12520,methane yield plays an important role in evaluating the performance of anaerobic digestion ad process due to fluctuating characteristics of palm oil mill effluent pome in this study two years of industrial scale plant data collected from biogas plant in pahang malaysia consisting of methane yield and h2s concentration were modelled using supervised machine learning ml algorithms i e artificial neural network ann and response surface methodology rsm input parameters appraised were ph temperature and recirculation ratio rr of total treated effluent and bottom sludge to raw pome fitness of all models was evaluated based on performance metrics namely determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse results demonstrated that ann was superior to rsm model with r2 of 0 9762 and 0 8500 respectively besides three dimensional 3 d response surface plot was utilised to study interactive effects between ad parameters on methane yield temperature and recirculation ratio rr was found to be main interactive factor of methane yield which was corroborated using pareto chart process optimisation using rsm revealed that the highest methane yield was 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved i e improvement percentage of 9 3 with the least h2s concentration of 1086 4 mg l under optimum operating conditions i e temperature ph and rr of 42 c 7 36 and 2 5 respectively sensitivity analysis revealed that rr plays substantial roles in yielding more methane in ad process maintaining rr ratio at optimum level 1 05 to 2 60 is key to achieve high methane yield with good stability by considering the trade off between operating cost and revenue of biogas plant graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion artificial neural network methane yield response surface methodology sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in this new norm era after covid pandemic malaysia is yet the second seed in palm oil production before indonesia which has unceasingly exploited the country s agricultural commodities accounting to the world s palm oil production and global export revenue improved by 4 9 and 1 4 respectively in 2021 1 palm oil mill effluent pome is perceived as the primary wastewater source produced from palm oil mills that jeopardize the environment due to the increasing global demand for edible oil it is approximated that 0 5 to 0 75 t of pome is generated for every ton of fresh fruit bunches ffb processed 2 pome has mild acidic properties due to the presence of organics and free fatty acids in ffb moreover it is a brownish dense liquid that is nontoxic but rich in chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod the recurrence of high organic acid content untreated pome that is directly discharged into watercourses without proper management system will have substantial effects on the aquatic life 3 of late anaerobic digestion ad is a promising wastewater treatment technique for treating pome employed by most palm oil mills due to its capability to lower the cod and bod significantly before sending to the subsequent ponds for further treatment in complying with the standard discharge limit enforced by the department of environment doe malaysia 4 in malaysia the conventional treatment technique includes ponding system and open digesting tank with some drawbacks such as long retention time large utilisation of treatment areas and uncontrolled greenhouse gas emission 5 conversely pome can also be treated with covered lagoon whereby the biogas is captured as the investment cost on the capital and operating is relatively low 6 with the implementation of biogas capture greenhouse gases emission can be overcome and energy can be harvested from the degradation of pome this has attracted the attention of palm oil millers to transform it into an environmentally friendly process therefore this offers advantages to the millers as biogas captured in covered lagoon is an alternative solution for renewable sources of energy particularly electricity which can be used for generating profits although this seems to be an emerging technology for treating pome concerns on the economics still arise from the unforeseen perturbations in biogas production that are resulted from the instability and poor performance of the ad process 7 this could be resulted from diversification and varying of the feed streams especially during disease outbreak or natural disasters such as floods 8 9 furthermore pome has varying characteristics with cod ranging from 44 000 to 112 000 mg l depending on high and low crop seasons and processing loads in the milling processes thus this can be inferred that the situation will exacerbate during the low crop season where the organic matter i e food for the anaerobic microorganism will be scarce and eventually lead to low biogas generation 10 in accordance with the aforementioned issues it is reckoned that influential operational parameter is one of the vital factors affecting the performance of the ad processes 11 the primary parameters include ph and temperature 12 a good stability of ad system comes with a balanced level of ph that is neither too acidic nor alkaline as this will affect the microbial activities and growth responsible for the methanogenesis process 13 sensitive methanogens are vulnerable to ph alteration which contribute to intolerable volatile fatty acids vfas 14 likewise temperature is an influential parameter that creates an adaptability environment for the anaerobic bacterial consortium that feed on the organic matter with methane as the product thus any sudden variation in temperature will lead to decreasing cod reduction which eventually reduce the biogas production including amassment of total vfas resulted from biomass washout 15 moreover recirculation ratio of both treated effluent and bottom sludge is another influential parameter that pose interactive effect on the performance of ad processes especially on ph 16 nevertheless the interactive effects of these parameters seem complex and non linear which is likely to cause unfavourable conditions to the anaerobic digestion system 17 to overcome the setbacks the performance of the ad process can be intensified by having a stable and proper control over the anaerobic digestion parameters by establishing a model for ad processes 14 18 response surface methodology rsm is commonly used in collecting experimental data and constructing mathematical modelling that is beneficial in developing improving and optimising processes by analysing multiple input features on responses 19 zinatizadeh et al 20 presented central composite face centered design ccfd based rsm approach for predicting methane yield the maximum yield is 0 304 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved at feed flow rate of 2 12 l d up flow velocity of 0 52 m h and hrt of 1 7 d when pome is the substrate for anaerobic digestion 20 another research conducted by tiong et al using food waste fw as substrate shows methane yield calculated is 0 300 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved the anaerobic digestion parameters include recycle ratio of sludge water to fw ratio and co substrate to fw ratio at 0 381 0 027 kg kg and 0 004 kg kg with hrt of 37 2 d 21 rsm indeed has the capability of improving the accuracy of the existing design processes 22 howbeit reports mentioned that many problems had been encountered during the process of modelling which cannot be solved using simple mathematical equations betiku and taiwo 23 reported that the generated mathematical model may not be able to justify the effect of certain independent parameters of ad on the responses due to its complexity 23 hence novel artificial intelligence ai techniques such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm fuzzy logic particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga can be substituted for mathematical modelling for their capability in data mining and model establishment of complex systems without any prior knowledge about ad process 24 with the emerging technologies for laboratory scale pome treatment nair et al 18 proposed an approach for modelling ann in evaluating methane yield from biogas in laboratory scale anaerobic bioreactor using an organic portion of municipal solid waste as the substrates the validated performance shows the root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 values of 0 5102 and 0 915 respectively 18 another similar approach where ann modelling is proposed by mougari et al 25 demonstrates the corresponding values of rmse and r2 values as 0 0063 and 0 9995 for prediction of cumulative biogas and methane yield from mono digestion and co digestion of various organic waste in batch anaerobic digester 25 jacob and banerjee 26 have modelled ann with rmse and r values of 0 3687 and 0 9944 when evaluating methane yield from co digestion of potato waste and aquatic weed 26 generally most researchers only focused on laboratory scale pome treatment using high rate anaerobic bioreactors 5 for modelling and optimisation none of this prior research has tried to analyse ad process in the covered lagoon for modelling and optimising the responses which utilises real industrial scale plant data with reference to the recent literature studies ann approach is testified to have good efficiency in prediction and optimise process parameters through various types of ad processes with varying bioreactors 25 intelligent computation models are highly dependent on artificial neural networks ann and used for evaluating complicated process 27 30 moreover ann is capable of solving complex systems even without prior knowledge about ad processes with complex interactions between input and output variables 31 33 although ann has the advantage in nonlinearities over rsm it could not generate a model equation like rsm does 19 despite all the novel machine learning algorithms being widely used in predicting biogas production no authors have employed neural network techniques in anaerobic process for predicting the concentration of raw hydrogen sulphide h2s which comes from the source of biogas production the purpose of this is to ensure that not only the covered anaerobic lagoon is maintained in a healthy condition but also safeguards the economic welfare of the overall biogas plant including biogas scrubber in the subsequent purification processes according to okoro and sun 34 the desulphurisation of biogas for h2s removal has been one of the most significant challenges in the biogas industry this is because the presence of h2s in biogas causes detrimental effects on equipment durability such as bio scrubbers 34 a high concentration of h2s in raw biogas will pose severe damage to it so it is encouraged to have low h2s produced from biogas to reduce the burden of the bio scrubber therefore this research aims to develop box behnken design bbd rsm and ann models for ad process by utilising the existing plant data of a biogas plant located in pahang malaysia using the developed models the goal of this research is to determine the feasibility and reliability of the machine learning algorithms in enhancing the performance and stability of the covered anaerobic lagoon of late the application of modelling and optimising the output variables i e methane yield along with concentration of h2s in raw biogas before purification using rsm is bounded despite the wide variation of response variables used as performance indicator of ad furthermore another novelty considered for this work includes the variability of topology and architecture for determining the best prediction model of ann which will be used for interactive effect analysis between the ad parameters on the chosen response variables this was testified using the performance metrics namely mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and r2 with the aid of these optimisation and prediction models the evaluation can be performed on the operations in real industrial scale biogas plant hence this offers the biogas plant better process control and identification of the operating parameters that will reduce the downtime and cost for maintenance while enhancing the methane yield for more profits leading to a more sustainable biogas plant for the palm oil industries 2 methods and materials 2 1 collection point of samples from treated effluent and measuring points of biogas the experimental results were taken from the scada system of real industrial scale plant over the past two years as shown in fig 1 raw pome that comes from the palm oil mill will mix with the recirculated anaerobically treated effluent from the covered lagoon in the mixing pond for the adjustment of temperature and ph before sending it to the covered lagoon for anaerobic digestion process the characteristics of pome were seen to fluctuate within a range as shown in table 1 the outputs of the covered lagoon can be categorised into treated effluent and bottom sludge that will be treated via subsequent treatment ponds to meet the discharge limit as presented in the table 1 the samples of the treated pome were collected from the different sampling points at different height of the covered lagoon the ph and temperature of the samples were measured on site and were recorded immediately the biogas content was measured using gas analyser at the recirculation line of the mixed treated and untreated biogas such as methane carbon dioxide hydrogen sulphide and oxygen besides the methane yield was calculated using eq 1 1 y 1 v t biogas y methane cod t removed where y1 is methane yield n m3 ch4 kg codremoved vt biogas is the total volume of biogas n m3 month ymethane is the methane composition in biogas codt removed is the total cod removed kg codremoved month the recirculation ratio was calculated using eq 2 2 rr v t te and bs v pome where the rr is recirculation ratio vt te and bs is total volumetric flowrate of treated effluent te and bottom sludge bs vpome is the volumetric of raw pome 2 2 collection and pre processing of real industrial scale plant data the development of an excellent model requires a good plant dataset for the prediction of methane yield and concentration of raw h2s from anaerobic digestion of pome before data mining analysis of variance anova is the primary step of data pre processing it is a statistical tool that is utilised to determine whether the means of two or more independent groups of data are significantly different from each other 35 in anova a hypothesis test was employed by comparing the fisher test f value and p value to the significant value so that the null hypothesis can be evaluated rsm was used for data analysis using anova a significance level of 0 05 was utilised in this test so that the null hypothesis can be rejected when the f and p value become lower than or equivalent to 0 05 as the population means are significantly different while there are many operating parameters in the literature reported to have substantial effects on biogas production and cod removal it is not applicable to all pome based biogas plants therefore anova studies was carried out using design expert software to identify the most critical input parameters that have statistically significant effects on biogas production and cod removal parameters such as hrt mlss ts ss bod and concentration of oil and grease of raw pome are considered not affecting the cod removal and biogas production as their p values are 0 05 three critical input parameters i e temperature ph and recirculation ratio are identified and used for designing the models these data collected from the real industrial scale covered lagoon over two years period with average values are presented in table a1 appendix once the dataset has been confirmed to have statistical different the accuracy of the results and learning speed of ann were enhanced by using the same dataset from the developed rsm model the dataset obtained can be normalised prior to data mining 31 33 here normalisation was only required for ann model whereby the data were scaled from 1 to 1 as shown in eq 3 this allows the data to be more apt to the activation function assigned to their respective hidden and output layer in ann 25 3 x i norm x i x min x max x min where xi norm is the normalised value for each sample i in the dataset of 16 samples for a particular variable xmin and xmax denote the minimum and maximum value for the variable 2 3 modelling and optimisation analysis 2 3 1 development of response surface methodology rsm model the design of the response surface was conducted for model fitting using a three level three factor box behnken design bbd to identify the most appropriate polynomial equation design expert 13 software was utilised to generate rsm model for data analysis and optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters such as temperature ph and recirculation ratio to maximise methane yield and minimise h2s concentration in untreated biogas all the experiments and analysis were performed in duplicate which summed up a total of 80 experimental runs with each run having 3 independent parameters such as treated effluent temperature ph and ratio of recirculation of treated effluent and bottom sludge to raw pome were denoted as x1 x2 and x3 respectively coded levels were assigned to all three input variables using numerical values of 1 0 and 1 in designing bbd as presented in table 2 two responses were analysed and predicted namely methane yield y1 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and y2 ppm which can be simplified into an empirical model given in eq 4 the quadratic polynomial equation was employed to fit the experimental data by using the coefficients obtained for the model equation 4 y pred β o i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j i j k β ij x i x j e where ypred is the predicted value of response variable y βo is the intercept value βi i 1 2 k is the linear coefficients βii is quadratic coefficients and βij represents the interaction coefficients xi and xj are denoted as input features that affect the responses and e is the random error the experimental data obtained were evaluated via three main steps namely analysis of variance anova regression model analysis and 3 d response surface plots besides graphical pareto chart was plotted using ms excel to study the percentage effect of each model term the equation used to calculate the effect of each model term in percentage was expressed in eq 5 5 p i β i 2 β i 2 100 i 0 where pi is percent contribution and βi is the regression coefficient of the individual term once the analysis of data was done a regression model was generated to analyse the deviation of predicted values from the experimental data 3 d surface plots were then utilised to study the effect of each independent variable on the methane yield and h2s concentration lastly optimisation was performed to obtain the optimal conditions for the dependent variable the design matrix of the bbd model was tabulated in table a2 for comparison between the predicted values and the experimental data of both responses 2 3 2 development of artificial neural network ann model the prediction of methane yield and concentration of raw h2s in biogas was modelled using artificial neural network approach one of the most common types of ann architecture is feed forward neural network ffnn as it has the capability of understanding complex and nonlinear problems 31 33 it comprises of input hidden and output layer input layer introduces the independent variables to the network while output layer receives information from the neurons of hidden layers with weights w ij neural networks with more hidden layers are extremely hard to train in this study trial and error is done in the coding to decide the number of hidden layers as the results in terms of regression is closer to 1 and error values closer to zero one hidden layer is chosen which is deemed sufficient the weights imply the intensity of the input data attached to the node which are summed with bias b j that is responsible in controlling the magnitude of input data 25 this is then transformed by multiplying with a sigmoid transfer function called tan sigmoid tansig or log sigmoid logsig function in the hidden layer of the proposed ann model expressed in eq 6 and 7 25 6 g a tanh a exp a exp a exp a exp a 7 g a log a 1 1 exp a the output signal from this sigmoid function is conveyed to the output layer the number of variables is equal to the number of neurons in output layer which is governed by a linear transfer function purelin given by eq 8 25 8 g a purelin a a where g a is then activation function these transfer functions have been utilised during the development of ann model once data samples are fed into matlabtm 2020b data scaling is done followed by data division similar to all ann models training a portion of the data was performed in this work whereby the training algorithm utilised was levenberg marquardt due to its capability and robustness in solving fitting problems 25 the data was divided into 3 categories namely training validation and testing set in a ratio of 70 15 15 the data division was decided based on trial and error 70 of data was used for training 15 for testing and remaining 15 for validation this is to ensure that the designed ann framework was tested and validated for better prediction of the response variables as a result the best architecture and topology of the ann model will be selected based on the results of the validation and testing of the model by choosing the appropriate algorithm and optimal number of hidden neurons 36 fig 2 illustrated the proposed ann architecture with 3 input variables namely ph temperature and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge to pome 14 hidden neurons 2 targeted outputs for methane yield and concentration of raw h2s there are 2 vital factors in establishing an ann model that have to be specified which include the training algorithm transfer function and number of neurons the topology of the ann was further enhanced by performing trial and error to obtain the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer trial and error were executed to determine the robustness of each training algorithm which were evaluated using box plot box plot was constructed to show the distribution and variation of the statistical performance of ann models using six different learning algorithms 36 six classes of training algorithm were evaluated such as levenberg marquardt backpropagation gradient descent with variable learning rate resilient backpropagation conjugated gradient descent quasi newton algorithm and bayesian regulation this procedure was reiterated starting from 0 to 20 number for hidden neurons so that the lowest mse with high r2 value achieved with all the factors specified the network was trained with evaluation conducted on the established model using mse and r2 based on this method 14 hidden neurons were chosen in this study due to its lowest mse the inference time of ann model is 15 s 2 4 statistical evaluation of the developed models the performance of rsm and ann models were accessed using two common metrics namely rmse and r2 it was observed that the performance of the ann model changed when the training procedure was repeated thus the ann model was trained till mse approaching 0 and r2 in close proximity to 1 which were presented in eqs 9 and 10 respectively by taking the square root of mse rmse can be expressed in eq 11 furthermore mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape were other metrics that can be used to assess the constructed model arranged in eqs 12 and 13 however an additional metric called symmetrical mean absolute percentage error smape was used to determine the model accuracy of ann which was given in eq 14 the metrics equations were expressed as follows 31 33 36 38 9 mse 1 x i 1 x a i p i 2 10 r 2 1 i 1 x a i p i 2 i 1 x p i a i 2 11 rmse 1 x i 1 x a i p i 2 12 mae 1 x 1 1 x a i p i 13 mape 1 x 1 1 x a i p i a i 14 smape 1 x i 1 x a i p i a i p i 2 100 where x is the number of observations a i is the mean of the actual values pi and ai are the predicted and experimental actual value respectively 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative importance i of each anaerobic digestion input parameter on the methane yield for both rsm and ann models the sensitivity analysis performed on the developed rsm model by utilising the sum of squares ss of the model and linear terms obtained from anova the relative importance will be evaluated using the sum of squares to compute the contribution of each factor on the methane yield was arranged in eq 15 38 15 contribution factor ss f ss t 100 where ssf and sst represent the sum of squares of factor and all factors respectively garson equation was utilised to calculate the importance level of the established ann model for sensitivity analysis to be carried out on the anaerobic digestion parameters however weights generated randomly from the developed ann will be utilised in this equation instead of sum of squares which were shown in table a3 as a result the equation was given by ishola et al 38 16 i j m 1 m n h w jm ih k 1 ni w jm ih w mn ho k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w jm ih k 1 ni w jm ih w mn ho where the number of input and hidden neurons are denoted as n i and n h respectively w represents the weight connections that are associated to input hidden and output layer which are denoted as subscripts of i h and o respectively and the corresponding number of neurons are represented using subscripts of k m and n i j is the relative importance of the variable j on methane yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of time on methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas fig 3 showed the real industrial scale plant data for methane yield and h2s concentration for two years period from july 2019 till june 2021 based on the figure a relationship can be observed between the methane yield and concentration of hydrogen sulphide it illustrated that low methane production was observed before dec 19 leading to high h2s concentration in the biogas produced this was possibly due to the low removal of total solids ts and cod at 47 and 71 4 respectively low ts removal indicates that the removal of volatile solids vs is low as well a low removal of vs and cod implies that methanogenesis process is inhibited by the presence of high volatile fatty acids vfa concentration in the anaerobic lagoon 39 this could be the reason why high treated effluent and bottom sludge being recycled back into the covered lagoon leading to high temperature 40 42 c was detected during that season although this situation was caused by the high vfa concentration but due to the high recirculation ratio the ph can be seen maintained in alkalinity condition instead of dropping below ph 7 the temperature ph and recirculation ratio during this season were around 42 c 7 2 and 2 5 respectively this information was evidently supported by the data collected from the industrial scale plant which are shown in the table a1 on mar 20 the methane yield and h2s concentration can be seen to stabilise but dropped significantly from 0 24 to 0 17 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved on jan 21 this was probably due to the low temperature that is below 37 c table a1 that slowed down the methanogenesis process although the mesophilic condition is within the range of 30 c to 42 c 2 this is highly dependent on the process of ad and varies from plant to plant this was agreed by cioabla et al 40 which explained that the microbial activity and growth rate will be reduced with the reduction of temperature leading to the drop in biogas production moreover any sudden or instantaneous change in temperature of ad can result in lower cod reduction as well as biogas production with accumulation of volatile fatty acids 15 that tend to release more h2s in the biogas although both response variables which were utilised in this research demonstrated a strong relationship between them yet methane yield is prioritised more than the concentration of h2s this is because a healthy anaerobic lagoon will automatically yield high methane but low h2s which in turn bringing profit and ensuring the economic welfare of the biogas plant is maintained methanogenesis process happens when methanogens feed on hydrogen and acetic acids however these substrates produced from acetogenesis process will also be consumed by sulfate reducing bacteria srb leading to a survival competition with the inferior methanogens 7 which explains the relationship between methanogens and srb therefore to prevent srb from dominating over methanogens implementing the proposed machine learning tools will definitely help to prevent the h2s concentration from escalating by manipulating or controlling the ph temperature and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge to pome at their respective optimal range nevertheless the most influential parameter that can affect the concentration of h2s can be accessed via sensitivity analysis section 3 5 3 2 analysis of the developed bbd rsm model the resulting regression equation models that were based on the bbd experimental results will be used to determine the effect of the anaerobic digestion parameters on the response variables besides the established polynomial equations can be used for theoretical prediction of methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas in the future 38 the coefficient of determination achieved can also be implied by the designed quadratic equations for box behnken design as expressed in eqs 17 and 18 17 y 1 0 2719 0 0057 x 1 0 0091 x 2 0 0087 x 1 x 2 0 017 x 1 x 3 0 0096 x 2 x 3 0 015 x 1 2 0 016 x 2 2 0 0058 x 3 2 18 y 2 1258 84 44 35 x 1 50 45 x 2 54 34 x 1 x 2 88 75 x 1 x 3 253 29 x 2 x 3 93 02 x 1 2 165 48 x 2 2 where x1 x2 and x3 are the input variables denoted as temperature c ph and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge whereas the responses are y1 and y2 representing methane yield and h2s concentration referring to both equations x3 was not included as it has p value 0 05 indicating an insignificant effect on the responses of all the linear terms only temperature in eq 18 has negative effect on h2s concentration whereas the other linear terms have positive effect on their respective response apart from that the data predicted was found to fit the quadratic model applied for both response model according to betiku and taiwo 23 a good fit model exhibits r2 value of at least 0 80 the resulting r2 values for y1 and y2 were 0 8311 and 0 8689 respectively for example the independent features accounted for 83 11 of the sample variation in methane yield while the remaining 16 89 of the total variation was not described by the model this can be evidently shown from the parity plot in fig 4 that successfully described the predicted data fitted well to the regression model exhibiting satisfying r2 which corroborated that both models achieved good fit furthermore the corresponding adjusted r2 were 0 8094 and 0 8520 for y1 and y2 in which good correlation and significance of the model were observed the predicted r2 for y1 0 7694 and y2 0 8185 were slightly lower than the adjusted r2 but still above the 0 75 for a good fit model 21 the results of the response surface quadratic model were analysed using anova as presented in tables 3 and 4 the resultant anova tests for the model of both methane yield y1 and h2s concentration y2 responses were identified to be significant using fisher test f value and probability p value at 95 confidence level this excluding the insignificant model terms such as recirculation ratio of the linear term x3 for model y1 whereas the model term for y2 were linear and quadratic of recirculation ratio x3 2 the model fitting tests for y1 and y2 were found to be adequacy in which the f value were 38 28 and 51 54 with the corresponding p value of 0 0001 for both cases indicating that the model was statistically significant although anova can determine the significance of each model term but its effect on the output variable was unknown therefore graphical analysis was implemented to study the effect of each linear and interactive factor using pareto chart referring to fig 5 a the primary effect was contributed by the quadratic terms temperature recirculation ratio rr ph ph temperature temperature which has at least 20 effect on methane yield this implies that ph and temperature are the main concern parameter to the methane yield as the squared of the linear term will double up the effect substantially besides the coefficient of these quadratic terms was observed to be larger as compared to the model terms that contributed 20 temperature rr has dominating effect on methane yield because of the significant change in the crop seasons and usually plant operator has to control it by supplying the appropriate amount of treated effluent back to the mixing pond it can also be seen from table a1 that the recorded temperature and recirculation ratio from biogas plant were varied the most as compared to ph which was always within the optimum range as for h2s concentration shown in fig 5 b the main contributor term was ph rr with 55 effect followed by ph ph of about 20 and the remaining model terms were below 10 the interaction between ph rr was observed to be the most dominant because ph will definitely affect the methanogens activity and growth rate which subsequently induced the reproductivity of sulfate reducing bacteria as mentioned previously sbr is more active than methanogens in competing for methanogenic substrates such as hydrogen and acetic acids by converting them into h2s instead of methane when ph is low 7 besides ph should always be controlled along with varying recirculation ratio as the incoming acidic raw pome will cause nuisance to the condition of the anaerobic covered lagoon this explains why recirculation ratio alone has the least for both responses according to table a1 it was obvious that either temperature or ph will differ when recirculation ratio was varied all in all it can be seen that ph should be taken into consideration before temperature and finally recirculation ratio this could be a reason why the biogas plant has been emphasising on the consistency of the ph of the treated effluent and bottom sludge at optimum range as methanogens are sensitive to environmental changes 41 the design models implemented for this study are reduced quadratic models this is because there is insufficient data to represent the prediction model to a higher order polynomial equation as the biogas plant is still new with merely two years of operation 3 3 analysis of the developed ann model to find the best neural network model trial and error were performed on different learning algorithms and transfer functions so that the selected model resulted in satisfactory overall statistical performance box plot was utilised and comprised of maximum third quartile median first quartile and minimum values the variation of the model was presented in fig 6 where large variation was seen in levenberg marquardt lm resilient backpropagation rp scaled conjugate gradient scg and bfgs quasi newton bfg when the number of hidden neurons was altered from 1 to 20 a good model usually has small variation and high median prediction accuracy which was shown by lm and bayesian regularization backpropagation br 36 despite the high median prediction accuracy from trainbr it has many outliers that will reduce the productivity of the model hence lm was chosen for further evaluation of the ann model table 5 showed the quantitative results that have been examined by interchanging the activation function between hidden and output layer by setting the number of hidden neurons as 11 for the model to be executed the evaluation of the model performance was based on the model mse r2 and accuracy based on the table logsig employed in output layer showed high mse and low r2 and accuracy regardless of the activation function used in hidden layer when tansig was accounted for output layer only logsig in the hidden layer outperformed purelin and tansig with r2 value of about 0 98 for all datasets yet this is still inferior to purelin being utilised for output layer in which the tansig in hidden layer showed the most outstanding performance with the lowest mse in the testing and validation dataset despite the small variance in the r2 value as compared to logsig in hidden layer both tansig and logsig are comparable and appropriate to be utilised for training function in hidden layer while the output layer belongs to purelin though many researchers agreed to utilise tansig and purelin for hidden and output layer respectively 31 33 38 however this can be corroborated again and discussed in the next section as the performance will be differed when the optimum number of hidden neurons was chosen beside choosing the learning algorithm and transfer function selection of the ideal number of hidden neurons is a tedious task and usually done using trial and error with careful consideration however matlab has the ability to produce the results concurrently for examining the desired range of number of hidden neurons in this study the number of hidden neurons was analysed ranging from 1 to 20 by finding the suitable transfer function for the hidden layer tansig and logsig will be accessed comparatively via trial and error with the aid of for loop the learning performance in terms of mse and r2 becomes better when the number of hidden neurons was sufficiently large as seen from fig 7 a and b respectively which was agreed by betiku and taiwo 23 however the number of hidden neurons was kept limit at 15 as additional hidden neurons will cause noise during the training phase of the dataset in this case the number of hidden neurons were analysed from 5 to 15 as tabulated in table a4 the most satisfactory ann model based on the performance metrics was found to be 14 hidden neurons when logsig was utilised as the hidden layer and purelin for output layer this concluded model 3 14 2 was the best topology where 3 represents the input variables 14 as hidden neurons and 2 for the response variables in forecasting methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas once the best performance of the model has been identified the metrics for training validation and testing set including the overall performance that correspond to methane yield and h2s concentration were presented in table 6 the overall mse mae mape and r2 achieved with 14 hidden neurons were 318 6 5 10 0 0046 and 0 9762 respectively the regression curve obtained using the best architecture and topology of the model for training testing and validation were plotted as illustrated in fig 8 including the overall r values it can be observed that levenberg marquart converged rapidly with low mse achieved as shown in fig 9 optimal mse of 62 17 was found at fifth iteration during the validation process a small mse literally means the model has better prediction with minimal residual error between the target and output value the weights and biases were randomly generated throughout the training phase until minimal mse value was achieved for the training dataset consequently the ann models will be validated through mse of the validation set as displayed in fig 8 the r values for training testing validation and overall dataset showed satisfactory result that were in close proximity to 1 this implies that the forecasted value of the methane yield and h2s concentration from the best ann model is nearly achieving the targeted value with satisfying r2 value shown in fig 10 selection of the appropriate model in terms of the type of output variable was carried out to determine which response variable model is more reliable the statistical results were presented in table 7 whereby models 1 and 2 were simulated using one output variable namely methane yield and h2s concentration respectively in contrast to model 3 two output variables were employed in the model to demonstrate its statistical performance the resultant statistical performance showed that the quantitative result r2 value for all the models were quite close to 1 but models 2 and 3 showed unsatisfactory mse value however to determine the best ann model for optimisation the performance of the dataset in testing and validation should be evaluated it can be observed that model 1 demonstrated r2 value of 0 9799 and 0 9891 for testing and validation respectively the validation performance for model 1 was the best while model 2 demonstrated the highest r2 during the testing phase however when compared to the mse values for all models model 1 was nearly 0 indicating the model was statistically perfect as compared to model 3 which has lower mse value than model 2 this was due to smaller mse value indicated a smaller rmse value was achieved that described the model was best fitted in general model 1 will be chosen to study the interactive effects between ad parameters on methane yield using 3 d response surface plots due to its excellent validation performance 3 4 optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters on the responses 3 4 1 relationship between the anaerobic digestion parameters on methane yield it is important to analyse the effect of the temperature ph recirculation ratio and their interactions on methane yield using 3 d response surface plot before optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters was executed in this study only methane yield will be analysed as it was clearly explained that higher methane yield would lead to lower h2s concentration or otherwise besides it was also determined from table 7 that model 1 by using only methane yield as the response variable due to its satisfactory statistical performance with low mse and high r2 value which proved its competency to be the best candidate for optimisation using the developed rsm model fig 11 showed the effect of the two interactive factors on the methane yield these resultant plots can be compared with the real industrial scale data as a validation through historical data referring to the fig 11 a at high rr of 3 0 the methane yield decreased significantly as the temperature dropped from 42 5 to 35 8 c regardless of the changes in ph low methane yield was observed only when the ph was not in the optimum range 6 8 to 7 2 that is favourable for the methanogens to grow 40 this observation was similar to the evaluation done based on the real industrial scale biogas plant shown in fig 3 under the mesophilic range microbial activity and growth rate can be reduced to about 50 for each 10 c of temperature drop drastic drop in biogas production begins when digestion temperature reduces to 20 c and it even will stop production at temperature of 10 c 40 in contrast to higher temperature volatile fatty acids generation is said to increase if the anaerobic lagoon is operating out of the mesophilic range from 35 c to 42 c 2 5 42 on top of that the effect of ph on methane yield was illustrated in fig 11 b when the temperature was optimised at 39 c it can be seen that ph also affects the methane yield significantly as the methane yield decreases from ph of 7 5 to 6 5 the lowest methane yield was observed when the ph was at 6 5 and low recirculation ratio of 0 76 at low ph of 6 5 methanogens bacteria became incapable of digesting the volatile fatty acids into methane and other components as the bacteria could not survive in very acidic condition 40 volatile fatty acids will increase and cause ph to drop further in the anaerobic lagoon with that being said volatile fatty acids consumption by methanogens can induce an increase in ph level in the pond for biogas production no historical data of the existing real plant has recorded ph lower than 7 0 table a1 though it was found out that the existing plant data from mar 21 to apr 21 the methane yield was slightly reduced 0 268 0 266 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved even when the ph increased 7 09 to 7 12 with increasing recirculation ratio yet this cannot be corroborated since the ph only changed slightly and well maintained at optimum range of ph therefore high methane yield can be obtained at high temperature and ph ranges of 37 to 42 5 c and 6 8 to 7 4 respectively at recirculation ratio of 3 0 as demonstrated in fig 11 a referring to fig 11 c both increasing and decreasing trend can be seen when the temperature is decreasing which depends on the recirculation ratio this shows the strong interactive effects between temperature and rr as discussed in fig 5 a under section 3 2 however highest methane yield was favoured when recirculation ratio and temperature were high at 3 06 and 42 5 c in fig 11 c however when considering the pumping cost that was needed for recirculation high recirculation ratio should be avoided as this will raise the concern of the operating cost of the biogas plant when recirculated pome is insufficient the raw pome that coming in with high temperature and in acidic condition will cause unfavourable conditions and fail to meet the optimum operating condition of the lagoon according to the existing plant data from oct 19 to dec 19 the methane yield was seen increasing significantly from 0 202 to 0 292 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved when temperature decreased 41 7 to 36 5 c with moderate recirculation ratio 1 05 to 2 43 therefore it was suggested to have optimum recirculation range from 1 05 to 2 43 all in all the rr temperature has the most prominent influence on methane yield when the ph was at optimal level of 7 4 this observation corresponds with the pareto chart in fig 5 a where the interactive effects between rr temperature is the highest 26 as compared to rr ph and temperature ph when the temperature is at low range 35 38 c the recirculation ratio needs to be adjusted to a lower range 0 76 1 68 in order to obtain high methane yield conversely high rr ratio 2 6 3 0 is needed when the temperature is on the higher side 42 5 c besides maintaining ph at optimal range is vital as a drop in ph will not be able to maintain the high methane yield this can be seen from fig 11 a and b that show varying either temperature or recirculation ratio will not rectify the issue of having low methane yield when ph was off from the optimum range this results are particularly important for the biogas plant s operators which can be served as guidelines when facing low methane yield issues 3 4 2 validation of the predicted values using bbd rsm optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters was carried out to obtain maximum methane yield but minimising the h2s concentration this was executed by choosing the specification for the independent variables to be within the optimum range based on the historical data and experience of the plant operator as shown in table 8 the resultant optimum conditions for all factors as well as the predicted maximum methane yield within the selected range was displayed in fig 12 based on fig 12 the temperature obtained was 42 c in which many researchers agree with the optimum temperature range of mesophilic can be between 35 c to 40 c in malaysia 2 42 this helps to promote the methane yield with faster degradation of organic matter besides the optimal recirculation ratio was 2 50 which was considered high but still within the desired range this optimal value was satisfying as low recirculation ratio is more preferably when the digester is overloaded resulting in low efficiency of the anaerobic digester otherwise keeping the recirculation ratio high is recommended as the treated effluent still contains some organic substrates that could maximise the throughput of the methane for higher retention time as well as improving the mixing behaviour of the digester to homogenise the untreated and treated pome 43 as for the ph 7 36 can be considered high but because of the existing biogas plant does not using any agents that contains ammonia thus having high ph will not cause nuisance to the digester 40 this can help to reduce the efficiency of srb while allowing methanogens to grow and digest faster for higher methane yield with the optimum conditions generated using the designed bbd rsm model actual data was obtained from the real industrial scale biogas plant for the validation of the maximum methane yield and the lowest achievable h2s concentration it was concluded that the actual highest methane yield obtained was 0 272 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved which has a slight difference of 0 48 when compared to the maximum predicted methane yield at 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved in term of h2s concentration the least predicted value was 1086 4 ppm and the actual value obtained was 1195 ppm resulting in percentage difference of 9 09 this showed that the prediction accuracy for h2s model was still comparable to the actual data albeit not as accurate as methane yield model the results proved that the developed methane yield model is robust and feasible to be implemented in real industrial plant in this research ann is a good prediction tool for methane yield whereas the optimisation process done using rms approach was reliable but only limited to optimising within the optimum operating range in comparison to the recent literature studies tiong et al 21 demonstrated bbd rsm for process optimisation of anaerobic co digestion from food waste and pome the responses such as the removal efficiencies of methane flow cod and volatile solid were set to meet their respective target so that the highest calculated methane yield was 0 3 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved after optimisation of the ad parameters in this research the highest methane yield achieved after optimisation was only 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved which differed significantly from tiong et al 21 this is probably due to optimisation of the different process parameters on the responses which in this research both the methane yield and h2s concentration were set to meet maximum and minimum target value respectively another possibility that the methane yield achieved by tiong et al 21 was higher was due to the combination of pome with food waste that could lead to higher throughput of methane as compared to mono digestion pome other than that the comparison based on the performance metrics of various studies is very complicated as the experimental data differed from every studies 31 33 hence an overview performance of the rsm models were presented in table 9 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify the relative importance of each factor on methane yield using sum of squares and garson equation for rsm and ann model respectively as shown in fig 13 the results shown were not following a same trend from both models methane yield prediction from rsm model was significantly affected by ph followed by temperature and rr in contrast to that ann model displayed that recirculation ratio contributed the most to methane yield instead of ph being the last and temperature being the intermediate contributor it can be observed that ann model was capable of distributing the contribution of each factor in nearly equal probability as similar observations were seen from the sensitivity analysis presented by ishola et al 38 conversely rsm model only prioritised one factor more than the others perhaps rsm model was not competent in dealing with nonlinear trends in complex dataset due to the fluctuating characteristics of pome therefore it can be concluded that recirculation ratio played the most important role in methane yield with relative importance of 36 meanwhile ph and temperature should also not be neglected as the corresponding importance level were 30 and 34 respectively indicating that both factors still play substantial roles in yielding more methane in fact both ph and recirculation ratio are inter related where high recirculation ratio will lead to higher treated effluent ph this is because more anaerobically treated effluent will be recirculated to provide the alkalinity and thus creating appropriate environment for the methanogens to produce more methane gas 3 6 statistical comparison of bbd rsm and ann all the proposed algorithms in this research have evidently shown its robustness and adequacy using various statistical performance indicators which were shown in table 10 based on fig 4 the parity plots of rsm model illustrated that the deviation of the predicted data from actual value was quite large as compared to ann model shown in fig 10 there was only a few predicted data points that deviated slightly from the regression line the developed models have high r values 0 8 indicating a good correlation was observed between the predicted and actual data points besides table 10 showed all models were reliable with its corresponding r2 achieving at least 75 21 rmse was utilised as an indicator of the model best fit given in a dataset it was observed that no high rmse was found in both models of rsm and ann when predicting methane yield which implies a good model fitting being achieved similar for mae indicator showed the reliability of both models at low mse value when predicting methane yield however both approaches did show satisfying overall mape value demonstrated by both models in overall ann model achieved the lowest values based on all the error indicators and highest overall r and r2 when compared to bbd rsm model the performance metrics of methane yield prediction can be demonstrated in a graphical manner by using taylor diagram as shown in fig 14 the prediction of methane yield for rsm and ann model can be evaluated correlatively to the observed dataset using the standard deviation rmse and r metrics it can be observed that the standard deviation of rsm is very much smaller than ann when compared to the observed dataset this could mean that rsm has lesser tendency of getting poor predicted results due to high precision but the accuracy was poor due to unsatisfactory rmse and r values as compared to ann model it was more comparable to the observed dataset with rmse and r values of 0 003 and 0 984 that were adjacent to 0 and 1 respectively there is no doubt that ann model prediction can produce a standard deviation that is almost adjacent to the actual dataset as compared to rsm model this clearly justifies that ann model is definitely the best candidate model as the best fitting model in prediction of methane yield in this research however ann has few limitations such as lower prediction efficiency as compared to other models random forest rf and gradient boosting machine gbm time consuming and large amount of data is required 47 therefore to improve the accuracy of ann model more data sets i e longer operational duration 3 years should be implemented into the model for future study 4 conclusion this research has successfully appraised the performance of rsm and ann in modelling of anaerobic digestion parameters for methane yield and h2s concentration in biogas the developed models showed the predictions of methane yield using ann model was the most reliable and well fitted model as compared to rsm model the corresponding highest methane yield and minimum h2s concentration obtained were 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and 1086 4 ppm at optimal conditions of 42 c 7 36 and 2 5 for temperature ph and recirculation ratio of total effluent to pome respectively the predicted results were validated with the actual results of 0 2720 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and 1195 ppm this optimisation results showed that the predicted maximum methane yield and h2s was highly correlated to the actual data with small percentage difference of 0 48 and 9 09 respectively besides the sensitivity analysis of ann model conducted on the anaerobic digestion parameters revealed that recirculation ratio played the most vital role followed by temperature and finally ph the result from this study is useful for decision making and operational cost saving of biogas plants the three influential input parameters can be manipulated through estimating of required methane yield leading to savings in cost and energy by the operational systems in a nutshell the prediction for methane yield fits the model well with high r2 of 0 9762 however more data sets i e longer operational period 3 years should be implemented into the ann model to allow more observations and quantitative results to be recorded for future analysis there is no doubt that the implementation of rsm and ann models could help to sustain and maintain the health and economic welfare of the biogas plant with improved handling of treating pome via anaerobic covered lagoon for further improvements data mining and model validation by using other similar biogas plants would be proposed for future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12520,methane yield plays an important role in evaluating the performance of anaerobic digestion ad process due to fluctuating characteristics of palm oil mill effluent pome in this study two years of industrial scale plant data collected from biogas plant in pahang malaysia consisting of methane yield and h2s concentration were modelled using supervised machine learning ml algorithms i e artificial neural network ann and response surface methodology rsm input parameters appraised were ph temperature and recirculation ratio rr of total treated effluent and bottom sludge to raw pome fitness of all models was evaluated based on performance metrics namely determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse results demonstrated that ann was superior to rsm model with r2 of 0 9762 and 0 8500 respectively besides three dimensional 3 d response surface plot was utilised to study interactive effects between ad parameters on methane yield temperature and recirculation ratio rr was found to be main interactive factor of methane yield which was corroborated using pareto chart process optimisation using rsm revealed that the highest methane yield was 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved i e improvement percentage of 9 3 with the least h2s concentration of 1086 4 mg l under optimum operating conditions i e temperature ph and rr of 42 c 7 36 and 2 5 respectively sensitivity analysis revealed that rr plays substantial roles in yielding more methane in ad process maintaining rr ratio at optimum level 1 05 to 2 60 is key to achieve high methane yield with good stability by considering the trade off between operating cost and revenue of biogas plant graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion artificial neural network methane yield response surface methodology sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in this new norm era after covid pandemic malaysia is yet the second seed in palm oil production before indonesia which has unceasingly exploited the country s agricultural commodities accounting to the world s palm oil production and global export revenue improved by 4 9 and 1 4 respectively in 2021 1 palm oil mill effluent pome is perceived as the primary wastewater source produced from palm oil mills that jeopardize the environment due to the increasing global demand for edible oil it is approximated that 0 5 to 0 75 t of pome is generated for every ton of fresh fruit bunches ffb processed 2 pome has mild acidic properties due to the presence of organics and free fatty acids in ffb moreover it is a brownish dense liquid that is nontoxic but rich in chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod the recurrence of high organic acid content untreated pome that is directly discharged into watercourses without proper management system will have substantial effects on the aquatic life 3 of late anaerobic digestion ad is a promising wastewater treatment technique for treating pome employed by most palm oil mills due to its capability to lower the cod and bod significantly before sending to the subsequent ponds for further treatment in complying with the standard discharge limit enforced by the department of environment doe malaysia 4 in malaysia the conventional treatment technique includes ponding system and open digesting tank with some drawbacks such as long retention time large utilisation of treatment areas and uncontrolled greenhouse gas emission 5 conversely pome can also be treated with covered lagoon whereby the biogas is captured as the investment cost on the capital and operating is relatively low 6 with the implementation of biogas capture greenhouse gases emission can be overcome and energy can be harvested from the degradation of pome this has attracted the attention of palm oil millers to transform it into an environmentally friendly process therefore this offers advantages to the millers as biogas captured in covered lagoon is an alternative solution for renewable sources of energy particularly electricity which can be used for generating profits although this seems to be an emerging technology for treating pome concerns on the economics still arise from the unforeseen perturbations in biogas production that are resulted from the instability and poor performance of the ad process 7 this could be resulted from diversification and varying of the feed streams especially during disease outbreak or natural disasters such as floods 8 9 furthermore pome has varying characteristics with cod ranging from 44 000 to 112 000 mg l depending on high and low crop seasons and processing loads in the milling processes thus this can be inferred that the situation will exacerbate during the low crop season where the organic matter i e food for the anaerobic microorganism will be scarce and eventually lead to low biogas generation 10 in accordance with the aforementioned issues it is reckoned that influential operational parameter is one of the vital factors affecting the performance of the ad processes 11 the primary parameters include ph and temperature 12 a good stability of ad system comes with a balanced level of ph that is neither too acidic nor alkaline as this will affect the microbial activities and growth responsible for the methanogenesis process 13 sensitive methanogens are vulnerable to ph alteration which contribute to intolerable volatile fatty acids vfas 14 likewise temperature is an influential parameter that creates an adaptability environment for the anaerobic bacterial consortium that feed on the organic matter with methane as the product thus any sudden variation in temperature will lead to decreasing cod reduction which eventually reduce the biogas production including amassment of total vfas resulted from biomass washout 15 moreover recirculation ratio of both treated effluent and bottom sludge is another influential parameter that pose interactive effect on the performance of ad processes especially on ph 16 nevertheless the interactive effects of these parameters seem complex and non linear which is likely to cause unfavourable conditions to the anaerobic digestion system 17 to overcome the setbacks the performance of the ad process can be intensified by having a stable and proper control over the anaerobic digestion parameters by establishing a model for ad processes 14 18 response surface methodology rsm is commonly used in collecting experimental data and constructing mathematical modelling that is beneficial in developing improving and optimising processes by analysing multiple input features on responses 19 zinatizadeh et al 20 presented central composite face centered design ccfd based rsm approach for predicting methane yield the maximum yield is 0 304 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved at feed flow rate of 2 12 l d up flow velocity of 0 52 m h and hrt of 1 7 d when pome is the substrate for anaerobic digestion 20 another research conducted by tiong et al using food waste fw as substrate shows methane yield calculated is 0 300 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved the anaerobic digestion parameters include recycle ratio of sludge water to fw ratio and co substrate to fw ratio at 0 381 0 027 kg kg and 0 004 kg kg with hrt of 37 2 d 21 rsm indeed has the capability of improving the accuracy of the existing design processes 22 howbeit reports mentioned that many problems had been encountered during the process of modelling which cannot be solved using simple mathematical equations betiku and taiwo 23 reported that the generated mathematical model may not be able to justify the effect of certain independent parameters of ad on the responses due to its complexity 23 hence novel artificial intelligence ai techniques such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm fuzzy logic particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga can be substituted for mathematical modelling for their capability in data mining and model establishment of complex systems without any prior knowledge about ad process 24 with the emerging technologies for laboratory scale pome treatment nair et al 18 proposed an approach for modelling ann in evaluating methane yield from biogas in laboratory scale anaerobic bioreactor using an organic portion of municipal solid waste as the substrates the validated performance shows the root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 values of 0 5102 and 0 915 respectively 18 another similar approach where ann modelling is proposed by mougari et al 25 demonstrates the corresponding values of rmse and r2 values as 0 0063 and 0 9995 for prediction of cumulative biogas and methane yield from mono digestion and co digestion of various organic waste in batch anaerobic digester 25 jacob and banerjee 26 have modelled ann with rmse and r values of 0 3687 and 0 9944 when evaluating methane yield from co digestion of potato waste and aquatic weed 26 generally most researchers only focused on laboratory scale pome treatment using high rate anaerobic bioreactors 5 for modelling and optimisation none of this prior research has tried to analyse ad process in the covered lagoon for modelling and optimising the responses which utilises real industrial scale plant data with reference to the recent literature studies ann approach is testified to have good efficiency in prediction and optimise process parameters through various types of ad processes with varying bioreactors 25 intelligent computation models are highly dependent on artificial neural networks ann and used for evaluating complicated process 27 30 moreover ann is capable of solving complex systems even without prior knowledge about ad processes with complex interactions between input and output variables 31 33 although ann has the advantage in nonlinearities over rsm it could not generate a model equation like rsm does 19 despite all the novel machine learning algorithms being widely used in predicting biogas production no authors have employed neural network techniques in anaerobic process for predicting the concentration of raw hydrogen sulphide h2s which comes from the source of biogas production the purpose of this is to ensure that not only the covered anaerobic lagoon is maintained in a healthy condition but also safeguards the economic welfare of the overall biogas plant including biogas scrubber in the subsequent purification processes according to okoro and sun 34 the desulphurisation of biogas for h2s removal has been one of the most significant challenges in the biogas industry this is because the presence of h2s in biogas causes detrimental effects on equipment durability such as bio scrubbers 34 a high concentration of h2s in raw biogas will pose severe damage to it so it is encouraged to have low h2s produced from biogas to reduce the burden of the bio scrubber therefore this research aims to develop box behnken design bbd rsm and ann models for ad process by utilising the existing plant data of a biogas plant located in pahang malaysia using the developed models the goal of this research is to determine the feasibility and reliability of the machine learning algorithms in enhancing the performance and stability of the covered anaerobic lagoon of late the application of modelling and optimising the output variables i e methane yield along with concentration of h2s in raw biogas before purification using rsm is bounded despite the wide variation of response variables used as performance indicator of ad furthermore another novelty considered for this work includes the variability of topology and architecture for determining the best prediction model of ann which will be used for interactive effect analysis between the ad parameters on the chosen response variables this was testified using the performance metrics namely mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and r2 with the aid of these optimisation and prediction models the evaluation can be performed on the operations in real industrial scale biogas plant hence this offers the biogas plant better process control and identification of the operating parameters that will reduce the downtime and cost for maintenance while enhancing the methane yield for more profits leading to a more sustainable biogas plant for the palm oil industries 2 methods and materials 2 1 collection point of samples from treated effluent and measuring points of biogas the experimental results were taken from the scada system of real industrial scale plant over the past two years as shown in fig 1 raw pome that comes from the palm oil mill will mix with the recirculated anaerobically treated effluent from the covered lagoon in the mixing pond for the adjustment of temperature and ph before sending it to the covered lagoon for anaerobic digestion process the characteristics of pome were seen to fluctuate within a range as shown in table 1 the outputs of the covered lagoon can be categorised into treated effluent and bottom sludge that will be treated via subsequent treatment ponds to meet the discharge limit as presented in the table 1 the samples of the treated pome were collected from the different sampling points at different height of the covered lagoon the ph and temperature of the samples were measured on site and were recorded immediately the biogas content was measured using gas analyser at the recirculation line of the mixed treated and untreated biogas such as methane carbon dioxide hydrogen sulphide and oxygen besides the methane yield was calculated using eq 1 1 y 1 v t biogas y methane cod t removed where y1 is methane yield n m3 ch4 kg codremoved vt biogas is the total volume of biogas n m3 month ymethane is the methane composition in biogas codt removed is the total cod removed kg codremoved month the recirculation ratio was calculated using eq 2 2 rr v t te and bs v pome where the rr is recirculation ratio vt te and bs is total volumetric flowrate of treated effluent te and bottom sludge bs vpome is the volumetric of raw pome 2 2 collection and pre processing of real industrial scale plant data the development of an excellent model requires a good plant dataset for the prediction of methane yield and concentration of raw h2s from anaerobic digestion of pome before data mining analysis of variance anova is the primary step of data pre processing it is a statistical tool that is utilised to determine whether the means of two or more independent groups of data are significantly different from each other 35 in anova a hypothesis test was employed by comparing the fisher test f value and p value to the significant value so that the null hypothesis can be evaluated rsm was used for data analysis using anova a significance level of 0 05 was utilised in this test so that the null hypothesis can be rejected when the f and p value become lower than or equivalent to 0 05 as the population means are significantly different while there are many operating parameters in the literature reported to have substantial effects on biogas production and cod removal it is not applicable to all pome based biogas plants therefore anova studies was carried out using design expert software to identify the most critical input parameters that have statistically significant effects on biogas production and cod removal parameters such as hrt mlss ts ss bod and concentration of oil and grease of raw pome are considered not affecting the cod removal and biogas production as their p values are 0 05 three critical input parameters i e temperature ph and recirculation ratio are identified and used for designing the models these data collected from the real industrial scale covered lagoon over two years period with average values are presented in table a1 appendix once the dataset has been confirmed to have statistical different the accuracy of the results and learning speed of ann were enhanced by using the same dataset from the developed rsm model the dataset obtained can be normalised prior to data mining 31 33 here normalisation was only required for ann model whereby the data were scaled from 1 to 1 as shown in eq 3 this allows the data to be more apt to the activation function assigned to their respective hidden and output layer in ann 25 3 x i norm x i x min x max x min where xi norm is the normalised value for each sample i in the dataset of 16 samples for a particular variable xmin and xmax denote the minimum and maximum value for the variable 2 3 modelling and optimisation analysis 2 3 1 development of response surface methodology rsm model the design of the response surface was conducted for model fitting using a three level three factor box behnken design bbd to identify the most appropriate polynomial equation design expert 13 software was utilised to generate rsm model for data analysis and optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters such as temperature ph and recirculation ratio to maximise methane yield and minimise h2s concentration in untreated biogas all the experiments and analysis were performed in duplicate which summed up a total of 80 experimental runs with each run having 3 independent parameters such as treated effluent temperature ph and ratio of recirculation of treated effluent and bottom sludge to raw pome were denoted as x1 x2 and x3 respectively coded levels were assigned to all three input variables using numerical values of 1 0 and 1 in designing bbd as presented in table 2 two responses were analysed and predicted namely methane yield y1 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and y2 ppm which can be simplified into an empirical model given in eq 4 the quadratic polynomial equation was employed to fit the experimental data by using the coefficients obtained for the model equation 4 y pred β o i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j i j k β ij x i x j e where ypred is the predicted value of response variable y βo is the intercept value βi i 1 2 k is the linear coefficients βii is quadratic coefficients and βij represents the interaction coefficients xi and xj are denoted as input features that affect the responses and e is the random error the experimental data obtained were evaluated via three main steps namely analysis of variance anova regression model analysis and 3 d response surface plots besides graphical pareto chart was plotted using ms excel to study the percentage effect of each model term the equation used to calculate the effect of each model term in percentage was expressed in eq 5 5 p i β i 2 β i 2 100 i 0 where pi is percent contribution and βi is the regression coefficient of the individual term once the analysis of data was done a regression model was generated to analyse the deviation of predicted values from the experimental data 3 d surface plots were then utilised to study the effect of each independent variable on the methane yield and h2s concentration lastly optimisation was performed to obtain the optimal conditions for the dependent variable the design matrix of the bbd model was tabulated in table a2 for comparison between the predicted values and the experimental data of both responses 2 3 2 development of artificial neural network ann model the prediction of methane yield and concentration of raw h2s in biogas was modelled using artificial neural network approach one of the most common types of ann architecture is feed forward neural network ffnn as it has the capability of understanding complex and nonlinear problems 31 33 it comprises of input hidden and output layer input layer introduces the independent variables to the network while output layer receives information from the neurons of hidden layers with weights w ij neural networks with more hidden layers are extremely hard to train in this study trial and error is done in the coding to decide the number of hidden layers as the results in terms of regression is closer to 1 and error values closer to zero one hidden layer is chosen which is deemed sufficient the weights imply the intensity of the input data attached to the node which are summed with bias b j that is responsible in controlling the magnitude of input data 25 this is then transformed by multiplying with a sigmoid transfer function called tan sigmoid tansig or log sigmoid logsig function in the hidden layer of the proposed ann model expressed in eq 6 and 7 25 6 g a tanh a exp a exp a exp a exp a 7 g a log a 1 1 exp a the output signal from this sigmoid function is conveyed to the output layer the number of variables is equal to the number of neurons in output layer which is governed by a linear transfer function purelin given by eq 8 25 8 g a purelin a a where g a is then activation function these transfer functions have been utilised during the development of ann model once data samples are fed into matlabtm 2020b data scaling is done followed by data division similar to all ann models training a portion of the data was performed in this work whereby the training algorithm utilised was levenberg marquardt due to its capability and robustness in solving fitting problems 25 the data was divided into 3 categories namely training validation and testing set in a ratio of 70 15 15 the data division was decided based on trial and error 70 of data was used for training 15 for testing and remaining 15 for validation this is to ensure that the designed ann framework was tested and validated for better prediction of the response variables as a result the best architecture and topology of the ann model will be selected based on the results of the validation and testing of the model by choosing the appropriate algorithm and optimal number of hidden neurons 36 fig 2 illustrated the proposed ann architecture with 3 input variables namely ph temperature and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge to pome 14 hidden neurons 2 targeted outputs for methane yield and concentration of raw h2s there are 2 vital factors in establishing an ann model that have to be specified which include the training algorithm transfer function and number of neurons the topology of the ann was further enhanced by performing trial and error to obtain the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer trial and error were executed to determine the robustness of each training algorithm which were evaluated using box plot box plot was constructed to show the distribution and variation of the statistical performance of ann models using six different learning algorithms 36 six classes of training algorithm were evaluated such as levenberg marquardt backpropagation gradient descent with variable learning rate resilient backpropagation conjugated gradient descent quasi newton algorithm and bayesian regulation this procedure was reiterated starting from 0 to 20 number for hidden neurons so that the lowest mse with high r2 value achieved with all the factors specified the network was trained with evaluation conducted on the established model using mse and r2 based on this method 14 hidden neurons were chosen in this study due to its lowest mse the inference time of ann model is 15 s 2 4 statistical evaluation of the developed models the performance of rsm and ann models were accessed using two common metrics namely rmse and r2 it was observed that the performance of the ann model changed when the training procedure was repeated thus the ann model was trained till mse approaching 0 and r2 in close proximity to 1 which were presented in eqs 9 and 10 respectively by taking the square root of mse rmse can be expressed in eq 11 furthermore mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape were other metrics that can be used to assess the constructed model arranged in eqs 12 and 13 however an additional metric called symmetrical mean absolute percentage error smape was used to determine the model accuracy of ann which was given in eq 14 the metrics equations were expressed as follows 31 33 36 38 9 mse 1 x i 1 x a i p i 2 10 r 2 1 i 1 x a i p i 2 i 1 x p i a i 2 11 rmse 1 x i 1 x a i p i 2 12 mae 1 x 1 1 x a i p i 13 mape 1 x 1 1 x a i p i a i 14 smape 1 x i 1 x a i p i a i p i 2 100 where x is the number of observations a i is the mean of the actual values pi and ai are the predicted and experimental actual value respectively 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative importance i of each anaerobic digestion input parameter on the methane yield for both rsm and ann models the sensitivity analysis performed on the developed rsm model by utilising the sum of squares ss of the model and linear terms obtained from anova the relative importance will be evaluated using the sum of squares to compute the contribution of each factor on the methane yield was arranged in eq 15 38 15 contribution factor ss f ss t 100 where ssf and sst represent the sum of squares of factor and all factors respectively garson equation was utilised to calculate the importance level of the established ann model for sensitivity analysis to be carried out on the anaerobic digestion parameters however weights generated randomly from the developed ann will be utilised in this equation instead of sum of squares which were shown in table a3 as a result the equation was given by ishola et al 38 16 i j m 1 m n h w jm ih k 1 ni w jm ih w mn ho k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w jm ih k 1 ni w jm ih w mn ho where the number of input and hidden neurons are denoted as n i and n h respectively w represents the weight connections that are associated to input hidden and output layer which are denoted as subscripts of i h and o respectively and the corresponding number of neurons are represented using subscripts of k m and n i j is the relative importance of the variable j on methane yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of time on methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas fig 3 showed the real industrial scale plant data for methane yield and h2s concentration for two years period from july 2019 till june 2021 based on the figure a relationship can be observed between the methane yield and concentration of hydrogen sulphide it illustrated that low methane production was observed before dec 19 leading to high h2s concentration in the biogas produced this was possibly due to the low removal of total solids ts and cod at 47 and 71 4 respectively low ts removal indicates that the removal of volatile solids vs is low as well a low removal of vs and cod implies that methanogenesis process is inhibited by the presence of high volatile fatty acids vfa concentration in the anaerobic lagoon 39 this could be the reason why high treated effluent and bottom sludge being recycled back into the covered lagoon leading to high temperature 40 42 c was detected during that season although this situation was caused by the high vfa concentration but due to the high recirculation ratio the ph can be seen maintained in alkalinity condition instead of dropping below ph 7 the temperature ph and recirculation ratio during this season were around 42 c 7 2 and 2 5 respectively this information was evidently supported by the data collected from the industrial scale plant which are shown in the table a1 on mar 20 the methane yield and h2s concentration can be seen to stabilise but dropped significantly from 0 24 to 0 17 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved on jan 21 this was probably due to the low temperature that is below 37 c table a1 that slowed down the methanogenesis process although the mesophilic condition is within the range of 30 c to 42 c 2 this is highly dependent on the process of ad and varies from plant to plant this was agreed by cioabla et al 40 which explained that the microbial activity and growth rate will be reduced with the reduction of temperature leading to the drop in biogas production moreover any sudden or instantaneous change in temperature of ad can result in lower cod reduction as well as biogas production with accumulation of volatile fatty acids 15 that tend to release more h2s in the biogas although both response variables which were utilised in this research demonstrated a strong relationship between them yet methane yield is prioritised more than the concentration of h2s this is because a healthy anaerobic lagoon will automatically yield high methane but low h2s which in turn bringing profit and ensuring the economic welfare of the biogas plant is maintained methanogenesis process happens when methanogens feed on hydrogen and acetic acids however these substrates produced from acetogenesis process will also be consumed by sulfate reducing bacteria srb leading to a survival competition with the inferior methanogens 7 which explains the relationship between methanogens and srb therefore to prevent srb from dominating over methanogens implementing the proposed machine learning tools will definitely help to prevent the h2s concentration from escalating by manipulating or controlling the ph temperature and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge to pome at their respective optimal range nevertheless the most influential parameter that can affect the concentration of h2s can be accessed via sensitivity analysis section 3 5 3 2 analysis of the developed bbd rsm model the resulting regression equation models that were based on the bbd experimental results will be used to determine the effect of the anaerobic digestion parameters on the response variables besides the established polynomial equations can be used for theoretical prediction of methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas in the future 38 the coefficient of determination achieved can also be implied by the designed quadratic equations for box behnken design as expressed in eqs 17 and 18 17 y 1 0 2719 0 0057 x 1 0 0091 x 2 0 0087 x 1 x 2 0 017 x 1 x 3 0 0096 x 2 x 3 0 015 x 1 2 0 016 x 2 2 0 0058 x 3 2 18 y 2 1258 84 44 35 x 1 50 45 x 2 54 34 x 1 x 2 88 75 x 1 x 3 253 29 x 2 x 3 93 02 x 1 2 165 48 x 2 2 where x1 x2 and x3 are the input variables denoted as temperature c ph and recirculation ratio of treated effluent and bottom sludge whereas the responses are y1 and y2 representing methane yield and h2s concentration referring to both equations x3 was not included as it has p value 0 05 indicating an insignificant effect on the responses of all the linear terms only temperature in eq 18 has negative effect on h2s concentration whereas the other linear terms have positive effect on their respective response apart from that the data predicted was found to fit the quadratic model applied for both response model according to betiku and taiwo 23 a good fit model exhibits r2 value of at least 0 80 the resulting r2 values for y1 and y2 were 0 8311 and 0 8689 respectively for example the independent features accounted for 83 11 of the sample variation in methane yield while the remaining 16 89 of the total variation was not described by the model this can be evidently shown from the parity plot in fig 4 that successfully described the predicted data fitted well to the regression model exhibiting satisfying r2 which corroborated that both models achieved good fit furthermore the corresponding adjusted r2 were 0 8094 and 0 8520 for y1 and y2 in which good correlation and significance of the model were observed the predicted r2 for y1 0 7694 and y2 0 8185 were slightly lower than the adjusted r2 but still above the 0 75 for a good fit model 21 the results of the response surface quadratic model were analysed using anova as presented in tables 3 and 4 the resultant anova tests for the model of both methane yield y1 and h2s concentration y2 responses were identified to be significant using fisher test f value and probability p value at 95 confidence level this excluding the insignificant model terms such as recirculation ratio of the linear term x3 for model y1 whereas the model term for y2 were linear and quadratic of recirculation ratio x3 2 the model fitting tests for y1 and y2 were found to be adequacy in which the f value were 38 28 and 51 54 with the corresponding p value of 0 0001 for both cases indicating that the model was statistically significant although anova can determine the significance of each model term but its effect on the output variable was unknown therefore graphical analysis was implemented to study the effect of each linear and interactive factor using pareto chart referring to fig 5 a the primary effect was contributed by the quadratic terms temperature recirculation ratio rr ph ph temperature temperature which has at least 20 effect on methane yield this implies that ph and temperature are the main concern parameter to the methane yield as the squared of the linear term will double up the effect substantially besides the coefficient of these quadratic terms was observed to be larger as compared to the model terms that contributed 20 temperature rr has dominating effect on methane yield because of the significant change in the crop seasons and usually plant operator has to control it by supplying the appropriate amount of treated effluent back to the mixing pond it can also be seen from table a1 that the recorded temperature and recirculation ratio from biogas plant were varied the most as compared to ph which was always within the optimum range as for h2s concentration shown in fig 5 b the main contributor term was ph rr with 55 effect followed by ph ph of about 20 and the remaining model terms were below 10 the interaction between ph rr was observed to be the most dominant because ph will definitely affect the methanogens activity and growth rate which subsequently induced the reproductivity of sulfate reducing bacteria as mentioned previously sbr is more active than methanogens in competing for methanogenic substrates such as hydrogen and acetic acids by converting them into h2s instead of methane when ph is low 7 besides ph should always be controlled along with varying recirculation ratio as the incoming acidic raw pome will cause nuisance to the condition of the anaerobic covered lagoon this explains why recirculation ratio alone has the least for both responses according to table a1 it was obvious that either temperature or ph will differ when recirculation ratio was varied all in all it can be seen that ph should be taken into consideration before temperature and finally recirculation ratio this could be a reason why the biogas plant has been emphasising on the consistency of the ph of the treated effluent and bottom sludge at optimum range as methanogens are sensitive to environmental changes 41 the design models implemented for this study are reduced quadratic models this is because there is insufficient data to represent the prediction model to a higher order polynomial equation as the biogas plant is still new with merely two years of operation 3 3 analysis of the developed ann model to find the best neural network model trial and error were performed on different learning algorithms and transfer functions so that the selected model resulted in satisfactory overall statistical performance box plot was utilised and comprised of maximum third quartile median first quartile and minimum values the variation of the model was presented in fig 6 where large variation was seen in levenberg marquardt lm resilient backpropagation rp scaled conjugate gradient scg and bfgs quasi newton bfg when the number of hidden neurons was altered from 1 to 20 a good model usually has small variation and high median prediction accuracy which was shown by lm and bayesian regularization backpropagation br 36 despite the high median prediction accuracy from trainbr it has many outliers that will reduce the productivity of the model hence lm was chosen for further evaluation of the ann model table 5 showed the quantitative results that have been examined by interchanging the activation function between hidden and output layer by setting the number of hidden neurons as 11 for the model to be executed the evaluation of the model performance was based on the model mse r2 and accuracy based on the table logsig employed in output layer showed high mse and low r2 and accuracy regardless of the activation function used in hidden layer when tansig was accounted for output layer only logsig in the hidden layer outperformed purelin and tansig with r2 value of about 0 98 for all datasets yet this is still inferior to purelin being utilised for output layer in which the tansig in hidden layer showed the most outstanding performance with the lowest mse in the testing and validation dataset despite the small variance in the r2 value as compared to logsig in hidden layer both tansig and logsig are comparable and appropriate to be utilised for training function in hidden layer while the output layer belongs to purelin though many researchers agreed to utilise tansig and purelin for hidden and output layer respectively 31 33 38 however this can be corroborated again and discussed in the next section as the performance will be differed when the optimum number of hidden neurons was chosen beside choosing the learning algorithm and transfer function selection of the ideal number of hidden neurons is a tedious task and usually done using trial and error with careful consideration however matlab has the ability to produce the results concurrently for examining the desired range of number of hidden neurons in this study the number of hidden neurons was analysed ranging from 1 to 20 by finding the suitable transfer function for the hidden layer tansig and logsig will be accessed comparatively via trial and error with the aid of for loop the learning performance in terms of mse and r2 becomes better when the number of hidden neurons was sufficiently large as seen from fig 7 a and b respectively which was agreed by betiku and taiwo 23 however the number of hidden neurons was kept limit at 15 as additional hidden neurons will cause noise during the training phase of the dataset in this case the number of hidden neurons were analysed from 5 to 15 as tabulated in table a4 the most satisfactory ann model based on the performance metrics was found to be 14 hidden neurons when logsig was utilised as the hidden layer and purelin for output layer this concluded model 3 14 2 was the best topology where 3 represents the input variables 14 as hidden neurons and 2 for the response variables in forecasting methane yield and h2s concentration in raw biogas once the best performance of the model has been identified the metrics for training validation and testing set including the overall performance that correspond to methane yield and h2s concentration were presented in table 6 the overall mse mae mape and r2 achieved with 14 hidden neurons were 318 6 5 10 0 0046 and 0 9762 respectively the regression curve obtained using the best architecture and topology of the model for training testing and validation were plotted as illustrated in fig 8 including the overall r values it can be observed that levenberg marquart converged rapidly with low mse achieved as shown in fig 9 optimal mse of 62 17 was found at fifth iteration during the validation process a small mse literally means the model has better prediction with minimal residual error between the target and output value the weights and biases were randomly generated throughout the training phase until minimal mse value was achieved for the training dataset consequently the ann models will be validated through mse of the validation set as displayed in fig 8 the r values for training testing validation and overall dataset showed satisfactory result that were in close proximity to 1 this implies that the forecasted value of the methane yield and h2s concentration from the best ann model is nearly achieving the targeted value with satisfying r2 value shown in fig 10 selection of the appropriate model in terms of the type of output variable was carried out to determine which response variable model is more reliable the statistical results were presented in table 7 whereby models 1 and 2 were simulated using one output variable namely methane yield and h2s concentration respectively in contrast to model 3 two output variables were employed in the model to demonstrate its statistical performance the resultant statistical performance showed that the quantitative result r2 value for all the models were quite close to 1 but models 2 and 3 showed unsatisfactory mse value however to determine the best ann model for optimisation the performance of the dataset in testing and validation should be evaluated it can be observed that model 1 demonstrated r2 value of 0 9799 and 0 9891 for testing and validation respectively the validation performance for model 1 was the best while model 2 demonstrated the highest r2 during the testing phase however when compared to the mse values for all models model 1 was nearly 0 indicating the model was statistically perfect as compared to model 3 which has lower mse value than model 2 this was due to smaller mse value indicated a smaller rmse value was achieved that described the model was best fitted in general model 1 will be chosen to study the interactive effects between ad parameters on methane yield using 3 d response surface plots due to its excellent validation performance 3 4 optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters on the responses 3 4 1 relationship between the anaerobic digestion parameters on methane yield it is important to analyse the effect of the temperature ph recirculation ratio and their interactions on methane yield using 3 d response surface plot before optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters was executed in this study only methane yield will be analysed as it was clearly explained that higher methane yield would lead to lower h2s concentration or otherwise besides it was also determined from table 7 that model 1 by using only methane yield as the response variable due to its satisfactory statistical performance with low mse and high r2 value which proved its competency to be the best candidate for optimisation using the developed rsm model fig 11 showed the effect of the two interactive factors on the methane yield these resultant plots can be compared with the real industrial scale data as a validation through historical data referring to the fig 11 a at high rr of 3 0 the methane yield decreased significantly as the temperature dropped from 42 5 to 35 8 c regardless of the changes in ph low methane yield was observed only when the ph was not in the optimum range 6 8 to 7 2 that is favourable for the methanogens to grow 40 this observation was similar to the evaluation done based on the real industrial scale biogas plant shown in fig 3 under the mesophilic range microbial activity and growth rate can be reduced to about 50 for each 10 c of temperature drop drastic drop in biogas production begins when digestion temperature reduces to 20 c and it even will stop production at temperature of 10 c 40 in contrast to higher temperature volatile fatty acids generation is said to increase if the anaerobic lagoon is operating out of the mesophilic range from 35 c to 42 c 2 5 42 on top of that the effect of ph on methane yield was illustrated in fig 11 b when the temperature was optimised at 39 c it can be seen that ph also affects the methane yield significantly as the methane yield decreases from ph of 7 5 to 6 5 the lowest methane yield was observed when the ph was at 6 5 and low recirculation ratio of 0 76 at low ph of 6 5 methanogens bacteria became incapable of digesting the volatile fatty acids into methane and other components as the bacteria could not survive in very acidic condition 40 volatile fatty acids will increase and cause ph to drop further in the anaerobic lagoon with that being said volatile fatty acids consumption by methanogens can induce an increase in ph level in the pond for biogas production no historical data of the existing real plant has recorded ph lower than 7 0 table a1 though it was found out that the existing plant data from mar 21 to apr 21 the methane yield was slightly reduced 0 268 0 266 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved even when the ph increased 7 09 to 7 12 with increasing recirculation ratio yet this cannot be corroborated since the ph only changed slightly and well maintained at optimum range of ph therefore high methane yield can be obtained at high temperature and ph ranges of 37 to 42 5 c and 6 8 to 7 4 respectively at recirculation ratio of 3 0 as demonstrated in fig 11 a referring to fig 11 c both increasing and decreasing trend can be seen when the temperature is decreasing which depends on the recirculation ratio this shows the strong interactive effects between temperature and rr as discussed in fig 5 a under section 3 2 however highest methane yield was favoured when recirculation ratio and temperature were high at 3 06 and 42 5 c in fig 11 c however when considering the pumping cost that was needed for recirculation high recirculation ratio should be avoided as this will raise the concern of the operating cost of the biogas plant when recirculated pome is insufficient the raw pome that coming in with high temperature and in acidic condition will cause unfavourable conditions and fail to meet the optimum operating condition of the lagoon according to the existing plant data from oct 19 to dec 19 the methane yield was seen increasing significantly from 0 202 to 0 292 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved when temperature decreased 41 7 to 36 5 c with moderate recirculation ratio 1 05 to 2 43 therefore it was suggested to have optimum recirculation range from 1 05 to 2 43 all in all the rr temperature has the most prominent influence on methane yield when the ph was at optimal level of 7 4 this observation corresponds with the pareto chart in fig 5 a where the interactive effects between rr temperature is the highest 26 as compared to rr ph and temperature ph when the temperature is at low range 35 38 c the recirculation ratio needs to be adjusted to a lower range 0 76 1 68 in order to obtain high methane yield conversely high rr ratio 2 6 3 0 is needed when the temperature is on the higher side 42 5 c besides maintaining ph at optimal range is vital as a drop in ph will not be able to maintain the high methane yield this can be seen from fig 11 a and b that show varying either temperature or recirculation ratio will not rectify the issue of having low methane yield when ph was off from the optimum range this results are particularly important for the biogas plant s operators which can be served as guidelines when facing low methane yield issues 3 4 2 validation of the predicted values using bbd rsm optimisation of the anaerobic digestion parameters was carried out to obtain maximum methane yield but minimising the h2s concentration this was executed by choosing the specification for the independent variables to be within the optimum range based on the historical data and experience of the plant operator as shown in table 8 the resultant optimum conditions for all factors as well as the predicted maximum methane yield within the selected range was displayed in fig 12 based on fig 12 the temperature obtained was 42 c in which many researchers agree with the optimum temperature range of mesophilic can be between 35 c to 40 c in malaysia 2 42 this helps to promote the methane yield with faster degradation of organic matter besides the optimal recirculation ratio was 2 50 which was considered high but still within the desired range this optimal value was satisfying as low recirculation ratio is more preferably when the digester is overloaded resulting in low efficiency of the anaerobic digester otherwise keeping the recirculation ratio high is recommended as the treated effluent still contains some organic substrates that could maximise the throughput of the methane for higher retention time as well as improving the mixing behaviour of the digester to homogenise the untreated and treated pome 43 as for the ph 7 36 can be considered high but because of the existing biogas plant does not using any agents that contains ammonia thus having high ph will not cause nuisance to the digester 40 this can help to reduce the efficiency of srb while allowing methanogens to grow and digest faster for higher methane yield with the optimum conditions generated using the designed bbd rsm model actual data was obtained from the real industrial scale biogas plant for the validation of the maximum methane yield and the lowest achievable h2s concentration it was concluded that the actual highest methane yield obtained was 0 272 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved which has a slight difference of 0 48 when compared to the maximum predicted methane yield at 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved in term of h2s concentration the least predicted value was 1086 4 ppm and the actual value obtained was 1195 ppm resulting in percentage difference of 9 09 this showed that the prediction accuracy for h2s model was still comparable to the actual data albeit not as accurate as methane yield model the results proved that the developed methane yield model is robust and feasible to be implemented in real industrial plant in this research ann is a good prediction tool for methane yield whereas the optimisation process done using rms approach was reliable but only limited to optimising within the optimum operating range in comparison to the recent literature studies tiong et al 21 demonstrated bbd rsm for process optimisation of anaerobic co digestion from food waste and pome the responses such as the removal efficiencies of methane flow cod and volatile solid were set to meet their respective target so that the highest calculated methane yield was 0 3 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved after optimisation of the ad parameters in this research the highest methane yield achieved after optimisation was only 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved which differed significantly from tiong et al 21 this is probably due to optimisation of the different process parameters on the responses which in this research both the methane yield and h2s concentration were set to meet maximum and minimum target value respectively another possibility that the methane yield achieved by tiong et al 21 was higher was due to the combination of pome with food waste that could lead to higher throughput of methane as compared to mono digestion pome other than that the comparison based on the performance metrics of various studies is very complicated as the experimental data differed from every studies 31 33 hence an overview performance of the rsm models were presented in table 9 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify the relative importance of each factor on methane yield using sum of squares and garson equation for rsm and ann model respectively as shown in fig 13 the results shown were not following a same trend from both models methane yield prediction from rsm model was significantly affected by ph followed by temperature and rr in contrast to that ann model displayed that recirculation ratio contributed the most to methane yield instead of ph being the last and temperature being the intermediate contributor it can be observed that ann model was capable of distributing the contribution of each factor in nearly equal probability as similar observations were seen from the sensitivity analysis presented by ishola et al 38 conversely rsm model only prioritised one factor more than the others perhaps rsm model was not competent in dealing with nonlinear trends in complex dataset due to the fluctuating characteristics of pome therefore it can be concluded that recirculation ratio played the most important role in methane yield with relative importance of 36 meanwhile ph and temperature should also not be neglected as the corresponding importance level were 30 and 34 respectively indicating that both factors still play substantial roles in yielding more methane in fact both ph and recirculation ratio are inter related where high recirculation ratio will lead to higher treated effluent ph this is because more anaerobically treated effluent will be recirculated to provide the alkalinity and thus creating appropriate environment for the methanogens to produce more methane gas 3 6 statistical comparison of bbd rsm and ann all the proposed algorithms in this research have evidently shown its robustness and adequacy using various statistical performance indicators which were shown in table 10 based on fig 4 the parity plots of rsm model illustrated that the deviation of the predicted data from actual value was quite large as compared to ann model shown in fig 10 there was only a few predicted data points that deviated slightly from the regression line the developed models have high r values 0 8 indicating a good correlation was observed between the predicted and actual data points besides table 10 showed all models were reliable with its corresponding r2 achieving at least 75 21 rmse was utilised as an indicator of the model best fit given in a dataset it was observed that no high rmse was found in both models of rsm and ann when predicting methane yield which implies a good model fitting being achieved similar for mae indicator showed the reliability of both models at low mse value when predicting methane yield however both approaches did show satisfying overall mape value demonstrated by both models in overall ann model achieved the lowest values based on all the error indicators and highest overall r and r2 when compared to bbd rsm model the performance metrics of methane yield prediction can be demonstrated in a graphical manner by using taylor diagram as shown in fig 14 the prediction of methane yield for rsm and ann model can be evaluated correlatively to the observed dataset using the standard deviation rmse and r metrics it can be observed that the standard deviation of rsm is very much smaller than ann when compared to the observed dataset this could mean that rsm has lesser tendency of getting poor predicted results due to high precision but the accuracy was poor due to unsatisfactory rmse and r values as compared to ann model it was more comparable to the observed dataset with rmse and r values of 0 003 and 0 984 that were adjacent to 0 and 1 respectively there is no doubt that ann model prediction can produce a standard deviation that is almost adjacent to the actual dataset as compared to rsm model this clearly justifies that ann model is definitely the best candidate model as the best fitting model in prediction of methane yield in this research however ann has few limitations such as lower prediction efficiency as compared to other models random forest rf and gradient boosting machine gbm time consuming and large amount of data is required 47 therefore to improve the accuracy of ann model more data sets i e longer operational duration 3 years should be implemented into the model for future study 4 conclusion this research has successfully appraised the performance of rsm and ann in modelling of anaerobic digestion parameters for methane yield and h2s concentration in biogas the developed models showed the predictions of methane yield using ann model was the most reliable and well fitted model as compared to rsm model the corresponding highest methane yield and minimum h2s concentration obtained were 0 2733 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and 1086 4 ppm at optimal conditions of 42 c 7 36 and 2 5 for temperature ph and recirculation ratio of total effluent to pome respectively the predicted results were validated with the actual results of 0 2720 n m3 ch4 kg codremoved and 1195 ppm this optimisation results showed that the predicted maximum methane yield and h2s was highly correlated to the actual data with small percentage difference of 0 48 and 9 09 respectively besides the sensitivity analysis of ann model conducted on the anaerobic digestion parameters revealed that recirculation ratio played the most vital role followed by temperature and finally ph the result from this study is useful for decision making and operational cost saving of biogas plants the three influential input parameters can be manipulated through estimating of required methane yield leading to savings in cost and energy by the operational systems in a nutshell the prediction for methane yield fits the model well with high r2 of 0 9762 however more data sets i e longer operational period 3 years should be implemented into the ann model to allow more observations and quantitative results to be recorded for future analysis there is no doubt that the implementation of rsm and ann models could help to sustain and maintain the health and economic welfare of the biogas plant with improved handling of treating pome via anaerobic covered lagoon for further improvements data mining and model validation by using other similar biogas plants would be proposed for future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12521,in this study to achieve high efficiency utilization of charges on layered double hydroxides ldhs a simple and direct synthesis method of ldhs in wastewater was designed for the removal of the contaminants ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline tc the obtained ldhs structure was characterized by xrd ft ir dls sem and tem the removal of cip tc using different mg al ratios and stepwise experiments was investigated with the formation of ldhs structures in wastewater the cip tc molecule was sandwiched between the ldhs layers and removal process was controlled by the positive charges resulting in a more efficient utilization of the ldhs layer than that of other methods the removal of cip was dominant during competitive removal the isothermal model of the generalized langmuir model obtained a good fit with the experimental data in the single and mixed systems indicating a specific number of adsorption sites on the ldhs layer and heterogeneous adsorption sites with different adsorption energies according to the site energy distribution theory the calculated average energies of cip and tc were 18 68 and 16 68 j mmol 1 respectively under competitive adsorption molecular simulation was conducted to explain the interaction between the cip tc molecule and ldhs layer based on the electron density and bonding energy moreover the effects of ph ion coexistence and antibiotic competition were investigated which revealed favorable adsorption stability parameters therefore this method for ldhs formation in wastewater allowed the efficient utilization of positive charges and provided a promising method for antibiotic removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords layered double hydroxides antibiotics molecular simulation site energy distribution wastewater treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction antibiotics belong to class of drugs used in treating human diseases and in animal husbandry 1 2 however 30 90 of antibiotic drugs are returned unchanged to the aquatic environment on account owing to their incomplete metabolism by animals and humans 3 5 in addition a large amount of antibiotics in aquatic environments are contributed by pharmaceutical industries hospitals animal farms and municipal waste 6 10 thus antibiotics have been detected in surface water shallow groundwater and even in drinking water systems which can accumulate to higher concentrations thereby posing a high ecological risk to the environment 11 13 the efficient removal of antibiotics from the environment is a serious concern that should be addressed to abate their negative effects 14 15 several methods have been explored for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater 16 among these adsorption has been widely studied because of its low cost high efficiency and wide applicability 17 adsorbents such as carbon based materials 18 23 metal organic frameworks 24 25 organic polymers 26 27 and clay 28 31 have been selected to remove antibiotics from wastewater layered double hydroxides ldhs have received wide attention as an adsorbent material with the advantage of low cost easy preparation stable structure environment friendly and excellent adsorptive properties 32 the common formula for ldhs is m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x an x n mh2o where m2 and m3 are divalent and trivalent cations respectively and an is an exchangeable charge balancing interlayer anion 33 35 considerable effort has been devoted to the adsorption of antibiotic contaminants by ldhs 36 for example utilizing of positive charged ldhs layer and ion exchange property antibiotics could be adsorbed into the interlayer of ldhs and removed from wastewater 37 38 utilizing of the memory effect of ldhs layer calcined ldhs could be used to remove antibiotics from wastewater through the reconstruction of ldhs layers and regeneration of charges 39 40 these methods utilize the positive charges on the ldhs layer to immobilize contaminants 41 42 however these methods have the drawbacks of low utilization of positive charges exposure of internal charges and methodological complexity in this study a simple method for synthesizing ldhs directly in wastewater and simultaneous removal of antibiotic contaminants was designed and proposed ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline tc which are frequently used synthetic antibiotics with high activity against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria were selected for this study different ratios of mg2 and al3 were investigated and a stepwise removal test was performed characterization methods including x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir dynamic light scattering dls scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem were used to characterize the synthesized structure the removal performance was studied using isothermal experiments and the generalized langmuir model was used to describe the adsorption process the theory of site energy distribution was employed and the average energy of the adsorption sites was calculated and analyzed molecular simulation was performed to investigate the competitive adsorption mechanism based on the bonding energies and electron transfer between the antibiotics and ldhs in addition the effects of ph coexisting ions and other antibiotics were analyzed therefore this method offers a promising approach for the efficient utilization of positive charges on ldhs layers in antibiotic removal 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all reagents used in this study were analytical grade and the high purity experimental water was used mg no3 2 6h2o al no3 3 9h2o and naoh were obtained from the beijing chemical reagent factory china ciprofloxacin c17h18fn3o3 hcl tetracyclines c22h24n2o8 hcl erythromycin c37h67no13 and sulfadiazine c10h10n4o2s were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co 2 2 individual removal experiment of tc and cip a solution 25 ml with 0 2 mmol mg no3 2 0 1 mmol al no3 3 and 0 6 mmol naoh solution 25 ml were simultaneously added dropwise into 50 ml wastewater the synthesized ldhs in wastewater was 17 7 mg according to ldhs formula under vigorous stirring at a fixed rate around one drop per second the final ph of the reaction system was almost neutral which is beneficial to water environment wastewater 50 ml containing different amounts 0 04 0 16 mmol of cip or tc was analyzed the mixture was fully agitated for 30 min without aging the suspension was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min the antibiotic concentration in the supernatant was measured the obtained solid was repeatedly washed and dried at 60 c denoted as ldh cip and ldh tc based on their antibiotic content cip and tc respectively to analyze the removal process the removal experiment of tc and cip was tested in detail the wastewater of 50 ml containing 0 12 mmol of cip or tc was used the solution was added step by step and each step included 2 ml naoh and 2 ml mg al solution the residuary concentration of cip or tc was measured after each step all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 competitive removal experiment of mixed tc and cip in the competitive removal experiment tc and cip mixed solution with the same amount of cip and tc was used the initial addition was between 0 08 and 0 32 mmol including 0 04 0 16 mmol cip and tc respectively the same experimental procedure as that in section 2 2 was followed the obtained sample was denoted as ldh mixed the residual cip and tc in mixed solution after treatment were tested respectively 2 4 analysis of the effects of ph and coexisting ions in the ph analysis 25 ml wastewater with 0 12 mmol cip or tc was used the procedure is similar to that in section 2 3 the ph of the final system was adjusted to 6 10 using naoh solution in the analysis of the coexisting ions 1 mmol l cation na k nh4 ca2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 ch3coo were added to the solution with 0 12 mmol cip or tc to test the removal efficiency sdz and ery antibiotics with the same concentration as that of cip or tc were mixed in the solution and the level of competitive adsorption for cip was detected the experimental process was the same as that used in section 2 3 2 5 characterization equilibrium concentrations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry agilent bruker usa the ldhs samples were characterized by xrd rigaku d max rc diffractometer with cu target kα ray λ 1 5418 ω and working voltage current of 40 kv 100 ma at a step interval of 0 02 in the 2θ range of 5 70 a cary 630 spectrometer was used for the ft ir characterization sem su1510 hitachi ltd japan was used to characterize the morphologies of the samples tem tecnai g2f 20 america at accelerating voltage of 200 kv to collect photomicrographs the particle size of the samples was analyzed by dynamic light scattering technique malvern zetasizer nano zs90 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ldh tc and ldh cip the ft ir spectra of the cip tc ldh cip ldh tc and ldhs samples were shown in fig 1b for the ldhs samples the peaks at approximately 3456 and 1631 cm 1 originate from the oh groups of the ldhs and interlayer water molecules respectively 43 in addition the peaks at approximately 1387 cm 1 were attributed to the no groups by the nitrate ions the absorption bands below 1000 cm 1 were attributed to m o which were characteristic peaks of ldhs 44 for ldh cip the peaks of the co and cc stretching vibrations appeared at approximately 1030 and 1605 cm 1 respectively 45 46 and the absorption bands at 1350 1100 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of cf 47 thus characteristic peaks of cip were observed in ldh cip suggesting the immobilization of cip molecules with ldhs similarly the bending vibration peaks of cn 900 650 cm 1 cc 1030 cm 1 and co 1605 cm 1 which were characteristic peaks of tc were noted in the ldh tc spectra indicating the successful immobilization of tc by ldhs 45 48 the particle size of ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc were tested and shown in fig s1 compared with ldhs 150 300 nm the size of ldh cip and ldh tc was 200 400 and 400 1500 nm respectively indicating that the existence of cip and tc in the forming process of ldhs increased the particle size the xrd patterns of the ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc samples were shown in fig 1c the xrd pattern of pristine ldhs consists of sharp symmetrical diffraction peaks indicating good crystallinity the d003 value was 7 54 å for ldh cip and ldh tc the position of the 003 diffraction peak of shifted to lower angles with a larger d003 value of approximately 13 71 and 14 36 å respectively this indicated the formation of the ldhs in wastewater thereby sandwiching the large cip tc molecules between the layers as well as enlarged interlayer spacing the sem and tem morphologies of ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc were shown in fig 2a l as shown in fig 2a d the morphology of ldhs displayed a layered structure and the lattice fringes were observed clearly in tem results in fig 2e i the morphology of ldh cip and ldh tc exhibited an irregular and stacked plate like structure and the lattice fringes were blurred indicating the existence of cip and tc was not conducive to the crystallization of ldhs structure besides after the formation of ldhs and removal of cip tc from the wastewater the system reached a neutral ph which was not suitable for the growth and crystallization of ldhs resulting in an irregular and non growing crystal structure 49 3 2 isothermal analysis variations in adsorption capacity with increased in cip and tc concentrations were investigated the results were shown in fig 3a and b the cip adsorption capacity of the newly formed ldhs increased with increasing initial concentration until reaching equilibrium the tc adsorption capacity exhibited a similar trend the isothermal model is ideal for exploring adsorption mechanisms to understand the relationship between the adsorption sites and contaminants 50 51 thus the langmuir eq 1 and freundlich eq 2 adsorption isotherm models were selected 52 54 1 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where c 0 mg l 1 is the initial antibiotic concentration c e mg l 1 is the antibiotic equilibrium concentration q e mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at the experimental equilibrium q m mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbents b is the equilibrium constant of the langmuir model and k f and n are the isothermal adsorption constants the langmuir model assumes that adsorption occurs on the surface of a monomolecular layer with identical and independent adsorption sites of the adsorbed particles 54 55 meanwhile the freundlich isotherm assumes multilayer adsorption over heterogeneous surfaces 51 55 according to the fitted experimental data in fig 3a and b and evaluation parameters in table s1 the adsorption capacities of ldh cip and ldh tc with different mg al ratios can be better described by the langmuir model hence the removal of cip tc by the formed ldhs was attributed to the monolayer adsorption with the adsorption immobilized at a finite number of definite adsorption sites only the sorption coefficients rl of cip and tc which were associated with the preferential degree of reaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate were in the range of 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 0 04 respectively suggesting the favorable sorption between cip tc on ldhs 53 55 the reaction with different mg al ratios exhibited a similar trend as that of the adsorption process in particular the adsorption capacity increased with increasing al content the positive charges on the ldhs layer were generated by the substitution of divalent metal ions with trivalent metal ions hence as the al ratio in the ldh layer increased more positive charges were produced with a higher charge density thereby providing more adsorption sites and a larger adsorption capacity for cip tc based on this a removal process was proposed and assessed with the addition of the mg al and naoh solutions ldh structures were continuously formed in wastewater and positive charges were gradually produced on the ldh layer the negative charge of the cip tc contaminant was attracted to the newly formed positive charge on the ldhs layer and combined with the layer to balance the charge therefore in the case of containing pollutants in wastewater the abundant positive charges on the ldhs layer could immobilize the contaminants with increasing adsorption capacity the increase in the cip tc concentration exceeded that of the formed positive charges in wastewater thereby inhibiting the increased adsorption capacity in the experiment with different mg al ratios when the added mg al solution with a higher proportion of al the formed ldhs layers possessed more positive charges and exhibited better removal capacity hence the removal of cip tc by the formation of ldhs in wastewater was controlled by positive charges which is consistent with the langmuir model to explore the relationship between cip tc and ldhs formation a stepwise experiment was conducted by testing the residual cip tc after the addition of a partial mg al and naoh solutions as shown in fig 3c the cip removal capacity increased rapidly with the dropwise addition of mg al and naoh solutions into the wastewater the removal capacity exhibited an approximately linear relationship with the amount of formed ldhs revealing the immobilization of a portion of the cip tc in wastewater with the formation of ldh structures the tc removal in the stepwise experiment exhibited a similar trend fig 3d these results indicate a close relationship between the cip tc molecules and newly formed ldh layers confirming the removal mechanism table 1 compared the cip and tc adsorption capacities of ldhs and other materials obtained in this study with those reported in previous papers compared with ldhs and other materials to remove cip and tc the adsorption capacities obtained by this method are significantly higher thus directly forming ldh structures in wastewater prompts the efficient utilization of the newly formed positive charges to directly immobilize cip tc and avoid the exposure of internal charges 3 3 characterization of ldh mixed in actual wastewater with antibiotics cip and tc contaminants usually coexist because of the mixed use of antibiotics 58 hence a competitive adsorption process by forming ldhs structures in mixed wastewater was assessed the characterization of samples from the mixed wastewater was shown in fig 4a d in the ft ir analysis fig 4a the curve of ldh mixed had characteristic cip and tc peaks revealing the successful combination of cip and tc molecules with ldhs in the xrd pattern of ldh mixed fig 4b characteristic peaks of ldhs were observed indicating the formation of ldhs structures in mixed wastewater the 003 diffraction peak of ldh mixed shifted to lower angles with a d003 value of 16 01 å which is larger than that of ldh cip 13 71 å and ldh tc 14 36 å this revealed simultaneous immobilization of cip and tc molecules in the ldhs interlayer which affected the layer spacing the sem morphology of the ldh mixed was also investigated whereby an irregular layered structure fig 4c and d was noted likely to that in single contaminant wastewater 3 4 competitive removal of cip and tc the removal efficiencies of cip and tc with different initial concentrations during the competitive removal by forming ldhs structures in mixed wastewater were tested a comparison of the cip and tc removal in the single and competitive systems was shown in fig 5c and d respectively under competitive adsorption the adsorption efficiency of tc was greatly affected by the presence of cip with an influence rate of approximately 30 compared with the single system the adsorption behavior of cip had lower influence with an influence rate of less than 10 these results indicated the competitiveness of cip and tc molecules in approaching the positive charges during the removal process with the formation of an ldhs layer in mixed wastewater furthermore cip demonstrated higher advantages in the competitive adsorption isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption of cip and tc in the mixed wastewater the results were shown in fig 5a and b compared with the freundlich model the langmuir model better fits the experimental data consistent with the single system although the langmuir model had a high fit coefficient in the single and mixed systems it could not adequately describe the adsorption process in particular the langmuir model assumes identical definite and equivalent adsorption sites on the adsorbent indicating that each cip tc adsorption on the ldhs layer has equal adsorption energies 38 59 however the positive charges on the edge surface or interior of the ldhs layer have different exposure and interaction with the contaminants which does not correspond with the assumption of the langmuir model therefore a generalized langmuir model with heterogeneity parameters was employed to further analyze the adsorption process in this study 24 59 the equation for the generalized langmuir model is as follows 3 q e q g 0 b g c e m 1 b g c e m n g m where qg 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the generalized isotherm m and ng are the heterogeneity parameters that affect the uniformity of the energy distribution and bg is a generalized form of the langmuir constant related to the temperature and adsorption energy the data fitting and correlation parameters were listed in table s1 in the single and mixed systems the generalized langmuir model had a higher fit coefficient r2 to the experimental data than that of the langmuir model for cip and tc this reveals the heterogeneous adsorption sites on the adsorbent which could be better described by the generalized langmuir model moreover the fitting of the generalized langmuir model indicated a certain number of adsorption sites on the ldhs layer and heterogeneous adsorption sites with different adsorption energies 60 hence the theory of site energy distribution was employed to further analyze the adsorption sites 3 5 theory of site energy distribution and molecular simulation the theory of site energy distribution explores the adsorption mechanism of the uneven adsorption energy of the adsorbents revealing the distribution function of the corresponding adsorption sites 60 the equation assumes that the total adsorption capacity of non uniform surface adsorbents on adsorbates q ce is given by the integral of the adsorption isotherm qh e ce multiplied by the energy distribution function f e at the local adsorption site with uniform energy 61 the formula used is as follows 4 q c e 0 q h e c e f e de the derivation process was discussed in our previous work 57 the site energy distribution function f e and average site energy μ e can be obtained as follows 5 f e n g q g 0 b g c s n rt exp n g e rt 1 b g c s exp e rt m 1 n g m 6 μ e rt m ln 1 b g c s m where c s is the solubility of the solute in a specific solution at absolute temperature t and r is the gas constant and e is the difference between the sorption energy at solute concentration c e and solubility c s fig 5g and h showed the relationship between the adsorption potential energy e of cip tc and equilibrium adsorption q e in the single and mixed systems with the increase of q e e continually decreased in a single system the cip and tc molecules were first adsorbed on the high energy adsorption site which then occupied the low energy adsorption site as the adsorption capacity increased in the mixed system the curves had a similar trend however the downward trend of tc was more drastic than that of cip these results indicated that the tc molecules in the mixed system were dramatically affected by cip in terms of occupying high energy adsorption sites the frequency distribution function curves for f e and e were shown in fig 5i and j respectively the average energy of cip and tc was 18 89 and 16 34 j mmol 1 in the single system and 18 68 and 16 68 j mmol 1 in the mixed system respectively revealing the higher average energy of cip than that of tc hence in the removal process the cip molecule occupied a large number of high energy adsorption sites on the newly formed ldhs layer with a dominant position in the competitive adsorption to explain the different average energies of cip and tc on the ldhs layer a molecular simulation was used to simulate the interaction and analyze the mechanism based on the electron density and binding energy the transfer of electron density is shown in fig 5e and f the electron rearrangement after immobilizing cip and tc on the ldhs layer can be observed through the color difference in which the yellow and blue regions represent the consumption and accumulation of electron density respectively compared to ldh tc ldh cip has larger variational areas and the carboxylate group in the cip molecule had a remarkable loss of electrons to the ldhs layer revealing that the positive charges on the ldhs layer preferred to obtain electrons from cip with a stronger interaction the bonding energies of cip and tc on the ldhs layer were calculated using the following formula 62 63 7 e e ldhs e cip tc e ldh cip tc where ecip tc eldhs and eldh cip tc are the bonding energies of cip tc ldhs and ldh cip ldh tc respectively the calculated bonding energies of cip and tc were 2 32 and 1 79 ev respectively the higher bonding energy of cip indicates its stronger interaction with the ldhs layer than tc hence during the competitive adsorption positive charges were formed in the ldhs layer which increased its accessibility to cip molecules and allowed them to obtain the dominant position in the competitive adsorption 3 6 effect of ph and coexisting ions for the removal of antibiotics ph is a vital factor that can influence the electrical properties of antibiotic molecules and ldhs 64 the removal of cip and tc over a ph range of 6 to 10 was studied as shown in fig 6a and b zeta potential of ldhs under different ph was also tested and shown in fig s2 cip existed in the solution in the form of cations zwitterions and anions at different ph values with pka values of 6 1 and 8 9 respectively 65 66 at a ph of approximately 6 the cips were mainly cationic with obvious electrostatic repulsion to the positively charged ldhs layer as the ph was increased to 8 the abundance of the cationic form of cip decreased thereby increasing the adsorption capacity from 6 to 8 with a continuous increase in ph the positive charges on the ldhs layer became minimal which is not suitable for the removal of cip from wastewater hence the removal of cip increased as the ph increased from 6 to 8 and subsequently decreased in the ph range of 6 10 the tc molecule was negatively charged with a pka of 3 3 and 7 7 67 68 as the positive charges on the ldhs decreased with increasing ph the removal efficiency of tc decreased with increasing ph the influence of the coexisting ions on the removal experiment was also investigated as shown in fig 6c and d among the anions cl no3 so4 2 and ch3coo had minimal impact on the removal of cip or tc among the cations na k and nh4 had minimal influence on the adsorption of cip or tc in contrast ca2 slightly decreased the adsorption of tc and cip nonetheless high cip and tc removal efficiencies were obtained in this study the competitive adsorption of other types of antibiotics was also considered the cip removal efficiency in the presence of ery or sdz was investigated as shown in fig 6e and f other types of antibiotics had very little effect on cip removal revealing the advantages of cip in competitive adsorption overall this method increases the adsorption stability of antibiotics and is a promising technique for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater 4 conclusion in this study a method for directly synthesizing ldhs in wastewater and simultaneously removing antibiotic contaminants was analyzed the cip tc molecule was sandwiched between the ldhs layers the unsuitable crystallization environment resulted in ldhs with an irregular plate like structure the removal of cip tc with different mg al ratios and stepwise experiments revealed the immobilization of the cip tc molecules in wastewater the removal process was controlled by positive charges as the ldhs structure was formed resulting in a higher utilization efficiency of the ldhs layer than that of other methods in the competitive adsorption experiment the contaminants were competitive in approaching the positive charges with cip having the dominant position the generalized langmuir model better described the removal process for the single and mixed systems indicating a certain number of adsorption sites on the ldhs layer however the adsorption sites were heterogeneous with different adsorption energies the calculated average energy of cip and tc was 18 68 and 16 68 j mmol 1 respectively which is consistent with that in the single system from the molecular simulation the interaction between cip and the ldhs layer had larger variational areas of electron density with a higher calculated bonding energy of 2 32 ev than that of tc 1 79 ev indicating the stronger interaction of cip with the ldhs layer moreover it was more accessible to occupy more adsorption sites on

12521,in this study to achieve high efficiency utilization of charges on layered double hydroxides ldhs a simple and direct synthesis method of ldhs in wastewater was designed for the removal of the contaminants ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline tc the obtained ldhs structure was characterized by xrd ft ir dls sem and tem the removal of cip tc using different mg al ratios and stepwise experiments was investigated with the formation of ldhs structures in wastewater the cip tc molecule was sandwiched between the ldhs layers and removal process was controlled by the positive charges resulting in a more efficient utilization of the ldhs layer than that of other methods the removal of cip was dominant during competitive removal the isothermal model of the generalized langmuir model obtained a good fit with the experimental data in the single and mixed systems indicating a specific number of adsorption sites on the ldhs layer and heterogeneous adsorption sites with different adsorption energies according to the site energy distribution theory the calculated average energies of cip and tc were 18 68 and 16 68 j mmol 1 respectively under competitive adsorption molecular simulation was conducted to explain the interaction between the cip tc molecule and ldhs layer based on the electron density and bonding energy moreover the effects of ph ion coexistence and antibiotic competition were investigated which revealed favorable adsorption stability parameters therefore this method for ldhs formation in wastewater allowed the efficient utilization of positive charges and provided a promising method for antibiotic removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords layered double hydroxides antibiotics molecular simulation site energy distribution wastewater treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction antibiotics belong to class of drugs used in treating human diseases and in animal husbandry 1 2 however 30 90 of antibiotic drugs are returned unchanged to the aquatic environment on account owing to their incomplete metabolism by animals and humans 3 5 in addition a large amount of antibiotics in aquatic environments are contributed by pharmaceutical industries hospitals animal farms and municipal waste 6 10 thus antibiotics have been detected in surface water shallow groundwater and even in drinking water systems which can accumulate to higher concentrations thereby posing a high ecological risk to the environment 11 13 the efficient removal of antibiotics from the environment is a serious concern that should be addressed to abate their negative effects 14 15 several methods have been explored for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater 16 among these adsorption has been widely studied because of its low cost high efficiency and wide applicability 17 adsorbents such as carbon based materials 18 23 metal organic frameworks 24 25 organic polymers 26 27 and clay 28 31 have been selected to remove antibiotics from wastewater layered double hydroxides ldhs have received wide attention as an adsorbent material with the advantage of low cost easy preparation stable structure environment friendly and excellent adsorptive properties 32 the common formula for ldhs is m2 1 xm3 x oh 2 x an x n mh2o where m2 and m3 are divalent and trivalent cations respectively and an is an exchangeable charge balancing interlayer anion 33 35 considerable effort has been devoted to the adsorption of antibiotic contaminants by ldhs 36 for example utilizing of positive charged ldhs layer and ion exchange property antibiotics could be adsorbed into the interlayer of ldhs and removed from wastewater 37 38 utilizing of the memory effect of ldhs layer calcined ldhs could be used to remove antibiotics from wastewater through the reconstruction of ldhs layers and regeneration of charges 39 40 these methods utilize the positive charges on the ldhs layer to immobilize contaminants 41 42 however these methods have the drawbacks of low utilization of positive charges exposure of internal charges and methodological complexity in this study a simple method for synthesizing ldhs directly in wastewater and simultaneous removal of antibiotic contaminants was designed and proposed ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline tc which are frequently used synthetic antibiotics with high activity against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria were selected for this study different ratios of mg2 and al3 were investigated and a stepwise removal test was performed characterization methods including x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir dynamic light scattering dls scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem were used to characterize the synthesized structure the removal performance was studied using isothermal experiments and the generalized langmuir model was used to describe the adsorption process the theory of site energy distribution was employed and the average energy of the adsorption sites was calculated and analyzed molecular simulation was performed to investigate the competitive adsorption mechanism based on the bonding energies and electron transfer between the antibiotics and ldhs in addition the effects of ph coexisting ions and other antibiotics were analyzed therefore this method offers a promising approach for the efficient utilization of positive charges on ldhs layers in antibiotic removal 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods all reagents used in this study

tetracyclines c22h24n2o8 hcl erythromycin c37h67no13 and sulfadiazine c10h10n4o2s were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co 2 2 individual removal experiment of tc and cip a solution 25 ml with 0 2 mmol mg no3 2 0 1 mmol al no3 3 and 0 6 mmol naoh solution 25 ml were simultaneously added dropwise into 50 ml wastewater the synthesized ldhs in wastewater was 17 7 mg according to ldhs formula under vigorous stirring at a fixed rate around one drop per second the final ph of the reaction system was almost neutral which is beneficial to water environment wastewater 50 ml containing different amounts 0 04 0 16 mmol of cip or tc was analyzed the mixture was fully agitated for 30 min without aging the suspension was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min the antibiotic concentration in the supernatant was measured the obtained solid was repeatedly washed and dried at 60 c denoted as ldh cip and ldh tc based on their antibiotic content cip and tc respectively to analyze the removal process the removal experiment of tc and cip was tested in detail the wastewater of 50 ml containing 0 12 mmol of cip or tc was used the solution was added step by step and each step included 2 ml naoh and 2 ml mg al solution the residuary concentration of cip or tc was measured after each step all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 competitive removal experiment of mixed tc and cip in the competitive removal experiment tc and cip mixed solution with the same amount of cip and tc was used the initial addition was between 0 08 and 0 32 mmol including 0 04 0 16 mmol cip and tc respectively the same experimental procedure as that in section 2 2 was followed the obtained sample was denoted as ldh mixed the residual cip and tc in mixed solution after treatment were tested respectively 2 4 analysis of the effects of ph and coexisting ions in the ph analysis 25 ml wastewater with 0 12 mmol cip or tc was used the procedure is similar to that in section 2 3 the ph of the final system was adjusted to 6 10 using naoh solution in the analysis of the coexisting ions 1 mmol l cation na k nh4 ca2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 ch3coo were added to the solution with 0 12 mmol cip or tc to test the removal efficiency sdz and ery antibiotics with the same concentration as that of cip or tc were mixed in the solution and the level of competitive adsorption for cip was detected the experimental process was the same as that used in section 2 3 2 5 characterization equilibrium concentrations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry agilent bruker usa the ldhs samples were characterized by xrd rigaku d max rc diffractometer with cu target kα ray λ 1 5418 ω and working voltage current of 40 kv 100 ma at a step interval of 0 02 in the 2θ range of 5 70 a cary 630 spectrometer was used for the ft ir characterization sem su1510 hitachi ltd japan was used to characterize the morphologies of the samples tem tecnai g2f 20 america at accelerating voltage of 200 kv to collect photomicrographs the particle size of the samples was analyzed by dynamic light scattering technique malvern zetasizer nano zs90 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ldh tc and ldh cip the ft ir spectra of the cip tc ldh cip ldh tc and ldhs samples were shown in fig 1b for the ldhs samples the peaks at approximately 3456 and 1631 cm 1 originate from the oh groups of the ldhs and interlayer water molecules respectively 43 in addition the peaks at approximately 1387 cm 1 were attributed to the no groups by the nitrate ions the absorption bands below 1000 cm 1 were attributed to m o which were characteristic peaks of ldhs 44 for ldh cip the peaks of the co and cc stretching vibrations appeared at approximately 1030 and 1605 cm 1 respectively 45 46 and the absorption bands at 1350 1100 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of cf 47 thus characteristic peaks of cip were observed in ldh cip suggesting the immobilization of cip molecules with ldhs similarly the bending vibration peaks of cn 900 650 cm 1 cc 1030 cm 1 and co 1605 cm 1 which were characteristic peaks of tc were noted in the ldh tc spectra indicating the successful immobilization of tc by ldhs 45 48 the particle size of ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc were tested and shown in fig s1 compared with ldhs 150 300 nm the size of ldh cip and ldh tc was 200 400 and 400 1500 nm respectively indicating that the existence of cip and tc in the forming process of ldhs increased the particle size the xrd patterns of the ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc samples were shown in fig 1c the xrd pattern of pristine ldhs consists of sharp symmetrical diffraction peaks indicating good crystallinity the d003 value was 7 54 å for ldh cip and ldh tc the position of the 003 diffraction peak of shifted to lower angles with a larger d003 value of approximately 13 71 and 14 36 å respectively this indicated the formation of the ldhs in wastewater thereby sandwiching the large cip tc molecules between the layers as well as enlarged interlayer spacing the sem and tem morphologies of ldhs ldh cip and ldh tc were shown in fig 2a l as shown in fig 2a d the morphology of ldhs displayed a layered structure and the lattice fringes were observed clearly in tem results in fig 2e i the morphology of ldh cip and ldh tc exhibited an irregular and stacked plate like structure and the lattice fringes were blurred indicating the existence of cip and tc was not conducive to the crystallization of ldhs structure besides after the formation of ldhs and removal of cip tc from the wastewater the system reached a neutral ph which was not suitable for the growth and crystallization of ldhs resulting in an irregular and non growing crystal structure 49 3 2 isothermal analysis variations in adsorption capacity with increased in cip and tc concentrations were investigated the results were shown in fig 3a and b the cip adsorption capacity of the newly formed ldhs increased with increasing initial concentration until reaching equilibrium the tc adsorption capacity exhibited a similar trend the isothermal model is ideal for exploring adsorption mechanisms to understand the relationship between the adsorption sites and contaminants 50 51 thus the langmuir eq 1 and freundlich eq 2 adsorption isotherm models were selected 52 54 1 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where c 0 mg l 1 is the initial antibiotic concentration c e mg l 1 is the antibiotic equilibrium concentration q e mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at the experimental equilibrium q m mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbents b is the equilibrium constant of the langmuir model and k f and n are the isothermal adsorption constants the langmuir model assumes that adsorption occurs on the surface of a monomolecular layer with identical and independent adsorption sites of the adsorbed particles 54 55 meanwhile the freundlich isotherm assumes multilayer adsorption over heterogeneous surfaces 51 55 according to the fitted experimental data in fig 3a and b and evaluation parameters in table s1 the adsorption capacities of ldh cip and ldh tc with different mg al ratios can be better described by the langmuir model hence the removal of cip tc by the formed ldhs was attributed to the monolayer adsorption with the adsorption immobilized at a finite number of definite adsorption sites only the sorption coefficients rl of cip and tc which were associated with the preferential degree of reaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate were in the range of 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 0 04 respectively suggesting the favorable sorption between cip tc on ldhs 53 55 the reaction with different mg al ratios exhibited a similar trend as that of the adsorption process in particular the adsorption capacity increased with increasing al content the positive charges on the ldhs layer were generated by the substitution of divalent metal ions with trivalent metal ions hence as the al ratio in the ldh layer increased more positive charges were produced with a higher charge density thereby providing more adsorption sites and a larger adsorption capacity for cip tc based on this a removal process was proposed and assessed with the addition of the mg al and naoh solutions ldh structures were continuously formed in wastewater and positive charges were gradually produced on the ldh layer the negative charge of the cip tc contaminant was attracted to the newly formed positive charge on the ldhs layer and combined with the layer to balance the charge therefore in the case of containing pollutants in wastewater the abundant positive charges on the ldhs layer could immobilize the contaminants with increasing adsorption capacity the increase in the cip tc concentration exceeded that of the formed positive charges in wastewater thereby inhibiting the increased adsorption capacity in the experiment with different mg al ratios when the added mg al solution with a higher proportion of al the formed ldhs layers possessed more positive charges and exhibited better removal capacity hence the removal of cip tc by the formation of ldhs in wastewater was controlled by positive charges which is consistent with the langmuir model to explore the relationship between cip tc and ldhs formation a stepwise experiment was conducted by testing the residual cip tc after the addition of a partial mg al and naoh solutions as shown in fig 3c the cip removal capacity increased rapidly with the dropwise addition of mg al and naoh solutions into the wastewater the removal capacity exhibited an approximately linear relationship with the amount of formed ldhs revealing the immobilization of a portion of the cip tc in wastewater with the formation of ldh structures the tc removal in the stepwise experiment exhibited a similar trend fig 3d these results indicate a close relationship between the cip tc molecules and newly formed ldh layers confirming the removal mechanism table 1 compared the cip and tc adsorption capacities of ldhs and other materials obtained in this study with those reported in previous papers compared with ldhs and other materials to remove cip and tc the adsorption capacities obtained by this method are significantly higher thus directly forming ldh structures in wastewater prompts the efficient utilization of the newly formed positive charges to directly immobilize cip tc and avoid the exposure of internal charges 3 3 characterization of ldh mixed in actual wastewater with antibiotics cip and tc contaminants usually coexist because of the mixed use of antibiotics 58 hence a competitive adsorption process by forming ldhs structures in mixed wastewater was assessed the characterization of samples from the mixed wastewater was shown in fig 4a d in the ft ir analysis fig 4a the curve of ldh mixed had characteristic cip and tc peaks revealing the successful combination of cip and tc molecules with ldhs in the xrd pattern of ldh mixed fig 4b characteristic peaks of ldhs were observed indicating the formation of ldhs structures in mixed wastewater the 003 diffraction peak of ldh mixed shifted to lower angles with a d003 value of 16 01 å which is larger than that of ldh cip 13 71 å and ldh tc 14 36 å this revealed simultaneous immobilization of cip and tc molecules in the ldhs interlayer which affected the layer spacing the sem morphology of the ldh mixed was also investigated whereby an irregular layered structure fig 4c and d was noted likely to that in single contaminant wastewater 3 4 competitive removal of cip and tc the removal efficiencies of cip and tc with different initial concentrations during the competitive removal by forming ldhs structures in mixed wastewater were tested a comparison of the cip and tc removal in the single and competitive systems was shown in fig 5c and d respectively under competitive adsorption the adsorption efficiency of tc was greatly affected by the presence of cip with an influence rate of approximately 30 compared with the single system the adsorption behavior of cip had lower influence with an influence rate of less than 10 these results indicated the competitiveness of cip and tc molecules in approaching the positive charges during the removal process with the formation of an ldhs layer in mixed wastewater furthermore cip demonstrated higher advantages in the competitive adsorption isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption of cip and tc in the mixed wastewater the results were shown in fig 5a and b compared with the freundlich model the langmuir model better fits the experimental data consistent with the single system although the langmuir model had a high fit coefficient in the single and mixed systems it could not adequately describe the adsorption process in particular the langmuir model assumes identical definite and equivalent adsorption sites on the adsorbent indicating that each cip tc adsorption on the ldhs layer has equal adsorption energies 38 59 however the positive charges on the edge surface or interior of the ldhs layer have different exposure and interaction with the contaminants which does not correspond with the assumption of the langmuir model therefore a generalized langmuir model with heterogeneity parameters was employed to further analyze the adsorption process in this study 24 59 the equation for the generalized langmuir model is as follows 3 q e q g 0 b g c e m 1 b g c e m n g m where qg 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity of the generalized isotherm m and ng are the heterogeneity parameters that affect the uniformity of the energy distribution and bg is a generalized form of the langmuir constant related to the temperature and adsorption energy the data fitting and correlation parameters were listed in table s1 in the single and mixed systems the generalized langmuir model had a higher fit coefficient r2 to the experimental data than that of the langmuir model for cip and tc this reveals the heterogeneous adsorption sites on the adsorbent which could be better described by the generalized langmuir model moreover the fitting of the generalized langmuir model indicated a certain number of adsorption sites on the ldhs layer and heterogeneous adsorption sites with different adsorption energies 60 hence the theory of site energy distribution was employed to further analyze the adsorption sites 3 5 theory of site energy distribution and molecular simulation the theory of site energy distribution explores the adsorption mechanism of the uneven adsorption energy of the adsorbents revealing the distribution function of the corresponding adsorption sites 60 the equation assumes that the total adsorption capacity of non uniform surface adsorbents on adsorbates q ce is given by the integral of the adsorption isotherm qh e ce multiplied by the energy distribution function f e at the local adsorption site with uniform energy 61 the formula used is as follows 4 q c e 0 q h e c e f e de the derivation process was discussed in our previous work 57 the site energy distribution function f e and average site energy μ e can be obtained as follows 5 f e n g q g 0 b g c s n rt exp n g e rt 1 b g c s exp e rt m 1 n g m 6 μ e rt m ln 1 b g c s m where c s is the solubility of the solute in a specific solution at absolute temperature t and r is the gas constant and e is the difference between the sorption energy at solute concentration c e and solubility c s fig 5g and h showed the relationship between the adsorption potential energy e of cip tc and equilibrium adsorption q e in the single and mixed systems with the increase of q e e continually decreased in a single system the cip and tc molecules were first adsorbed on the high energy adsorption site which then occupied the low energy adsorption site as the adsorption capacity increased in the mixed system the curves had a similar trend however the downward trend of tc was more drastic than that of cip these results indicated that the tc molecules in the mixed system were dramatically affected by cip in terms of occupying high energy adsorption sites the frequency distribution function curves for f e and e were shown in fig 5i and j respectively the average energy of cip and tc was 18 89 and 16 34 j mmol 1 in the single system and 18 68 and 16 68 j mmol 1 in the mixed system respectively revealing the higher average energy of cip than that of tc hence in the removal process the cip molecule occupied a large number of high energy adsorption sites on the newly formed ldhs layer with a dominant position in the competitive adsorption to explain the different average energies of cip and tc on the ldhs layer a molecular simulation was used to simulate the interaction and analyze the mechanism based on the electron density and binding energy the transfer of electron density is shown in fig 5e and f the electron rearrangement after immobilizing cip and tc on the ldhs layer can be observed through the color difference in which the yellow and blue regions represent the consumption and accumulation of electron density respectively compared to ldh tc ldh cip has larger variational areas and the carboxylate group in the cip molecule had a remarkable loss of electrons to the ldhs layer revealing that the positive charges on the ldhs layer preferred to obtain electrons from cip with a stronger interaction the bonding energies of cip and tc on the ldhs layer were calculated using the following formula 62 63 7 e e ldhs e cip tc e ldh cip tc where ecip tc eldhs and eldh cip tc are the bonding energies of cip tc ldhs and ldh cip ldh tc respectively the calculated bonding energies of cip and tc were 2 32 and 1 79 ev respectively the higher bonding energy of cip indicates its stronger interaction with the ldhs layer than tc hence during the competitive adsorption positive charges were formed in the ldhs layer which increased its accessibility to cip molecules and allowed them to obtain the dominant position in the competitive adsorption 3 6 effect of ph and coexisting ions for the removal of antibiotics ph is a vital factor that can influence the electrical properties of antibiotic molecules and ldhs 64 the removal of cip and tc over a ph range of 6 to 10 was studied as shown in fig 6a and b zeta potential of ldhs under different ph was also tested and shown in fig s2 cip existed in the solution in the form of cations zwitterions

12522,the consumption of products of animal origin pao has drastically increased in the last 50 years alongside animal by products residues generation increased as they were generated during pao processing rendering industries are the main route to add value to these residues leading to a higher amount of raw material that increases production and residue generation such as gaseous effluents and wastewater regarding rendering wastewater treatment literature is still scarce on treatments and valorisation processes in this context this paper is the first review and bibliometric analysis of rendering wastewater focusing on approaching treatment and valorisation processes proposed in the literature pointing out its gaps and future perspectives biological and physicochemical processes are approached by literature the majority of research papers addresses biological process meanwhile recent literature focus on physicochemical processes literature indicates that whereas different streams of wastewater are generated in the rendering industry the possibility of segregation plays a major role in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp configuration valorisation of the rendering wastewater can generate added value products such as fog rich sludge reprocessed as raw material protein and biogas besides treated water for irrigation hygiene and vapour generation therefore combining different steps of biological and physicochemical processes during the rendering wastewater treatment can enhance its efficiency enabling its valorisation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rendering industry rendering wastewater wastewater treatment wastewater valorisation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rendering industry is a vital branch for value aggregation on animal by products residue generated on products of animal origin pao industries eight billion animals are processed annually by pao industries worldwide leading to 340 million tons of pao per year three times more when compared to 50 years ago 1 however this number represents only the portion appropriated for human consumption 52 68 leaving behind an unsettling amount of animal by products from slaughter and meat processing which represents about 32 to 48 of the total weight of the processed animals 2 3 therefore allocation of this huge residue generation from pao requires alternative disposal strategies such as rendering plants despite having a green bias from its raw material the rendering activity also can generate environmental impacts due to the waste generated in the rendering processes this subject is scarcely approached by scientific literature especially in the context of wastewater with most of the published papers focusing on odour mitigation 4 plausible reasons for the lack of scientific material on the field can be related to unpleasant situations reported by stakeholders e g strong odours bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic and is usually located in remote regions and near to pao industries 5 7 therefore advancements are needed to evaluate possibilities around the rendering industry processes and its wastes the lack of reviews regarding the wastewater from the rendering industry also contributes to the smaller scientific outlook making it difficult for researchers to get in touch with this theme s status quo and further research lines enhancement rendering industries have distinct wastewater streams with a slightly different compositions according to the generation point overall it is composed of fats oils and greases fog total ts and volatile suspended solids vss and ammoniacal nitrogen presenting high total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod these characteristics make this type of wastewater a potential source of nutrients and energy recovery proteins and fats from animal tissues are the raw material of the rendering plants thus they can be found in the wastewater

composition is similar to slaughterhouses and other industries in the pao segment 11 12 such as pet food and frigorific industries a comparison of applied treatments and valorisation processes among these industries seems possible if the differences are considered like the greater concentration of proteins like collagen and fatty products fog resulting from the severe processing of animal tissue the wastewater treatment usually employed by rendering industries lacks on nutrient and energy recovery the state of art of processes used to treat this nutrient rich wastewater includes physicochemical approach e g dissolved air flotation requiring high operational costs and sludge generation 13 14 or biological processes that seek optimization and procedural feasibility however there is a lack of research on by product valorisation due to high investment operationalization or specific pre treatments 6 13 15 in this context this review aims to identify the current state of art on wastewater treatment valorisation and potential processes for the treatment and reuse of rendering industries liquid residue this is the first review to evaluate literature processes regarding this theme since no published study has ever presented this proposed strategy the subject s recent scientific literature was pointed out and deeply discussed in a systematic review and bibliometric analysis leading to preponderant aspects and future perspectives 2 bibliometric analysis state of art was evaluated through a systematic literature search with hybrid structure review framework fitting and trend analysis using bibliometrics 16 following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines regarding the systematic review step 17 document

segregated as research and review articles according to titles and abstracts review articles were considered for analysis and potential use in reference to the literature research articles were filtered by the eligibility criteria with full text analysis and further considered over the systematic review and bibliometric analysis only research articles in a range of 16 years from 2006 to 2022 were considered for state of art frameworks and discussion to establish the latest scenario on this branch articles before this date range were case studies applying biological processes being studied later in the proposed data range the inclusion criteria considered i articles that focused on wastewater ii articles where the origin of the wastewater was rendering industries attached or not to other industrial establishments and iii articles that studied pao industries wastewater not characterized as rendering plants according to the authors that did not have rendering related activities considering the case of attached rendering industries to other industrial establishments articles from the third criterion were not considered in the bibliometric analysis and systematic review being only addressed during discussions due to the similarity of the wastewater articles were excluded if i the focus was a solid waste or gaseous effluents ii the studied wastewater was mixed with streams from other industries affecting comparison due to wastewater composition iii the industry process only animal derivatives like dairy products due to the composition of the wastewater from these industries iv the article dealt with purely theoretical studies not proposing and presenting practical processes evaluation or v the article dealt with mathematical modelling based on data extracted solely from the literature 3 systematic review forty one research articles were eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria after screening fig 1 papers fitted to frameworks are shown in each section below considering the wastewater characteristics main purpose applied processes hypotheses and conclusions most studies unrelated to pao industries found over the searching process mentioned the rendering industry in their abstracts but did not study its wastewater only fourteen articles that cite a direct relationship with the rendering industry and present similar wastewater were selected for further discussion indexation issues were identified among the assessed articles mainly due to the misuse of terms to refer to the rendering industry such as the terms pet food and feed industry these issues were the leading reasons for full text analysis in the inclusion step in order to include papers that study the rendering wastewater but do not address this industry as a rendering plant like rendering plants attached to slaughterhouses the evolution of publications fig s 1 presented a small number of articles published from 1985 to 2000 8 papers with a gradual growth after 2003 reaching its peak in 2006 with 8 papers solely published in 2006 reaching a total of 22 papers a substantial decrease occurred until 2015 with only 07 papers published after 2017 a slight growth appeared adding up to 12 papers until 2022 altogether 41 papers were published in 50 years representing a small engagement on this subject however the growing publication tendency in recent years 2017 2022 suggests an increasing interest of researchers in proposing optimizing treatments for rendering wastewater the evolution of publications fig s 1 presented a small number of articles published from 1985 to 2000 8 papers with a gradual growth after 2003 reaching its peak in 2006 with 8 papers solely published in 2006 totalizing 22 papers a substantial decrease occurred until 2015 with only 07 papers published after 2017 a slight growth appeared adding up to 12 papers until 2022 altogether 41 papers were published in 50 years representing a small engagement on this subject however the growing publication tendency in recent years 2017 2022 suggests an increasing interest of researchers in proposing optimizing treatments for rendering wastewater this lack of publications might be enhanced through strategies related to publication growth namely review articles which are a gap in this field thus this review fills a gap in this field as it analyses what has been studied pointing out future perspectives rendering industries have several streams fig 2 and the possibility of segregation after their generation might interfere with whether valorisation or treatment process will be applied streams that can be separated from others seem more fittable to valorisation processes enabling fog and proteins recovery due to structural upkeeping of species and less contamination by other compounds such as streams 2 to 7 in fig 2 9 14 18 19 the studies addressed herein were fitted to frameworks main purpose of the study process employed main hypothesis and conclusions and stated as biological and physicochemical processes biological processes were the most cited including pre treatments and secondary treatments the following topics consider that all of these research papers investigated established biological processes lacking in proposing recent and innovative research e g bioelectrochemical processes on the other hand physicochemical processes represented the most recent research covering primary and tertiary treatments separation processes were the main subjects of these papers with economic feasibility against current processes operationalization and by products valorization with a real scale application as topics yet to be studied e g membranes permeate and condensate exhausted adsorbent in both cases favorable processes applied to similar wastewater were cited as potential future research in the field a general guiding scheme is presented in fig 3 considering all cited treatment possibilities and stream variation according to fig 2 4 biological processes biological processes were the first approaches to rendering wastewater treatment and are the most widely studied fig 4 the authors focused on optimization to remove organic material from wastewater and applied it as a secondary treatment table 1 however recent publications are mainly focused on primary and tertiary treatments creating a gap around biological processes optimization and assessment of novelty processes 4 1 anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion ad fig 4 a is a biological process where organic matter is broken down producing valuable by products i e biogas the mechanism of this process is composed of four steps i hydrolysis ii acidogenesis iii acetogenesis and iv methanogenesis 20 anaerobic digestion is usually applied to similar wastewater like slaughterhouses 21 as well as slaughterhouses wastewater the rendering wastewater composition presents key substrates to anaerobic digestion namely fats and proteins mainly from streams 2 to 7 and 9 in fig 2 woon and othman 22 assessed the possibility of ad in rendering raw wastewater as well as other solid streams in the industry e g dissolved air flotation sludge the authors stated that the rendering wastewater has a high potential to be valorised with ad mainly due to biogas production fog rich wastewater is a feasible supply to biogas production as stated by diamantis et al 23 it was estimated that biogas production could reach 1000 m3 per ton of fog in ad however studies on economic feasibility considering operational expenses compared to other processes are yet to be covered apart from solids content removed amid primary treatment fog is one of the main concerns in this case due to low solubility through the process decreasing digestion efficiency and leading to foaming and pipe clogging 23 24 along with rendering wastewater ad the most unsettling factor is inhibition the fog and protein content itself plays a determining role in the process efficiency triglycerides and proteins naturally occurring in the wastewater and by products generated such as volatile free acids are some of the concerns that require further investigation 22 25 potential pre treatments are proposed in order to decrease fog inhibition i saponification with a simple design but chemically costly and potential inhibition with long chain fatty acid lcfa salts generated ii emulsification generating non inhibition substrates yet requiring a high amount of electricity and specific systems iii surfactant addition enabling other wastes valorisation as biosurfactants i e bile and increasing fog solubility which also leads to foaming issues iv thermal processing enhancing initial hydrolysis in ad but highly electric energy consumption and v enzymatic hydrolysis breaking inhibitors molecules into soluble and digestible substrates but presenting high operational costs due to the enzyme application 23 26 being a consolidated method ad shows potential application to value rendering wastewater biomethanation of this wastewater is a promising fact to the fog content usually considered a problem in the course of secondary treatment even though it is already a widely studied process biogas production efficiency is a trending topic opening doors for novelty in pre treatments 4 2 aerobic digestion aerobic digestion fig 4 b is used to degrade organic material in an aerated medium when compared to ad it presents smaller capital costs but also generates a huge amount of sludge poor in dewaterability requires a high supply of oxygen is usually influenced by the environment e g temperature and lacks in generating valuable by products 27 a small number of papers 07 studied aerobic digestion in rendering wastewater usually coupled with membrane bioreactors or along nitrification and denitrification as discussed in the following topics topics 4 3 and 4 5 an aerobic digestion process with activated sludge solely applied after raw wastewater screening and dissolved air flotation was a case study brought by basuvaraj et al 28 the authors demonstrated that the main issue related to the process was the floc formation which was controlled after aeration and external substrate dosage it is also highlighted that the solids retained within the generated sludge are reprocessed by the industry as raw material at this point a potential by product within aerobic digestion application arises however studies on composition and quality parameters e g acidity and peroxide indexes are needed to evaluate reprocessing feasibility 4 3 nitrogen removal processes the typical ammoniacal nitrogen content in rendering wastewater 100 to 800 mg l leads wastewater treatment plants wwtp to seek efficient nitrogen removal among biological processes nitrification and denitrification nad fig 4 c are the most common ones with nad ammoniacal nitrogen removal occurs through aerobic and anoxic phases where ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and then nitrate further reduced to molecular nitrogen respectively 29 30 auterská and novák 31 compared nad in four rendering industries within three years all the systems were coupled with activated sludge after primary treatment the main issues were viscous and filamentous bulking and ammonium and nitrate inhibition shortage of suspended material and poor nutritional content e g phosphorus magnesium molybdenum iron retained in primary treatment led to these issues as low quality sludge formation and sedimentation performance occurred sludge formation was controlled through micronutrient dosage being enhanced by ph control and dosage of external carbon source after system stabilization up to 95 nitrogen and 97 cod were removed however at higher nitrogen content 200 ppm as exposed by silveira et al 29 typical nad processes tend to present low efficiency in this scenario nitrification occurs partially and a substantial amount of ammonia is left behind based on this the authors proposed nitrification coupled with the anammox process fig 4 d where ammonium is partially oxidized to nitrite and then both species are converted to diatomic nitrogen n2 by anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria nitrogen species stoichiometry was the main exposed challenge being a future topic of study around specific conditions for nitrogen species content control decreasing costs and labour related to external nitrogen species dosage 4 4 bioelectrochemical processes bioelectrochemical processes bep aim to generate electricity and chemicals e g h2 along wastewater treatment this product generation occurs in reactors with different configurations depending on their goal including microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs 32 their applicability is related to the substrate present in the wastewater the fog in rendering wastewater covers this requirement being a precursor of lcfa converted to small chain fatty acids scfa a carbon source to anode respiring bacteria 33 xie et al 33 approached the first study regarding this topic the high fat content led to acetate production under anaerobic conditions which is consumed for electric energy production over an 80 day batch cycle 34 3 of the cod was converted into electric energy the main issue was lcfa inhibition to scfa conversion as shown by previous studies topic 4 6 future research may deal with this problem by employing enzymatic pre treatments to hydrolyse these species into scfa enhancing microbial activity 25 the novelty of bep mainly for rendering wastewater enables huge possibilities to be studied apart from the enzymatic pre treatment cited above other gaps to be filled permeate the real scale implementation of bep cost comparison considering the generated electricity feedback and the optimal way to couple bep cells in the already structured wwtp 4 5 membrane bioreactors aerobic digestion as other cited processes like nad can be coupled with other techniques to enhance organic material and nutrient removal an increasing system following this trend is membrane bioreactor mbr fig 4 e mbr consists of an aerated bioreactor coupled with membrane filtration at different calibres its application has been widely increasing in the last 30 years 34 in rendering wastewater mbrs studies are still scarce acharya et al 35 37 presented high cod and nitrogen removal 98 and 99 8 respectively with mbr coupled with nad cod and solids concentration temperature and retention time influence the process regulating the biological process and mass transfer flux 38 to scale up and analyse its feasibility apart from aerobic like conditions already mentioned lifetime and fouling on membranes need to be inspected as well as cheaper membrane materials and their influence on the mass transfer lifetime essays may predict whether coupling these steps may be positive other than biological and separation processing separately 4 6 enzymatic hydrolysis enzymatic hydrolysis fig 4 f is a potential biological alternative to pre treat wastewater which contain compounds that can be hydrolysed into molecules with higher biodegradability characteristics 24 39 hydrolytic enzymes can be used in wide applications one of them is lipolytic activity when fog content is a major concern as stated on topic 4 1 jeganathan et al 39 41 presented the first and only approaches to enzymatic pre treatment of rendering wastewater immobilized lipase was applied through the process considering its recovery potential evaluated at 65 with 70 of remaining enzyme activity after the first cycle fog conversion into lcfa was 50 in batch essays reaching 64 with continuous application along with fog cod removal was similar 65 pre treating resulted in an even more efficient ad reaching 0 46 lch4 gcod 18 higher than the raw wastewater 0 39 lch4 gcod 39 however as proposed by the authors further studies should address the optimization of the experimental condition including treatment of rendering wastewater with different enzymes reactor designs number of cycles until enzyme activity becomes unfeasible active site competition by medium inhibitors and without dilution whereas the cited papers diluted it at 5 to 10 by volume within this subject industrial enzymatic hydrolysis pre treatment implementation must consider i enzyme type where lipases seem to be the most applicable ones to hydrolyse the majority of fog content ii enzyme origin being commercial or produced iii enzyme availability to supply all the needed amount in the pre treatment iv operationalization whether this process will employ free or immobilized enzymes v interaction between fog and the catalyst beads if immobilized and iv operational costs comparing its feasibility among commonly employed processes 4 7 novel biological processes biological processes are a great alternative for rendering wastewater processing mainly for its valorisation biogas electricity stable organic sludge and chemical compounds are a few of the products with added value having a positive impact on the environment therefore as stated by the authors cited herein biological treatment of rendering wastewater is a crucial step between primary and tertiary treatments due to its composition the lack of studies on novel biological processes provides opportunities to be tackled with future research in this time gap from the 2006 peak of publication to 2022 new technologies for biological processes were developed however they were not applied to rendering wastewater different configurations of ad bioreactors such as anaerobic filters baffled reactors up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor anaerobic contactor reactor and anaerobic ponds were successfully and largely employed in similar wastewater 42 43 thus ad applied to rendering wastewater considering optimizing its parameters to the real scale application and comparing each process could provide enhancements in this field aerobic systems apart from mbrs are also viable options for rendering wastewater recently biofilm reactors namely moving bed biofilm reactor have been applied to minimize space aeration costs and medium influence intermittent sequencing batch reactor are also a viable alternative also presenting a high nitrogen removal application of both processes in similar wastewater approaches possibilities around its use in rendering wastewater treatment 42 5 physicochemical processes physicochemical processes are the most recent published articles on this subject when compared to biological processes fig 5 they can be used in different steps of wastewater treatment primary for ammoniacal nitrogen recovery 10 44 45 fat and protein recovery 9 18 19 46 47 and high solid content removal 48 52 and tertiary for higher removal of stubborn components and disinfection through filtration 47 49 51 52 or oxidation 44 table 2 5 1 flotation flotation fig 5 a is a separation technique applied as a preliminary treatment step to high solid content wastewater 53 even though its main idea is the removal of solids it can be applied to recover material of interest as set about by zak and pawlak 46 who proposed the recovery of fat and protein from a rendering industry wastewater however reprocessing the generated sludge in the rendering industry depends on the flotation chemicals toxicity and their impact on the structure of the recovered nutrients zak and pawlak 46 studied the application of a double chamber flotation system applying an air saturated medium this medium enhances the same mechanism of a dissolved air flotation system commonly applied in the rendering industry which is reshaped to enable the recovery of fat and protein in various stages 45 53 this restructuration led the authors to find an 85 recovery of fat content in the wastewater presenting a maximum content of 2 3 of protein even though the recovered products might present composition unsuitable to be reprocessed as raw material such as high acidity and peroxide index as shown by the authors acidity and peroxide index related to the fat content respectively were between 9 5 and 16 3 mgkoh g and 2 4 to 5 8 meq kg rising to 48 6 mgkoh g and 23 meq kg during temperature varying from 25 to 30 c and operational time between 12 and 18 h these situations might turn the generated product unfeasible as raw material due to the instability of the cited parameters which might interfere with the final product of the industry along with acidity and peroxide indexes fat constituents are essential parameters to consider in the availability of reprocessing and its implementation such as the storage space and maximum operation time oxidation due to the high pressure medium tends to occur with air flotation processes degrading fat and protein quality 45 this oxidation may be one of the possibilities that led the acidity and peroxide index to rise between longer operational periods as shown flotation is a viable option for the rendering industry wastewater high efficiency removal of solids makes it more feasible for wastewater to be treated on subsequent processes for organic material and nutrient removal the retained solids can be disposed of as sludge or valorised for reprocessing as raw material to the rendering plant if composition and toxicity are assessed 5 2 coagulation and flocculation coagulation and flocculation cf processes fig 5 b are commonly applied in wastewater treatment as a primary step to decrease the high content of suspended solids firstly coagulants are applied to the wastewater to neutralize particle charges and further flocculant addition enhances particles binding into flocs formed flocs are settled and separated by gravity racar et al 49 52 assessed cf as an alternative to the high solids content removal to decrease fouling within membrane separation racar et al 52 presented fouling decreasing from 62 5 to 3 2 in the posterior membrane treatment mainly due to the high removal of turbidity total carbon 56 1 and doc 66 4 that occurred after cf application racar et al 49 obtained a 50 to 95 fouling reduction through the removal of solids directly influencing the removal of turbidity 96 and total carbon 75 for both studies raw wastewater without cf showed a greater tendency of fouling in the subsequent filtration steps fouling reduction differences are related to the studied membrane scales with lower foul in ultrafiltration against nanofiltration as well as the optimization of coagulant and flocculant dosage studied by these papers cf operationalization also requires extensive training of operators due to strict dosage and ph requirements for a stable and functioning process 50 54 chemical coagulants and flocculants usually lead to a large amount of sludge generation after solid retention sludge filtration proposals are present in the literature such as the use of a sand filter by racar et al 52 but the retained sludge destination is still a gap in the literature in the case of rendering plants alike discussed on flotation the retained solids by cf might be available with natural coagulants and flocculants application as demonstrated by bahrodin et al 55 these compounds lead to a higher retention efficiency and lower sludge generation its application is a potential study bias for the feasibility of the proposed process requiring an assessment of these products availability and optimized parameters when applied to the rendering wastewater therefore cf presents high suspended solids retention influencing turbidity and carbon removal the resulting wastewater provides further treatment approaches that usually lead to smaller efficiency with raw wastewater the amount of sludge generated can be decreased with novel coagulants and flocculants which also provides a potential rich nutrient material to be reprocessed along with the rendering plant 5 3 electrochemical processes literature tackles electrochemical processes as treatments for wastewater valorisation through interest compounds recovery the electrochemical mechanism is based on chemical reactions caused by an electrical current application the applied current enhances reactions solely caused by chemical agents on ordinary treatments leading to novel processes based on their principles like electrocoagulation electroflotation ecf electrolytic metal deposition electrochemical precipitation and emulsion splitting electrolysis 56 58 since chemical agents are no longer needed reprocessing the recovered material might as well be an option 59 ecf fig 5 c for rendering wastewater treatment was proposed by xie et al 50 current density stirring and sedimentation time turned out as the main parameters for higher efficiency the control of fatty acids profile throughout the treatment showed feasible characteristics to reprocess the recovered fat in the rendering plant as raw material in line with the discussion in topic 5 1 reprocessing also requires further analysis acidity index is a major parameter in this case which will dictate its dosage as a raw material and degradability related to shelf life within storage time until its application further feasibility studies comparing similar processes with chemical agents i e cf might present the advantages of the electrochemical approach with fewer costs related to chemical agents more favorable sludge to be reprocessed into the rendering plant as raw material and high performance of treatment such as cod removal 60 61 electrochemical process can also be applied to recover ammoniacal nitrogen as assessed by xie and popat 45 employing electrochemical stripping fig 5 d smaller energy demand occurs from the electrochemical perspective when compared to ordinary stripping 62 in this case stripping was applied as a tertiary step after biological treatment cell configuration cathodic ph and current density played important roles in the process reaching up to 99 ammoniacal nitrogen recovery as ammonia apart from these parameters the correct functioning of this structure is dependent on the wastewater due to its composition different feeding strategies may be needed as proposed by the authors to prevent cl2 formation from the high presence of cl in the treated wastewater the cited characteristics represent the versatility of electrochemical processes both in primary and tertiary treatments low costs are considered to be taken due to chemical agents ecf and energy demand electrochemical stripping but the comparison between the ordinary and proposed processes is yet to be studied in rendering wastewater along with it pilot and real scale implementation are still needed to be covered by these processes evaluating its costs applicability and operationalization considering the high loads of wastewater generated daily 63 5 4 membranes membrane technologies fig 5 e are separation processes based on pressure thermal electric or concentration driven forces membranes are usually applied as tertiary treatment removing recalcitrant contaminants from previously treated wastewater 64 its application in rendering wastewater treatment has been increasing in the literature in the past 6 years generating aggregated value products from the condensate and water reclamation with the resulting permeate however its application still faces issues such as membrane pores fouling decreasing mass transfer and process efficiency 9 48 zhou et al 47 brought up the first outlook with membranes on nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes the membranes were evaluated on direct and crossflow modes to determine whether configuration results as the most cost efficient alternative although fitting results occurred on both configurations the direct flow appears to be the less expensive and easiest of operationalization both processes presented high tds e cod reduction reaching up to 98 and 98 for nanofiltration and 91 and 95 for reverse osmosis respectively reverse osmosis resulted in higher purity of permeate due to its permeability the authors also compared ultrafiltration as a primary treatment for the high solids content removal with the existing dissolved air flotation system reaching a 62 cheaper operation racar et al 48 related the problem of membrane fouling in their studies proposing cf 49 52 and larger calibre membranes 48 51 as pre treatments to reduce the solids content responsible for the decline in membrane efficiency the authors propose membrane separation as a tertiary solution after secondary treatment to remove remaining contaminants e g nitrogen and chlorine species all presented cases demonstrated high removal of turbidity total carbon and solids content decreasing fouling in the tertiary membrane treatment among the pre treatments proposed by the authors cf results in an appropriate permeate for ultrafiltration generating effluent suitable for soil irrigation and the own rendering plant cleaning 49 52 while the pre treatment directly with ultrafiltration generates a permeate with fewer solids suitable for posterior nanofiltration and reverse osmosis treatment with permeate applicable to steam generation 48 51 mostafa et al 18 and muster slawitsch et al 9 expose the gap around physical processes focused on compounds recovery from wastewater valuing the condensate apart from just treating the wastewater the composition of the rendering wastewater was the main considered parameter the lower temperature achieved higher permeate quality with a smaller mass transfer of species e g volatile free fatty acids through the membrane fouling was mainly formed by proteins and their hydrolysed products both researchers showed that polyurethane coated polytetrafluoroethylene membranes resulted in a less fouling tendency with a smaller mass transfer rate when compared to the non coated membrane therefore the studies proved that membrane composition is linked directly with the process efficiency with different materials and fouling removal costs being future trending topics unlike other membrane studies mostafa et al 18 and muster slawitsch et al 9 proposed a promising strategy for the reuse of a specific wastewater stream from the rendering plant the condensate from the drying process stream 7 in fig 2 known as sticky water this stream is usually reclaimed with evaporation an ordinary system already applied with equipment from specialized brands in the rendering branch 65 66 the resulting condensate is a protein and fat rich liquid available for gradual reprocess by the rendering industry directly into the drying equipment membrane separation of this stream generated a higher solid content condensate than the usual generated with the mentioned evaporation equipment however higher solids concentration solids present issues with pipe encrustation and line clogging with reprocessing strategies and dosage yet to be studied 67 the cost comparison of membranes and evaporation processes to sticky water reclamation is brought by zhou and husson 19 studying forward and reverse osmosis the membrane like system reaches a higher concentration capacity up to 45 than evaporation 23 1 costing 5 3 of its total value for sticky water recovery protein denaturation and fat hydrolysis are the primary factors for reprocessing feasibility 68 minimal non standard composition such as acidity from the condensate fat oxidation may have a negative influence on the process therefore studies about its composition and existing degradation still need to be assessed however the membrane s low operational temperature 75 c is lower than the practised on evaporation 130 c bringing the possibility of a lower thermal impact on these issues zhou and husson 19 recently brennan et al 14 presented membrane application to valorise the same condensate stream stream 7 in fig 2 collected after the usual evaporation process focusing on ammoniacal nitrogen recovery membrane composition played a key role where ptfe membrane was more fittable due to higher efficiency and pp membrane led to a higher wetting tendency up to 64 of ammoniacal nitrogen was recovered as ammonium sulphate potential fertilizer that generates an income through the wastewater to the industry which can beat up the costs of the processes considered to be 45 higher than the actual employed aerobic digestion treatment the wastewater stream and its composition demonstrated the applicability of each process plants with combined streams were usually suitable for wastewater treatment and permeate reclamation for less noble applications including cleaning steam generation and irrigation after microorganisms and remaining prions evaluation 44 when more valuable streams are available in the case of the cited sticky water membrane technology is usually applied to add value to the condensate in this case coupling the proposed processes above can also be an alternative to evaluate and ease the high load of wastewater to be treated as proposed in fig s 2 the wastewater stream and its composition demonstrated the applicability of each process plants with combined streams were usually suitable for wastewater treatment and permeate reclamation for less noble applications including cleaning steam generation and irrigation after microorganisms and remaining prions evaluation 44 when more valuable streams are available in the case of the cited sticky water membrane technology is usually applied to add value to the condensate in this case coupling the proposed processes above can also be an alternative to evaluate and ease the high load of wastewater to be treated as proposed in fig s 2 thus the chosen method will be related according to the wastewater stream to be treated and the availability of its segregation as well as to issues involving the application of the generated products e g sticky water volume and its conservation availability of rural areas for irrigation 5 5 novel physicochemical processes according to the papers cited herein physicochemical processes are the most approached treatments in recent years this contemporary interest leads to allow the application of novel processes wastewater valorisation still needs to be considered among these processes mainly focusing on value aggregation of by products coupling these processes in between and to biological ones seems to be a prominent way to the valorisation objective among the separation processes adsorption has a potential field of study as proposed by verbeek et al 10 proteins were recovered with bentonite dosage the high load of ammoniacal nitrogen in rendering wastewater could also be studied for its potential recovery one key stream to be analysed would be the condensate generated after evaporation membrane for sticky water concentration after exhaustion the nutrient rich adsorbent could be assessed to dispose it as fertilizer or be treated for desorption to ammoniacal nitrogen recovery and commercialization 69 in the electrochemical field a huge number of possibilities are yet to be studied besides ecf and electrochemical stripping such as electrochemical oxidation for tertiary treatment 70 and electrolysis as a primary step 71 both successfully applied to slaughterhouse wastewater a research gap was also identified around post treatment processes focusing mainly on microorganism removal and prions deactivation as proposed by ding et al 44 advanced oxidation processes aops are potential applications on this subject as ozonation was studied by the author the rapid increase in aops studies provides a prosperous scenario to assess these techniques for rendering wastewater as stated in similar wastewater some trending aops are ultraviolet peroxidation ultrasound photo fenton electro fenton and couplings of these as matter of fact some of these processes also present toc cod and turbidity removal showing a potential replacement for tertiary processes 70 72 6 future research rendering industry future perspectives overpass pre treatment primary secondary tertiary and post treatment steps and their needs in order to treat and value this wastewater primary and pre treatments studies need to elucidate the implementation and valorisation of segregated streams before the general mixing solids content retained within this step must be evaluated according to its composition for reprocessing or external applications secondary treatments and future enhancements are related to valorisation processes recovering compounds of interest and generating value aggregated by products tertiary and post treatments studies need to propose efficient and sludge free ways to nutrient recovery microorganism removal and prion inactivation unsettling topics to be studied through these processes are mainly related to i real scale and long term operations ii efficiency during peaks in the wastewater composition iii generated by products composition degradability and storing until reprocess i e fog sludge sticky water and iv destination of the cited generated by products when not partially or entirely reprocessed e g excess of fog sludge high acidity index of sticky water determining storage conditions or subsequent treatment to avoid problems related to degradability of the material within nitrogen removal processes e g nitrification and denitrification stopping inhibitors formation and parameter optimization to decrease external feeding points are to be covered valorisation of the wastewater through biological processes such as microbial fuel cell and anaerobic digestion showed its potential application with issues yet to be studied such as inhibitors e g long chain fatty acids proteins pre treatment processes like enzymatic hydrolysis arise as a possibility evaluating enzyme type origin dosage combination and immobilization as well as its impact on by products generated in further treatment steps e g biogas processes that propose fats and proteins recovery still need to cover the generated product degradability and optimal dosage if used as raw material these processes also need to consider whether all the streams of wastewater are viable for this recovery or only non contaminated wastewater streams 2 to 7 in fig 2 the viability of the generated products should rely on physicochemical composition such as acidity and peroxide index and the current legislation from where the rendering industry is allocated previous and primary physicochemical treatments such as flotation and c f are studied to remove solids also reducing other parameters like organic load and turbidity its operation however requires the analysis of different aspects i greener bias concerning the coagulant and flocculant applied with the possibility of process optimization through coagulants of natural origin that present greater efficiency and lower sludge generation when compared to commonly used chemical coagulants and ii composition of the retained solids including fats and proteins to evaluate the best parameters and coagulant flocculant products that capture this material without degrading and oxidizing its structure allowing its reprocessing physical processes based on membrane separation i e filtration reverse osmosis distillation presented membrane fouling as the major obstacle the same issue is also applicable to systems operating with biological membrane reactors different aspects are emerged to be considered i the study of different compositions of membranes with materials and layers that reduce the formation of fouling layers increasing the operational time until the critical decrease in mass transfer ii assessing the cleaning operation time which may lead to more than one equipment to supply the continuous batches of the rendering activity and iii in the case of reprocessing the concentrate gaps in the literature have to evaluate permeate and sludge reprocessing gaps to be covered are i the ideal dosage to avoid drastic compositional changes in the main rendered product and pipe incrustation due to the high level of solids ii the influence of this material on the existing lines and the materials that compose them iii adapting the main rendering process and existing equipment to receive this material iv and the characterization of the compounds that compose it mainly the proteins which can be denatured throughout the process and make the reprocess of condensate unfeasible overall articles approaching the scale up of the cited processes are a must have for the next steps on rendering wastewater treatment alongside the study of novel processes scaling up analysis might enrich the literature on the topic by enabling more reliable modelling and cost analysis the following are the supplementary data

12522,the consumption of products of animal origin pao has drastically increased in the last 50 years alongside animal by products residues generation increased as they were generated during pao processing rendering industries are the main route to add value to these residues leading to a higher amount of raw material that increases production and residue generation such as gaseous effluents and wastewater regarding rendering wastewater treatment literature is still scarce on treatments and valorisation processes in this context this paper is the first review and bibliometric analysis of rendering wastewater focusing on approaching treatment and valorisation processes proposed in the literature pointing out its gaps and future perspectives biological and physicochemical processes are approached by literature the majority of research papers addresses biological process meanwhile recent literature focus on physicochemical processes literature indicates that whereas different streams of wastewater are generated in the rendering industry the possibility of segregation plays a major role in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp configuration valorisation of the rendering wastewater can generate added value products such as fog rich sludge reprocessed as raw material protein and biogas besides treated water for irrigation hygiene and vapour generation therefore combining different steps of biological and physicochemical processes during the rendering wastewater treatment can enhance its efficiency enabling its valorisation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rendering industry rendering wastewater wastewater treatment wastewater valorisation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rendering industry is a vital branch for value aggregation on animal by products residue generated on products of animal origin pao industries eight billion animals are processed annually by pao industries worldwide leading to 340 million tons of pao per year three times more when compared to 50 years ago 1 however this number represents only the portion appropriated for human consumption 52 68 leaving behind an unsettling amount of animal by products from slaughter and meat processing which represents about 32 to 48 of the total weight of the processed animals 2 3 therefore allocation of this huge residue generation from pao requires alternative disposal strategies such as rendering plants despite having a green bias from its raw material the rendering activity also can generate environmental impacts due to the waste generated in the rendering processes this subject is scarcely approached by scientific literature especially in the context of wastewater with most of the published papers focusing on odour mitigation 4 plausible reasons for the lack of scientific material on the field can be related to unpleasant situations reported by stakeholders e g strong odours bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic and is usually located in remote regions and near to pao industries 5 7 therefore advancements are needed to evaluate possibilities around the rendering industry processes and its wastes the lack of reviews regarding the wastewater from the rendering industry also contributes to the smaller scientific outlook making it difficult for researchers to get in touch with this theme s status quo and further research lines enhancement rendering industries have distinct wastewater streams with a slightly different compositions according to the generation point overall it is composed of fats oils and greases fog total ts and volatile suspended solids vss and ammoniacal nitrogen presenting high total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod these characteristics make this type of wastewater a potential source of nutrients and energy recovery proteins and fats from animal tissues are the raw material of the rendering plants thus they can be found in the wastewater slightly variations might occur regarding the raw material i freshness ii animal of origin e g poultry cattle fish or swine and iii processed part e g viscera blood bones 8 10 rendering wastewater composition is similar to slaughterhouses and other industries in the pao segment 11 12 such as pet food and frigorific industries a comparison of applied treatments and valorisation processes among these industries seems possible if the differences are considered like the greater concentration of proteins like collagen and fatty products fog resulting from the severe processing of animal tissue the wastewater treatment usually employed by rendering industries lacks on nutrient and energy recovery the state of art of processes used to treat this nutrient rich wastewater includes physicochemical approach e g dissolved air flotation requiring high operational costs and sludge generation 13 14 or biological processes that seek optimization and procedural feasibility however there is a lack of research on by product valorisation due to high investment operationalization or specific pre treatments 6 13 15 in this context this review aims to identify the current state of art on wastewater treatment valorisation and potential processes for the treatment and reuse of rendering industries liquid residue this is the first review to evaluate literature processes regarding this theme since no published study has ever presented this proposed strategy the subject s recent scientific literature was pointed out and deeply discussed in a systematic review and bibliometric analysis leading to preponderant aspects and future perspectives 2 bibliometric analysis state of art was evaluated through a systematic literature search with hybrid structure review framework fitting and trend analysis using bibliometrics 16 following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines regarding the systematic review step 17 document gathering was conducted from march 2022 to june 2022 on the scopus and web of science databases chosen accordingly to their representativeness for the proposed theme availability of document searching and exporting tools the search terms were applied along boolean operators as follows wastewater or effluent and rendering or feed industr or pet food or animal by product searched within title abstract and keywords a group of words that refer to the matrix of interest was considered as follows wastewater and the second group of words that refer to the industry of interest considering the different terms that appear for the rendering industry in the literature the documents were collected in a range of 50 years 1972 to 2022 documents were exported to mendeley reference management software and separated according to document type following the database tags i e articles books and book chapters and others articles were grouped into a single database duplicates were excluded and segregated as research and review articles according to titles and abstracts review articles were considered for analysis and potential use in reference to the literature research articles were filtered by the eligibility criteria with full text analysis and further considered over the systematic review and bibliometric analysis only research articles in a range of 16 years from 2006 to 2022 were considered for state of art frameworks and discussion to establish the latest scenario on this branch articles before this date range were case studies applying biological processes being studied later in the proposed data range the inclusion criteria considered i articles that focused on wastewater ii articles where the origin of the wastewater was rendering industries attached or not to other industrial establishments and iii articles that studied pao industries wastewater not characterized as rendering plants according to the authors that did not have rendering related activities considering the case of attached rendering industries to other industrial establishments articles from the third criterion were not considered in the bibliometric analysis and systematic review being only addressed during discussions due to the similarity of the wastewater articles were excluded if i the focus was a solid waste or gaseous effluents ii the studied wastewater was mixed with streams from other industries affecting comparison due to wastewater composition iii the industry process only animal derivatives like dairy products due to the composition of the wastewater from these industries iv the article dealt with purely theoretical studies not proposing and presenting practical processes evaluation or v the article dealt with mathematical modelling based on data extracted solely from the literature 3 systematic review forty one research articles were eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria after screening fig 1 papers fitted to frameworks are shown in each section below considering the wastewater characteristics main purpose applied processes hypotheses and conclusions most studies unrelated to pao industries found over the searching process mentioned the rendering industry in their abstracts but did not study its wastewater only fourteen articles that cite a direct relationship with the rendering industry and present similar wastewater were selected for further discussion indexation issues were identified among the assessed articles mainly due to the misuse of terms to refer to the rendering industry such as the terms pet food and feed industry these issues were the leading reasons for full text analysis in the inclusion step in order to include papers that study the rendering wastewater but do not address this industry as a rendering plant like rendering plants attached to slaughterhouses the evolution of publications fig s 1 presented a small number of articles published from 1985 to 2000 8 papers with a gradual growth after 2003 reaching its peak in 2006 with 8 papers solely published in 2006 reaching a total of 22 papers a substantial decrease occurred until 2015 with only 07 papers published after 2017 a slight growth appeared adding up to 12 papers until 2022 altogether 41 papers were published in 50 years representing a small engagement on this subject however the growing publication tendency in recent years 2017 2022 suggests an increasing interest of researchers in proposing optimizing treatments for rendering wastewater the evolution of publications fig s 1 presented a small number of articles published from 1985 to 2000 8 papers with a gradual growth after 2003 reaching its peak in 2006 with 8 papers solely published in 2006 totalizing 22 papers a substantial decrease occurred until 2015 with only 07 papers published after 2017 a slight growth appeared adding up to 12 papers until 2022 altogether 41 papers were published in 50 years representing a small engagement on this subject however the growing publication tendency in recent years 2017 2022 suggests an increasing interest of researchers in proposing optimizing treatments for rendering wastewater this lack of publications might be enhanced through strategies related to publication growth namely review articles which are a gap in this field thus this review fills a gap in this field as it analyses what has been studied pointing out future perspectives rendering industries have several streams fig 2 and the possibility of segregation after their generation might interfere with whether valorisation or treatment process will be applied streams that can be separated from others seem more fittable to valorisation processes enabling fog and proteins recovery due to structural upkeeping of species and less contamination by other compounds such as streams 2 to 7 in fig 2 9 14 18 19 the studies addressed herein were fitted to frameworks main purpose of the study process employed main hypothesis and conclusions and stated as biological and physicochemical processes biological processes were the most cited including pre treatments and secondary treatments the following topics consider that all of these research papers investigated established biological processes lacking in proposing recent and innovative research e g bioelectrochemical processes on the other hand physicochemical processes represented the most recent research covering primary and tertiary treatments separation processes were the main subjects of these papers with economic feasibility against current processes operationalization and by products valorization with a real scale application as topics yet to be studied e g membranes permeate and condensate exhausted adsorbent in both cases favorable processes applied to similar wastewater were cited as potential future research in the field a general guiding scheme is presented in fig 3 considering all cited treatment possibilities and stream variation according to fig 2 4 biological processes biological processes were the first approaches to rendering wastewater treatment and are the most widely studied fig 4 the authors focused on optimization to remove organic material from wastewater and applied it as a secondary treatment table 1 however recent publications are mainly focused on primary and tertiary treatments creating a gap around biological processes optimization and assessment of novelty processes 4 1 anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion ad fig 4 a is a biological process where organic matter is broken down producing valuable by products i e biogas the mechanism of this process is composed of four steps i hydrolysis ii acidogenesis iii acetogenesis and iv methanogenesis 20 anaerobic digestion is usually applied to similar wastewater like slaughterhouses 21 as well as slaughterhouses wastewater the rendering wastewater composition presents key substrates to anaerobic digestion namely fats and proteins mainly from streams 2 to 7 and 9 in fig 2 woon and othman 22 assessed the possibility of ad in rendering raw wastewater as well as other solid streams in the industry e g dissolved air flotation sludge the authors stated that the rendering wastewater has a high potential to be valorised with ad mainly due to biogas production fog rich wastewater is a feasible supply to biogas production as stated by diamantis et al 23 it was estimated that biogas production could reach 1000 m3 per ton of fog in ad however studies on economic feasibility considering operational expenses compared to other processes are yet to be covered apart from solids content removed amid primary treatment fog is one of the main concerns in this case due to low solubility through the process decreasing digestion efficiency and leading to foaming and pipe clogging 23 24 along with rendering wastewater ad the most unsettling factor is inhibition the fog and protein content itself plays a determining role in the process efficiency triglycerides and proteins naturally occurring in the wastewater and by products generated such as volatile free acids are some of the concerns that require further investigation 22 25 potential pre treatments are proposed in order to decrease fog inhibition i saponification with a simple design but chemically costly and potential inhibition with long chain fatty acid lcfa salts generated ii emulsification generating non inhibition substrates yet requiring a high amount of electricity and specific systems iii surfactant addition enabling other wastes valorisation as biosurfactants i e bile and increasing fog solubility which also leads to foaming issues iv thermal processing enhancing initial hydrolysis in ad but highly electric energy consumption and v enzymatic hydrolysis breaking inhibitors molecules into soluble and digestible substrates but presenting high operational costs due to the enzyme application 23 26 being a consolidated method ad shows potential application to value rendering wastewater biomethanation of this wastewater is a promising fact to the fog content usually considered a problem in the course of secondary treatment even though it is already a widely studied process biogas production efficiency is a trending topic opening doors for novelty in pre treatments 4 2 aerobic digestion aerobic digestion fig 4 b is used to degrade organic material in an aerated medium when compared to ad it presents smaller capital costs but also generates a huge amount of sludge poor in dewaterability requires a high supply of oxygen is usually influenced by the environment e g temperature and lacks in generating valuable by products 27 a small number of papers 07 studied aerobic digestion in rendering wastewater usually coupled with membrane bioreactors or along nitrification and denitrification as discussed in the following topics topics 4 3 and 4 5 an aerobic digestion process with activated sludge solely applied after raw wastewater screening and dissolved air flotation was a case study brought by basuvaraj et al 28 the authors demonstrated that the main issue related to the process was the floc formation which was controlled after aeration and external substrate dosage it is also highlighted that the solids retained within the generated sludge are reprocessed by the industry as raw material at this point a potential by product within aerobic digestion application arises however studies on composition and quality parameters e g acidity and peroxide indexes are needed to evaluate reprocessing feasibility 4 3 nitrogen removal processes the typical ammoniacal nitrogen content in rendering wastewater 100 to 800 mg l leads wastewater treatment plants wwtp to seek efficient nitrogen removal among biological processes nitrification and denitrification nad fig 4 c are the most common ones with nad ammoniacal nitrogen removal occurs through aerobic and anoxic phases where ammonium is oxidized to nitrite and then nitrate further reduced to molecular nitrogen respectively 29 30 auterská and novák 31 compared nad in four rendering industries within three years all the systems were coupled with activated sludge after primary treatment the main issues were viscous and filamentous bulking and ammonium and nitrate inhibition shortage of suspended material and poor nutritional content e g phosphorus magnesium molybdenum iron retained in primary treatment led to these issues as low quality sludge formation and sedimentation performance occurred sludge formation was controlled through micronutrient dosage being enhanced by ph control and dosage of external carbon source after system stabilization up to 95 nitrogen and 97 cod were removed however at higher nitrogen content 200 ppm as exposed by silveira et al 29 typical nad processes tend to present low efficiency in this scenario nitrification occurs partially and a substantial amount of ammonia is left behind based on this the authors proposed nitrification coupled with the anammox process fig 4 d where ammonium is partially oxidized to nitrite and then both species are converted to diatomic nitrogen n2 by anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria nitrogen species stoichiometry was the main exposed challenge being a future topic of study around specific conditions for nitrogen species content control decreasing costs and labour related to external nitrogen species dosage 4 4 bioelectrochemical processes bioelectrochemical processes bep aim to generate electricity and chemicals e g h2 along wastewater treatment this product generation occurs in reactors with different configurations depending on their goal including microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs 32 their applicability is related to the substrate present in the wastewater the fog in rendering wastewater covers this requirement being a precursor of lcfa converted to small chain fatty acids scfa a carbon source to anode respiring bacteria 33 xie et al 33 approached the first study regarding this topic the high fat content led to acetate production under anaerobic conditions which is consumed for electric energy production over an 80 day batch cycle 34 3 of the cod was converted into electric energy the main issue was lcfa inhibition to scfa conversion as shown by previous studies topic 4 6 future research may deal with this problem by employing enzymatic pre treatments to hydrolyse these species into scfa enhancing microbial activity 25 the novelty of bep mainly for rendering wastewater enables huge possibilities to be studied apart from the enzymatic pre treatment cited above other gaps to be filled permeate the real scale implementation of bep cost comparison considering the generated electricity feedback and the optimal way to couple bep cells in the already structured wwtp 4 5 membrane bioreactors aerobic digestion as other cited processes like nad can be coupled with other techniques to enhance organic material and nutrient removal an increasing system following this trend is membrane bioreactor mbr fig 4 e mbr consists of an aerated bioreactor coupled with membrane filtration at different calibres its application has been widely increasing in the last 30 years 34 in rendering wastewater mbrs studies are still scarce acharya et al 35 37 presented high cod and nitrogen removal 98 and 99 8 respectively with mbr coupled with nad cod and solids concentration temperature and retention time influence the process regulating the biological process and mass transfer flux 38 to scale up and analyse its feasibility apart from aerobic like conditions already mentioned lifetime and fouling on membranes need to be inspected as well as cheaper membrane materials and their influence on the mass transfer lifetime essays may predict whether coupling these steps may be positive other than biological and separation processing separately 4 6 enzymatic hydrolysis enzymatic hydrolysis fig 4 f is a potential biological alternative to pre treat wastewater which contain compounds that can be hydrolysed into molecules with higher biodegradability characteristics 24 39 hydrolytic enzymes can be used in wide applications one of them is lipolytic activity when fog content is a major concern as stated on topic 4 1 jeganathan et al 39 41 presented the first and only approaches to enzymatic pre treatment of rendering wastewater immobilized lipase was applied through the process considering its recovery potential evaluated at 65 with 70 of remaining enzyme activity after the first cycle fog conversion into lcfa was 50 in batch essays reaching 64 with continuous application along with fog cod removal was similar 65 pre treating resulted in an even more efficient ad reaching 0 46 lch4 gcod 18 higher than the raw wastewater 0 39 lch4 gcod 39 however as proposed by the authors further studies should address the optimization of the experimental condition including treatment of rendering wastewater with different enzymes reactor designs number of cycles until enzyme activity becomes unfeasible active site competition by medium inhibitors and without dilution whereas the cited papers diluted it at 5 to 10 by volume within this subject industrial enzymatic hydrolysis pre treatment implementation must consider i enzyme type where lipases seem to be the most applicable ones to hydrolyse the majority of fog content ii enzyme origin being commercial or produced iii enzyme availability to supply all the needed amount in the pre treatment iv operationalization whether this process will employ free or immobilized enzymes v interaction between fog and the catalyst beads if immobilized and iv operational costs comparing its feasibility among commonly employed processes 4 7 novel biological processes biological processes are a great alternative for rendering wastewater processing mainly for its valorisation biogas electricity stable organic sludge and chemical compounds are a few of the products with added value having a positive impact on the environment therefore as stated by the authors cited herein biological treatment of rendering wastewater is a crucial step between primary and tertiary treatments due to its composition the lack of studies on novel biological processes provides opportunities to be tackled with future research in this time gap from the 2006 peak of publication to 2022 new technologies for biological processes were developed however they were not applied to rendering wastewater different configurations of ad bioreactors such as anaerobic filters baffled reactors up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor anaerobic contactor reactor and anaerobic ponds were successfully and largely employed in similar wastewater 42 43 thus ad applied to rendering wastewater considering optimizing its parameters to the real scale application and comparing each process could provide enhancements in this field aerobic systems apart from mbrs are also viable options for rendering wastewater recently biofilm reactors namely moving bed biofilm reactor have been applied to minimize space aeration costs and medium influence intermittent sequencing batch reactor are also a viable alternative also presenting a high nitrogen removal application of both processes in similar wastewater approaches possibilities around its use in rendering wastewater treatment 42 5 physicochemical processes physicochemical processes are the most recent published articles on this subject when compared to biological processes fig 5 they can be used in different steps of wastewater treatment primary for ammoniacal nitrogen recovery 10 44 45 fat and protein recovery 9 18 19 46 47 and high solid content removal 48 52 and tertiary for higher removal of stubborn components and disinfection through filtration 47 49 51 52 or oxidation 44 table 2 5 1 flotation flotation fig 5 a is a separation technique applied as a preliminary treatment step to high solid content wastewater 53 even though its main idea is the removal of solids it can be applied to recover material of interest as set about by zak and pawlak 46 who proposed the recovery of fat and protein from a rendering industry wastewater however reprocessing the generated sludge in the rendering industry depends on the flotation chemicals toxicity and their impact on the structure of the recovered nutrients zak and pawlak 46 studied the application of a double chamber flotation system applying an air saturated medium this medium enhances the same mechanism of a dissolved air flotation system commonly applied in the rendering industry which is reshaped to enable the recovery of fat and protein in various stages 45 53 this restructuration led the authors to find an 85 recovery of fat content in the wastewater presenting a maximum content of 2 3 of protein even though the recovered products might present composition unsuitable to be reprocessed as raw material such as high acidity and peroxide index as shown by the authors acidity and peroxide index related to the fat content respectively were between 9 5 and 16 3 mgkoh g and 2 4 to 5 8 meq kg rising to 48 6 mgkoh g and 23 meq kg during temperature varying from 25 to 30 c and operational time between 12 and 18 h these situations might turn the generated product unfeasible as raw material due to the instability of the cited parameters which might interfere with the final product of the industry along with acidity and peroxide indexes fat constituents are essential parameters to consider in the availability of reprocessing and its implementation such as the storage space and maximum operation time oxidation due to the high pressure medium tends to occur with air flotation processes degrading fat and protein quality 45 this oxidation may be one of the possibilities that led the acidity and peroxide index to rise between longer operational periods as shown flotation is a viable option for the rendering industry wastewater high efficiency removal of solids makes it more feasible for wastewater to be treated on subsequent processes for organic material and nutrient removal the retained solids can be disposed of as sludge or valorised for reprocessing as raw material to the rendering plant if composition and toxicity are assessed 5 2 coagulation and flocculation coagulation and flocculation cf processes fig 5 b are commonly applied in wastewater treatment as a primary step to decrease the high content of suspended solids firstly coagulants are applied to the wastewater to neutralize particle charges and further flocculant addition enhances particles binding into flocs formed flocs are settled and separated by gravity racar et al 49 52 assessed cf as an alternative to the high solids content removal to decrease fouling within membrane separation racar et al 52 presented fouling decreasing from 62 5 to 3 2 in the posterior membrane treatment mainly due to the high removal of turbidity total carbon 56 1 and doc 66 4 that occurred after cf application racar et al 49 obtained a 50 to 95 fouling reduction through the removal of solids directly influencing the removal of turbidity 96 and total carbon 75 for both studies raw wastewater without cf showed a greater tendency of fouling in the subsequent filtration steps fouling reduction differences are related to the studied membrane scales with lower foul in ultrafiltration against nanofiltration as well as the optimization of coagulant and flocculant dosage studied by these papers cf operationalization also requires extensive training of operators due to strict dosage and ph requirements for a stable and functioning process 50 54 chemical coagulants and flocculants usually lead to a large amount of sludge generation after solid retention sludge filtration proposals are present in the literature such as the use of a sand filter by racar et al 52 but the retained sludge destination is still a gap in the literature in the case of rendering plants alike discussed on flotation the retained solids by cf might be available with natural coagulants and flocculants application as demonstrated by bahrodin et al 55 these compounds lead to a higher retention efficiency and lower sludge generation its application is a potential study bias for the feasibility of the proposed process requiring an assessment of these products availability and optimized parameters when applied to the rendering wastewater therefore cf presents high suspended solids retention influencing turbidity and carbon removal the resulting wastewater provides further treatment approaches that usually lead to smaller efficiency with raw wastewater the amount of sludge generated can be decreased with novel coagulants and flocculants which also provides a potential rich nutrient material to be reprocessed along with the rendering plant 5 3 electrochemical processes literature tackles electrochemical processes as treatments for wastewater valorisation through interest compounds recovery the electrochemical mechanism is based on chemical reactions caused by an electrical current application the applied current enhances reactions solely caused by chemical agents on ordinary treatments leading to novel processes based on their principles like electrocoagulation electroflotation ecf electrolytic metal deposition electrochemical precipitation and emulsion splitting electrolysis 56 58 since chemical agents are no longer needed reprocessing the recovered material might as well be an option 59 ecf fig 5 c for rendering wastewater treatment was proposed by xie et al 50 current density stirring and sedimentation time turned out as the main parameters for higher efficiency the control of fatty acids profile throughout the treatment showed feasible characteristics to reprocess the recovered fat in the rendering plant as raw material in line with the discussion in topic 5 1 reprocessing also requires further analysis acidity index is a major parameter in this case which will dictate its dosage as a raw material and degradability related to shelf life within storage time until its application further feasibility studies comparing similar processes with chemical agents i e cf might present the advantages of the electrochemical approach with fewer costs related to chemical agents more favorable sludge to be reprocessed into the rendering plant as raw material and high performance of treatment such as cod removal 60 61 electrochemical process can also be applied to recover ammoniacal nitrogen as assessed by xie and popat 45 employing electrochemical stripping fig 5 d smaller energy demand occurs from the electrochemical perspective when compared to ordinary stripping 62 in this case stripping was applied as a tertiary step after biological treatment cell configuration cathodic ph and current density played important roles in the process reaching up to 99 ammoniacal nitrogen recovery as ammonia apart from these parameters the correct functioning of this structure is dependent on the wastewater due to its composition different feeding strategies may be needed as proposed by the authors to prevent cl2 formation from the high presence of cl in the treated wastewater the cited characteristics represent the versatility of electrochemical processes both in primary and tertiary treatments low costs are considered to be taken due to chemical agents ecf and energy demand electrochemical stripping but the comparison between the ordinary and proposed processes is yet to be studied in rendering wastewater along with it pilot and real scale implementation are still needed to be covered by these processes evaluating its costs applicability and operationalization considering the high loads of wastewater generated daily 63 5 4 membranes membrane technologies fig 5 e are separation processes based on pressure thermal electric or concentration driven forces membranes are usually applied as tertiary treatment removing recalcitrant contaminants from previously treated wastewater 64 its application in rendering wastewater treatment has been increasing in the literature in the past 6 years generating aggregated value products from the condensate and water reclamation with the resulting permeate however its application still faces issues such as membrane pores fouling decreasing mass transfer and process efficiency 9 48 zhou et al 47 brought up the first outlook with membranes on nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes the membranes were evaluated on direct and crossflow modes to determine whether configuration results as the most cost efficient alternative although fitting results occurred on both configurations the direct flow appears to be the less expensive and easiest of operationalization both processes presented high tds e cod reduction reaching up to 98 and 98 for nanofiltration and 91 and 95 for reverse osmosis respectively reverse osmosis resulted in higher purity of permeate due to its permeability the authors also compared ultrafiltration as a primary treatment for the high solids content removal with the existing dissolved air flotation system reaching a 62 cheaper operation racar et al 48 related the problem of membrane fouling in their studies proposing cf 49 52 and larger calibre membranes 48 51 as pre treatments to reduce the solids content responsible for the decline in membrane efficiency the authors propose membrane separation as a tertiary solution after secondary treatment to remove remaining contaminants e g nitrogen and chlorine species all presented cases demonstrated high removal of turbidity total carbon and solids content decreasing fouling in the tertiary membrane treatment among the pre treatments proposed by the authors cf results in an appropriate permeate for ultrafiltration generating effluent suitable for soil irrigation and the own rendering plant cleaning 49 52 while the pre treatment directly with ultrafiltration generates a permeate with fewer solids suitable for posterior nanofiltration and reverse osmosis treatment with permeate applicable to steam generation 48 51 mostafa et al 18 and muster slawitsch et al 9 expose the gap around physical processes focused on compounds recovery from wastewater valuing the condensate apart from just treating the wastewater the composition of the rendering wastewater was the main considered parameter the lower temperature achieved higher permeate quality with a smaller mass transfer of species e g volatile free fatty acids through the membrane fouling was mainly formed by proteins and their hydrolysed products both researchers showed that polyurethane coated polytetrafluoroethylene membranes resulted in a less fouling tendency with a smaller mass transfer rate when compared to the non coated membrane therefore the studies proved that membrane composition is linked directly with the process efficiency with different materials and fouling removal costs being future trending topics unlike other membrane studies mostafa et al 18 and muster slawitsch et al 9 proposed a promising strategy for the reuse of a specific wastewater stream from the rendering plant the condensate from the drying process stream 7 in fig 2 known as sticky water this stream is usually reclaimed with evaporation an ordinary system already applied with equipment from specialized brands in the rendering branch 65 66 the resulting condensate is a protein and fat rich liquid available for gradual reprocess by the rendering industry directly into the drying equipment membrane separation of this stream generated a higher solid content condensate than the usual generated with the mentioned evaporation equipment however higher solids concentration solids present issues with pipe encrustation and line clogging with reprocessing strategies and dosage yet to be studied 67 the cost comparison of membranes and evaporation processes to sticky water reclamation is brought by zhou and husson 19 studying forward and reverse osmosis the membrane like system reaches a higher concentration capacity up to 45 than evaporation 23 1 costing 5 3 of its total value for sticky water recovery protein denaturation and fat hydrolysis are the primary factors for reprocessing feasibility 68 minimal non standard composition such as acidity from the condensate fat oxidation may have a negative influence on the process therefore studies about its composition and existing degradation still need to be assessed however the membrane s low operational temperature 75 c is lower than the practised on evaporation 130 c bringing the possibility of a lower thermal impact on these issues zhou and husson 19 recently brennan et al 14 presented membrane application to valorise the same condensate stream stream 7 in fig 2 collected after the usual evaporation process focusing on ammoniacal nitrogen recovery membrane composition played a key role where ptfe membrane was more fittable due to higher efficiency and pp membrane led to a higher wetting tendency up to 64 of ammoniacal nitrogen was recovered as ammonium sulphate potential fertilizer that generates an income through the wastewater to the industry which can beat up the costs of the processes considered to be 45 higher than the actual employed aerobic digestion treatment the wastewater stream and its composition demonstrated the applicability of each process plants with combined streams were usually suitable for wastewater treatment and permeate reclamation for less noble applications including cleaning steam generation and irrigation after microorganisms and remaining prions evaluation 44 when more valuable streams are available in the case of the cited sticky water membrane technology is usually applied to add value to the condensate in this case coupling the proposed processes above can also be an alternative to evaluate and ease the high load of wastewater to be treated as proposed in fig s 2 the wastewater stream and its composition demonstrated the applicability of each process plants with combined streams were usually suitable for wastewater treatment and permeate reclamation for less noble applications including cleaning steam generation and irrigation after microorganisms and remaining prions evaluation 44 when more valuable streams are available in the case of the cited sticky water membrane technology is usually applied to add value to the condensate in this case coupling the proposed processes above can also be an alternative to evaluate and ease the high load of wastewater to be treated as proposed in fig s 2 thus the chosen method will be related according to the wastewater stream to be treated and the availability of its segregation as well as to issues involving the application of the generated products e g sticky water volume and its conservation availability of rural areas for irrigation 5 5 novel physicochemical processes according to the papers cited herein physicochemical processes are the most approached treatments in recent years this contemporary interest leads to allow the application of novel processes wastewater valorisation still needs to be considered among these processes mainly focusing on value aggregation of by products coupling these processes in between and to biological ones seems to be a prominent way to the valorisation objective among the separation processes adsorption has a potential field of study as proposed by verbeek et al 10 proteins were recovered with bentonite dosage the high load of ammoniacal nitrogen in rendering wastewater could also be studied for its potential recovery one key stream to be analysed would be the condensate generated after evaporation membrane for sticky water concentration after exhaustion the nutrient rich adsorbent could be assessed to dispose it as fertilizer or be treated for desorption to ammoniacal nitrogen recovery and commercialization 69 in the electrochemical field a huge number of possibilities are yet to be studied besides ecf and electrochemical stripping such as electrochemical oxidation for tertiary treatment 70 and electrolysis as a primary step 71 both successfully applied to slaughterhouse wastewater a research gap was also identified around post treatment processes focusing mainly on microorganism removal and prions deactivation as proposed by ding et al 44 advanced oxidation processes aops are potential applications on this subject as ozonation was studied by the author the rapid increase in aops studies provides a prosperous scenario to assess these techniques for rendering wastewater as stated in similar wastewater some trending aops are ultraviolet peroxidation ultrasound photo fenton electro fenton and couplings of these as matter of fact some of these processes also present toc cod and turbidity removal showing a potential replacement for tertiary processes 70 72 6 future research rendering industry future perspectives overpass pre treatment primary secondary tertiary and post treatment steps and their needs in order to treat and value this wastewater primary and pre treatments studies need to elucidate the implementation and valorisation of segregated streams before the general mixing solids content retained within this step must be evaluated according to its composition for reprocessing or external applications secondary treatments and future enhancements are related to valorisation processes recovering compounds of interest and generating value aggregated by products tertiary and post treatments studies need to propose efficient and sludge free ways to nutrient recovery microorganism removal and prion inactivation unsettling topics to be studied through these processes are mainly related to i real scale and long term operations ii efficiency during peaks in the wastewater composition iii generated by products composition degradability and storing until reprocess i e fog sludge sticky water and iv destination of the cited generated by products when not partially or entirely reprocessed e g excess of fog sludge high acidity index of sticky water determining storage conditions or subsequent treatment to avoid problems related to degradability of the material within nitrogen removal processes e g nitrification and denitrification stopping inhibitors formation and parameter optimization to decrease external feeding points are to be covered valorisation of the wastewater through biological processes such as microbial fuel cell and anaerobic digestion showed its potential application with issues yet to be studied such as inhibitors e g long chain fatty acids proteins pre treatment processes like enzymatic hydrolysis arise as a possibility evaluating enzyme type origin dosage combination and immobilization as well as its impact on by products generated in further treatment steps e g biogas processes that propose fats and proteins recovery still need to cover the generated product degradability and optimal dosage if used as raw material these processes also need to consider whether all the streams of wastewater are viable for this recovery or only non contaminated wastewater streams 2 to 7 in fig 2 the viability of the generated products should rely on physicochemical composition such as acidity and peroxide index and the current legislation from where the rendering industry is allocated previous and primary physicochemical treatments such as flotation and c f are studied to remove solids also reducing other parameters like organic load and turbidity its operation however requires the analysis of different aspects i greener bias concerning the coagulant and flocculant applied with the possibility of process optimization through coagulants of natural origin that present greater efficiency and lower sludge generation when compared to commonly used chemical coagulants and ii composition of the retained solids including fats and proteins to evaluate the best parameters and coagulant flocculant products that capture this material without degrading and oxidizing its structure allowing its reprocessing physical processes based on membrane separation i e filtration reverse osmosis distillation presented membrane fouling as the major obstacle the same issue is also applicable to systems operating with biological membrane reactors different aspects are emerged to be considered i the study of different compositions of membranes with materials and layers that reduce the formation of fouling layers increasing the operational time until the critical decrease in mass transfer ii assessing the cleaning operation time which may lead to more than one equipment to supply the continuous batches of the rendering activity and iii in the case of reprocessing the concentrate gaps in the literature have to evaluate permeate and sludge reprocessing gaps to be covered are i the ideal dosage to avoid drastic compositional changes in the main rendered product and pipe incrustation due to the high level of solids ii the influence of this material on the existing lines and the materials that compose them iii

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uranium a radioactive heavy metal with a half life of millions to billions of years has been widely discharged into the environment due to natural or anthropogenic activities resulting in environmental surface and water contamination 1 2 uranium s high toxicity long half life and significant affinity for complexing organic ligands make it a major threat to the human animal and environmental health when it contaminates water 3 4 even in low quantities uranium exposure in humans can result in serious health issues such as liver and kidney damage and even lead to death 5 7 also due to its enormous energy density 3 9 106 mj kg 1uranium and absence of greenhouse gas emissions nuclear energy is undoubtedly an incredibleenergysource in the present times given the growing human population and energy demands 8 9 therefore separation enrichment and recovery of u vi from the contaminated sites are of great significance for the sustainable development of nuclear energy environmental protection and human health numerous techniques have been adopted for u vi removal from aqueous solutions such as membraneseparation 10 co precipitation 11 ion exchange 12 13 electro coagulation 14 solvent extraction 15 solid phase extraction 16 17 and adsorption 18 19 of these known techniques studies have shown

contamination 20 24 adsorption isotherms and kinetics models allow for easy evaluation of the process s mechanistic features and knowledge of the adsorption mechanism helps optimize reaction conditions 25 26 there are some good studies available depicting the use of adsorption for various environmental applications shahmirzadi et al 27 discussed various adsorption processes and technologies that are reported in the last decade for desalination water softening and salt removal studies of yagub et al 28 and dutta et al 29 reported various adsorbents efficient in removal of colored dye from aqueous solutions among those a bioadsorbent showed the best result with qmax of 1653 mg g and sorption efficiency of 95 xiao et al 30 reported the graphene oxide preparation using modified hummers method and the possible mechanism involved for the removal of organic dye from aqueous solution the π π interactions between graphene and organic dyes provides the maximum adsorption capability 1301 8 mg g and 1005 7 mg g for cationic and anionic dyes respectively huang et al 31 showed in his research work how metal organic frameworks and their derivatives are used successfully as an adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater sophia et al 32 reported various adsorption studies present in literature for removal of emerging pollutants like pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones plasticizers and other organic compounds in the past two decades various materials like organic porous carbon based cellulose chitosan based resin and synthetic polymer inorganic porous silica based ldhs etc composites nanomaterials go carbon nanotubes mxene etc framework materials etc have been explored as an adsorbent for u vi remediation 24 33 carbon based materials owing to their unique properties of easy functionalization adjustable pore structure high availability good stability acid and alkali resistance easy recovery by combusting large specific surface area and high adsorption capacity have been extensively investigated in the extraction of uranium from contaminated water 24 34 35 among them activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts mesoporous carbon biochar and graphene oxide go are the most studied as the literature data shows energy production catalysis and environmental remediation are just a few of the fields that are finding increasing use for these materials 36 39 nanostructured carbon compounds in particular have recently received a lot of attention in the field of water remediation the main advantages of these compounds for adsorption applications are their large surface area fast adsorption kinetics large numbers of binding sites and exceptional selectivity 40 as reported in literature reviews graphene family nanomaterials like graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have promising applications in environmental remediation 41 one of the most important graphene derivatives go has large surface area and numerous oxygen rich functional groups which make it an excellent adsorbent for practical applications of uranium removal 42 research into uranium removal using go rgo and their modified forms has increased dramatically over the years 25 recently biochar has piqued scientists attention and has been deployed in numerous environmental applications such as enhancing soil quality 43 eliminating emerging pollutants in soil 44 and water 45 reducing greenhouse gas emissions 46 and generating energy 47 biochar is a carbonized biomass produced by the thermochemical decomposition of organic matter at temperatures between 200 and 700 c under oxygen derived conditions 48 biochar s qualities which are influenced by the feedstock type and manufacturing conditions determine its potential for use in a variety of environmental applications biochar can be manufactured from plentiful animal and plant biomass 49 and possesses desirable characteristics like high permeability good porosity and large surface area 50 in addition to these characteristics its affinity for various functional groups and low cost makes it an ideal candidate for adsorbing u vi onto its surface resulting in efficient wastewater treatment and promoting sustainable waste management 51 another carbon based adsorbent activated carbon ac has been used to treat industrial wastewater since the 1960s and is one of the first established adsorbents the production of ac 52 involves the dehydration and carbonization of raw materials in succession with activation using potassium hydroxide 53 zinc chloride 54 phosphoric acid 55 etc over 3 x 105tons of ac are produced annually all over the world and the most common traditional raw materials for this include wood peat phenolic resin coconut shell coal petroleum residues and agricultural waste 56 ac is a versatile material with many applications particularly in the field of environmental remediation and sorption of heavy metals owing to its exceptional physical and chemical properties 57 59 to date substantial advancement has been achieved in the field of uranium adsorption from aqueous solution by various types of adsorbents and a great number of studies have been published to establish utility of diverse adsorbents towards uranium recovery and extraction however a detailed evaluation of the synthesis application and mechanism of significant carbon based adsorbents e g activated carbon biochar graphene and its derivates for u vi removal from aqueous solution is unattainable in this review we focused on the current advancements of the three aforesaid carbon based adsorbents in relevance to their synthesis adsorption performance adsorption mechanism and various modification strategies to boost their performances and selectivity towards u vi removal more emphasis has been paid to discuss the emergence of the novel biochar based adsorbents and their adsorptive performance considering their inexistence in literature reviews for u vi sorption at last limitations and challenges in the field of uranium removal by carbon based adsorbents have been discussed to offer new insights into this research 2 synthesis of adsorbents uranium is found in environmentally important concentrations near uranium mining and processing facilities which typically entail substantial amount of wastewater uranium removal from substantial amount of wastewater is accompanying with low cost traditional treatment approaches e g mineral adsorption 60 carbonaceous based sorption technologies are an alternate way for eliminating harmful cation metals from wastewater 61 various researchers have discussed from time to time about the hazardous nature of radioactive waste and showed concern for its removal strategies 62 63 here we summarize the synthesis strategies used for go biochar and activated carbon for the removal of toxic u vi metal from wastewater 2 1 synthesis strategies for graphene oxide its derivates the unique features of 2d network structure of graphene oxide go and its derivates such as reduced graphene oxide rgo functionalized graphene oxide and graphene oxide composites promote its dispersion in solution along with tuning the appropriate surface functional group which reduces the self aggregation of go resulting in improved adsorption capacity towards pollutants 64 most commonly used method for the synthesis of go was hummer s method 65 the graphene produced from flake graphite has several broken conjugations in the graphene plane and numerous oxygen containing functional groups include hydroxyl carboxyl epoxide and carbonyl on the surface to make stable complex with metal ions or pollutants to act as a better adsorbent 63 however several modifications had been carried out by several researchers according to the desired results since the nature of pristine graphene is hydrophobic which is hard to disperse in water 66 the new improved method or the tour s method with its simpler protocol resulting the influence of the final yield and minimizes the toxic gas no2 n2o4 and or clo2 evolution during synthesis and equivalent conductivity upon reduction used in hummer s and modified hummer s method for the synthesis of graphene oxide 67 among the traditional activated carbon biochar and modern carbon nanotubes cnts material go has emerged as better uranium adsorbents for example liu et al 68 prepared the phosphate functionalized graphene oxide pgo with maximum adsorption capacity of 251 7 mg g and give an excellent removal efficiency for u vi in acidic condition romanchuk et al 69 reported the rapid removal of radionuclide actinides and trans uranium elements including americium iii thorium iv plutonium iv neptunium v uranium vi even from acidic solutions ph 2 because of its strong interplanar connections go has a proclivity to aggregate therefore a sizeable percentage of the go s surface area is lost reducing its effectiveness in wastewater remediation to address this issue various polymers have been grafted onto the surface of go in order to prevent self aggregation and improve its adsorption ability song et al 70 reported a rapid monolayer sorption rate and efficiency for the removal of u vi using a novel graphene oxide go and poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrene sulfonate pedot pss go pedot pss nanocomposite having an inner sphere complexation mechanism with endothermic nature apart from the graphene chen et al 71 prepared a few layered n p and s co doped graphene like carbon nanosheets nps glcs for the removal of u vi maximum adsorption capacity of 294 16 mg g at ph range of 5 9 were reported due to a strong covalent bond such as p o u and s o u were generated between the heteroatom n p s with uo2 2 in removal process wang et al 72 reported the graphene oxide nanoribbon gonrs which are defined as graphene stripes with a width of nanometers prepared from the oxidative multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts showed 394 1 mg g higher adsorption capacity of u vi on gonrs at ph 4 5 furthermore wang et al 73 functionalized the gonrs with amidoxime ao and achieved the u vi adsorption capacity of 502 6 mg g at ph 4 5 wang et al 74 further discussed the mechanism at different unzipping level of mwcnts for the interaction between u vi and gonrs and showed the mechanism of uo2 2 complex with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups at the edges of the gonrs different stages of unzipping mwcnts into gonrs is shown schematically in fig 1 considering the multiple steps and the variety of reagents involved the graphene oxide sulfonation is challenging however zhang et al 75 suggested a simple one pot technique for the synthesis of sulfonated graphene oxide gos employing fuming sulfonic acid 50 so3 h2so4 by vapor solid transfer reaction of go the gos was utilized as an adsorbent to remove u vi ions with a maximum adsorption capacity of 309 09 mg g 2 2 synthesis strategies for biochar biochar is a porous carbonaceous material that is typically obtained from variety of feedstock including agricultural wastes rice husks bagasse paper products animal manures and even urban green waste in an oxygen limited environment prevent combustion 76 it has the potential to be a widely used material for the remediation of water and soil due to the broad accessibility of feedstocks and having tunable physicochemical properties the pore size distribution functional groups present at surface and ion exchange capacity of biochar determine its efficacy in pollutant management the biochar characteristics can be tuned by controlling the pyrolysis temperature heat transfer rate residence period and types of feedstocks e g at high pyrolysis temperatures the surface area hydrophobicity and microporosity of biochar are increased resulting in efficient handling of the organic pollutants whereas biochar is more appropriate for eliminating polar organic and inorganic contaminants at lower temperatures via oxygen containing functional groups precipitation and electrostatic attraction changes in surface reactivity chemical physical and structural qualities are the outcome of surface alterations of biochar by oxidizing the biochar surface the materials number of surface sites and efficacy can be increased e g carboxylic and phenolic groups several scientists started working on generating biochar out of straw as an adsorbent for uranium vi rice straw based biochar s were modified with the oxidation treatment by hno3 h2o2 and kmno4 chemical regents at different heating temperature of 550 650 and 750 c the effects of pyrolysis temperature modifying agent type surface chemistry surface charge and pore structure on u vi removal were studied and found that the amount and character of the surface groups have a greater impact on u vi adsorption than porosity the highest adsorption occurred at a ph of 5 5 when compared to other adsorbents rice straw derived biochar s demonstrated equivalent u vi adsorption 77 currently a range of methods for manufacturing biochar have been investigated depending on the specifications of biochar properties to generate energy from biomass biochemical conversion uses biological catalysts and biological organisms whereas thermochemical conversion uses heat and a chemical catalyst the major phase in the biochemical process which is commonly used to make methanol and biodiesel from biomass is fermentation whereas thermochemical conversion techniques are further classed as combustion gasification and pyrolysis however while biochemical conversion technology is less expensive and more ecologically friendly than thermochemical conversion technology the rate of hydrogen production and yield in the biochemical conversion method is very low because of this constraint thermochemical conversion is more popular than biological conversion here in this section the discussion is based only on thermochemical conversion processes included pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization htc gasification and torrefaction 2 2 1 pyrolyzed biochar oxygen free environment convert the biomass into more stable product biochar and other solid residues this conversion involved two stage process primary pyrolysis followed by secondary different organic functional groups like carboxyl carbonyl and hydroxyl break up along with devolatilization involves dehydration decarboxylation and dehydrogenation gets into main constituent by heat during primary pyrolysis gases like ch2 ch4 co and co2 along with the char are the product obtained during secondary pyrolysis during the process bio oil is formed after re condensation of some of the volatilized biomolecule depending upon the thermal or catalytical cracking as represented by the following equation 78 c 6 h 6 o 6 n h 2 co ch 4 c 5 h 12 h 2 o ch 3 oh c h 3 cooh c in this equation the gaseous product followed by liquid products and solid yield are represented in first second and last term of the equation respectively the process is classified as slow intermediate or fast pyrolysis based on the pyrolysis temperature residence period and heating rate flash vacuum and hydropyrolysis are the other modified version of these three fundamental pyrolysis methods 79 each method s operation parameters impart various properties to the final biochar products 2 2 1 1 slow pyrolysis slow pyrolysis has long been used to produce charcoal it is the traditional kind of pyrolysis distinguished by a slow heating rate and a long residence duration slow pyrolysis involves heating biomass to temperatures in the 400 500 c range at a rate of 0 1 to 1 c s for 5 to 30 min slow pyrolysis favors the generation of biochar but liquid bio oil and gaseous products syn gas are also generated in trace amounts slow pyrolysis provides a favourable environment and enough time for the secondary reactions to complete because to the restricted heating rate and lengthier vapor residence duration 80 81 additionally a longer vapor residence time permits the elimination of vapors produced by the secondary reaction this ultimately results in the production of solid carbonaceous biochar because of these features biochar production via slow pyrolysis is considered sustainable slow pyrolysis biochar has been reported to be beneficial for soil remediation and the sorption of several wastewater contaminants 82 recently researchers 83 reported fabrication of biochar by slow pyrolysis from different types of feedstocks namely sewage sludge agriculture biomass waste and wood biomass waste and compared their efficacy in terms of heavy metal removal from wastewater biochar fabricated from sewage sludge showed highest adsorption capacity followed by agriculture biomass waste and wood biomass waste 2 2 1 2 fast pyrolysis fast pyrolysis involves heating biomass to 850 1250 c at a heating rate of 10 200 c for a short period of time ranging between 1 and 10s it is exploited for bio oil production since the oil product yield exceeds the char and gaseous product fast pyrolysis typically yields 60 75 liquid product 15 25 charcoal and 10 20 non condensable gaseous products the fundamental principle is to heat biomass to a temperature at which thermal cracking can occur while minimizing exposure duration which promotes char formation 84 rather than letting the biomass react and produce the unfavorable char the high heating process converts the input biomass into a liquid product high liquid yields are produced via quick pyrolysis of biomass while char and exit gas percentages are reduced high heating rates 1000 c s and brief vapor residence durations of at most 2 s are necessary for fast pyrolysis guda et al 85 have discussed these key properties of rapid pyrolysis in detail a detailed study has been reported by lyu et al 86 on the component present in bio oil derived from different pyrolysis conditions by using gc ms techniques bagasse corncob spruce and pine were the biomass feedstocks used for pyrolysis materials in this study low temperature pretreatment of biomass produced furans ketones and phenols in high quantity while aldehydes and acids were the product by high temperature and furans and ketones by optimal temperatures of 520 and 550 c because of its low ph the bio oil produced by rapid pyrolysis is very corrosive the high heating value of this oil is approximately half that of crude oil necessitating the upgrading of bio oil before use nowadays the fast pyrolysis method is used in a few more applications such as the synthesis of food tastes and specific compounds 2 2 1 3 intermediate pyrolysis this method of pyrolysis is commonly used to achieve a balance of liquid and solid products while rapid pyrolysis results in a high liquid yield and a low char yield slow pyrolysis results in a high liquid yield and a low char yield the operating parameters for intermediate pyrolysis fall in between slow and fast generally the pressure maintains at 0 1 mpa during the process intermediate pyrolysis settings prevent the creation of high molecular tars and yield dry char appropriate for agricultural use or energy production as well as high quality bio oil intermediate pyrolysis occurs between 500 and 650 c with heating rates ranging from 0 1 to 10 c min and residence times ranging from 300 to 1000s the usual result contains 40 60 liquid 20 30 non condensable gases and 15 25 biochar 79 the liquid product of intermediate pyrolysis can be used directly in boilers and engines because unlike the liquid byproduct of rapid pyrolysis it does not include a significant amount of reactive tar 87 2 2 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc hydrothermal carbonization is regarded as an economical way for biochar synthesis because the process may be carried out at a low temperature of roughly 180 250 c and the product produced by the hydrothermal process is referred to as hydrochar in this process the biomass with water placed in a closed reactor and the temperature is gradually raised to maintain stability different products are formed at particular temperature e g the biochar produced at temperatures below 200 c is known as hydrothermal carbonization bio oil produced at temperatures between 250 and 400 c is known as hydrothermal liquefaction and gaseous products syngas such as co co2 h2 and ch4 produced at temperatures above 400 c is known as hydrothermal gasification the hydrolyzed product undergoes a number of processes including dehydration fragmentation and isomerization to provide the intermediate product 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and its derivatives furthermore the hydrochar is produced via condensation polymerization and intramolecular dehydration 88 the degradation of lignin begins with a dealkylation and hydrolysis reaction which produces phenolic compounds such as phenols catechols syringols and so on finally the char is synthesised by repolymerization and cross linking of intermediates similar to the pyrolysis reaction the non soluble components of lignin are transformed into hydrochar 2 2 3 gasification gasification is a thermochemical process that converts carbonaceous materials into gaseous products namely syngas which consists of co co2 ch4 h2 and traces of hydrocarbons in the presence of gasification agents such as oxygen air steam etc to reiterate the reaction temperature is the single most crucial factor in establishing the level of syngas production carbon monoxide and hydrogen production increased with rising temperatures while methane carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon output decreased the main product of this method is syngas and char is a byproduct with a lower yield the gasification mechanism is broken into several phases which are as follows i drying in which the moisture content of the biomass is entirely evaporated with no energy recovery the moisture content of different biomass materials varies when biomass contains a significant moisture content drying is performed as a separate process during the gasification process ii oxidative combustion in which the main energy sources undergo oxidation and combustion reactions with the gasification agents these gasification agents react with the combustible species present in the gasifier to produce co2 co and water 2 2 4 torrefaction torrefaction is a relatively recent technology for producing charcoal because it uses a limited heating rate it is known as mild pyrolysis the oxygen moisture and carbon dioxide in biomass were removed using inert ambient air in the absence of oxygen at 300 c utilizing various breakdown mechanisms torrefaction changes biomass properties such particle size moisture content surface area heating rate and energy density torrefaction can be achieved in various ways a steam torrefaction in this process biomass is treated with steam at a temperature of no 260 c for approximately 10 min b wet torrefaction also known as hydrothermal carbonization is the process of interacting biomass with water at temperatures ranging from 180 to 260 c for 5 240 min c oxidative torrefaction this approach entails treating biomass with oxidizing agents such as gases used in the combustion process to produce heat energy to achieve the necessary temperature this heat energy is used torrefaction is an incomplete pyrolysis reaction that happens when the following requirements are satisfied temperature of 200 300 c residence time of 30 min heating rate of 50 c min and absence of oxygen the dry torrefaction process is broken down into several stages heating drying torrefaction and cooling drying can also be divided into two stages pre drying and post drying in a recent study lu et al 89 discovered that after 5 adsorption desorption cycles the biochar formed by torrefaction of antibiotic fermentation residue had stable adsorption competencies towards u vi and mb with no noticeable changes in oxygenated functional groups in the ftir spectra of the regenerated biochar 2 3 synthesis strategies for activated carbon activated carbons are one of the most widely used water purification and treatment agents it has a high affinity for organic molecules low molecular weight molecules and possesses oxygenated functional groups throughout its entire surface that can adsorb metal ions dyes and other organic compounds from aqueous solutions 59 the activated carbons are made up of porous structure formed by heating organic precursors to high temperatures resulting in void spaces and the removal of water and biomass furthermore strong chemical radiation and thermal stability as well as rigid porous structure and mechanical strength confer significant advantages over polymeric materials 90 some of the most frequent forms are wood fruit stones and coals with varying characteristics depending on their final application some examples include powdered granular activated carbons fibres clothing and carbon integral or carbon coated monoliths 91 activated carbon cannot be reactivated after usage therefore digging it out of water treatment reservoirs renders it impracticable for treating the large volumes of waste produced by today s industry and population this issue has been handled in two ways discovering low cost substitute sources and improving the efficacy of present materials although several innovative activated carbons have been successfully created over the past decade there has not been a unified approach to characterising and assessing their capacities such as adsorption separation and catalytic activities 92 93 activated carbon can be made by either directly activating a dry raw precursor or by a two phase process that includes carbonization and activation 94 firstly the carbonization phase achieved by heating 700 c the raw materials to evaporate and remove the hydrocarbons therefore this phase is a pyrolytic process and the product is called carbonized material char or biochar the next phase activation methods are utilized to increase porosity and produce structures in the activated carbon resulting in the production of fine solid cavities macropores are 50 nm mesopores are in between 2 nm to 50 nm and micropores are 2 nm are the types of pores produced on the surface of activated carbon 95 moreover based on the nature of the activation process activated carbon can be classified into two main categories physical activation using steam or co2 and chemical activation using oxidizing agents such as koh zncl2 h3po4 etc 96 2 3 1 physical method this method offers a chemical free low cost environmentally friendly way to prepare activated carbon and it has the potential to yield activated carbon with a porous structure and high physical strength it consists of two consecutive step processes i e carbonization in an inert atmosphere to devolatilize the raw material and gasification of the obtained char or biochar by oxidizing agents steam carbon dioxide or a mixture of both assuming carbonization occurs between 400 and 600 c the typical gasification temperature ranges from 800 to 1000 c chemical control slow activation rate days is preferable to diffusional control rapid causes outside particle burning poor porosity growth which is why co2 activation must take place in controlled environments since the interactions of steam and carbon dioxide with carbon are endothermic thermal activation requires an external energy input to keep the desired high temperature because the reaction of oxygen or air with carbon is very exothermic and quick it is difficult to manage and ensure porosity development rather than particle consumption because of this as well as safety concerns about temperature control oxygen activation is rarely used low amounts of oxygen or air can however be used during thermal activation with steam or carbon dioxide to help high temperatures by reacting with the gases created during activation i e co and h2 this method has the advantage of decreasing the pressure of co and h2 both of which hinder activation while increasing the partial pressure of the activating agent negative aspects of physically activating activated carbon include the lengthy activation period the low adsorption capacity of the generated activated carbon and the high amount of energy required mellah et al 97 used a commercially available from merck activated carbon size 2 mm for the removal of uranium and achieved the 98 efficiency at initial concentration of 100 mg l with a 0 1 g adsorbent dosage similarly caccin et al 98 used the commercial activated carbon prepared by physical activation process from the coconut shell for the removal of uranium cesium and strontium results showed that cesium and strontium were not showed any affinity towards ac resulting no removal occur however with u vi ac showed excellent adsorption efficacy of 55 32 mg g during the batch study activated palm kernel shell carbon apksc was used by yi et al 99 for the removal of u vi from aqueous solution in a batch adsorption experiment with adsorption capacity of 51 81 mg g the apksc removed up to 94 30 of u vi at an initial u vi concentration of 50 mg l with an adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l after 120 min apksc used in this study was also available commercially 2 3 2 chemical method in this method of activation various chemicals or activating agent e g koh zncl2 h3po4 etc at temperature of 400 to 900 c are used accordingly it is a one step or two step process and has advantages over physical method in terms of low cost low heating temperature high porosity and high adsorption capacity the one step activation process comprises impregnating the chemical activating agent into the biomass precursor which is then activated carbonized the first phase in the two step chemical activation involves carbonizing the biomass precursor to form biochar at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 c thermal breakdown results in the release of volatile content in vapors tars and gases as well as the formation of pores in the resulting biochar raw materials used in wet oxidation or chemical activation contained cellulose like wood in this method of activation the activating agents defines the steps of mechanism involved for pores formation like phosphoric acid associated the lignocellulosic structure of the raw material in activation process while the zinc chloride encourage the removal of water from the structure lignocellulosic precursor gets combined with activating agents and act as a template for the formation of microporosity so the amount of impregnation temperature carbonization time and the weight ratio of chemical agents to dry precursor are the influencing parameters in the process of activation 100 101 some of the chemical activators are discussed here 2 3 2 1 activation by zncl2 by chemically activating zinc chloride acs may become more porous and with a higher surface area thus providing a greater adsorption capacity lignocellulosic and cellulosic precursor are used to produce activated carbon by zinc chloride through the impregnation during activation during this activation process zinc chloride combined with the saturated pores and with the increasing mass ratio the volatile material released easier from the surface the activated carbon larger surface area in the activated carbon can be the result from the distinct intra and inter coated cavities caused by the break down of cellulose molecule due to inflation this could be the result of an electrolytic action named selling induced by zinc chloride carbon and hydrogen atoms with other product like o2 co co2 methane and aldehydes etc resulted by the conversion of lignocellulosic materials during activation process moreover zinc chloride restricted the formation of bitumen and other fluids that restrain the movement of volatile substances to be released from the surface the activated carbon the yield of activated carbon is increased by the addition of large ring aromatic compounds to zinc chloride this process allows the zinc chloride to react with carbon without reacting with it 102 compared to the potassium hydroxide process the activated carbon produced by zinc chloride is more effective the presence of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the activated carbon structure can be removed by the use of zinc chloride the reduction of these two components by the presence of zinc chloride leads to a decrease in oxygen and a rise in nitrogen gondugdo et al 103 reported the increase in porosity and surface area concentration of zinc chloride used in the activation process the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are removed from the activated carbon structure when zinc chloride is used the effect of temperature and zinc chloride concentration on various atoms is that hydrogen and oxygen content drop while nitrogen content increases zinc chloride functions as a lewis acid enhancing condensed aromatic reactions by promoting molecular hydrogen deformation from the hydro aromatic structure of precursors causing polymerization processes to occur and be affected by the exclusion of some of the active sites from surrounding molecules this increase in concentration breaks the structure and convert the structure to mesopores from micropores 104 hu et al 105 used coconut shells and palm seeds as starting materials to make mesoporous activated carbon which they activated simultaneously with zncl2 and co2 they discovered that the major pore feature at low zncl2 concentrations is microporous whereas the predominant pore characteristic at high zncl2 concentrations is mesoporous 2 3 2 2 activation by koh for the formation of high surface area fine pore size less toxic and corrosive and low cost activated carbon potassium salts such as koh and k2co3aremostly used for the precursor of coal the activated carbon by koh activation used for removal of various organic chemicals such as phenol dyes and other pollutants due to presence of oh functional groups on the surface of activated carbon the ability of k to quickly form intercalation compounds with carbon explains why koh activation is more effective than other chemical activating agents furthermore the k2o generated during the koh activation process is reduced to k by carbon resulting in carbon gasification and subsequent co2 emission which leads to the creation of pores tounsadi et al 106 reported an optimization approach for the preparation of activated carbon from glebionis coronaria l using koh activator for the removal of cadmium and cobalt metal ions response surface methodology rsm were used for the optimization of factors namely carbonization temperature activation temperature activation time and impregnation ratio however the yield 10 40 of activated carbon is lower than the other activators such as zncl2 and h3po4 as compared to other activators but give high pore volume and high surface area 107 moreover the interaction between the koh and the biomass precursor and their biochar influences the characteristics like surface area pore size distribution and adsorption characteristics for different adsorbate of activated carbon during the activation process oginni et al 108 reported the biomass derived activated carbon activated at a temperature 900 c with sbet1597 m2 g and 0 89 cm3 g total pore volume structure mesopore obtaining the high equilibrium uptake of 166 67 mg g and 153 09 mg g for caffeine and acetaminophen respectively the mesopore serves as a conduit for the adsorbate to reach the micropores as a result the rate of adsorption of the activated carbons is increased elmouwahidi et al 109 studied the properties of activated carbons produced by one step and two step chemical synthesis of olive residue using koh as an activating agent the biochar precursor was created at a temperature of 300 c and the biomass and biochar precursors were activated for 2 h at a temperature of 840 c at a low impregnation ratio the biomass derived activated carbon had a greater bet surface area of 1390 m2 g than the biochar derived activated carbon which had a surface area of 1295 m2 g meanwhile as the impregnation ratio increased the biomass derived activated carbon s bet surface area declined to 1350 m2 g while the biochar derived activated carbon exhibited a greater bet surface area of 1626 m2 g the overall pore and mesopore volumes of biochar derived activated carbons were greater than those of biomass derived activated carbons however the surface chemistry of the activated carbons generated from biochar and biomass was similar liu et al 110 investigated the koh impregnation of corn cob generated activated carbon pyrolysis at 800 c for 1 h the activated carbons had bet surface areas was 1054 2 m2 g the authors discovered that as the impregnation ratio increased the surface areas and volumes of the mesopores increased substantially indicating that the micropores collapsed and merged into bigger mesopores chen et al 111 investigated the koh chemical activation mechanism during biomass and proposed the mechanism that introduced new o containing groups into biochar a chemical pathway between koh and o containing groups is proposed for activating koh during biomass pyrolysis as o containing groups react with koh at 1 8 1 2 or 400 600 c 2 3 2 3 activation by h3po4 formation of activated carbon using phosphoric acid h3po4 is also utilized prominently for lignocellulosic materials and various forms of biomass as the acid controlled the physical and chemical interaction during impregnation stage for the bulk of the solution 112 different researchers reported the interaction behaviour of acid with different sources of activated carbon demiral et al 113 reported that due to the evaporation of phosphoric acid during carbonization process the pores and cavities were formed on the surface of activated carbon this could be understood that the formation of pores or the active sites of the activated carbon were achieved as the mechanisms of activation involved the process of thermal degradation of polymer dehydration and redistribution of biopolymers in lignocellulosic materials 114 115 the particles and volatile products formed during the interaction of acid with precursor resulting the variation of different sizes of micro and mesopores and the hydrophilic nature of the surface to increase adsorption efficiency of carbon surface 116 large amount of oxygen and phosphorous containing surface groups increasing the carbon and nitrogen content significantly increases the surface area and high active sites for the adsorption 117 some of the activated carbon activated by zncl2 koh and h3po4 are listed in the table 1 for different adsorbate such as uranium vi and others lead mercury iv etc through pre carbonization and chemical activation kennedy et al 118 investigated the h3po4 activation of rice husk pores produced at a higher activation temperature were shown to be expanded or widened resulting in microporosity production however for advanced applications carbon materials should have a high mesopore content as well as a high surface area 3 application towards u vi removal 3 1 go based adsorbents for u vi removal recently pristine go and go based nanomaterials with unique physicochemical properties including high surface area and abundant oxygen containing functional groups are applied as high efficiency adsorbent for elimination of u vi ions the main adsorption properties between go based materials and u vi are summarized in table 1 3 1 1 pristine go go is considered as the oxidized form of graphene containing different functional groups like hydroxyl carboxylic and epoxide on the surface attaining to the high surface area and abundant functional groups on the go surfaces the material showed high adsorption capacity in the removal of uranyl ions from aqueous solutions zhao et al 119 prepared few layered go fgo by modified hummers method the spacing of graphene increased from 0 8 nm to 2 89 nm during the oxidation process in fgo which attributed the increased of concentration of co and co on the surface of fgo which was further confirmed from the xps analysis the maximum adsorption capacity of u vi on few layered go at 293 k was 97 5 mg g another study in same year was done by li et al 120 in which the c1s spectrum of rgo showed mainly the non oxygenated carbon 284 8 ev with high c o ration of 81 5 in comparison to c1s spectrum of go with only c o ratio of 48 4 the afm image of go showed the presence of sheets having uniform thickness 1 nm with lateral dimensions varying from 1 to 100 nm which demonstrates the complete exfoliation of graphite oxide down to individual go sheets the maximum adsorption capacity of rgo for u vi was observed to be 299 mg g at ph 4 0 another research reported in literature is of wang et al 121 who performed adsorption of u vi on few layered graphene oxide nanosheets with maximum adsorption capacity of 92 mg g at t 298 k and ph 3 45 however the pristine go can cause irreversible aggregation in aqueous solution which may reduce the surface areas and hinder effective removal behaviours therefore different modified go materials were fabricated and applied to the efficient removal of uranyl ions 3 1 2 nitrogen functionalized go go in aqueous solutions tends to aggregate rapidly and form strong π π forces and makes the surface inert 122 which reduces its interaction with target contaminants and thus limits their further applications in field of environmental pollution control management therefore keeping in mind researchers should take all these aspects necessary steps to enhance its dispersibility and to reduce the aggregation of go all kinds of surface modified go were synthesised via chemical modification or attaching a stabilizer such as a soluble polymer or a surfactant to graft different functional groups on the surfaces 123 125 introduction of nitrogen bearing groups on go surface shows paramount significance in uranium removal in this regard amidoxime group is one of the most efficient chelating functional groups for uranium adsorption with a high capacity and selectivity 126 128 according to the study done by wang et al 129 multiple nitrogen moieties acidic oxime and basic amino groups in amidoxime bind with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups of go sheet by hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction forming go amidoxime hydrogels go agh this adsorbent exhibit high selectivity towards uranium in presence of co existing ions like mg2 ca2 ba2 and sr2 which exist in high concentrations in wastewater and compete with uranium for the sorption on go agh the selectivity was high due to the great chelating properties of nitrogen moieties with uranium researchers found that uo2 2 species of uranium was adsorbed on the hydrogen with large distribution coefficient value kd 1 89 105 it was observed that lone pairs on the nitrogen atom of amino group and the oxygen atom of the oxime group donated to the positive charged metal centre of the uranium species that form a stable chelate therefore go agh showed high adsorption capacity q max around 398 4 mg g in presence of high concentrations of competitive ions furthermore researchers develop novel functional group ligands in coordination with amidoxime group to enhance the selectivity and adsorption capacity simultaneously in this regard carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin cmcd possess good uranium adsorption characteristics in coordination with amidoxime group li et al 130 prepared amidoxime functionalized cmcd modified graphene oxide aerogel gdc via a one step hydrothermal method after a series of adsorption experiments performed to describe the uranium uptake rate researchers found that q max 642 3 mg g of gdc at ph 6 towards uranium was much higher than q max of amidoxime functionalized graphene oxide aerogel and β cyclodextrin graphene composites i e 421 4 mg g and 213 6 mg g respectively high q max of gdc revealed the synergistic effect of amidoxime and β cyclodextrin towards uranium adsorption in terms of kinetics and isotherm study pseudo second order and langmuir kinetics was well fitted which corresponds adsorption process occurs through chemisorption in terms of selectivity gdc exhibit good selectivity towards uranium in presence of different anions cl no3 so4 2 and cations ca2 co2 cu2 fe2 mg2 v2 the strong selectivity of uranium is due to strong attraction with amidoxime and internal cavity of cmcd amine groups are other good candidates for the adsorption of uranium from aqueous solution they are considered as soft donors towards elements of actinide series and form stable chelate complexes with these elements 131 liu et al 132 designed amine functionalized go nanosheets by covalently grafting p phenyldiamine on the surface of go nanosheets which attributed to the nitrogen containing functional groups on the surface of reduced go nanosheets which enhances the selectivity and removal capacity of uranium from the aqueous medium the maximum removal capacity of uranium on go and go nh2 was 97 3 mg g and 215 2 mg g at 298 k verma et al 133 developed effective adsorbent nh3 go where graphene oxide nanosheets were reduced by liquid ammonia in dehydrating solvent the purpose of using ammonia was to reduce carboxylic acid of graphene into amide to achieve high selectivity and removal of uranium study revealed that nh3 go adsorbent showed high selectivity towards uranyl ions in presence of interference cations ca2 mg2 k na pb2 fe2 and zn2 and anions co3 2 hco3 2 cl so4 2 due to amide functionalization of go the maximum adsorption capacity q max was found to be 80 13 mg g at neutral ph at 298 k this adsorption capacity was high in comparison to many other silica based adsorbents 134 136 nowadays many polymer based materials grafted on graphene have been rigorously studied as efficient adsorbents for uranium because these materials can be modified and designed to show remarkable characteristics including large surface area permanent porosity and multifunctionality these polymer based materials include polyacrylamide polydopamine polyethyleneimine polyamidoxime chitosan for example song et al 137 grafted polyacrylamide on go pam go through plasma induced polymerization technique in which pam and go were activated by electrons photons and alpha particles and activated pam and go form chemical bonds tga analysis revealed that 11 64 by weight of pam was grafted on go sem images fig 2a show that go nanosheets are packed together in contrast to the widely distributed pam go nanosheets fig 2b furthermore ft ir raman and xrd examination reveal that the dark dots on the go nanosheets in the tem image of pam go nanosheets fig 2d are nanosized pam domains chemically bonded on the go surface the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 164 mg g at ph 6 at 295 k another polymer cross linking agent called polyethyleneimine pei was grafted on go hydrogel surface by wang et al 138 the results showed that pei gh has very good adsorption capacity of 898 mg g with high removal rate of 90 at ppm level and near about 85 at ppb level in simulated sea water qian et al 139 prepared oxime polydopamine pda modified reduced graphene oxide rgo pda oxime by simple one step process and utilized for effective u vi adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of rgo pda oxime was found to be 1049 mg g at ph 6 which was much larger than rgo pda without oxime and only go 675 mg g and 613 mg g so functionalization with oxime enhances the capacity towards the uranium langmuir isotherm would be better fitted r2 0 9835 in comparison to freundlich isotherm r2 0 9420 the uv vis spectrum fig 3a of the rgo pda oxime solution shows that both pda and oxime have maintained their stabilities ft ir spectroscopy was then used to further analyse the functionalization of the surfaces of the produced samples fig 3b the existence of pda in the produced products was shown by the detection of a feature at 1510 cm 1 nh bending vibration while an additional peak at 1610 cm 1 cꟷn stretching vibration in the rgo pda oxime confirmed the presence of the oxime groups researcher also performed the experiment on simulated sea water and the results reflected good adsorption of uranium in simulated water at ph 8 i e 201 62 mg g 267 70 mg g 348 62 mg g for the uranium initial concentrations of 8 16 and 32 mg l respectively polyaniline having different amino groups grafted on surface of graphene to enhance the adsorption capacity towards uranium for example shao et al 140 synthesised polyaniline pani go composite by in situ polymerization technique in which aniline monomers would bound to the oxygen containing functional groups on dispersed go the characteristics of pani go were that it contains abundant amounts of primary and secondary amino groups which exhibit selective extraction of u vi from aqueous solution the adsorption of u vi on pani go is mainly due to the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between u vi and amino groups on the composite the xps spectrum of pani go after u vi adsorbed revealed the presence of xps u4f5 2 and xps u4f7 2 peaks at 393 0 and 382 1 ev respectively these binding energies are consistent with those of u vi 141 the maximum adsorption capacity q max at ph 5 and 3 5 was found to be 1960 mg g and 610 mg g respectively chitosan is also another class of natural organic polymer comprising the amino and hydroxyl functional groups on the polymer chain which exhibit good chelating properties that are favourable to interaction with uranium 142 to improve the adsorption capacity of chitosan towards uranium various modifications have been done huang et al 143 prepared the graphene oxide chitosan aerogel go cs and effect of various experimental parameters including ph kinetics isotherms were evaluated in terms of ph the maximum adsorption showed in the range of 3 5 adsorption isotherm study was performed at ph 3 5 5 0 8 5 and maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 200 0 319 9 384 6 mg g at ph 3 5 5 0 and 8 5 respectively interestingly it was found that freundlich adsorption r2 0 93 isotherm was well fitted at ph 3 5 and 5 and langmuir adsorption r2 0 96 was well fitted at ph 8 5 these adsorption isotherm results demonstrate that the diverse functional groups such as nh2 oh cooh exist on go cs participated in the uranium binding under mild acidic conditions while nh2 and oh groups were majorly involved for uranium binging in alkaline conditions these results further were verified by xps and exafs analysis some other notable research studies are also reported in literature 144 151 3 1 3 phosphorus functionalized go cai et al 152 developed phosphorylated graphene oxide chitosan composite go cs p by arbuzov reaction 153 the removal efficiency of go cs p composite go cs and pristine go towards u vi was observed under varying experimental conditions it was found that the adsorption increased with increasing ph and showed maximum adsorption at ph 6 5 and adsorption equilibrium for all above three materials reached in very short time of 15 min the maximum adsorption capacities sequence towards u vi of three adsorbents was in the order of go cs p 779 44 mg g pristine go 573 91 mg g go cs 346 16 mg g the important point to mention in the adsorption capacities result was that go cs had low adsorption capacity in comparison to pristine go the reason given by the researchers was that the crosslinking amidation reaction between go and cs causes consumption of more active carboxylic groups of go causing less capacity of go cs another simpler process for synthesis of phosphorylated graphene oxide pgo is via the method of in situ phosphorylation of go with concentrated phosphoric acid 154 the incorporation of the phosphate group on the surface of go was validated by ftir and xps analyses consistent with langmuir isotherms the qmax increased from 249 38 mg g go to 336 70 mg g pgo another outstanding work done was by dutta et al 155 an innovative nanoscale adsorbent reduced graphene oxide with adenosine 5 monophosphate rgo amp was created for the rapid and efficient adsorptive removal of uranyl ions at ph 6 according to the researchers amp s functionalization of go explains its remarkable adsorption capability 3024 mg g in 4 min by providing a strong binding affinity for uo2 2 via phosphate oxygen and chelation via the aromatic nitrogen group after amp reduction rgo undergoes structural modifications that may explain the observed variations in peak position of raman spectra fig 4 furthermore it was shown that rgo amp can be regenerated and reused for a total of 5 cycles while preserving 90 of its capacity by the end of the fifth cycle proving that it is a sustainable adsorbent 3 1 4 go metal oxide composites magnetic nature metal oxides are considered as one of the new generation of adsorbents due to its easy magnetic separation good biocompatibility and therefore widely used in water treatment therefore researchers grafted the surface of graphene oxide from metal oxides to fabricate magnetic graphene nanocomposites in this regard tan et al 156 synthesised cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites from hydrothermal method and investigated the adsorption potential of u vi sem images showed cofe2o4 nanoparticles being uniformly distributed over the entire surface of graphene sheets and between the layers of graphene sheets in terms of xrd analysis fig 5a the five main characteristics diffraction peaks at 30 10 35 40 43 10 57 00 and 62 60 corresponds to 220 311 400 511 and 440 were observed in cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites which were in good agreement with standard diffraction pattern of pristine cofe2o4 the maximum adsorption capacity q max of cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites was found to be 227 2 mg g at ph 6 and temp 298 k large specific saturation magnetization of 37 56 emu g as shown in fig 5b makes this adsorbent easy to separate from solution by applying an external magnetic field song et al 157 investigated first time the adsorption capacity of nico2o4 towards uranium they synthesised ultrathin nanosheets of nico2o4 on rgo by a co precipitation of ni2 and co2 followed by calcinations process from bet analysis the pore volume and surface area of the nico2o4 was found to be 0 42 cm3g 1 and 123 2 m2g 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 342 4 mg g at ph 5 0 the adsorption process was best described by pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm another class of metal oxide which received great attention in last few years for uranium removal due to its non toxicity and high chemical stability was titanium dioxide tio2 in this regard yu et al 158 prepared 3d graphene tio2 nanocomposite 3d ga tio2 used for the elimination of radionuclides the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be in the order of 3d ga tio2 go rgo tio2 441 3 mg g 280 0 mg g 140 9 mg g 98 5 mg g at ph 5 pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm was well fitted which corresponds to the chemisorption and monolayer adsorption some other notable studies in literature are also reported 150 159 163 3 1 5 go mofs composites recently yang et al 164 fabricated the one of a kind go cooh uio 66 composite for the u vi adsorption by coordinating the zirconium ion of uio 66 with the carboxyl groups of go upon contact with a 512 29 mg l uranium solution the go cooh uio 66 composite exhibited a greater adsorption capacity 1097 mg g than uio 66 1012 mg g guo et al 165 explored the unique antifouling and adsorption properties of the go ag zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 gza it was prepared by bonding of ag doped zif 67 on the go surface via coordination of ag metal with oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go to evaluate the practical applicability of the adsorbent the adsorption was evaluated on spiked natural sea water with 200 mg l uranium concentration and the results evaluate that the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 602 41 mg g at ph 7 0 and 298 k in addition the adsorbent showed excellent uranium removal rate from in presence of coexisting elements in real seawater 3 1 6 go cnts composites gu et al 166 prepared the graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts aerogels by intercalation of cnts between the graphene sheets which resulted in increased layer spacing and tremendously enhanced the adsorption capacity towards u vi adsorption the results demonstrate that at initial concentration of u vi co 50 mg l the go cnts aerogels showed maximum adsorption capacity of 100 mg l at ph 5 and 298 k which is attributed to the additional active sites on the surface of aerogels adsorption kinetics and isotherms was well fitted with pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm another new class of adsorbent which was explored by wang et al 72 was graphene oxide nanoribbons gonrs which is defined as nanometers wide stripes of graphene and prepared by modified tour s method to unzip multiwalled cnts to prepare gonrs sem ftir and xps analysis demonstrated that abundant oxygen containing functional groups like cooh oh are present on surface and edge of nanoribbons that form strong surface complexes with u vi ions on the surfaces of gonr resulting in high adsorption capacity the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 437 1 mg g at ph 4 5 and 298 k which was high in comparison to various adsorbents in terms of regeneration this adsorbent showed desorption efficiency of 97 5 by 0 5 mol l hcl after 5 cycles 3 1 7 miscellaneous go composite bentonite clay has great adsorption affinity towards heavy metals due to its high surface area and high cation exchange capacity 167 so studies have been done for removal of uranium by improving its adsorption capacity by grafting it with graphene oxide in this regard liu et al 168 prepared go bentonite composite by graft polymerization epoxy chloropropane and ammonium persulfate sodium bisulphate were used as cross linker and initiator respectively the results demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 234 19 mg g at neutral ph and 303 k research on the fabrication and potential uses of sulfonated graphene has also been reported zhang et al 75 successfully synthesised sulfonated graphene oxide gos via vapor solid transfer reaction of graphene oxide go using fuming sulfonic acid 50 so3 h2 so4 sem and tem images showed smoother and thinner sheet structure of gos compared to go it s possible that this is because the incorporation of hydrophilic so3h groups prevents the aggregation of gos sheets results showed gos exhibited excellent adsorption behaviour for u vi with the maximum adsorption capacity of 309 09 mg g another notable work reported in literature is of graphene oxide nanosheets being linked to clay mineral by performing organomodification on commercially available sepiolite surface 169 the adsorption of uranium on these adsorbents were found to increase in the order sepiolite 89 3 mg g go 119 8 mg g go sepiolite 161 3 mg g the mechanism of uranium adsorption on go sepiolite composites was found to be surface complexation under alkaline conditions and ion exchange at low ph other notable studies reported in literature are 170 173 3 2 biochar based adsorbents for u vi removal although many types of adsorbents exist in practice their usage is limited due to relatively high cost non sustainability and complicated manufacturing processes and application 174 biochar with different surface modifications shows high adsorption capacities towards uranium removal from aqueous medium and it is considered as the sustainable low cost alternative adsorbent 175 the abundance of surface functional groups high porosity large surface area and excellent ion exchange capacity results in a significantly high adsorption efficiency of biochar based adsorbents 176 besides its good adsorption performance biochar shows the advantages of simple synthesis and application facile functionalization stable structure enhanced physicochemical properties and other environmental advantages like the energy co production carbon sequestration and biowaste valorisation to increase biochar s adsorption capacity and environmental applicability modification of raw biochar prepared by hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis is a current research focus 177 181 these modifications include surface oxidation and modification with chelating ligands doping with desired element magnetization surface coating with metal oxides and loading of nanoparticles to obtain biochar nanocomposites 182 184 the main adsorption properties between biochar based adsorbents and u vi are given in table 2 3 2 1 hydrothermally carbonized biochar the hydrothermally generated biochar is hypothesised to have higher affinity for adsorption of dissolved u vi due to the presence of oxygen rich functional groups on its surface hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomass results in formation of a carbon rich black solid an insoluble product in the temperature range of 180 350 c 185 earliest notable research revealed usage of switchgrass as precursor for synthesis of hydrothermally modified biochar hmb a porous and amorphous solid 186 the presence of functional groups hydroxyl phenolic carbonyl and carboxyl was confirmed from ft ir analysis and these groups on the biochar surface adds substantial cation exchange capacity and also provides an excellent opportunity to adsorb uranium from the aqueous solution furthermore by the tg analysis hmb was found to be more thermally stable as an adsorbent in comparison to raw biomass like peat poplar sawdust and coconut shells batch experiments demonstrated maximum adsorption 90 of u vi at ph 5 9 with maximum adsorption capacity of 2 12 mg of u g two years later zhang et al 187 produced biochar from pine needles at 180 c in citric acid solution by hydrothermal carbonization htc sem analysis revealed a lot of carbon particles on the surface of htc indicating the successful carbonization and hydrolyzation of pine needles batch experiments demonstrated maximum adsorption capacity of 62 7 mg of u g at ph 6 0 and excellent equilibrium time of 50 min the desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent was also performed to check the economic viability of adsorbent and showed 99 desorption efficiency researchers observed that pristine biochars obtained by hydrothermal treatment needed some modifications for enhanced adsorption characteristics ioannou et al 188 investigated u vi adsorption on oxidized biochar fibres ocf derived from lufa cylindrica plant fibres by hydrothermal carbonization and further modified it with mno2 deposition ocf mno2 adsorption process was very well fitted by the langmuir isotherm which showed maximum sorption capacity for ocf as 95 71 mg g and it increased to an astonishing 904 24 mg g after modification mno2 colloidal particles formation on the biochar surface offers an enormous amount of surface and hydroxyl groups for metal ion adsorption which results in this exceptional sorption capacity sem images fig 6b clearly showed distinct mno2 crystallites formation on biochar surface white spots the creation of stable complexes e g mn o u vi on the surface of the modified material was attributed to the formation of a bidentate surface complex 189 190 another manganese oxide doped adsorbent research was done recently wang et al 191 synthesised a novel algal biochar cb from rhizoclonium riparium algae by hydrothermal carbonization and then modified it with δ mno2 mno2 cb the sorption isotherm was better fitted by the freundlich isotherm model and the maximum sorption capacity of u vi at ph 6 0 and 289 k was 100 2 mg g for the sorbent after δ mno2 particles are embedded in the filamentous biochar specific surface area results in a dramatic increase of 200 63 7 m2g 1 moreover the reusability of the mno2 cb 94 8 after 5 cycles further ensured its promising candidature for u vi elimination in wastewater which can also reduce the cost in practical applications and will be environmentally sustainable ye et al 192 successfully synthesised a biochar lrbc by hydrothermal carbonization using luffa ratan agricultural residue as precursor material further it was oxidized and transformed into functionalized lrbc f lrbc by hummer method to be used for u vi sorption the results showed that the maximum sorption capacities reached 382 mg g at ph 6 0 and 298 k the sem study of surface morphologies reveals that the basic texture of the modified biochar is preserved in comparison to the original biochar but the surface of the f lrbc becomes rougher and irregular which in turn facilitates binding to uranyl ions in solution according to the xrd results fig 7a the increased crystallinity of the functionalized biomass charcoal over the original biochar accounted for the 14 shift in the diffraction peak tga data fig 7b reveal that at 110 c biochar loses around 2 of its weight due to the evaporation of the physically adsorbed water 3 2 2 pyrolyzed biochar for pyrolysis literature shows that plant derived biochar is the most desirable option for scientists due to abundant availability low cost and eco friendly nature mishra et al 193 prepared biochar from eucalyptus wood through pyrolysis the maximum adsorption of u vi with initial concentration co 100 mg l was found to be 95 at ph 5 5 with equilibrium time 20 min while maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 27 2 mg g from best fitted langmuir isotherm close comparison of ft ir spectra of pristine biochar and uranium loaded biochar concluded that peaks at 1746 cm 1 corresponds to c o of carboxylic group 1460 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of carboxylate group 1016 cm 1 co stretching polysaccharides were found to be missing in uranium loaded biochar because of uranium adsorption xps spectrum of pristine biochar and uranium loaded biochar was compared and showed that along with common peaks of c 1 s n k and br atoms one peak of uranium at 377 63 ev was observed in uranium loaded biochar in survey scan this peak was further deconvoluted into 381 5 ev and 392 3 ev which corresponds to u 4f7 2 and u 4f5 2 a year later li et al 194 prepared biochar from camphor tree leaves bc ctl through pyrolysis process in tubular furnace at 350 c for 6 h potassium hydroxide koh was used during pyrolysis to remove the organic matter increasing the pore volume surface area and reactive surface functional groups the surface of bt ctl was positively charged below phzpc 5 76 due to protonation of functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups and easy deprotonation above phzpc which corresponds to the electronegativity of bc ctl and cause electrostatic interaction between u vi and active sites in ph range of 6 5 7 5 the comparison order of various kinetic models on basis of regression coefficient r2 for removal of u vi shows pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich kinetic equation from this order it was concluded that it was a case of chemisorption langmuir isotherm was best fitted and maximum adsorption capacity values q max increase from 98 29 mg g to 110 mg g 1 from t 293 k to t 333 k gulihen et al 195 worked extensively on biochar synthesis using macauba endocarp a palm tree shell as precursor material in this study the endocarp was subjected to six different pyrolytic temperatures 250 c 650 c aiming to evaluate the effect of the pyrolytic temperature on the biochar derived for the removal of u vi from aqueous solutions gyf measurements and later further study revealed that only biochars produced at 250 c bc250 and 350 c bc350 were of practical significance two years later further improvements of this selected material were done by doing the physical activation 196 the adsorption capacity of bc350 for uranyl ions in aqueous solutions was greatly improved by co2 physical activation qmax 488 7 mg g with over 99 removal for an initial u vi concentration of 5 mg l the activation method increased porosity by increasing the specific surface area from 0 83 to 643 m2 g the redlich peterson three parameter equation isotherm model was the most appropriate for fitting the experimental data suggesting heterogeneity of adsorption sites with different affinities for uranium setting up as a hybrid adsorption mechanism 197 the biochar showed its potential as a promising material for u vi removal from aqueous solutions in multi stage systems hno3 activation of pyrolyzed biochar is another effective technique hadjittofi et al 198 produced activated biochar via pyrolysis of o ficus indica cactus fibres and then oxidized it with hno3 for u vi adsorption application 199 pseudo first order and freundlich isotherm model well fitted the adsorption process showing high qmax value of 214 mg g even in acidic conditions ph 3 0 according to sem the material consists of a highly aligned series of lamellar structures that provide sorbent microchannels and an enlarged surface for quick fluid exchange and improved sorption capacity the ftir spectra demonstrate unambiguously that the activation of hno3 results in the formation of inner sphere complexes with the surface carboxylic moieties which are plentiful on the lamellar structures of bio sorbents jin et al 200 reported the adsorption of uranium on nitric acid treated biochar produced form wheat straw and cow manure the q max of u vi by the biochars at ph 4 5 and t 298 k decreased in the order of acid modified wheat straw 355 6 mg g acid modified cow manure 73 3 mg g pristine cow manure 64 0 mg g pristine wheat straw 8 7 mg g the apparently high adsorption capacity of acid modified wheat straw was due to the enhancement of cooh groups on the surface firstly these groups increase the surface hydrophilicity of the biochars and make suitable for uranium removal 201 secondly the carboxylic groups attached to the condensed aromatic rings on the surface of biochar which can form strong surface complexes with u vi 202 studies have shown that chemical oxidation of pyrolyzed biochar improves the adsorption results significantly yakout et al 77 pyrolyzed rice straw to produce biochar and then subjected it to liquid phase oxidation using different oxidizing agents in order to obtain materials with various surface characteristics among all biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c and modified by kmno4 was named as bk5 and showed remarkable adsorptive removal 99 3 of u vi at ph 5 5 with qmax of 100 mg g in terms of surface chemistry bk5 exhibited highest surface area 143 m2 g and maximum microporosity among all modified biochars therefore showing maximum adsorption towards uranium further in 2021 ahmed et al 180 pyrolyzed rice straw to generate biochar rsbc and then chemically oxidized it to obtain a modified biochar rsbc ox the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model was 242 65 mg g eds analysis reported that the oxygen content rose after modifying rsbc ox with nitric acid resulting in an increase in oxygen containing groups which improved the adsorption capacity of rsbc ox towards u vi introduction of mno2 particles has also been reported to increase the properties of pyrolyzed biochars towards u vi sorption much like hydrothermally synthesised biochar discussed above li et al 203 pyrolyzed ficus microcarpa aerial root fmar a plant biomass at 600 c for 2 h to obtain biochar for u vi adsorption the redlich peterson model and the pseudo second order kinetic model best described the process the sorption capacity of the modified fmar biochar 14 72 mg g was found to be higher than that of the raw biochar 6 30 mg g after kmno4 modification numerous characterization techniques sem eds ftir xps demonstrated that an increase in oh content and the development of an irregular sheet like nanostructure with mno2 nanoparticles on the biochar surfaces considerably increased the adsorption of u vi researchers 204 pyrolyzed orange peel at 650 c to obtain pristine biochar opc and then enhanced it with mno2 in situ deposition technique this novel biochar mno2 opc yielded the most competitive uptake value as 246 3 mg g described by langmuir isotherm model sem analysis revealed that number of pores increased after loading mno2 and meanwhile the specific surface area increased 165 01 m2 g for opc to 273 25 m2 g for 1 2mno2 opc as the loading amount increased till 1 6mno2 opc this was attributed to the redox reaction between manganese sulphate and kmno4 used during synthesis of biochar the eds analysis confirmed the main elemental composition of oxygen manganese carbon and binding uranium after adsorption process researchers also worked on animal derived biochars for more efficient u vi remediation as compared to plant derived biochar animal manure derived biochar has a higher concentration of po4 3 co3 2 which aids in the adsorption of heavy metal ions by animal manure derived biochar 205 in 2021 liao et al 181 synthesised three kinds of pig manure biochars pmbc by calcining pig manure pm pre treated with different agents in nitrogen the pm modified by h2o h2o2 and kmno4 were named pm h2o pm hp and pm pp respectively the modified biochars showed exceptional sorption capacities 979 3 mg g and 661 7 mg g by pm pp pmhp respectively the crystalline grains on pm pp were roughly spherical and homogeneously dispersed as validated by sem tem examination and thus supplied extra adsorption sites for adsorbing u vi after the successful experiment on pig derived biochar liao et al 206 explored further and synthesised bi2o3 doped horse manure derived biochar bi2o3 hmdb by slow pyrolysis technology at 500 c the biochar showed short equilibrium time 80 min a fast adsorption rate 5 0 mg g min and excellent sorption capacity qmax of 516 5 mg g on u vi removal with r2 values of 0 999 0 998 pso and langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorption process compared to others furthermore elemental mapping revealed that the nanoparticles on bi2o3 hmdb were mostly made up of o and bi confirming that bi2o3 was doped into the biochar successfully and uniformly the results also revealed that the bi2o3 hmdb had a removal effectiveness of almost 99 7 with only about 0 009 mg l u vi remaining in the solution much below the world health organization standard of 0 030 mg l 207 3 2 3 magnetized biochar the magnetization of biochars is a cost effective method that facilitates phase separation which in turn reduces secondary pollution problems faced by pristine and other modified biochars 208 it also improves their adsorption capacity for u vi removal the modification using metal salts or metal oxides can drastically enhance the characteristics of the materials as regards adsorption catalysis and magnetism wang et al 209 modified a pyrolyzed rice husk biochar bc via an aqueous fe3 solution treatment and used it for pb ii and u vi removal the results demonstrated that the ion exchange and complexation activity between biochar and metal ions was significantly enhanced by the presence of fe oxides in magnetized biochar mbc the adsorption experimental data were well simulated with the assumptions of pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models with qmax being 64 mg g and 118 mg g at 328 k for bc and mbc respectively due to the inclusion of fexoy mbc had a 100 increase in bet surface area and micropore volume compared to bc 52 1 m2 g 0 02 cm3 g according to sem micrographs the magnetic modification procedure produced a biochar with a rough surface and a lot of micro spheres and mineral particles which can offer a lot of adsorption spots increasing the biochar s adsorption capacity in another similar study magnetic biochar composite mb was successfully synthesised by pyrolysis of siderite and rice husk biochars at 550 c under n2 protection 210 batch adsorption experiments were governed by langmuir isotherm showing qmax of 52 63 mg gat 288 k sem edx analysis showed the presence of fine granular nanoparticles of fe3o4 attached on the surface of porous fibrous structure in line with previous study 211 u vi adsorbed onto mb was reduced to u iv by fe3o4 according to xps and xanes analyses further in 2021 a lot of advances was done in magnetisation of biochars ahmed et al 179 pyrolyzed citrus lannatus seeds a watermelon biowaste to obtain pristine biochar bc and then magnetized it with mnfe2o4 by co precipitation method 212 this magnetized biochar mfbc showed enhanced adsorption capacity qmax of27 61 mg g compared to bc qmax of21 24 mg g at ph 4 0 with a saturation magnetization of 36 28 emu g mf bc shows potential for widespread use in wastewater treatment thanks to its ability to facilitate a simple magnetic separation the structural porosity of the biochars was calculated using n2 adsorption desorption fig 8 and the desorption curve of mf bc was found to represent the type iv loop in accordance with iupac standards 213 ahmed et al 214 researched further and magnetized pristine biochar obtained from tribulus terrestris a plant biomass by two different methods using fecl3 both adsorbents 1s bc and 2s bc were studied and showed decent sorption capacity of 49 56 mg g and 66 mg g respectively five consecutive regeneration cycles verified an excellent reusability 95 for 1s bc further some impressive research was done in year 2020 21 wang et al 215 synthesised a magnetic biochar composite fe3o4 mb by hydrothermal treatment using cyanobacterium derived pristine biochar mb as precursor material the results showed the maximum sorption capacity of 52 06 mg g at ph 6 0 and 298 k according to the ftir and xps analysis under further investigations it was found that u vi sorption on composite was mainly ascribed to the surface complexation between u vi and oxygen containing functional groups oh c o on the surface of biochar the sharp increase of o content 7 98 and fe content 100 in eds spectra illustrated the successful fabrication of ferric oxide mb composite sen et al 216 synthesised a silicon containing activated biochar supporting iron oxide nanoparticle sb fe using rice husks for u vi adsorption from the contaminant groundwater the maximum adsorption capacity from the langmuir isothermal model was recorded as 138 88 mg g at ph 5 5 zhang et al 217 prepared activated biochar loaded nano zero valent iron a bc nzvi composite by aqueous phase reduction and magnetization using biomass longan shells as carbon source the results showed that the sorbent displayed an efficient sorption ability in u vi remediation with maximum adsorption capacity reaching 331 13 mg g at ph 6 0 the characteristic diffraction peaks fig 9a of a bc and nzvi was observed to be retained in the a bc nzvi material suggesting the successful synthesis of a bc nzvi from ftir image fig 9b we infer that the sorbent withheld original characteristic bands along with generation of a new weak signal at 685 cm 1 which was attributed to the feo bond formed between bc and nzvi as seen in fig 9d surface area of a bc nzvi sbet was found to be785 81 m2 g a 32 7 loss as compared to a bc due to blocking of micropores of biochar by the introduction of iron particles the phzpc value fig 9e of a bc nzvi was 6 2 implying electrostatic interactions affect the u vi removal at different ph values speaking of latest research in 2022 researchers pyrolyzed waste watermelon rind to obtain pristine biochar wbc and then magnetized it mwbc by co precipitation method to treat u vi contaminated water 218 due to the magnetic particles imbedded on its surface wbc had a larger surface area 65 7 pore volume adsorption capabilities 138 and stability which aided its separation from the aqueous phase due to the external magnetic field the u vi adsorption of mwbc showed a qmax of 323 56 mg g at ph 4 0 which was higher than that of watermelon rind biochar wbc 135 86 mg g around 99 removal capacity was achieved by the third cycle with a drop in uranium content within who criteria indicating that the synthesised adsorbent may be employed in real world applications such as uranium polluted industries and pharmaceutical wastes 3 2 4 miscellaneous biochar composites previous studies showed that most biochar adsorbents were of wood or plant origin but ashry et al 219 used biochar produced from gasification of cow bone rich in ca phosphate for uranium removal a freundlich adsorption isotherm coupled to a reversible first order kinetic equation best described the time dependent fixation of u vi within the biochar structure based on experimental data for ph 7 elemental analysis from icp ms confirmed the presence of ca and p in good proportion furthermore surface morphology through sem confirmed the grains of ca and p in association with carbon matrix in 2021 ahmed et al 51 successfully synthesised a hydroxyapatite hap biochar nanocomposite br hap from rice straw biochar br by co precipitation method to be used as a new and efficient adsorbent for removing u vi from aqueous solution it was shown that br and br hap had maximal u vi adsorption capabilities of 110 56 mg g and 428 25 mg g respectively eds analysis confirmed the successful modification of biochar leading to enhanced oxygenated functional groups by showing a consistent elemental distribution and greater oxygen content in br hap akl et al 220 fabricated a new orange peel biochar based hydrogel composite by graft polymerization using guar gum and acrylamide ggamb themaximum adsorption capacity of the ggamb hydrogel composite based on the langmuir isotherm model was 263 2 mg g and the adsorption equilibrium was attained at 150 min biochar micrograph as seen in sem images revealed a smooth nonporous and less uneven surface whereas the ggamb composite showed a rougher porous and irregular surface morphology which is desirable for uranium vi adsorption in the same year liu et al 221 synthesised novel biochar supported by starch and nanoscale iron sulfide sfes biochar composites and derived from peanut shell 222 u vi uptake from aqueous solution by sfes biochar composites were carried out which followed freundlich isotherm and showed qmax of 76 39 mg g at 298 k deposition of two major elements fe and s on the surface of sfes biochar as seen in eds spectrum fig 10 confirmed the successful loading of fes nanoparticles on the surface of biochar 3 3 activated carbon based adsorbents for u vi removal activated carbon is a proven effective adsorbent for the treatment of a wide variety of pollutants 58 223 228 activated carbon s low cost and ease of production as well as its extended service life high internal surface area and porosity and chemical and thermal stability make it a promising candidate as an economical and effective adsorbent for heavy metal removal from wastewaters the main adsorption properties between activated carbon based adsorbents and u vi are given in table 3 earliest notable study present in literature data of this century is of 2006 when researchers used granulated activated carbon to examine u vi adsorption from aqueous solutions and got exceptional results qmax 28 3 mg g at 293 k 97 the exothermic adsorption process well fitted by the freundlich isotherm model at ph 3 0 0 1 and 0 1 g of activated carbon the highest elimination of u vi 98 was recorded the activation energy ea of 7 91 kj mol indicated physical adsorption of u vi onto activated carbon further researchers studied the adsorption of u vi cesium and strontium ions as a function of contact time and metal ion concentration from aqueous solutions onto a commercial activated carbon gcn1240 obtained by physical activation of coconut shell 98 adsorption process followed assumptions of pseudo first order kinetics and agrees well with both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models revealing qmax of 55 32 mg g sem observation clearly showed the porous structure of the carbon the same year yakout et al 229 investigated adsorptive competition between uranium vi and humic acids ha using rice straw activated carbon modified with koh rsk carbon langmuir isotherm well fitted the adsorption process showing qmax of 100 mg g the interaction of uranium ions with ha resulted in the creation of u ha complexes which altered the surface interactions of both uranium ions and ha with the carbon surface according to the findings humic substance is a significant uranium binding inhibitor and should be eliminated from wastewater for uranium remediation yi et al 230 studied the adsorption of uranyl cations uo2 2 by apricot shell activated carbon asac in a batch system the optimal ph for favourable u vi adsorption was 6 0 as the effect of u vi adsorption was significantly ph dependent the adsorption mechanism followed both langmuir and freundlich models assumptions while exhibiting a qmax of 59 17 mg g research studies showed that magnetisation of activated carbon significantly increased its u vi sorption ability for example researchers synthesised nanoscale zero valent iron supported on activated charcoal nzvi ac by the reduction of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate with sodium borohydride and the adsorption capacity reached an exceptional 492 6 mg g according to the freundlich isotherm model 231 saleh et al 232 succeeded in synthesising polyethyleneimine modified activated carbon fe paf and using it as an effective magnetic adsorbent under optimal conditions u vi adsorption onto paf followed the langmuir isotherm model with a qmax of 115 31 mg g the nitrogen and oxygen containing functional groups contributed to adsorption and improved the adsorbent s effectiveness after modification zhang et al 233 synthesised magnetic activated carbons macs from orange peel by co functionalization of poly dopamine pda and ag nanoparticles for the recovery of u vi from simulated seawater compared with macs 632 91 mg g at ph 7 0 this novel sorbent s macs pda ag calculated maximum adsorption capacity increased to 657 89 mg g at ph 8 0 and showed good recyclability the appearance of fe o fe stretching vibration 595 cm 1 in ftir spectra confirmed the successful fabrication of macs furthermore the appearance of phenolic co stretching vibration 1240 cm 1 and the shearing vibration of nh 1519 cm 1 reveal that the pda layer is incorporated on macs in 2018 haddad et al 234 did surface modification of commercially activated carbon ac and prepared two new activated carbons by achieving nitric acid oxidation ox ac and iron chloride impregnation fe ac to remove uranium vi ions from aqueous solutions the adsorption performance of the examined adsorbents was categorised as ac ox ac fe ac 9 51 14 41 38 01 mg g based on the experimental data this is related to the amount of oxygen content in the adsorbent ftir analysis revealed that the emergence of new bands depicted that the cooh groups are introduced on the surface of carbon after the treatment of ox ac and fe ac with nitric acid and kmno4 respectively the xrd pattern of the iron impregnated sample fe ac revealed two peaks between 33 and 40 and 54 65 which may be attributed to the crystalline structures of pure α fe2o3 icdd 00 033 0664 confirming that iron was deposited as ferric oxide on the carbon layer s surface owing to their special affinity for uranium ions amidoxime modified adsorbents have also proven to be one of the most promising candidates for uranium extraction from aqueous systems 235 liu et al 236 synthesised amidoxime based activated carbon and surface of adsorbent carbon became rougher after u vi adsorption due to remarkable number of particles being disposed on its surface fig 11 emergence of several new peaks c n nh2 no in the ftir spectrum confirmed that the amidoxime groups were grafted onto activated carbon successfully phosphoric acid activation is also reported to be an efficient method for modification of adsorbents pu et al 237 prepared activated carbon ac from waste cigarette filters by convenient carbonization and functionalization this eco friendly sorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 106 mg g for u vi removal after functionalization with phosphoric acid much higher than the untreated activated carbon 31 mg g and the adsorption selectivity is very desirable the emergence of peak at 920 cm 1 of ftir spectra may be attributed to the influence of p element another phosphorous containing activated carbon synthesised as a potential sorbent for uranium vi is reported in literature is of haggag et al 238 phosphate activated carbon pac was derived from pistachio nutshells and showed qmax of 337 mg g at ph 3 5 the chemical activation process was found effective in creating a large surface area with well developed pores of different sizes and shapes on the surface of pistachio nutshell activated carbon tem image revealed the micro mesoporous structure and confirmed amorphous nature of the sorbent another researcher synthesised camellia oleifera shell based activated carbon cosac by phosphoric acid activation method and further used it to remove u vi from the aqueous solution in a batch system 239 the results showed that maximum sorption capacity and removal efficiency reached 78 93 mg g and 89 1 at optimum conditions the ph was found to be one of the most critical parameters affecting the adsorption of u vi with optimum results being observed at 5 5 bet research revealed that cosac has a high specific surface area of 1300 m2 g and a large total pore volume of 0 9 cm3 g both of which are essential for high performance adsorbents saputra et al 240 synthesised a coconut shell derived adsorbent via chemical activation with naoh and an impregnation method involving various solutions of mgcl2 the results demonstrated that equilibrium data are well described by the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of around 85 mg g at 303 k ftir and xrd spectra revealed the presence of brucite mg oh 2 compounds confirming the successful impregnation in 2020 aslani et al 241 synthesised ac pan active carbon polyacrylonitrile composite and investigated it in a batch system for uranium sorption aiming for uranium remediation from nuclear wastewater the qmax was found to be 28 45 mg g at 303 k thermodynamic parameters indicated the adsorption process to be exothermic spontaneous and favourable in the same year researchers prepared a novel sorbent by coating nano hydroxyapatite on activated carbon hap ac and immobilising into the alginate matrix hap ac alginate was found to be highly efficient 92 for removing uranium from the portable water with qmax of 18 66 mg g evaluated from langmuir isotherm 242 the xrd spectrum of the synthesised compound displayed the presence of the hexagonal crystal structure of the hydroxyapatite phase further a great deal of notable work was accomplished in 2021 researchers from egypt worked to mitigate uranium contamination in groundwater by developing cost effective graphite based activated carbon ac and then functionalized it by oxidation o ac and amination n o ac 243 the adsorption process was governed by langmuir isotherm which showed a maximum sorption capacity of 32 45 mg g 73 41 mg g for o ac n o ac respectively zhang et al 244 prepared phosphorylated activated carbon from silk gourd loofah rattan by phosphoric acid modification and the maximum sorption capacity was recorded to be 197 mg g nezhad et al 245 used carbon powder waste cpw from the zirconium carbide industry as the raw material for the preparation of activated modified carbon adsorbent which was used for uranium removal from radioactive waste effluents of the nuclear industry the sorbent was activated by koh and then oxidized by ammonium persulphate aps which further enhanced its uranium removal efficiency through carboxylic acid functional groups a cpw cooh the freundlich and timken models did not suit the sorption isotherms as well as the langmuir model which showed the maximal u vi sorption capacity as 192 31 mg g as a result of oxidation with aps the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc reduced from 9 7 for acpw to 3 1 for a cpw cooh showing that the acidic functional groups cooh are well formed on the surface of the sorbent nezhad et al 246 further functionalised this sorbent by using 2 aminobenzoic acid aba as a selective ligand for uo2 2 adsorption the langmuir model under optimal conditions determined the maximum sorption capacity of this new sorbent ac aba to be 194 2 mg g indicating that the modification method has increased the sorption capacity eds analysis indicates a notable uptick in the concentrations of oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen following the modification with a desorption efficacy of 98 after five sequential sorption desorption cycles 1 0 mol l hcl can successfully desorb u vi from ac aba preparing it for the next regeneration cycle 3 4 regeneration of carbon based adsorbents apart from water recovery regeneration of carbon adsorbent and recovery of adsorbed uranium is a critical issue to ensure greenness of the process for the recycling of both components adsorbent recovery not only reduce the overall cost of the process but also ensure the utility of the spent adsorbent in similar or related applications various regeneration methods such as thermal regeneration supercritical fluid extraction biological method advance oxidative method ozonation etc have been used in past for the regeneration of carbon based adsorbents 247 however few common issues encountered during these methods are high regeneration cost adsorbent deterioration long recovery periods and secondary environmental pollution keeping these issues in mind solvent desorption approach is the most recommended method used in the regeneration process in industries and laboratory studies we refer to the entire process of adsorption which results in spent adsorbent and desorption which results in new adsorption from spent adsorbent as one cycle desorbing eluents like hcl naoh and nacl are used in specific molar concentrations mostly 0 1 1 5 m in order to better understand the desorption process researchers typically do adsorption experiments across several cycles usually 5 6 desorption efficiency can be determined by the following formula desorption efficiency c des c ads 100 where cdes is the concentration of adsorbate desorbed in mg g and cads is the concentration of adsorbate adsorbed in mg g desorption studies of some researchers are already discussed briefly in this paper some other notable studies that showed desorption efficiency of 90 after 5 cycles are also reported in literature 75 139 148 191 246 4 performance evaluation of carbon based adsorbents by partition coefficient uranium species bound to various type of carbon based adsorbents through electrostatic functional groups complexation and vander walls interactions as depicted in fig 12 however the overall effectiveness of a uranium adsorption process has been demonstrated by maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at equilibrium conditions when comparing adsorbent performances it is technically more appropriate to use a nonbiased parameter because experimental variables such as initial adsorbate concentration adsorbent dosage and contact time vary substantially throughout published research in this regard partition coefficient which is defined as the ratio of equilibrium concentrations of a dissolved substance in a two phase system allow impartial judgment while comparing adsorbent performances it produces a normalised value that allows for fair comparisons among adsorbents despite the broad variety of initial experimental conditions the partition coefficient is derived from the ratio of the maximum adsorption capacity mg g to the equilibrium adsorbate concentration μm in the media partition coefficient adsorption capacity of u species on adsorbent mg g equilibrium adsorbate concentration μm the pc values determined for various carbon based adsorbents are given in tables 1 3 as such the reduced graphene oxide adenosine 5 monophosphate 155 gives the highest pc value as 1028 mg g μm 1 among all those go adsorbents reported in table 1 another intriguing aspect of pc is that it can be utilized as a quick method for gauging potential bias in evaluating performance only on the basis of adsorption capacity for example with a very high qmax of 602 41 mg g of graphene zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 165 pc value is calculated as 2 39 mg g μm 1 only whereas polydopamine go 146 has pc value of 34 62 mg g μm 1 with a qmax of 145 39 mg g the observed superiority of polydopamine go may reflect the large surface area and high concentration of oxygen containing functional groups a high pc value indicates that polydopamine go is successfully removing about 99 u from a solution initial u concentration of 10 mg l at a ph of 4 0 for biochar based adsorbents animal derived biochar performed best whereas magnetized biochars fell short with the highest pc value reaching 66 78 mg g μm 1 for activated biochar magnetized with nano zero valent iron 217 in case of activated carbon based adsorbents usage of high adsorbent dosage was reported to be the reason for low pc 5 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of uranium adsorption can be understood by various methods including ftir analysis xps analysis ph investigation contact time and dft calculations etc 5 1 mechanism by techniques there are two main techniques ftir and xps used for the confirmation of uranium adsorption and qualitative and quantitative determination 5 1 1 ftir analysis ftir analysis helps to determine adsorption of uranium ions on the surface of material by the variation in frequencies of particular functional groups after the adsorption along with the appearance of a low intensity band corresponding to uranium it is obvious from most of the studies that a low intensity band in the range of 910 cm 1 to 920 cm 1 appears in the ftir spectrum of material after the adsorption of uranium which is attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of o u o species table 4 as the concentration of uranium ion increases intensity of peaks appearing at 920 cm 1 also increases as shown in fig 13 198 the intensity of other peaks corresponding to the functional groups present in the materials generally lowers after the interaction with u vi ions this is due to the fact that lone pair of electrons or negative charge of functional groups were neutralized by positively charged uranium species table 4 shows that all types of materials including graphene based materials biochar based materials and activated carbon based materials can be effectively used for the uranium adsorption which can be detected by ftir spectroscopy in graphene functionalized materials the presence of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on the basal plane of graphene oxide go and other modified functionalities take part in uranium sorption various research groups show that amidoxime functionalization on graphene sheets are highly effective in removal of uranium species from aqueous solution 120 248 250 in biochar modified materials hydroxyl and carbonyl groups generally interact with uranium ions for the remediation process similarly activated carbon based materials contained oxidized functional groups which are responsible for the removal of u vi ions table 4 some other studies reviewed for table 4 description are 151 251 253 5 1 2 xps analysis sorption mechanism of uranium can be well understood by xps analysis using binding energy values for various elemental configurations the deconvoluted xps spectrum of particular element clearly shows the shifting in binding energies after the adsorption of uranium ions in xps spectrum the presence of peaks in the range of 380 ev u 4f5 2 to 395 u 4f7 2ev confirms the successful adsorption of uranium ions on the surface of material various graphene and activated carbon based materials have been used for uranium adsorption and the mechanism of sorption was confirmed by shifting in peaks in xps analysis as shown in table 5 the study of wang et al 191 showed that two peaks at 381 8 ev and 392 5 ev were observed fig 14a these peaks were attributed to u vi ions u 4f5 2and u 4f7 2 respectively fig 14b the binding energies of c 1s n 1s and o 1s shift from the original values after the interaction with uranium ions the relative amounts of peaks were decreased after the adsorption due to occupation of some active sites by uranium ions they show that the percentage of cc co and o c o in mno2 cb a biochar based material were reduced from 23 1 to 20 6 69 3 to 66 3 and 10 6 to 10 1 respectively after the sorption of uranium fig 14c and d the intensities of o 1s and mn 2p were changed after sorption of u vi ions fig 14e and f some studies revealed that the binding energies of n 1s o1s and c 1s were same after the adsorption of uranium but intensities of peaks decreased due to the formation of complex with oxygen or nitrogen and uranium vi ion 215 various other recent reports 254 explained the adsorption mechanism of uranium using xps analysis as shown in table 5 5 2 mechanism by parameters 5 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the solution greatly affects the adsorption of uranium ions in two aspects i behaviour of uranium species at different ph such as uo2 2 oh 2 uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 4 oh 7 uo2 oh 3 and uo2 3 oh 7 as shown in fig 15a 155 and ii surface charge of the adsorbent materials shown in fig 15b 255 these two parameters are generally considered to explain the adsorption mechanism of uranium ions in general it is found from most of the studies that sorption process of u vi ions increases on increasing the ph of solution 155 256 258 this is due to the protonation of oxygen and nitrogen functionalities at low ph which makes them unavailable for binding with positively charged uranium species however when ph of the solution increases the concentration of hydronium ion also decreases resulting in formation of more negatively charged species that can interact with positively charged uranium ions and remove them in some reports it is observed that amount of uranium ion adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent increases to some extent on increasing ph and then starts decreasing this is due to the formation of negative charged uranium species uo2 oh 3 and uo2 3 oh 7 which hinders the sorption process by repulsion with negatively charged functional groups table 6 in a very recent study 259 a graphene oxide functionalized material was used for the adsorptive removal of various metal ions including u vi pb ii cr vi and cd ii it was found that the maximum removal of metal ions occurred at ph 5 which was 92 4 in case of uranium elashry et al 259 reported 94 5 removal of u vi ion from aqueous solution using quinoline functionalized activated carbon at ph 4 7 another significant study is of wang et al 250 which showed that u vi adsorption increased with increasing ph these results showed that effect of ph on removal efficiency of u vi ion varied with types of material or in more specific way types of functional groups present on material 5 2 2 effect of contact time another important parameter for the investigation of adsorption mechanism is contact time between the adsorbent and uranium containing aqueous solution various models have been to investigate the adsorption kinetics such as pseudo first order pseudo second order weber morris intraparticle diffusion etc among these models pseudo second order best fitted for the adsorption kinetics as confirmed by most of the studies wang et al 250 reported that using various types of carbon modified materials including graphene and carbon nanotubes gonrs mwcnts pao gonrs a and gonrs a the adsorption rates of u vi ions were found to be fast and reached to equilibrium in 60 min the adsorption capacities for four materials were obtained from the pseudo second order kinetics 0 052 0 908 mmolg 1 were very close to the experimental values 0 051 0 853 mmol g indicating chemisorption as the rate determining step this study supported the previously reported results by researchers 260 who showed that go pda and go pda pei follow pseudo second order r2 1 among all models used for the determination of dynamic processes some activated carbon based materials were also utilized to show the maximum removal efficiency and equilibrium point the study of nezhad et al 246 explained two stage kinetic behaviour of sorption process of u vi ion using ac and ac aba materials at 40 c in the range of 30 180 min fig 16a they showed that at first stage a rapid initial sorption of u vi ion was observed due to the presence of substantial number of vacant active sites for uranium sorption whereas second stage was associated with constant adsorption rate because of repulsion with adsorbed uranium ions and various other factors the sorption equilibrium was attained in 100 min which was considered as optimum contact time esmaeel et al 251 showed that using afs composite sorption equilibrium can be achieved in 60 min of contact time fig 16b wang et al 191 reported the adsorption of u vi using fe3o4 cb as a magnetic biochar material they showed that sorption equilibrium by fe3o4 cb reached in 8 h later they utilized manganese oxide functionalized biochar material mno2 cb for u vi adsorption and showed that equilibrium reached within 7 h and the maximum sorption amount of mno2 cb was found to be 100 2 mg g fig 17a among all models fig 17b d used for adsorption kinetics including pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion best fitted curve was obtained using pseudo second order model with r2close to 1 0 999 fig 17c suggesting that sorption process followed chemisorption intra particle diffusion process was also used to investigate the rate determine step which showed that particle diffusion process was the main rate determine step for u vi adsorption a biochar based material f lrbc was utilized by researchers 192 for u vi removal from aqueous solution in adsorption kinetics a sharp increment in amount of uranium with increase in reaction time from 10 to 30 min was observed at ph 6 after that from 30 to 60 min a slow increment was obtained due to resistance by the adsorbed uranium ions recently some researchers explored the use of biochar based materials such as pig manure biochar 181 and bi2o3 supported biochar 206 to show that removal of u vi can be effectively removed within 80 min the above discussed adsorption kinetics involved use of linear form of equations to determine the adsorption capacity of materials at different time intervals however a few researchers used non linear forms of pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations 155 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t to explain the adsorption mechanism dutta et al 155 suggested that adsorption of uranyl ions depended on the concentration of u vi ion in the adsorbate they found that the adsorption data obtained from the non linear pseudo second order kinetics was in good agreement with the experimental data calculated from the above eq 2 the adsorption mechanism involved the transfer of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent over the entire range of contact time 5 3 dft calculations density functional theory dft is widely used for theoretical calculations of relevant basic data of bonding structures and adsorption energies of complexes between adsorbate and adsorbent it is an effective tool in the field of computational chemistry to describe the nature of bonding using the experimental values of bonding distance and adsorption energies 261 263 in recent years dft has been widely applied to support the adsorption mechanism of uranyl ion on various mesoporous and microporous materials the lesser bonding distance between uranyl ions and adsorbent and higher adsorption energy suggested that the uranylions are strongly attached to the surface of adsorbent duan et al 256 carried out dft calculation for six complexes including uo2pao h2o 4 uo2pao h2o 3 uo2 pao 2 h2o 3 uo2 pao 2 h2o 2 uo2 pao 2h2o and uo2 pao 3 the average bond distance between u vi ions and co ordinated oxygen atoms of water molecules u ow in uo2 h2o 5 2 complex was found to be 2 457 å which was in good agreement with previously reported results 263 however the bond distances for nitrogen u nl and oxygen u ol atoms of amidoxime group were relatively shorter which suggesting the stronger chelation ability of amidoxime groups with u vi ions than water molecules ai et al 264 used dft simulations to study the interaction mechanism of u vi ions with go using implicit water model at different ph level the major adsorbing sites of go were carboxylic groups cooh epoxy groups c o c and hydroxyl groups oh which interacted with uranyl ions to form various complexes in fig 18 the optimized structures of go o uo2 go oh uo2 2 and go oh2 uo2 3 were represented in acidic neutral and alkaline environment respectively it was found that on increasing the ph from acidic to alkaline bond distance contracted 2 104 å and adsorption energies increased 67 61 kcal mol suggesting chemisorption of u vi ions on the surface of go the decrease in ph caused bond elongation of uo bond 2 119 å and 2 450 å with decrease in adsorption energy which showed that acidic medium was not favourable for the adsorption of u vi ions the other complexes shown in fig 18 also followed the same mechanism in a most recent study sun et al 265 used unoxidized biochar bc and oxidized biochar obc materials for the removal of uranium vi ions they demonstrated that the adsorption mechanism of u vi ions can be well explained by dft simulations using optimized geometries of u vi ions and the materials on which it was adsorbed in fig 19 the optimized geometries of solvated u vi ion over bc and obc had been shown the experimental characterization showed that u vi ions were weakly adsorbed physisorbed on the surface of bc due to a large binding distance of 4 21 å and thermodynamically unfavorable adsorption energy of 2 38 kcal mol the hirshfeld charge transfer analysis also confirmed the weaker interaction because there was no appreciable charge transfer between u vi ion and bc adsorption of solvated u vi was found to be significantly strong due to strong hydrogen bonding between solvated u vi ions and functional groups like oh and cooh etc the bond distances are comparatively very low 1 64 å 1 71 å and 1 87 å moreover a highly negative adsorption energy 31 82 kcal mol and a larger charge transfer 0 06 to 0 09 e between the solvated u vi ion and the obc surface further confirmed the formation of strong hydrogen bonds 6 conclusion challenges and perspectives activated carbon biochar and graphene materials are most promising carbon materials for the removal of hazardous uranium from aqueous solutions their adsorptive characteristics are governed by surface interaction ion exchange and electrostatic interaction mechanism additionally ph has significant role in the uranium removal process by these materials as uranium specification in water is deeply affected by the solution ph as reviewed in this article langmuir and freundlich isotherm models offer better insights into the adsorption of uranium species on activated carbon biochar and graphene based adsorbents among kinetic models pseudo second order model is more suitable to describe uranium removal mechanism owing to the chemisorption nature of the adsorption process diverse functional moieties exist on the surface of these carbon materials are capable of binding different uranium species under defined experimental conditions outstanding efforts have been carried out by the researchers and scientists across the globe to develop carbon adsorbents that could selectively bound uranium species from the aqueous matrix containing other impurity metals considering global advancement we firmly believe that there is a bright scope of research in the field of uranium removal for scientific personal if following challenges and drawbacks as taken into consideration i efforts should be made in the direction of preparing carbon based adsorbents from waste carbon sources to develop a cost effective technique moreover green treatment protocols should be practiced ensuring selective binding of diverse uranium species such as oxides hydroxides and carbonates under all ph conditions ii the synthesis method used to prepare a carbon adsorbent has significant effect on its morphology like surface area pore size and chemical reactivity more attention should be given on these aspects to derive highly efficient and chemically durable carbon adsorbents for uranium removal iii the adsorption performance of different carbon based adsorbents should be judged using actual wastewater to simulate a more effective technique for application in realistic world iii uranium recovery from the spent adsorbent is an important aspect as it is crucial for uranium market therefore detailed spectral and theoretical knowledge on the uranium species interaction mechanism with carbon based adsorbent at molecular level is highly desirable to explore the adsorption mechanisms and design uranium recovery protocols iv emphasis should be made on developing effective and green protocols for the recovery of spent adsorbents without deteriorating its adsorption efficiency current regeneration protocols using acid or alkali are not environmentally friendly and thus need to be replaced by other environmentally friendly approaches with minimal or no effective on adsorbent performance iv other modes of experimental approach column or continuous flow mode should be included along with batch mode to test the efficiencies of these materials towards uranium removal from continuum stream of uranium

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uranium a radioactive heavy metal with a half life of millions to billions of years has been widely discharged into the environment due to natural or anthropogenic activities resulting in environmental surface and water contamination 1 2 uranium s high toxicity long half life and significant affinity for complexing organic ligands make it a major threat to the human animal and environmental health when it contaminates water 3 4 even in low quantities uranium exposure in humans can result in serious health issues such as liver and kidney damage and even lead to death 5 7 also due to its enormous energy density 3 9 106 mj kg 1uranium and absence of greenhouse gas emissions nuclear energy is undoubtedly an incredibleenergysource in the present times given the growing human population and energy demands 8 9 therefore separation enrichment and recovery of u vi from the contaminated sites are of great significance for the sustainable development of nuclear energy environmental protection and human health numerous techniques have been adopted for u vi removal from aqueous solutions such as membraneseparation 10 co precipitation 11 ion exchange 12 13 electro coagulation 14 solvent extraction 15 solid phase extraction 16 17 and adsorption 18 19 of these known techniques studies have shown

conditions 25 26 there are some good studies available depicting the use of adsorption for various environmental applications shahmirzadi et al 27 discussed various adsorption processes and technologies that are reported in the last decade for desalination water softening and salt removal studies of yagub et al 28 and dutta et al 29 reported various adsorbents efficient in removal of colored dye from aqueous solutions among those a bioadsorbent showed the best result with qmax of 1653 mg g and sorption efficiency of 95 xiao et al 30 reported the graphene oxide preparation using modified hummers method and the possible mechanism involved for the removal of organic dye from aqueous solution the π π interactions between graphene and organic dyes provides the maximum adsorption capability 1301 8 mg g and 1005 7 mg g for cationic and anionic dyes respectively huang et al 31 showed in his research work how metal organic frameworks and their derivatives are used successfully as an adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater sophia et al 32 reported various adsorption studies present in literature for removal of emerging pollutants like pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones plasticizers and other organic compounds in the past two decades various materials like organic porous carbon based cellulose chitosan based resin and synthetic polymer inorganic porous silica based ldhs etc composites nanomaterials go carbon nanotubes mxene etc framework materials etc have been explored as an adsorbent for u vi remediation 24 33 carbon based materials owing to their unique properties of easy functionalization adjustable pore structure high availability good stability acid and alkali resistance easy recovery by combusting large specific surface area and high adsorption capacity have been extensively investigated in the extraction of uranium from contaminated water 24 34 35 among them activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts mesoporous carbon biochar and graphene oxide go are the most studied as the literature data shows energy production catalysis and environmental remediation are just a few of the fields that are finding increasing use for these materials 36 39 nanostructured carbon compounds in particular have recently received a lot of attention in the field of water remediation the main advantages of these compounds for adsorption applications are their large surface area fast adsorption kinetics large numbers of binding sites and exceptional selectivity 40 as reported in literature reviews graphene family nanomaterials like graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have promising applications in environmental remediation 41 one of the most important graphene derivatives go has large surface area and numerous oxygen rich functional groups which make it an excellent adsorbent for practical applications of uranium removal 42 research into uranium removal using go rgo and their modified forms has increased dramatically over the years 25 recently biochar has piqued scientists attention and has been deployed in numerous environmental applications such as enhancing soil quality 43 eliminating emerging pollutants in soil 44 and water 45 reducing greenhouse gas emissions 46 and generating energy 47 biochar is a carbonized biomass produced by the thermochemical decomposition of organic matter at temperatures between 200 and 700 c under oxygen derived conditions 48 biochar s qualities which are influenced by the feedstock type and manufacturing conditions determine its potential for use in a variety of environmental applications biochar can be manufactured from plentiful animal and plant biomass 49 and possesses desirable characteristics like high permeability good porosity and large surface area 50 in addition to these characteristics its affinity for various functional groups and low cost makes it an ideal candidate for adsorbing u vi onto its surface resulting in efficient wastewater treatment and promoting sustainable waste management 51 another carbon based adsorbent activated carbon ac has been used to treat industrial wastewater since the 1960s and is one of the first established adsorbents the production of ac 52 involves the dehydration and carbonization of raw materials in succession with activation using potassium hydroxide 53 zinc chloride 54 phosphoric acid 55 etc over 3 x 105tons of ac are produced annually all over the world and the most common traditional raw materials for this include wood peat phenolic resin coconut shell coal petroleum residues and agricultural waste 56 ac is a versatile material with many applications particularly in the field of environmental remediation and sorption of heavy metals owing to its exceptional physical and chemical properties 57 59 to date substantial advancement has been achieved in the field of uranium adsorption from aqueous solution by various types of adsorbents and a great number of studies have been published to establish utility of diverse adsorbents towards uranium recovery and extraction however a detailed evaluation of the synthesis application and mechanism of significant carbon based adsorbents e g activated carbon biochar graphene and its derivates for u vi removal from aqueous solution is unattainable in this review we focused on the current advancements of the three aforesaid carbon based adsorbents in relevance to their synthesis adsorption performance adsorption mechanism and various modification strategies to boost their performances and selectivity towards u vi removal more emphasis has been paid to discuss the emergence of the novel biochar based adsorbents and their adsorptive performance considering their inexistence in literature reviews for u vi sorption at last limitations and challenges in the field of uranium removal by carbon based adsorbents have been discussed to offer new insights into this research 2 synthesis of adsorbents uranium is found in environmentally important concentrations near uranium mining and processing facilities which typically entail substantial amount of wastewater uranium removal from substantial amount of wastewater is accompanying with low cost traditional treatment approaches e g mineral adsorption 60 carbonaceous based sorption technologies are an alternate way for eliminating harmful cation metals from wastewater 61 various researchers have discussed from time to time about the hazardous nature of radioactive waste and showed concern for its removal strategies 62 63 here we summarize the synthesis strategies used for go biochar and activated carbon for the removal of toxic u vi metal from wastewater 2 1 synthesis strategies for graphene oxide its derivates the unique features of 2d network structure of graphene oxide go and its derivates such as reduced graphene oxide rgo functionalized graphene oxide and graphene oxide composites promote its dispersion in solution along with tuning the appropriate surface functional group which reduces the self aggregation of go resulting in improved adsorption capacity towards pollutants 64 most commonly used method for the synthesis of go was hummer s method 65 the graphene produced from flake graphite has several broken conjugations in the graphene plane and numerous oxygen containing functional groups include hydroxyl carboxyl epoxide and carbonyl on the surface to make stable complex with metal ions or pollutants to act as a better adsorbent 63 however several modifications had been carried out by several researchers according to the desired results since the nature of pristine graphene is hydrophobic which is hard to disperse in water 66 the new improved method or the tour s method with its simpler protocol resulting the influence of the final yield and minimizes the toxic gas no2 n2o4 and or clo2 evolution during synthesis and equivalent conductivity upon reduction used in hummer s and modified hummer s method for the synthesis of graphene oxide 67 among the traditional activated carbon biochar and modern carbon nanotubes cnts material go has emerged as better uranium adsorbents for example liu et al 68 prepared the phosphate functionalized graphene oxide pgo with maximum adsorption capacity of 251 7 mg g and give an excellent removal efficiency for u vi in acidic condition romanchuk et al 69 reported the rapid removal of radionuclide actinides and trans uranium elements including americium iii thorium iv plutonium iv neptunium v uranium vi even from acidic solutions ph 2 because of its strong interplanar connections go has a proclivity to aggregate therefore a sizeable percentage of the go s surface area is lost reducing its effectiveness in wastewater remediation to address this issue various polymers have been grafted onto the surface of go in order to prevent self aggregation and improve its adsorption ability song et al 70 reported a rapid monolayer sorption rate and efficiency for the removal of u vi using a novel graphene oxide go and poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrene sulfonate pedot pss go pedot pss nanocomposite having an inner sphere complexation mechanism with endothermic nature apart from the graphene chen et al 71 prepared a few layered n p and s co doped graphene like carbon nanosheets nps glcs for the removal of u vi maximum adsorption capacity of 294 16 mg g at ph range of 5 9 were reported due to a strong covalent bond such as p o u and s o u were generated between the heteroatom n p s with uo2 2 in removal process wang et al 72 reported the graphene oxide nanoribbon gonrs which are defined as graphene stripes with a width of nanometers prepared from the oxidative multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts showed 394 1 mg g higher adsorption capacity of u vi on gonrs at ph 4 5 furthermore wang et al 73 functionalized the gonrs with amidoxime ao and achieved the u vi adsorption capacity of 502 6 mg g at ph 4 5 wang et al 74 further discussed the mechanism at different unzipping level of mwcnts for the interaction between u vi and gonrs and showed the mechanism of uo2 2 complex with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups at the edges of the gonrs different stages of unzipping mwcnts into gonrs is shown schematically in fig 1 considering the multiple steps and the variety of reagents involved the graphene oxide sulfonation is challenging however zhang et al 75 suggested a simple one pot technique for the synthesis of sulfonated graphene oxide gos employing fuming sulfonic acid 50 so3 h2so4 by vapor solid transfer reaction of go the gos was utilized as an adsorbent to remove u vi ions with a maximum adsorption capacity of 309 09 mg g 2 2 synthesis strategies for biochar biochar is a porous carbonaceous material that is typically obtained from variety of feedstock including agricultural wastes rice husks bagasse paper products animal manures and even urban green waste in an oxygen limited environment prevent combustion 76 it has the potential to be a widely used material for the remediation of water and soil due to the broad accessibility of feedstocks and having tunable physicochemical properties the pore size distribution functional groups present at surface and ion exchange capacity of biochar determine its efficacy in pollutant management the biochar characteristics can be tuned by controlling the pyrolysis temperature heat transfer rate residence period and types of feedstocks e g at high pyrolysis temperatures the surface area hydrophobicity and microporosity of biochar are increased resulting in efficient handling of the organic pollutants whereas biochar is more appropriate for eliminating polar organic and inorganic contaminants at lower temperatures via oxygen containing functional groups precipitation and electrostatic attraction changes in surface reactivity chemical physical and structural qualities are the outcome of surface alterations of biochar by oxidizing the biochar surface the materials number of surface sites and efficacy can be increased e g carboxylic and phenolic groups several scientists started working on generating biochar out of straw as an adsorbent for uranium vi rice straw based biochar s were modified with the oxidation treatment by hno3 h2o2 and kmno4 chemical regents at different heating temperature of 550 650 and 750 c the effects of pyrolysis temperature modifying agent type surface chemistry surface charge and pore structure on u vi removal were studied and found that the amount and character of the surface groups have a greater impact on u vi adsorption than porosity the highest adsorption occurred at a ph of 5 5 when compared to other adsorbents rice straw derived biochar s demonstrated equivalent u vi adsorption 77 currently a range of methods for manufacturing biochar have been investigated depending on the specifications of biochar properties to generate energy from biomass biochemical conversion uses biological catalysts and biological organisms whereas thermochemical conversion uses heat and a chemical catalyst the major phase in the biochemical process which is commonly used to make methanol and biodiesel from biomass is fermentation whereas thermochemical conversion techniques are further classed as combustion gasification and pyrolysis however while biochemical conversion technology is less expensive and more ecologically friendly than thermochemical conversion technology the rate of hydrogen production and yield in the biochemical conversion method is very low because of this constraint thermochemical conversion is more popular than biological conversion here in this section the discussion is based only on thermochemical conversion processes included pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization htc gasification and torrefaction 2 2 1 pyrolyzed biochar oxygen free environment convert the biomass into more stable product biochar and other solid residues this conversion involved two stage process primary pyrolysis followed by secondary different organic functional groups like carboxyl carbonyl and hydroxyl break up along with devolatilization involves dehydration decarboxylation and dehydrogenation gets into main constituent by heat during primary pyrolysis gases like ch2 ch4 co and co2 along with the char are the product obtained during secondary pyrolysis during the process bio oil is formed after re condensation of some of the volatilized biomolecule depending upon the thermal or catalytical cracking as represented by the following equation 78 c 6 h 6 o 6 n h 2 co ch 4 c 5 h 12 h 2 o ch 3 oh c h 3 cooh c in this equation the gaseous product followed by liquid products and solid yield are represented in first second and last term of the equation respectively the process is classified as slow intermediate or fast pyrolysis based on the pyrolysis temperature residence period and heating rate flash vacuum and hydropyrolysis are the other modified version of these three fundamental pyrolysis methods 79 each method s operation parameters impart various properties to the final biochar products 2 2 1 1 slow pyrolysis slow pyrolysis has long been used to produce charcoal it is the traditional kind of pyrolysis distinguished by a slow heating rate and a long residence duration slow pyrolysis involves heating biomass to temperatures in the 400 500 c range at a rate of 0 1 to 1 c s for 5 to 30 min slow pyrolysis favors the generation of biochar but liquid bio oil and gaseous products syn gas are also generated in trace amounts slow pyrolysis provides a favourable environment and enough time for the secondary reactions to complete because to the restricted heating rate and lengthier vapor residence duration 80 81 additionally a longer vapor residence time permits the elimination of vapors produced by the secondary reaction this ultimately results in the production of solid carbonaceous biochar because of these features biochar production via slow pyrolysis is considered sustainable slow pyrolysis biochar has been reported to be beneficial for soil remediation and the sorption of several wastewater contaminants 82 recently researchers 83 reported fabrication of biochar by slow pyrolysis from different types of feedstocks namely sewage sludge agriculture biomass waste and wood biomass waste and compared their efficacy in terms of heavy metal removal from wastewater biochar fabricated from sewage sludge showed highest adsorption capacity followed by agriculture biomass waste and wood biomass waste 2 2 1 2 fast pyrolysis fast pyrolysis involves heating biomass to 850 1250 c at a heating rate of 10 200 c for a short period of time ranging between 1 and 10s it is exploited for bio oil production since the oil product yield exceeds the char and gaseous product fast pyrolysis typically yields 60 75 liquid product 15 25 charcoal and 10 20 non condensable gaseous products the fundamental principle is to heat biomass to a temperature at which thermal cracking can occur while minimizing exposure duration which promotes char formation 84 rather than letting the biomass react and produce the unfavorable char the high heating process converts the input biomass into a liquid product high liquid yields are produced via quick pyrolysis of biomass while char and exit gas percentages are reduced high heating rates 1000 c s and brief vapor residence durations of at most 2 s are necessary for fast pyrolysis guda et al 85 have discussed these key properties of rapid pyrolysis in detail a detailed study has been reported by lyu et al 86 on the component present in bio oil derived from different pyrolysis conditions by using gc ms techniques bagasse corncob spruce and pine were the biomass feedstocks used for pyrolysis materials in this study low temperature pretreatment of biomass produced furans ketones and phenols in high quantity while aldehydes and acids were the product by high temperature and furans and ketones by optimal temperatures of 520 and 550 c because of its low ph the bio oil produced by rapid pyrolysis is very corrosive the high heating value of this oil is approximately half that of crude oil necessitating the upgrading of bio oil before use nowadays the fast pyrolysis method is used in a few more applications such as the synthesis of food tastes and specific compounds 2 2 1 3 intermediate pyrolysis this method of pyrolysis is commonly used to achieve a balance of liquid and solid products while rapid pyrolysis results in a high liquid yield and a low char yield slow pyrolysis results in a high liquid yield and a low char yield the operating parameters for intermediate pyrolysis fall in between slow and fast generally the pressure maintains at 0 1 mpa during the process intermediate pyrolysis settings prevent the creation of high molecular tars and yield dry char appropriate for agricultural use or energy production as well as high quality bio oil intermediate pyrolysis occurs between 500 and 650 c with heating rates ranging from 0 1 to 10 c min and residence times ranging from 300 to 1000s the usual result contains 40 60 liquid 20 30 non condensable gases and 15 25 biochar 79 the liquid product of intermediate pyrolysis can be used directly in boilers and engines because unlike the liquid byproduct of rapid pyrolysis it does not include a significant amount of reactive tar 87 2 2 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc hydrothermal carbonization is regarded as an economical way for biochar synthesis because the process may be carried out at a low temperature of roughly 180 250 c and the product produced by the hydrothermal process is referred to as hydrochar in this process the biomass with water placed in a closed reactor and the temperature is gradually raised to maintain stability different products are formed at particular temperature e g the biochar produced at temperatures below 200 c is known as hydrothermal carbonization bio oil produced at temperatures between 250 and 400 c is known as hydrothermal liquefaction and gaseous products syngas such as co co2 h2 and ch4 produced at temperatures above 400 c is known as hydrothermal gasification the hydrolyzed product undergoes a number of processes including dehydration fragmentation and isomerization to provide the intermediate product 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and its derivatives furthermore the hydrochar is produced via condensation polymerization and intramolecular dehydration 88 the degradation of lignin begins with a dealkylation and hydrolysis reaction which produces phenolic compounds such as phenols catechols syringols and so on finally the char is synthesised by repolymerization and cross linking of intermediates similar to the pyrolysis reaction the non soluble components of lignin are transformed into hydrochar 2 2 3 gasification gasification is a thermochemical process that converts carbonaceous materials into gaseous products namely syngas which consists of co co2 ch4 h2 and traces of hydrocarbons in the presence of gasification agents such as oxygen air steam etc to reiterate the reaction temperature is the single most crucial factor in establishing the level of syngas production carbon monoxide and hydrogen production increased with rising temperatures while methane carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon output decreased the main product of this method is syngas and char is a byproduct with a lower yield the gasification mechanism is broken into several phases which are as follows i drying in which the moisture content of the biomass is entirely evaporated with no energy recovery the moisture content of different biomass materials varies when biomass contains a significant moisture content drying is performed as a separate process during the gasification process ii oxidative combustion in which the main energy sources undergo oxidation and combustion reactions with the gasification agents these gasification agents react with the combustible species present in the gasifier to produce co2 co and water 2 2 4 torrefaction torrefaction is a relatively recent technology for producing charcoal because it uses a limited heating rate it is known as mild pyrolysis the oxygen moisture and carbon dioxide in biomass were removed using inert ambient air in the absence of oxygen at 300 c utilizing various breakdown mechanisms torrefaction changes biomass properties such particle size moisture content surface area heating rate and energy density torrefaction can be achieved in various ways a steam torrefaction in this process biomass is treated with steam at a temperature of no 260 c for approximately 10 min b wet torrefaction also known as hydrothermal carbonization is the process of interacting biomass with water at temperatures ranging from 180 to 260 c for 5 240 min c oxidative torrefaction this approach entails treating biomass with oxidizing agents such as gases used in the combustion process to produce heat energy to achieve the necessary temperature this heat energy is used torrefaction is an incomplete pyrolysis reaction that happens when the following requirements are satisfied temperature of 200 300 c residence time of 30 min heating rate of 50 c min and absence of oxygen the dry torrefaction process is broken down into several stages heating drying torrefaction and cooling drying can also be divided into two stages pre drying and post drying in a recent study lu et al 89 discovered that after 5 adsorption desorption cycles the biochar formed by torrefaction of antibiotic fermentation residue had stable adsorption competencies towards u vi and mb with no noticeable changes in oxygenated functional groups in the ftir spectra of the regenerated biochar 2 3 synthesis strategies for activated carbon activated carbons are one of the most widely used water purification and treatment agents it has a high affinity for organic molecules low molecular weight molecules and possesses oxygenated functional groups throughout its entire surface that can adsorb metal ions dyes and other organic compounds from aqueous solutions 59 the activated carbons are made up of porous structure formed by heating organic precursors to high temperatures resulting in void spaces and the removal of water and biomass furthermore strong chemical radiation and thermal stability as well as rigid porous structure and mechanical strength confer significant advantages over polymeric materials 90 some of the most frequent forms are wood fruit stones and coals with varying characteristics depending on their final application some examples include powdered granular activated carbons fibres clothing and carbon integral or carbon coated monoliths 91 activated carbon cannot be reactivated after usage therefore digging it out of water treatment reservoirs renders it impracticable for treating the large volumes of waste produced by today s industry and population this issue has been handled in two ways discovering low cost substitute sources and improving the efficacy of present materials although several innovative activated carbons have been successfully created over the past decade there has not been a unified approach to characterising and assessing their capacities such as adsorption separation and catalytic activities 92 93 activated carbon can be made by either directly activating a dry raw precursor or by a two phase process that includes carbonization and activation 94 firstly the carbonization phase achieved by heating 700 c the raw materials to evaporate and remove the hydrocarbons therefore this phase is a pyrolytic process and the product is called carbonized material char or biochar the next phase activation methods are utilized to increase porosity and produce structures in the activated carbon resulting in the production of fine solid cavities macropores are 50 nm mesopores are in between 2 nm to 50 nm and micropores are 2 nm are the types of pores produced on the surface of activated carbon 95 moreover based on the nature of the activation process activated carbon can be classified into two main categories physical activation using steam or co2 and chemical activation using oxidizing agents such as koh zncl2 h3po4 etc 96 2 3 1 physical method this method offers a chemical free low cost environmentally friendly way to prepare activated carbon and it has the potential to yield activated carbon with a porous structure and high physical strength it consists of two consecutive step processes i e carbonization in an inert atmosphere to devolatilize the raw material and gasification of the obtained char or biochar by oxidizing agents steam carbon dioxide or a mixture of both assuming carbonization occurs between 400 and 600 c the typical gasification temperature ranges from 800 to 1000 c chemical control slow activation rate days is preferable to diffusional control rapid causes outside particle burning poor porosity growth which is why co2 activation must take place in controlled environments since the interactions of steam and carbon dioxide with carbon are endothermic thermal activation requires an external energy input to keep the desired high temperature because the reaction of oxygen or air with carbon is very exothermic and quick it is difficult to manage and ensure porosity development rather than particle consumption because of this as well as safety concerns about temperature control oxygen activation is rarely used low amounts of oxygen or air can however be used during thermal activation with steam or carbon dioxide to help high temperatures by reacting with the gases created during activation i e co and h2 this method has the advantage of decreasing the pressure of co and h2 both of which hinder activation while increasing the partial pressure of the activating agent negative aspects of physically activating activated carbon include the lengthy activation period the low adsorption capacity of the generated activated carbon and the high amount of energy required mellah et al 97 used a commercially available from merck activated carbon size 2 mm for the removal of uranium and achieved the 98 efficiency at initial concentration of 100 mg l with a 0 1 g adsorbent dosage similarly caccin et al 98 used the commercial activated carbon prepared by physical activation process from the coconut shell for the removal of uranium cesium and strontium results showed that cesium and strontium were not showed any affinity towards ac resulting no removal occur however with u vi ac showed excellent adsorption efficacy of 55 32 mg g during the batch study activated palm kernel shell carbon apksc was used by yi et al 99 for the removal of u vi from aqueous solution in a batch adsorption experiment with adsorption capacity of 51 81 mg g the apksc removed up to 94 30 of u vi at an initial u vi concentration of 50 mg l with an adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l after 120 min apksc used in this study was also available commercially 2 3 2 chemical method in this method of activation various chemicals or activating agent e g koh zncl2 h3po4 etc at temperature of 400 to 900 c are used accordingly it is a one step or two step process and has advantages over physical method in terms of low cost low heating temperature high porosity and high adsorption capacity the one step activation process comprises impregnating the chemical activating agent into the biomass precursor which is then activated carbonized the first phase in the two step chemical activation involves carbonizing the biomass precursor to form biochar at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 c thermal breakdown results in the release of volatile content in vapors tars and gases as well as the formation of pores in the resulting biochar raw materials used in wet oxidation or chemical activation contained cellulose like wood in this method of activation the activating agents defines the steps of mechanism involved for pores formation like phosphoric acid associated the lignocellulosic structure of the raw material in activation process while the zinc chloride encourage the removal of water from the structure lignocellulosic precursor gets combined with activating agents and act as a template for the formation of microporosity so the amount of impregnation temperature carbonization time and the weight ratio of chemical agents to dry precursor are the influencing parameters in the process of activation 100 101 some of the chemical activators are discussed here 2 3 2 1 activation by zncl2 by chemically activating zinc chloride acs may become more porous and with a higher surface area thus providing a greater adsorption capacity lignocellulosic and cellulosic precursor are used to produce activated carbon by zinc chloride through the impregnation during activation during this activation process zinc chloride combined with the saturated pores and with the increasing mass ratio the volatile material released easier from the surface the activated carbon larger surface area in the activated carbon can be the result from the distinct intra and inter coated cavities caused by the break down of cellulose molecule due to inflation this could be the result of an electrolytic action named selling induced by zinc chloride carbon and hydrogen atoms with other product like o2 co co2 methane and aldehydes etc resulted by the conversion of lignocellulosic materials during activation process moreover zinc chloride restricted the formation of bitumen and other fluids that restrain the movement of volatile substances to be released from the surface the activated carbon the yield of activated carbon is increased by the addition of large ring aromatic compounds to zinc chloride this process allows the zinc chloride to react with carbon without reacting with it 102 compared to the potassium hydroxide process the activated carbon produced by zinc chloride is more effective the presence of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the activated carbon structure can be removed by the use of zinc chloride the reduction of these two components by the presence of zinc chloride leads to a decrease in oxygen and a rise in nitrogen gondugdo et al 103 reported the increase in porosity and surface area concentration of zinc chloride used in the activation process the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are removed from the activated carbon structure when zinc chloride is used the effect of temperature and zinc chloride concentration on various atoms is that hydrogen and oxygen content drop while nitrogen content increases zinc chloride functions as a lewis acid enhancing condensed aromatic reactions by promoting molecular hydrogen deformation from the hydro aromatic structure of precursors causing polymerization processes to occur and be affected by the exclusion of some of the active sites from surrounding molecules this increase in concentration breaks the structure and convert the structure to mesopores from micropores 104 hu et al 105 used coconut shells and palm seeds as starting materials to make mesoporous activated carbon which they activated simultaneously with zncl2 and co2 they discovered that the major pore feature at low zncl2 concentrations is microporous whereas the predominant pore characteristic at high zncl2 concentrations is mesoporous 2 3 2 2 activation by koh for the formation of high surface area fine pore size less toxic and corrosive and low cost activated carbon potassium salts such as koh and k2co3aremostly used for the precursor of coal the activated carbon by koh activation used for removal of various organic chemicals such as phenol dyes and other pollutants due to presence of oh functional groups on the surface of activated carbon the ability of k to quickly form intercalation compounds with carbon explains why koh activation is more effective than other chemical activating agents furthermore the k2o generated during the koh activation process is reduced to k by carbon resulting in carbon gasification and subsequent co2 emission which leads to the creation of pores tounsadi et al 106 reported an optimization approach for the preparation of activated carbon from glebionis coronaria l using koh activator for the removal of cadmium and cobalt metal ions response surface methodology rsm were used for the optimization of factors namely carbonization temperature activation temperature activation time and impregnation ratio however the yield 10 40 of activated carbon is lower than the other activators such as zncl2 and h3po4 as compared to other activators but give high pore volume and high surface area 107 moreover the interaction between the koh and the biomass precursor and their biochar influences the characteristics like surface area pore size distribution and adsorption characteristics for different adsorbate of activated carbon during the activation process oginni et al 108 reported the biomass derived activated carbon activated at a temperature 900 c with sbet1597 m2 g and 0 89 cm3 g total pore volume structure mesopore obtaining the high equilibrium uptake of 166 67 mg g and 153 09 mg g for caffeine and acetaminophen respectively the mesopore serves as a conduit for the adsorbate to reach the micropores as a result the rate of adsorption of the activated carbons is increased elmouwahidi et al 109 studied the properties of activated carbons produced by one step and two step chemical synthesis of olive residue using koh as an activating agent the biochar precursor was created at a temperature of 300 c and the biomass and biochar precursors were activated for 2 h at a temperature of 840 c at a low impregnation ratio the biomass derived activated carbon had a greater bet surface area of 1390 m2 g than the biochar derived activated carbon which had a surface area of 1295 m2 g meanwhile as the impregnation ratio increased the biomass derived activated carbon s bet surface area declined to 1350 m2 g while the biochar derived activated carbon exhibited a greater bet surface area of 1626 m2 g the overall pore and mesopore volumes of biochar derived activated carbons were greater than those of biomass derived activated carbons however the surface chemistry of the activated carbons generated from biochar and biomass was similar liu et al 110 investigated the koh impregnation of corn cob generated activated carbon pyrolysis at 800 c for 1 h the activated carbons had bet surface areas was 1054 2 m2 g the authors discovered that as the impregnation ratio increased the surface areas and volumes of the mesopores increased substantially indicating that the micropores collapsed and merged into bigger mesopores chen et al 111 investigated the koh chemical activation mechanism during biomass and proposed the mechanism that introduced new o containing groups into biochar a chemical pathway between koh and o containing groups is proposed for activating koh during biomass pyrolysis as o containing groups react with koh at 1 8 1 2 or 400 600 c 2 3 2 3 activation by h3po4 formation of activated carbon using phosphoric acid h3po4 is also utilized prominently for lignocellulosic materials and various forms of biomass as the acid controlled the physical and chemical interaction during impregnation stage for the bulk of the solution 112 different researchers reported the interaction behaviour of acid with different sources of activated carbon demiral et al 113 reported that due to the evaporation of phosphoric acid during carbonization process the pores and cavities were formed on the surface of activated carbon this could be understood that the formation of pores or the active sites of the activated carbon were achieved as the mechanisms of activation involved the process of thermal degradation of polymer dehydration and redistribution of biopolymers in lignocellulosic materials 114 115 the particles and volatile products formed during the interaction of acid with precursor resulting the variation of different sizes of micro and mesopores and the hydrophilic nature of the surface to increase adsorption efficiency of carbon surface 116 large amount of oxygen and phosphorous containing surface groups increasing the carbon and nitrogen content significantly increases the surface area and high active sites for the adsorption 117 some of the activated carbon activated by zncl2 koh and h3po4 are listed in the table 1 for different adsorbate such as uranium vi and others lead mercury iv etc through pre carbonization and chemical activation kennedy et al 118 investigated the h3po4 activation of rice husk pores produced at a higher activation temperature were shown to be expanded or widened resulting in microporosity production however for advanced applications carbon materials should have a high mesopore content as well as a high surface area 3 application towards u vi removal 3 1 go based adsorbents for u vi removal recently pristine go and go based nanomaterials with unique physicochemical properties including high surface area and abundant oxygen containing functional groups are applied as high efficiency adsorbent for elimination of u vi ions the main adsorption properties between go based materials and u vi are summarized in table 1 3 1 1 pristine go go is considered as the oxidized form of graphene containing different functional groups like hydroxyl carboxylic and epoxide on the surface attaining to the high surface area and abundant functional groups on the go surfaces the material showed high adsorption capacity in the removal of uranyl ions from aqueous solutions zhao et al 119 prepared few layered go fgo by modified hummers method the spacing of graphene increased from 0 8 nm to 2 89 nm during the oxidation process in fgo which attributed the increased of concentration of co and co on the surface of fgo which was further confirmed from the xps analysis the maximum adsorption capacity of u vi on few layered go at 293 k was 97 5 mg g another study in same year was done by li et al 120 in which the c1s spectrum of rgo showed mainly the non oxygenated carbon 284 8 ev with high c o ration of 81 5 in comparison to c1s spectrum of go with only c o ratio of 48 4 the afm image of go showed the presence of sheets having uniform thickness 1 nm with lateral dimensions varying from 1 to 100 nm which demonstrates the complete exfoliation of graphite oxide down to individual go sheets the maximum adsorption capacity of rgo for u vi was observed to be 299 mg g at ph 4 0 another research reported in literature is of wang et al 121 who performed adsorption of u vi on few layered graphene oxide nanosheets with maximum adsorption capacity of 92 mg g at t 298 k and ph 3 45 however the pristine go can cause irreversible aggregation in aqueous solution which may reduce the surface areas and hinder effective removal behaviours therefore different modified go materials were fabricated and applied to the efficient removal of uranyl ions 3 1 2 nitrogen functionalized go go in aqueous solutions tends to aggregate rapidly and form strong π π forces and makes the surface inert 122 which reduces its interaction with target contaminants and thus limits their further applications in field of environmental pollution control management therefore keeping in mind researchers should take all these aspects necessary steps to enhance its dispersibility and to reduce the aggregation of go all kinds of surface modified go were synthesised via chemical modification or attaching a stabilizer such as a soluble polymer or a surfactant to graft different functional groups on the surfaces 123 125 introduction of nitrogen bearing groups on go surface shows paramount significance in uranium removal in this regard amidoxime group is one of the most efficient chelating functional groups for uranium adsorption with a high capacity and selectivity 126 128 according to the study done by wang et al 129 multiple nitrogen moieties acidic oxime and basic amino groups in amidoxime bind with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups of go sheet by hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction forming go amidoxime hydrogels go agh this adsorbent exhibit high selectivity towards uranium in presence of co existing ions like mg2 ca2 ba2 and sr2 which exist in high concentrations in wastewater and compete with uranium for the sorption on go agh the selectivity was high due to the great chelating properties of nitrogen moieties with uranium researchers found that uo2 2 species of uranium was adsorbed on the hydrogen with large distribution coefficient value kd 1 89 105 it was observed that lone pairs on the nitrogen atom of amino group and the oxygen atom of the oxime group donated to the positive charged metal centre of the uranium species that form a stable chelate therefore go agh showed high adsorption capacity q max around 398 4 mg g in presence of high concentrations of competitive ions furthermore researchers develop novel functional group ligands in coordination with amidoxime group to enhance the selectivity and adsorption capacity simultaneously in this regard carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin cmcd possess good uranium adsorption characteristics in coordination with amidoxime group li et al 130 prepared amidoxime functionalized cmcd modified graphene oxide aerogel gdc via a one step hydrothermal method after a series of adsorption experiments performed to describe the uranium uptake rate researchers found that q max 642 3 mg g of gdc at ph 6 towards uranium was much higher than q max of amidoxime functionalized graphene oxide aerogel and β cyclodextrin graphene composites i e 421 4 mg g and 213 6 mg g respectively high q max of gdc revealed the synergistic effect of amidoxime and β cyclodextrin towards uranium adsorption in terms of kinetics and isotherm study pseudo second order and langmuir kinetics was well fitted which corresponds adsorption process occurs through chemisorption in terms of selectivity gdc exhibit good selectivity towards uranium in presence of different anions cl no3 so4 2 and cations ca2 co2 cu2 fe2 mg2 v2 the strong selectivity of uranium is due to strong attraction with amidoxime and internal cavity of cmcd amine groups are other good candidates for the adsorption of uranium from aqueous solution they are considered as soft donors towards elements of actinide series and form stable chelate complexes with these elements 131 liu et al 132 designed amine functionalized go nanosheets by covalently grafting p phenyldiamine on the surface of go nanosheets which attributed to the nitrogen containing functional groups on the surface of reduced go nanosheets which enhances the selectivity and removal capacity of uranium from the aqueous medium the maximum removal capacity of uranium on go and go nh2 was 97 3 mg g and 215 2 mg g at 298 k verma et al 133 developed effective adsorbent nh3 go where graphene oxide nanosheets were reduced by liquid ammonia in dehydrating solvent the purpose of using ammonia was to reduce carboxylic acid of graphene into amide to achieve high selectivity and removal of uranium study revealed that nh3 go adsorbent showed high selectivity towards uranyl ions in presence of interference cations ca2 mg2 k na pb2 fe2 and zn2 and anions co3 2 hco3 2 cl so4 2 due to amide functionalization of go the maximum adsorption capacity q max was found to be 80 13 mg g at neutral ph at 298 k this adsorption capacity was high in comparison to many other silica based adsorbents 134 136 nowadays many polymer based materials grafted on graphene have been rigorously studied as efficient adsorbents for uranium because these materials can be modified and designed to show remarkable characteristics including large surface area permanent porosity and multifunctionality these polymer based materials include polyacrylamide polydopamine polyethyleneimine polyamidoxime chitosan for example song et al 137 grafted polyacrylamide on go pam go through plasma induced polymerization technique in which pam and go were activated by electrons photons and alpha particles and activated pam and go form chemical bonds tga analysis revealed that 11 64 by weight of pam was grafted on go sem images fig 2a show that go nanosheets are packed together in contrast to the widely distributed pam go nanosheets fig 2b furthermore ft ir raman and xrd examination reveal that the dark dots on the go nanosheets in the tem image of pam go nanosheets fig 2d are nanosized pam domains chemically bonded on the go surface the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 164 mg g at ph 6 at 295 k another polymer cross linking agent called polyethyleneimine pei was grafted on go hydrogel surface by wang et al 138 the results showed that pei gh has very good adsorption capacity of 898 mg g with high removal rate of 90 at ppm level and near about 85 at ppb level in simulated sea water qian et al 139 prepared oxime polydopamine pda modified reduced graphene oxide rgo pda oxime by simple one step process and utilized for effective u vi adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of rgo pda oxime was found to be 1049 mg g at ph 6 which was much larger than rgo pda without oxime and only go 675 mg g and 613 mg g so functionalization with oxime enhances the capacity towards the uranium langmuir isotherm would be better fitted r2 0 9835 in comparison to freundlich isotherm r2 0 9420 the uv vis spectrum fig 3a of the rgo pda oxime solution shows that both pda and oxime have maintained their stabilities ft ir spectroscopy was then used to further analyse the functionalization of the surfaces of the produced samples fig 3b the existence of pda in the produced products was shown by the detection of a feature at 1510 cm 1 nh bending vibration while an additional peak at 1610 cm 1 cꟷn stretching vibration in the rgo pda oxime confirmed the presence of the oxime groups researcher also performed the experiment on simulated sea water and the results reflected good adsorption of uranium in simulated water at ph 8 i e 201 62 mg g 267 70 mg g 348 62 mg g for the uranium initial concentrations of 8 16 and 32 mg l respectively polyaniline having different amino groups grafted on surface of graphene to enhance the adsorption capacity towards uranium for example shao et al 140 synthesised polyaniline pani go composite by in situ polymerization technique in which aniline monomers would bound to the oxygen containing functional groups on dispersed go the characteristics of pani go were that it contains abundant amounts of primary and secondary amino groups which exhibit selective extraction of u vi from aqueous solution the adsorption of u vi on pani go is mainly due to the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between u vi and amino groups on the composite the xps spectrum of pani go after u vi adsorbed revealed the presence of xps u4f5 2 and xps u4f7 2 peaks at 393 0 and 382 1 ev respectively these binding energies are consistent with those of u vi 141 the maximum adsorption capacity q max at ph 5 and 3 5 was found to be 1960 mg g and 610 mg g respectively chitosan is also another class of natural organic polymer comprising the amino and hydroxyl functional groups on the polymer chain which exhibit good chelating properties that are favourable to interaction with uranium 142 to improve the adsorption capacity of chitosan towards uranium various modifications have been done huang et al 143 prepared the graphene oxide chitosan aerogel go cs and effect of various experimental parameters including ph kinetics isotherms were evaluated in terms of ph the maximum adsorption showed in the range of 3 5 adsorption isotherm study was performed at ph 3 5 5 0 8 5 and maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 200 0 319 9 384 6 mg g at ph 3 5 5 0 and 8 5 respectively interestingly it was found that freundlich adsorption r2 0 93 isotherm was well fitted at ph 3 5 and 5 and langmuir adsorption r2 0 96 was well fitted at ph 8 5 these adsorption isotherm results demonstrate that the diverse functional groups such as nh2 oh cooh exist on go cs participated in the uranium binding under mild acidic conditions while nh2 and oh groups were majorly involved for uranium binging in alkaline conditions these results further were verified by xps and exafs analysis some other notable research studies are also reported in literature 144 151 3 1 3 phosphorus functionalized go cai et al 152 developed phosphorylated graphene oxide chitosan composite go cs p by arbuzov reaction 153 the removal efficiency of go cs p composite go cs and pristine go towards u vi was observed under varying experimental conditions it was found that the adsorption increased with increasing ph and showed maximum adsorption at ph 6 5 and adsorption equilibrium for all above three materials reached in very short time of 15 min the maximum adsorption capacities sequence towards u vi of three adsorbents was in the order of go cs p 779 44 mg g pristine go 573 91 mg g go cs 346 16 mg g the important point to mention in the adsorption capacities result was that go cs had low adsorption capacity in comparison to pristine go the reason given by the researchers was that the crosslinking amidation reaction between go and cs causes consumption of more active carboxylic groups of go causing less capacity of go cs another simpler process for synthesis of phosphorylated graphene oxide pgo is via the method of in situ phosphorylation of go with concentrated phosphoric acid 154 the incorporation of the phosphate group on the surface of go was validated by ftir and xps analyses consistent with langmuir isotherms the qmax increased from 249 38 mg g go to 336 70 mg g pgo another outstanding work done was by dutta et al 155 an innovative nanoscale adsorbent reduced graphene oxide with adenosine 5 monophosphate rgo amp was created for the rapid and efficient adsorptive removal of uranyl ions at ph 6 according to the researchers amp s functionalization of go explains its remarkable adsorption capability 3024 mg g in 4 min by providing a strong binding affinity for uo2 2 via phosphate oxygen and chelation via the aromatic nitrogen group after amp reduction rgo undergoes structural modifications that may explain the observed variations in peak position of raman spectra fig 4 furthermore it was shown that rgo amp can be regenerated and reused for a total of 5 cycles while preserving 90 of its capacity by the end of the fifth cycle proving that it is a sustainable adsorbent 3 1 4 go metal oxide composites magnetic nature metal oxides are considered as one of the new generation of adsorbents due to its easy magnetic separation good biocompatibility and therefore widely used in water treatment therefore researchers grafted the surface of graphene oxide from metal oxides to fabricate magnetic graphene nanocomposites in this regard tan et al 156 synthesised cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites from hydrothermal method and investigated the adsorption potential of u vi sem images showed cofe2o4 nanoparticles being uniformly distributed over the entire surface of graphene sheets and between the layers of graphene sheets in terms of xrd analysis fig 5a the five main characteristics diffraction peaks at 30 10 35 40 43 10 57 00 and 62 60 corresponds to 220 311 400 511 and 440 were observed in cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites which were in good agreement with standard diffraction pattern of pristine cofe2o4 the maximum adsorption capacity q max of cofe2o4 rgo nanocomposites was found to be 227 2 mg g at ph 6 and temp 298 k large specific saturation magnetization of 37 56 emu g as shown in fig 5b makes this adsorbent easy to separate from solution by applying an external magnetic field song et al 157 investigated first time the adsorption capacity of nico2o4 towards uranium they synthesised ultrathin nanosheets of nico2o4 on rgo by a co precipitation of ni2 and co2 followed by calcinations process from bet analysis the pore volume and surface area of the nico2o4 was found to be 0 42 cm3g 1 and 123 2 m2g 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 342 4 mg g at ph 5 0 the adsorption process was best described by pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm another class of metal oxide which received great attention in last few years for uranium removal due to its non toxicity and high chemical stability was titanium dioxide tio2 in this regard yu et al 158 prepared 3d graphene tio2 nanocomposite 3d ga tio2 used for the elimination of radionuclides the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be in the order of 3d ga tio2 go rgo tio2 441 3 mg g 280 0 mg g 140 9 mg g 98 5 mg g at ph 5 pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm was well fitted which corresponds to the chemisorption and monolayer adsorption some other notable studies in literature are also reported 150 159 163 3 1 5 go mofs composites recently yang et al 164 fabricated the one of a kind go cooh uio 66 composite for the u vi adsorption by coordinating the zirconium ion of uio 66 with the carboxyl groups of go upon contact with a 512 29 mg l uranium solution the go cooh uio 66 composite exhibited a greater adsorption capacity 1097 mg g than uio 66 1012 mg g guo et al 165 explored the unique antifouling and adsorption properties of the go ag zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 gza it was prepared by bonding of ag doped zif 67 on the go surface via coordination of ag metal with oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go to evaluate the practical applicability of the adsorbent the adsorption was evaluated on spiked natural sea water with 200 mg l uranium concentration and the results evaluate that the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 602 41 mg g at ph 7 0 and 298 k in addition the adsorbent showed excellent uranium removal rate from in presence of coexisting elements in real seawater 3 1 6 go cnts composites gu et al 166 prepared the graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts aerogels by intercalation of cnts between the graphene sheets which resulted in increased layer spacing and tremendously enhanced the adsorption capacity towards u vi adsorption the results demonstrate that at initial concentration of u vi co 50 mg l the go cnts aerogels showed maximum adsorption capacity of 100 mg l at ph 5 and 298 k which is attributed to the additional active sites on the surface of aerogels adsorption kinetics and isotherms was well fitted with pseudo second order and langmuir isotherm another new class of adsorbent which was explored by wang et al 72 was graphene oxide nanoribbons gonrs which is defined as nanometers wide stripes of graphene and prepared by modified tour s method to unzip multiwalled cnts to prepare gonrs sem ftir and xps analysis demonstrated that abundant oxygen containing functional groups like cooh oh are present on surface and edge of nanoribbons that form strong surface complexes with u vi ions on the surfaces of gonr resulting in high adsorption capacity the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 437 1 mg g at ph 4 5 and 298 k which was high in comparison to various adsorbents in terms of regeneration this adsorbent showed desorption efficiency of 97 5 by 0 5 mol l hcl after 5 cycles 3 1 7 miscellaneous go composite bentonite clay has great adsorption affinity towards heavy metals due to its high surface area and high cation exchange capacity 167 so studies have been done for removal of uranium by improving its adsorption capacity by grafting it with graphene oxide in this regard liu et al 168 prepared go bentonite composite by graft polymerization epoxy chloropropane and ammonium persulfate sodium bisulphate were used as cross linker and initiator respectively the results demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 234 19 mg g at neutral ph and 303 k research on the fabrication and potential uses of sulfonated graphene has also been reported zhang et al 75 successfully synthesised sulfonated graphene oxide gos via vapor solid transfer reaction of graphene oxide go using fuming sulfonic acid 50 so3 h2 so4 sem and tem images showed smoother and thinner sheet structure of gos compared to go it s possible that this is because the incorporation of hydrophilic so3h groups prevents the aggregation of gos sheets results showed gos exhibited excellent adsorption behaviour for u vi with the maximum adsorption capacity of 309 09 mg g another notable work reported in literature is of graphene oxide nanosheets being linked to clay mineral by performing organomodification on commercially available sepiolite surface 169 the adsorption of uranium on these adsorbents were found to increase in the order sepiolite 89 3 mg g go 119 8 mg g go sepiolite 161 3 mg g the mechanism of uranium adsorption on go sepiolite composites was found to be surface complexation under alkaline conditions and ion exchange at low ph other notable studies reported in literature are 170 173 3 2 biochar based adsorbents for u vi removal although many types of adsorbents exist in practice their usage is limited due to relatively high cost non sustainability and complicated manufacturing processes and application 174 biochar with different surface modifications shows high adsorption capacities towards uranium removal from aqueous medium and it is considered as the sustainable low cost alternative adsorbent 175 the abundance of surface functional groups high porosity large surface area and excellent ion exchange capacity results in a significantly high adsorption efficiency of biochar based adsorbents 176 besides its good adsorption performance biochar shows the advantages of simple synthesis and application facile functionalization stable structure enhanced physicochemical properties and other environmental advantages like the energy co production carbon sequestration and biowaste valorisation to increase biochar s adsorption capacity and environmental applicability modification of raw biochar prepared by hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis is a current research focus 177 181 these modifications include surface oxidation and modification with chelating ligands doping with desired element magnetization surface coating with metal oxides and loading of nanoparticles to obtain biochar nanocomposites 182 184 the main adsorption properties between biochar based adsorbents and u vi are given in table 2 3 2 1 hydrothermally carbonized biochar the hydrothermally generated biochar is hypothesised to have higher affinity for adsorption of dissolved u vi due to the presence of oxygen rich functional groups on its surface hydrothermal carbonization htc of biomass results in formation of a carbon rich black solid an insoluble product in the temperature range of 180 350 c 185 earliest notable research revealed usage of switchgrass as precursor for synthesis of hydrothermally modified biochar hmb a porous and amorphous solid 186 the presence of functional groups hydroxyl phenolic carbonyl and carboxyl was confirmed from ft ir analysis and these groups on the biochar surface adds substantial cation exchange capacity and also provides an excellent opportunity to adsorb uranium from the aqueous solution furthermore by the tg analysis hmb was found to be more thermally stable as an adsorbent in comparison to raw biomass like peat poplar sawdust and coconut shells batch experiments demonstrated maximum adsorption 90 of u vi at ph 5 9 with maximum adsorption capacity of 2 12 mg of u g two years later zhang et al 187 produced biochar from pine needles at 180 c in citric acid solution by hydrothermal carbonization htc sem analysis revealed a lot of carbon particles on the surface of htc indicating the successful carbonization and hydrolyzation of pine needles batch experiments demonstrated maximum adsorption capacity of 62 7 mg of u g at ph 6 0 and excellent equilibrium time of 50 min the desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent was also performed to check the economic viability of adsorbent and showed 99 desorption efficiency researchers observed that pristine biochars obtained by hydrothermal treatment needed some modifications for enhanced adsorption characteristics ioannou et al 188 investigated u vi adsorption on oxidized biochar fibres ocf derived from lufa cylindrica plant fibres by hydrothermal carbonization and further modified it with mno2 deposition ocf mno2 adsorption process was very well fitted by the langmuir isotherm which showed maximum sorption capacity for ocf as 95 71 mg g and it increased to an astonishing 904 24 mg g after modification mno2 colloidal particles formation on the biochar surface offers an enormous amount of surface and hydroxyl groups for metal ion adsorption which results in this exceptional sorption capacity sem images fig 6b clearly showed distinct mno2 crystallites formation on biochar surface white spots the creation of stable complexes e g mn o u vi on the surface of the modified material was attributed to the formation of a bidentate surface complex 189 190 another manganese oxide doped adsorbent research was done recently wang et al 191 synthesised a novel algal biochar cb from rhizoclonium riparium algae by hydrothermal carbonization and then modified it with δ mno2 mno2 cb the sorption isotherm was better fitted by the freundlich isotherm model and the maximum sorption capacity of u vi at ph 6 0 and 289 k was 100 2 mg g for the sorbent after δ mno2 particles are embedded in the filamentous biochar specific surface area results in a dramatic increase of 200 63 7 m2g 1 moreover the reusability of the mno2 cb 94 8 after 5 cycles further ensured its promising candidature for u vi elimination in wastewater which can also reduce the cost in practical applications and will be environmentally sustainable ye et al 192 successfully synthesised a biochar lrbc by hydrothermal carbonization using luffa ratan agricultural residue as precursor material further it was oxidized and transformed into functionalized lrbc f lrbc by hummer method to be used for u vi sorption the results showed that the maximum sorption capacities reached 382 mg g at ph 6 0 and 298 k the sem study of surface morphologies reveals that the basic texture of the modified biochar is preserved in comparison to the original biochar but the surface of the f lrbc becomes rougher and irregular which in turn facilitates binding to uranyl ions in solution according to the xrd results fig 7a the increased crystallinity of the functionalized biomass charcoal over the original biochar accounted for the 14 shift in the diffraction peak tga data fig 7b reveal that at 110 c biochar loses around 2 of its weight due to the evaporation of the physically adsorbed water 3 2 2 pyrolyzed biochar for pyrolysis literature shows that plant derived biochar is the most desirable option for scientists due to abundant availability low cost and eco friendly nature mishra et al 193 prepared biochar from eucalyptus wood through pyrolysis the maximum adsorption of u vi with initial concentration co 100 mg l was found to be 95 at ph 5 5 with equilibrium time 20 min while maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 27 2 mg g from best fitted langmuir isotherm close comparison of ft ir spectra of pristine biochar and uranium loaded biochar concluded that peaks at 1746 cm 1 corresponds to c o of carboxylic group 1460 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of carboxylate group 1016 cm 1 co stretching polysaccharides were found to be missing in uranium loaded biochar because of uranium adsorption xps spectrum of pristine biochar and uranium loaded biochar was compared and showed that along with common peaks of c 1 s n k and br atoms one peak of uranium at 377 63 ev was observed in uranium loaded biochar in survey scan this peak was further deconvoluted into 381 5 ev and 392 3 ev which corresponds to u 4f7 2 and u 4f5 2 a year later li et al 194 prepared biochar from camphor tree leaves bc ctl through pyrolysis process in tubular furnace at 350 c for 6 h potassium hydroxide koh was used during pyrolysis to remove the organic matter increasing the pore volume surface area and reactive surface functional groups the surface of bt ctl was positively charged below phzpc 5 76 due to protonation of functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups and easy deprotonation above phzpc which corresponds to the electronegativity of bc ctl and cause electrostatic interaction between u vi and active sites in ph range of 6 5 7 5 the comparison order of various kinetic models on basis of regression coefficient r2 for removal of u vi shows pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich kinetic equation from this order it was concluded that it was a case of chemisorption langmuir isotherm was best fitted and maximum adsorption capacity values q max increase from 98 29 mg g to 110 mg g 1 from t 293 k to t 333 k gulihen et al 195 worked extensively on biochar synthesis using macauba endocarp a palm tree shell as precursor material in this study the endocarp was subjected to six different pyrolytic temperatures 250 c 650 c aiming to evaluate the effect of the pyrolytic temperature on the biochar derived for the removal of u vi from aqueous solutions gyf measurements and later further study revealed that only biochars produced at 250 c bc250 and 350 c bc350 were of practical significance two years later further improvements of this selected material were done by doing the physical activation 196 the adsorption capacity of bc350 for uranyl ions in aqueous solutions was greatly improved by co2 physical activation qmax 488 7 mg g with over 99 removal for an initial u vi concentration of 5 mg l the activation method increased porosity by increasing the specific surface area from 0 83 to 643 m2 g the redlich peterson three parameter equation isotherm model was the most appropriate for fitting the experimental data suggesting heterogeneity of adsorption sites with different affinities for uranium setting up as a hybrid adsorption mechanism 197 the biochar showed its potential as a promising material for u vi removal from aqueous solutions in multi stage systems hno3 activation of pyrolyzed biochar is another effective technique hadjittofi et al 198 produced activated biochar via pyrolysis of o ficus indica cactus fibres and then oxidized it with hno3 for u vi adsorption application 199 pseudo first order and freundlich isotherm model well fitted the adsorption process showing high qmax value of 214 mg g even in acidic conditions ph 3 0 according to sem the material consists of a highly aligned series of lamellar structures that provide sorbent microchannels and an enlarged surface for quick fluid exchange and improved sorption capacity the ftir spectra demonstrate unambiguously that the activation of hno3 results in the formation of inner sphere complexes with the surface carboxylic moieties which are plentiful on the lamellar structures of bio sorbents jin et al 200 reported the adsorption of uranium on nitric acid treated biochar produced form wheat straw and cow manure the q max of u vi by the biochars at ph 4 5 and t 298 k decreased in the order of acid modified wheat straw 355 6 mg g acid modified cow manure 73 3 mg g pristine cow manure 64 0 mg g pristine wheat straw 8 7 mg g the apparently high adsorption capacity of acid modified wheat straw was due to the enhancement of cooh groups on the surface firstly these groups increase the surface hydrophilicity of the biochars and make suitable for uranium removal 201 secondly the carboxylic groups attached to the condensed aromatic rings on the surface of biochar which can form strong surface complexes with u vi 202 studies have shown that chemical oxidation of pyrolyzed biochar improves the adsorption results significantly yakout et al 77 pyrolyzed rice straw to produce biochar and then subjected it to liquid phase oxidation using different oxidizing agents in order to obtain materials with various surface characteristics among all biochar pyrolyzed at 550 c and modified by kmno4 was named as bk5 and showed remarkable adsorptive removal 99 3 of u vi at ph 5 5 with qmax of 100 mg g in terms of surface chemistry bk5 exhibited highest surface area 143 m2 g and maximum microporosity among all modified biochars therefore showing maximum adsorption towards uranium further in 2021 ahmed et al 180 pyrolyzed rice straw to generate biochar rsbc and then chemically oxidized it to obtain a modified biochar rsbc ox the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model was 242 65 mg g eds analysis reported that the oxygen content rose after modifying rsbc ox with nitric acid resulting in an increase in oxygen containing groups which improved the adsorption capacity of rsbc ox towards u vi introduction of mno2 particles has also been reported to increase the properties of pyrolyzed biochars towards u vi sorption much like hydrothermally synthesised biochar discussed above li et al 203 pyrolyzed ficus microcarpa aerial root fmar a plant biomass at 600 c for 2 h to obtain biochar for u vi adsorption the redlich peterson model and the pseudo second order kinetic model best described the process the sorption capacity of the modified fmar biochar 14 72 mg g was found to be higher than that of the raw biochar 6 30 mg g after kmno4 modification numerous characterization techniques sem eds ftir xps demonstrated that an increase in oh content and the development of an irregular sheet like nanostructure with mno2 nanoparticles on the biochar surfaces considerably increased the adsorption of u vi researchers 204 pyrolyzed orange peel at 650 c to obtain pristine biochar opc and then enhanced it with mno2 in situ deposition technique this novel biochar mno2 opc yielded the most competitive uptake value as 246 3 mg g described by langmuir isotherm model sem analysis revealed that number of pores increased after loading mno2 and meanwhile the specific surface area increased 165 01 m2 g for opc to 273 25 m2 g for 1 2mno2 opc as the loading amount increased till 1 6mno2 opc this was attributed to the redox reaction between manganese sulphate and kmno4 used during synthesis of biochar the eds analysis confirmed the main elemental composition of oxygen manganese carbon and binding uranium after adsorption process researchers also worked on animal derived biochars for more efficient u vi remediation as compared to plant derived biochar animal manure derived biochar has a higher concentration of po4 3 co3 2 which aids in the adsorption of heavy metal ions by animal manure derived biochar 205 in 2021 liao et al 181 synthesised three kinds of pig manure biochars pmbc by calcining pig manure pm pre treated with different agents in nitrogen the pm modified by h2o h2o2 and kmno4 were named pm h2o pm hp and pm pp respectively the modified biochars showed exceptional sorption capacities 979 3 mg g and 661 7 mg g by pm pp pmhp respectively the crystalline grains on pm pp were roughly spherical and homogeneously dispersed as validated by sem tem examination and thus supplied extra adsorption sites for adsorbing u vi after the successful experiment on pig derived biochar liao et al 206 explored further and synthesised bi2o3 doped horse manure derived biochar bi2o3 hmdb by slow pyrolysis technology at 500 c the biochar showed short equilibrium time 80 min a fast adsorption rate 5 0 mg g min and excellent sorption capacity qmax of 516 5 mg g on u vi removal with r2 values of 0 999 0 998 pso and langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorption process compared to others furthermore elemental mapping revealed that the nanoparticles on bi2o3 hmdb were mostly made up of o and bi confirming that bi2o3 was doped into the biochar successfully and uniformly the results also revealed that the bi2o3 hmdb had a removal effectiveness of almost 99 7 with only about 0 009 mg l u vi remaining in the solution much below the world health organization standard of 0 030 mg l 207 3 2 3 magnetized biochar the magnetization of biochars is a cost effective method that facilitates phase separation which in turn reduces secondary pollution problems faced by pristine and other modified biochars 208 it also improves their adsorption capacity for u vi removal the modification using metal salts or metal oxides can drastically enhance the characteristics of the materials as regards adsorption catalysis and magnetism wang et al 209 modified a pyrolyzed rice husk biochar bc via an aqueous fe3 solution treatment and used it for pb ii and u vi removal the results demonstrated that the ion exchange and complexation activity between biochar and metal ions was significantly enhanced by the presence of fe oxides in magnetized biochar mbc the adsorption experimental data were well simulated with the assumptions of pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models with qmax being 64 mg g and 118 mg g at 328 k for bc and mbc respectively due to the inclusion of fexoy mbc had a 100 increase in bet surface area and micropore volume compared to bc 52 1 m2 g 0 02 cm3 g according to sem micrographs the magnetic modification procedure produced a biochar with a rough surface and a lot of micro spheres and mineral particles which can offer a lot of adsorption spots increasing the biochar s adsorption capacity in another similar study magnetic biochar composite mb was successfully synthesised by pyrolysis of siderite and rice husk biochars at 550 c under n2 protection 210 batch adsorption experiments were governed by langmuir isotherm showing qmax of 52 63 mg gat 288 k sem edx analysis showed the presence of fine granular nanoparticles of fe3o4 attached on the surface of porous fibrous structure in line with previous study 211 u vi adsorbed onto mb was reduced to u iv by fe3o4 according to xps and xanes analyses further in 2021 a lot of advances was done in magnetisation of biochars ahmed et al 179 pyrolyzed citrus lannatus seeds a watermelon biowaste to obtain pristine biochar bc and then magnetized it with mnfe2o4 by co precipitation method 212 this magnetized biochar mfbc showed enhanced adsorption capacity qmax of27 61 mg g compared to bc qmax of21 24 mg g at ph 4 0 with a saturation magnetization of 36 28 emu g mf bc shows potential for widespread use in wastewater treatment thanks to its ability to facilitate a simple magnetic separation the structural porosity of the biochars was calculated using n2 adsorption desorption fig 8 and the desorption curve of mf bc was found to represent the type iv loop in accordance with iupac standards 213 ahmed et al 214 researched further and magnetized pristine biochar obtained from tribulus terrestris a plant biomass by two different methods using fecl3 both adsorbents 1s bc and 2s bc were studied and showed decent sorption capacity of 49 56 mg g and 66 mg g respectively five consecutive regeneration cycles verified an excellent reusability 95 for 1s bc further some impressive research was done in year 2020 21 wang et al 215 synthesised a magnetic biochar composite fe3o4 mb by hydrothermal treatment using cyanobacterium derived pristine biochar mb as precursor material the results showed the maximum sorption capacity of 52 06 mg g at ph 6 0 and 298 k according to the ftir and xps analysis under further investigations it was found that u vi sorption on composite was mainly ascribed to the surface complexation between u vi and oxygen containing functional groups oh c o on the surface of biochar the sharp increase of o content 7 98 and fe content 100 in eds spectra illustrated the successful fabrication of ferric oxide mb composite sen et al 216 synthesised a silicon containing activated biochar supporting iron oxide nanoparticle sb fe using rice husks for u vi adsorption from the contaminant groundwater the maximum adsorption capacity from the langmuir isothermal model was recorded as 138 88 mg g at ph 5 5 zhang et al 217 prepared activated biochar loaded nano zero valent iron a bc nzvi composite by aqueous phase reduction and magnetization using biomass longan shells as carbon source the results showed that the sorbent displayed an efficient sorption ability in u vi remediation with maximum adsorption capacity reaching 331 13 mg g at ph 6 0 the characteristic diffraction peaks fig 9a of a bc and nzvi was observed to be retained in the a bc nzvi material suggesting the successful synthesis of a bc nzvi from ftir image fig 9b we infer that the sorbent withheld original characteristic bands along with generation of a new weak signal at 685 cm 1 which was attributed to the feo bond formed between bc and nzvi as seen in fig 9d surface area of a bc nzvi sbet was found to be785 81 m2 g a 32 7 loss as compared to a bc due to blocking of micropores of biochar by the introduction of iron particles the phzpc value fig 9e of a bc nzvi was 6 2 implying electrostatic interactions affect the u vi removal at different ph values speaking of latest research in 2022 researchers pyrolyzed waste watermelon rind to obtain pristine biochar wbc and then magnetized it mwbc by co precipitation method to treat u vi contaminated water 218 due to the magnetic particles imbedded on its surface wbc had a larger surface area 65 7 pore volume adsorption capabilities 138 and stability which aided its separation from the aqueous phase due to the external magnetic field the u vi adsorption of mwbc showed a qmax of 323 56 mg g at ph 4 0 which was higher than that of watermelon rind biochar wbc 135 86 mg g around 99 removal capacity was achieved by the third cycle with a drop in uranium content within who criteria indicating that the synthesised adsorbent may be employed in real world applications such as uranium polluted industries and pharmaceutical wastes 3 2 4 miscellaneous biochar composites previous studies showed that most biochar adsorbents were of wood or plant origin but ashry et al 219 used biochar produced from gasification of cow bone rich in ca phosphate for uranium removal a freundlich adsorption isotherm coupled to a reversible first order kinetic equation best described the time dependent fixation of u vi within the biochar structure based on experimental data for ph 7 elemental analysis from icp ms confirmed the presence of ca and p in good proportion furthermore surface morphology through sem confirmed the grains of ca and p in association with carbon matrix in 2021 ahmed et al 51 successfully synthesised a hydroxyapatite hap biochar nanocomposite br hap from rice straw biochar br by co precipitation method to be used as a new and efficient adsorbent for removing u vi from aqueous solution it was shown that br and br hap had maximal u vi adsorption capabilities of 110 56 mg g and 428 25 mg g respectively eds analysis confirmed the successful modification of biochar leading to enhanced oxygenated functional groups by showing a consistent elemental distribution and greater oxygen content in br hap akl et al 220 fabricated a new orange peel biochar based hydrogel composite by graft polymerization using guar gum and acrylamide ggamb themaximum adsorption capacity of the ggamb hydrogel composite based on the langmuir isotherm model was 263 2 mg g and the adsorption equilibrium was attained at 150 min biochar micrograph as seen in sem images revealed a smooth nonporous and less uneven surface whereas the ggamb composite showed a rougher porous and irregular surface morphology which is desirable for uranium vi adsorption in the same year liu et al 221 synthesised novel biochar supported by starch and nanoscale iron sulfide sfes biochar composites and derived from peanut shell 222 u vi uptake from aqueous solution by sfes biochar composites were carried out which followed freundlich isotherm and showed qmax of 76 39 mg g at 298 k deposition of two major elements fe and s on the surface of sfes biochar as seen in eds spectrum fig 10 confirmed the successful loading of fes nanoparticles on the surface of biochar 3 3 activated carbon based adsorbents for u vi removal activated carbon is a proven effective adsorbent for the treatment of a wide variety of pollutants 58 223 228 activated carbon s low cost and ease of production as well as its extended service life high internal surface area and porosity and chemical and thermal stability make it a promising candidate as an economical and effective adsorbent for heavy metal removal from wastewaters the main adsorption properties between activated carbon based adsorbents and u vi are given in table 3 earliest notable study present in literature data of this century is of 2006 when researchers used granulated activated carbon to examine u vi adsorption from aqueous solutions and got exceptional results qmax 28 3 mg g at 293 k 97 the exothermic adsorption process well fitted by the freundlich isotherm model at ph 3 0 0 1 and 0 1 g of activated carbon the highest elimination of u vi 98 was recorded the activation energy ea of 7 91 kj mol indicated physical adsorption of u vi onto activated carbon further researchers studied the adsorption of u vi cesium and strontium ions as a function of contact time and metal ion concentration from aqueous solutions onto a commercial activated carbon gcn1240 obtained by physical activation of coconut shell 98 adsorption process followed assumptions of pseudo first order kinetics and agrees well with both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models revealing qmax of 55 32 mg g sem observation clearly showed the porous structure of the carbon the same year yakout et al 229 investigated adsorptive competition between uranium vi and humic acids ha using rice straw activated carbon modified with koh rsk carbon langmuir isotherm well fitted the adsorption process showing qmax of 100 mg g the interaction of uranium ions with ha resulted in the creation of u ha complexes which altered the surface interactions of both uranium ions and ha with the carbon surface according to the findings humic substance is a significant uranium binding inhibitor and should be eliminated from wastewater for uranium remediation yi et al 230 studied the adsorption of uranyl cations uo2 2 by apricot shell activated carbon asac in a batch system the optimal ph for favourable u vi adsorption was 6 0 as the effect of u vi adsorption was significantly ph dependent the adsorption mechanism followed both langmuir and freundlich models assumptions while exhibiting a qmax of 59 17 mg g research studies showed that magnetisation of activated carbon significantly increased its u vi sorption ability for example researchers synthesised nanoscale zero valent iron supported on activated charcoal nzvi ac by the reduction of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate with sodium borohydride and the adsorption capacity reached an exceptional 492 6 mg g according to the freundlich isotherm model 231 saleh et al 232 succeeded in synthesising polyethyleneimine modified activated carbon fe paf and using it as an effective magnetic adsorbent under optimal conditions u vi adsorption onto paf followed the langmuir isotherm model with a qmax of 115 31 mg g the nitrogen and oxygen containing functional groups contributed to adsorption and improved the adsorbent s effectiveness after modification zhang et al 233 synthesised magnetic activated carbons macs from orange peel by co functionalization of poly dopamine pda and ag nanoparticles for the recovery of u vi from simulated seawater compared with macs 632 91 mg g at ph 7 0 this novel sorbent s macs pda ag calculated maximum adsorption capacity increased to 657 89 mg g at ph 8 0 and showed good recyclability the appearance of fe o fe stretching vibration 595 cm 1 in ftir spectra confirmed the successful fabrication of macs furthermore the appearance of phenolic co stretching vibration 1240 cm 1 and the shearing vibration of nh 1519 cm 1 reveal that the pda layer is incorporated on macs in 2018 haddad et al 234 did surface modification of commercially activated carbon ac and prepared two new activated carbons by achieving nitric acid oxidation ox ac and iron chloride impregnation fe ac to remove uranium vi ions from aqueous solutions the adsorption performance of the examined adsorbents was categorised as ac ox ac fe ac 9 51 14 41 38 01 mg g based on the experimental data this is related to the amount of oxygen content in the adsorbent ftir analysis revealed that the emergence of new bands depicted that the cooh groups are introduced on the surface of carbon after the treatment of ox ac and fe ac with nitric acid and kmno4 respectively the xrd pattern of the iron impregnated sample fe ac revealed two peaks between 33 and 40 and 54 65 which may be attributed to the crystalline structures of pure α fe2o3 icdd 00 033 0664 confirming that iron was deposited as ferric oxide on the carbon layer s surface owing to their special affinity for uranium ions amidoxime modified adsorbents have also proven to be one of the most promising candidates for uranium extraction from aqueous systems 235 liu et al 236 synthesised amidoxime based activated carbon and surface of adsorbent carbon became rougher after u vi adsorption due to remarkable number of particles being disposed on its surface fig 11 emergence of several new peaks c n nh2 no in the ftir spectrum confirmed that the amidoxime groups were grafted onto activated carbon successfully phosphoric acid activation is also reported to be an efficient method for modification of adsorbents pu et al 237 prepared activated carbon ac from waste cigarette filters by convenient carbonization and functionalization this eco friendly sorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 106 mg g for u vi removal after functionalization with phosphoric acid much higher than the untreated activated carbon 31 mg g and the adsorption selectivity is very desirable the emergence of peak at 920 cm 1 of ftir spectra may be attributed to the influence of p element another phosphorous containing activated carbon synthesised as a potential sorbent for uranium vi is reported in literature is of haggag et al 238 phosphate activated carbon pac was derived from pistachio nutshells and showed qmax of 337 mg g at ph 3 5 the chemical activation process was found effective in creating a large surface area with well developed pores of different sizes and shapes on the surface of pistachio nutshell activated carbon tem image revealed the micro mesoporous structure and confirmed amorphous nature of the sorbent another researcher synthesised camellia oleifera shell based activated carbon cosac by phosphoric acid activation method and further used it to remove u vi from the aqueous solution in a batch system 239 the results showed that maximum sorption capacity and removal efficiency reached 78 93 mg g and 89 1 at optimum conditions the ph was found to be one of the most critical parameters affecting the adsorption of u vi with optimum results being observed at 5 5 bet research revealed that cosac has a high specific surface area of 1300 m2 g and a large total pore volume of 0 9 cm3 g both of which are essential for high performance adsorbents saputra et al 240 synthesised a coconut shell derived adsorbent via chemical activation with naoh and an impregnation method involving various solutions of mgcl2 the results demonstrated that equilibrium data are well described by the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of around 85 mg g at 303 k ftir and xrd spectra revealed the presence of brucite mg oh 2 compounds confirming the successful impregnation in 2020 aslani et al 241 synthesised ac pan active carbon polyacrylonitrile composite and investigated it in a batch system for uranium sorption aiming for uranium remediation from nuclear wastewater the qmax was found to be 28 45 mg g at 303 k thermodynamic parameters indicated the adsorption process to be exothermic spontaneous and favourable in the same year researchers prepared a novel sorbent by coating nano hydroxyapatite on activated carbon hap ac and immobilising into the alginate matrix hap ac alginate was found to be highly efficient 92 for removing uranium from the portable water with qmax of 18 66 mg g evaluated from langmuir isotherm 242 the xrd spectrum of the synthesised compound displayed the presence of the hexagonal crystal structure of the hydroxyapatite phase further a great deal of notable work was accomplished in 2021 researchers from egypt worked to mitigate uranium contamination in groundwater by developing cost effective graphite based activated carbon ac and then functionalized it by oxidation o ac and amination n o ac 243 the adsorption process was governed by langmuir isotherm which showed a maximum sorption capacity of 32 45 mg g 73 41 mg g for o ac n o ac respectively zhang et al 244 prepared phosphorylated activated carbon from silk gourd loofah rattan by phosphoric acid modification and the maximum sorption capacity was recorded to be 197 mg g nezhad et al 245 used carbon powder waste cpw from the zirconium carbide industry as the raw material for the preparation of activated modified carbon adsorbent which was used for uranium removal from radioactive waste effluents of the nuclear industry the sorbent was activated by koh and then oxidized by ammonium persulphate aps which further enhanced its uranium removal efficiency through carboxylic acid functional groups a cpw cooh the freundlich and timken models did not suit the sorption isotherms as well as the langmuir model which showed the maximal u vi sorption capacity as 192 31 mg g as a result of oxidation with aps the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc reduced from 9 7 for acpw to 3 1 for a cpw cooh showing that the acidic functional groups cooh are well formed on the surface of the sorbent nezhad et al 246 further functionalised this sorbent by using 2 aminobenzoic acid aba as a selective ligand for uo2 2 adsorption the langmuir model under optimal conditions determined the maximum sorption capacity of this new sorbent ac aba to be 194 2 mg g indicating that the modification method has increased the sorption capacity eds analysis indicates a notable uptick in the concentrations of oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen following the modification with a desorption efficacy of 98 after five sequential sorption desorption cycles 1 0 mol l hcl can successfully desorb u vi from ac aba preparing it for the next regeneration cycle 3 4 regeneration of carbon based adsorbents apart from water recovery regeneration of carbon adsorbent and recovery of adsorbed uranium is a critical issue to ensure greenness of the process for the recycling of both components adsorbent recovery not only reduce the overall cost of the process but also ensure the utility of the spent adsorbent in similar or related applications various regeneration methods such as thermal regeneration supercritical fluid extraction biological method advance oxidative method ozonation etc have been used in past for the regeneration of carbon based adsorbents 247 however few common issues encountered during these methods are high regeneration cost adsorbent deterioration long recovery periods and secondary environmental pollution keeping these issues in mind solvent desorption approach is the most recommended method used in the regeneration process in industries and laboratory studies we refer to the entire process of adsorption which results in spent adsorbent and desorption which results in new adsorption from spent adsorbent as one cycle desorbing eluents like hcl naoh and nacl are used in specific molar concentrations mostly 0 1 1 5 m in order to better understand the desorption process researchers typically do adsorption experiments across several cycles usually 5 6 desorption efficiency can be determined by the following formula desorption efficiency c des c ads 100 where cdes is the concentration of adsorbate desorbed in mg g and cads is the concentration of adsorbate adsorbed in mg g desorption studies of some researchers are already discussed briefly in this paper some other notable studies that showed desorption efficiency of 90 after 5 cycles are also reported in literature 75 139 148 191 246 4 performance evaluation of carbon based adsorbents by partition coefficient uranium species bound to various type of carbon based adsorbents through electrostatic functional groups complexation and vander walls interactions as depicted in fig 12 however the overall effectiveness of a uranium adsorption process has been demonstrated by maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at equilibrium conditions when comparing adsorbent performances it is technically more appropriate to use a nonbiased parameter because experimental variables such as initial adsorbate concentration adsorbent dosage and contact time vary substantially throughout published research in this regard partition coefficient which is defined as the ratio of equilibrium concentrations of a dissolved substance in a two phase system allow impartial judgment while comparing adsorbent performances it produces a normalised value that allows for fair comparisons among adsorbents despite the broad variety of initial experimental conditions the partition coefficient is derived from the ratio of the maximum adsorption capacity mg g to the equilibrium adsorbate concentration μm in the media partition coefficient adsorption capacity of u species on adsorbent mg g equilibrium adsorbate concentration μm the pc values determined for various carbon based adsorbents are given in tables 1 3 as such the reduced graphene oxide adenosine 5 monophosphate 155 gives the highest pc value as 1028 mg g μm 1 among all those go adsorbents reported in table 1 another intriguing aspect of pc is that it can be utilized as a quick method for gauging potential bias in evaluating performance only on the basis of adsorption capacity for example with a very high qmax of 602 41 mg g of graphene zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 165 pc value is calculated as 2 39 mg g μm 1 only whereas polydopamine go 146 has pc value of 34 62 mg g μm 1 with a qmax of 145 39 mg g the observed superiority of polydopamine go may reflect the large surface area and high concentration of oxygen containing functional groups a high pc value indicates that polydopamine go is successfully removing about 99 u from a solution initial u concentration of 10 mg l at a ph of 4 0 for biochar based adsorbents animal derived biochar performed best whereas magnetized biochars fell short with the highest pc value reaching 66 78 mg g μm 1 for activated biochar magnetized with nano zero valent iron 217 in case of activated carbon based adsorbents usage of high adsorbent dosage was reported to be the reason for low pc 5 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of uranium adsorption can be understood by various methods including ftir analysis xps analysis ph investigation contact time and dft calculations etc 5 1 mechanism by techniques there are two main techniques ftir and xps used for the confirmation of uranium adsorption and qualitative and quantitative determination 5 1 1 ftir analysis ftir analysis helps to determine adsorption of uranium ions on the surface of material by the variation in frequencies of particular functional groups after the adsorption along with the appearance of a low intensity band corresponding to uranium it is obvious from most of the studies that a low intensity band in the range of 910 cm 1 to 920 cm 1 appears in the ftir spectrum of material after the adsorption of uranium which is attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching of o u o species table 4 as the concentration of uranium ion increases intensity of peaks appearing at 920 cm 1 also increases as shown in fig 13 198 the intensity of other peaks corresponding to the functional groups present in the materials generally lowers after the interaction with u vi ions this is due to the fact that lone pair of electrons or negative charge of functional groups were neutralized by positively charged uranium species table 4 shows that all types of materials including graphene based materials biochar based materials and activated carbon based materials can be effectively used for the uranium adsorption which can be detected by ftir spectroscopy in graphene functionalized materials the presence of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on the basal plane of graphene oxide go and other modified functionalities take part in uranium sorption various research groups show that amidoxime functionalization on graphene sheets are highly effective in removal of uranium species from aqueous solution 120 248 250 in biochar modified materials hydroxyl and carbonyl groups generally interact with uranium ions for the remediation process similarly activated carbon based materials contained oxidized functional groups which are responsible for the removal of u vi ions table 4 some other studies reviewed for table 4 description are 151 251 253 5 1 2 xps analysis sorption mechanism of uranium can be well understood by xps analysis using binding energy values for various elemental configurations the deconvoluted xps spectrum of particular element clearly shows the shifting in binding energies after the adsorption of uranium ions in xps spectrum the presence of peaks in the range of 380 ev u 4f5 2 to 395 u 4f7 2ev confirms the successful adsorption of uranium ions on the surface of material various graphene and activated carbon based materials have been used for uranium adsorption and the mechanism of sorption was confirmed by shifting in peaks in xps analysis as shown in table 5 the study of wang et al 191 showed that two peaks at 381 8 ev and 392 5 ev were observed fig 14a these peaks were attributed to u vi ions u 4f5 2and u 4f7 2 respectively fig 14b the binding energies of c 1s n 1s and o 1s shift from the original values after the interaction with uranium ions the relative amounts of peaks were decreased after the adsorption due to occupation of some active sites by uranium ions they show that the percentage of cc co and o c o in mno2 cb a biochar based material were reduced from 23 1 to 20 6 69 3 to 66 3 and 10 6 to 10 1 respectively after the sorption of uranium fig 14c and d the intensities of o 1s and mn 2p were changed after sorption of u vi ions fig 14e and f some studies revealed that the binding energies of n 1s o1s and c 1s were same after the adsorption of uranium but intensities of peaks decreased due to the formation of complex with oxygen or nitrogen and uranium vi ion 215 various other recent reports 254 explained the adsorption mechanism of uranium using xps analysis as shown in table 5 5 2 mechanism by parameters 5 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the solution greatly affects the adsorption of uranium ions in two aspects i behaviour of uranium species at different ph such as uo2 2 oh 2 uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 4 oh 7 uo2 oh 3 and uo2 3 oh 7 as shown in fig 15a 155 and ii surface charge of the adsorbent materials shown in fig 15b 255 these two parameters are generally considered to explain the adsorption mechanism of uranium ions in general it is found from most of the studies that sorption process of u vi ions increases on increasing the ph of solution 155 256 258 this is due to the protonation of oxygen and nitrogen functionalities at low ph which makes them unavailable for binding with positively charged uranium species however when ph of the solution increases the concentration of hydronium ion also decreases resulting in formation of more negatively charged species that can interact with positively charged uranium ions and remove them in some reports it is observed that amount of uranium ion adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent increases to some extent on increasing ph and then starts decreasing this is due to the formation of negative charged uranium species uo2 oh 3 and uo2 3 oh 7 which hinders the sorption process by repulsion with negatively charged functional groups table 6 in a very recent study 259 a graphene oxide functionalized material was used for the adsorptive removal of various metal ions including u vi pb ii cr vi and cd ii it was found that the maximum removal of metal ions occurred at ph 5 which was 92 4 in case of uranium elashry et al 259 reported 94 5 removal of u vi ion from aqueous solution using quinoline functionalized activated carbon at ph 4 7 another significant study is of wang et al 250 which showed that u vi adsorption increased with increasing ph these results showed that effect of ph on removal efficiency of u vi ion varied with types of material or in more specific way types of functional groups present on material 5 2 2 effect of contact time another important parameter for the investigation of adsorption mechanism is contact time between the adsorbent and uranium containing aqueous solution various models have been to investigate the adsorption kinetics such as pseudo first order pseudo second order weber morris intraparticle diffusion etc among these models pseudo second order best fitted for the adsorption kinetics as confirmed by most of the studies wang et al 250 reported that using various types of carbon modified materials including graphene and carbon nanotubes gonrs mwcnts pao gonrs a and gonrs a the adsorption rates of u vi ions were found to be fast and reached to equilibrium in 60 min the adsorption capacities for four materials were obtained from the pseudo second order kinetics 0 052 0 908 mmolg 1 were very close to the experimental values 0 051 0 853 mmol g indicating chemisorption as the rate determining step this study supported the previously reported results by researchers 260 who showed that go pda and go pda pei follow pseudo second order r2 1 among all models used for the determination of dynamic processes some activated carbon based materials were also utilized to show the maximum removal efficiency and equilibrium point the study of nezhad et al 246 explained two stage kinetic behaviour of sorption process of u vi ion using ac and ac aba materials at 40 c in the range of 30 180 min fig 16a they showed that at first stage a rapid initial sorption of u vi ion was observed due to the presence of substantial number of vacant active sites for uranium sorption whereas second stage was associated with constant adsorption rate because of repulsion with adsorbed uranium ions and various other factors the sorption equilibrium was attained in 100 min which was considered as optimum contact time esmaeel et al 251 showed that using afs composite sorption equilibrium can be achieved in 60 min of contact time fig 16b wang et al 191 reported the adsorption of u vi using fe3o4 cb as a magnetic biochar material they showed that sorption equilibrium by fe3o4 cb reached in 8 h later they utilized manganese oxide functionalized biochar material mno2 cb for u vi adsorption and showed that equilibrium reached within 7 h and the maximum sorption amount of mno2 cb was found to be 100 2 mg g fig 17a among all models fig 17b d used for adsorption kinetics including pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion best fitted curve was obtained using pseudo second order model with r2close to 1 0 999 fig 17c suggesting that sorption process followed chemisorption intra particle diffusion process was also used to investigate the rate determine step which showed that particle diffusion process was the main rate determine step for u vi adsorption a biochar based material f lrbc was utilized by researchers 192 for u vi removal from aqueous solution in adsorption kinetics a sharp increment in amount of uranium with increase in reaction time from 10 to 30 min was observed at ph 6 after that from 30 to 60 min a slow increment was obtained due to resistance by the adsorbed uranium ions recently some researchers explored the use of biochar based materials such as pig manure biochar 181 and bi2o3 supported biochar 206 to show that removal of u vi can be effectively removed within 80 min the above discussed adsorption kinetics involved use of linear form of equations to determine the adsorption capacity of materials at different time intervals however a few researchers used non linear forms of pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations 155 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t to explain the adsorption mechanism dutta et al 155 suggested that adsorption of uranyl ions depended on the concentration of u vi ion in the adsorbate they found that the adsorption data obtained from the non linear pseudo second order kinetics was in good agreement with the experimental data calculated from the above eq 2 the adsorption mechanism involved the transfer of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent over the entire range of contact time 5 3 dft calculations density functional theory dft is widely used for theoretical calculations of relevant basic data of bonding structures and adsorption energies of complexes between adsorbate and adsorbent it is an effective tool in the field of computational chemistry to describe the nature of bonding using the experimental values of bonding distance and adsorption energies 261 263 in recent years dft has been widely applied to support the adsorption mechanism of uranyl ion on various mesoporous and microporous materials the lesser bonding distance between uranyl ions and adsorbent and higher adsorption energy suggested that the uranylions are strongly attached to the surface of adsorbent duan et al 256 carried out dft calculation for six complexes including uo2pao h2o 4 uo2pao h2o 3 uo2 pao 2 h2o 3 uo2 pao 2 h2o 2 uo2 pao 2h2o and uo2 pao 3 the average bond distance between u vi ions and co ordinated oxygen atoms of water molecules u ow in uo2 h2o 5 2 complex was found to be 2 457 å which was in good agreement with previously reported results 263 however the bond distances for nitrogen u nl and oxygen u ol atoms of amidoxime group were relatively shorter which suggesting the stronger chelation ability of amidoxime groups with u vi ions than water molecules ai et al 264 used dft simulations to study the interaction mechanism of u vi ions with go using implicit water model at different ph level the major adsorbing sites of go were carboxylic groups cooh epoxy groups c o c and hydroxyl groups oh which interacted with uranyl ions to form various complexes in fig 18 the optimized structures of go o uo2 go oh uo2 2 and go oh2 uo2 3 were represented in acidic neutral and alkaline environment respectively it was found that on increasing the ph from acidic to alkaline bond distance contracted 2 104 å and adsorption energies increased 67 61 kcal mol suggesting chemisorption of u vi ions on the surface of go the decrease in ph caused bond elongation of uo bond 2 119 å and 2 450 å with decrease in adsorption energy which showed that acidic medium was not favourable for the adsorption of u vi ions the other complexes shown in fig 18 also followed the same mechanism in a most recent study sun et al 265 used unoxidized biochar bc and oxidized biochar obc materials for the removal of uranium vi ions they demonstrated that the adsorption mechanism of u vi ions can be well explained by dft simulations using optimized geometries of u vi ions and the materials on which it was adsorbed in fig 19 the optimized geometries of solvated u vi ion over bc and obc had been shown the experimental characterization showed that u vi ions were weakly adsorbed physisorbed on the surface of bc due to a large binding distance of 4 21 å and thermodynamically unfavorable adsorption energy of 2 38 kcal mol the hirshfeld charge transfer analysis also confirmed the weaker interaction because there was no appreciable charge transfer between u vi ion and bc adsorption of solvated u vi was found to be significantly strong due to strong hydrogen bonding between solvated u vi ions and functional groups like oh and cooh etc the bond distances are comparatively very low 1 64 å 1 71 å and 1 87 å moreover a highly negative adsorption energy 31 82 kcal mol and a larger charge transfer 0 06 to 0 09 e between the solvated u vi ion and the obc surface further confirmed the formation of strong hydrogen bonds 6 conclusion challenges and perspectives activated carbon biochar and graphene materials are most promising carbon materials for the removal of hazardous uranium from aqueous solutions their adsorptive characteristics are governed by surface interaction ion exchange and electrostatic interaction mechanism additionally ph has significant role in the uranium removal process by these materials as uranium specification in water is deeply affected by the solution ph as reviewed in this article langmuir and freundlich isotherm models offer better insights into the adsorption of uranium species on activated carbon biochar and graphene based adsorbents among kinetic models pseudo second order model is more suitable to describe uranium removal mechanism owing to the chemisorption nature of the adsorption process diverse functional moieties exist on the surface of these carbon materials are capable of binding different uranium species under defined experimental conditions outstanding efforts have been carried out by the researchers and scientists across the globe to develop carbon adsorbents that could selectively bound uranium species from the aqueous matrix containing other impurity metals considering global advancement we firmly believe that there is a bright scope of research in the field of uranium removal for scientific personal if following challenges and drawbacks as taken into consideration i efforts should be made in the direction of preparing carbon based adsorbents from waste carbon sources to develop a cost effective technique moreover green treatment protocols should be practiced ensuring selective binding of diverse uranium species such as oxides hydroxides and carbonates under all ph conditions ii the synthesis method used to prepare a carbon adsorbent has significant effect on its morphology like surface area pore size and chemical reactivity more attention should be given on these aspects to derive highly efficient and chemically durable carbon adsorbents for uranium removal iii the adsorption performance of different carbon based adsorbents should be judged using actual wastewater to simulate a more effective technique for application in realistic world iii uranium recovery from the spent adsorbent is an important aspect as it is crucial for uranium market therefore detailed spectral and theoretical knowledge on the uranium species interaction mechanism with carbon based adsorbent at molecular level is highly desirable to explore the adsorption mechanisms and design uranium recovery protocols iv emphasis should be made on developing effective and green protocols for the recovery of spent adsorbents without deteriorating its adsorption efficiency current regeneration protocols using acid or alkali are not environmentally friendly and thus need to be replaced by other environmentally friendly approaches with minimal or no effective on adsorbent performance iv other modes of experimental approach column or continuous flow mode should be included along with batch mode to test the efficiencies of these materials towards uranium removal from continuum stream of uranium

12524,coagulation is an effective pre treatment step for ultrafiltration uf drinking water treatment but is limited by the inability to regulate membrane fouling particularly organic and biological fouling herein we propose a permanganate bisulfite pm bs pre oxidation enhanced coagulation process pm bs coagulation as uf pre treatment and apply it to treat samples of natural surface waters the results indicate that pm bs coagulation demonstrated superior performance in mitigating membrane fouling for the four different types of real water the specific membrane flux decline of uf following pm bs coagulation was 4 2 22 less than that of uf following coagulation and pm bs coagulation decreased the total filtration resistance by 21 7 74 9 compared to coagulation alone to achieve the best membrane fouling alleviation pm bs was suggested for use with aluminum polychloride coagulation under optimized oxidation coxtox coagulant dosage gt value and sedimentation time pm bs coagulation pre

metabolic activity of microorganisms and affecting the foulant characteristics and 2 indirectly adjusting the foulants depositional environment e g zeta potential roughness hydrophobicity and interfacial free energy these two factors influenced the subsequent fouling development this work highlights the potential of pm bs coagulation to assist uf in producing high quality drinking water while preserving a low membrane fouling propensity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration pre treatment membrane fouling control bisulfite activated permanganate enhanced coagulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there has been a substantial growth in ultrafiltration uf applications in drinking water treatment in recent decades 1 3 compared to conventional treatments uf shows great advantages in the removal of pathogens and particulate impurities which significantly improves the quality of treated water particularly with respect to its biological security furthermore uf has a lower environmental footprint despite these advantages the extended application of the uf process in full scale waterworks needs to overcome several bottlenecks such as membrane fouling high energy cost and low rejection of low molecular weight organics of these membrane fouling after long term operation which results in decreased membrane productivity and increased energy consumption is the main obstacle 4 although physical washing e g air scouring crossflow circulation and chemical cleaning can mitigate fouling these steps not only consume extensive energy and cleaning chemicals but also compromise membrane health and limit its lifespan 5 such a fouling control strategy is intrinsically a passive coping strategy i e remediation after pollution to overcome the limitations of passive cleaning efforts have been directed toward other controlling strategies including modification of the membrane surface e g adding cationic polymeric material 6 loading precious metals 7 inoculating quorum quenchers 8 precoating diatomite 9 pre treatment prior to membrane e g pre oxidation 10 adsorption 11 media membrane filtration 12 and coagulation 13 feed spacer innovation 14 introduction of an electromagnetic field 15 optimization of the operation mode e g batch running 16 and vibration of the membrane 17 and integrated use of these methods 18 19 among the aforementioned methods of membrane fouling control coagulation is the most widely used pretreatment method for uf processes in full scale waterworks 20 coagulation has been proven to be an effective and cheap option to control membrane fouling and improve general water quality owing to its ability to remove a wide range of potential foulants in raw water including particles organic colloids microbes and natural organic matter nom 5 however coagulation also has some weaknesses such as the inefficient removal of low molecular weight mw organics particularly the hydrophilic fraction 21 these low mw and hydrophilic organics include biopolymers or their depolymerized products one class of irreversible membrane foulants and assimilable organics nutrients for biofilm 22 in addition the coordination reactions between dissolved organic matter dom and hydrolysis products of metal ion coagulants can also result in the reduction of coagulation efficiency via the occupation of active sites on the flocculation particles therefore it is widely accepted that coagulation alone is ineffective in controlling organic and biological membrane fouling fortunately the successful combination of coagulation with permanganate pre oxidation or magnetic ion exchange in membrane fouling control gives confidence in the development of efficient membrane fouling control methods based on coagulation 23 the secret to the success of these combination methods based on coagulation is utilizing oxidation to mineralize dom or change the physicochemical properties and using adsorption to remove dom especially the low mw and hydrophilic organics which compensates for the drawbacks of coagulation in recent years activated permanganate oxidation technology characterized by the formation of reactive manganese species rmns and radicals has received considerable attention because of its high efficiency in removing trace organic matter 24 potassium permanganate pm can be activated by fe ii s iv sulfite bisulfite uv irradiation ultrasonication electric field peroxide electron rich moiety bearing organics humic acids benzoquinone oxidoreductase and 1 benzotriazolol 25 our previous work verified that bisulfite bs activated pm pm bs oxidation combined with coagulation showed great improvement in the removal of dom total nitrogen heavy metal ions emerging trace organic matter and nano zno particles compared to the combination of coagulation with pm or hypochlorite pre oxidation 26 the enhanced removal of these impurities by pm bs involves oxidation adsorption and assisted coagulation based on successful precedents activated pm oxidation has the potential to make up the short slab for coagulation in membrane fouling control to date there is little information on the efficiency and mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs oxidation combined with coagulation therefore pm bs a typical activated pm process was coupled with coagulation as a pre treatment step in the uf process the capability of membrane fouling control in this combined pretreatment process was first evaluated using typical source water for waterworks then the effects of the operational parameters e g oxidation and coagulation parameters were studied and sorted finally the alleviation of membrane fouling by the combined pre treatment process was clarified from two aspects changing the water quality of the uf feeding water and regulating the physicochemical properties of the membrane surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sodium

water the raw water samples in this study were reservoir type w1 river type w2 and lake type w3 freshwater and seawater w4 in zhejiang province the water quality parameters of the four water samples are listed in table s1 2 3 pm bs oxidation coagulation uf processes pm bs oxidation and coagulation experiments were conducted using a jar tester as shown in fig s1 in the pm bs pre oxidation stage pm and bs were dosed simultaneously at an optimal molar ratio 1 5 27 and reacted for tox min the coagulation process included fast mixing gf and tf and slow mixing gs and ts for flocculation the coagulant dosage followed the suggested value of waterworks 10 25 mg l 1 the coagulant dosage was calculated in terms of the dissolved metal e g 10 mg l 1 pac 10 mg l 1 fecl3 and 10 mg l 1 pafc containing the same mass of al and or fe after flocculation the slurry settled for tset min and the supernatant was transferred to the feeding tank of the uf unit the uf device is shown in fig s2 prior to the filtration test the uf membrane 50 kda 0 008 μm shanghai mosu scientific equipment co ltd was soaked in di water for 48 h to remove residual impurities and then filtered with di water until the total organic carbon toc of the filtrate was invariable a constant transmembrane pressure tmp of 100 kpa was loaded to the uf membrane the weight of the filtrate was automatically recorded by an electronic balance every 20s after treating 300 ml feeding water the uf membrane was reversed and backwashed with 100 ml of di water at a pressure of 150 kpa 28 the membrane was then turned over again and a new filtration cycle was started each filtration experiment was performed in duplicate 2 4 analytical methods the turbidity was measured using a hash 2100p turbidity meter the ph was

determination membrane fouling resistance was adopted to characterize uf membrane fouling and was determined based on the darcy formula 29 31 the total resistance of membrane filtration rt reversible fouling resistance rr and irreversible fouling resistance rir were determined according to a previous study 32 the detailed procedure is described in text s1 of supporting information 2 7 determination of membrane interfacial free energy based on a previously reported method 33 surface tension parameters including lifshitz van der waals γlw electron donor γ and electron acceptor γ components of the membrane surface energy were calculated based on the measurements of contact angles with water ethylene glycol and diiodomethane as solvents table s2 in supporting information the surface tension parameters of the membrane surface were obtained by measuring the contact angles of the three probe liquids and combining them with the extended young equation the detailed calculation procedure is presented in text s2 of the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency of membrane fouling alleviation for pm bs coagulation process to evaluate the efficiency of mitigating uf membrane fouling by pm bs coagulation pre treatment four different raw water samples w1 w2 w3 and w4 were used as test waters and the fouling behavior characterized by changes in membrane flux and fouling resistance of the uf membrane was monitored as shown in fig 1 pm bs coagulation pre treatment generally performed better in alleviating membrane fouling for the four raw waters than coagulation pre treatment alone after four filtration cycles the specific flux j j0 decrease in uf following pm bs coagulation was 4 2 22 less than that of uf following coagulation these results indicate that pm bs coagulation pre treatment indeed possesses a good capability to alleviate membrane fouling and the fouling mitigation performance is related to the raw water quality in addition pm bs coagulation pre treatment decreased rt by 21 7 74 9 compared to coagulation pre treatment regarding the most threatening irreversible fouling resistance rir pm bs coagulation pre treatment also behaved better than coagulation pre treatment alone for all four raw water samples pm bs coagulation pre treatment made subsequent uf obtain a j j0 recovery rate of 17 6 58 5 after backwashing which was higher than the coagulation pre treatment 11 6 50 2 these phenomena can be explained by the smaller rir resulting from pm bs coagulation pretreatment which also yielded a lower proportion of rir rir rt overall pm bs coagulation as an effective step to alleviate uf fouling exhibited good adaptability to different types of raw water 3 2 the influence of operational parameters the above mentioned results confirm that pm bs coagulation pre treatment can mitigate uf membrane fouling from the viewpoint of practical applications it is necessary to further identify the key parameters of pm bs coagulation pretreatment to achieve full utility thus taking raw water w1 as a representative the effects of the operational parameters of pm bs coagulation pretreatment on uf membrane fouling control were evaluated 3 2 1 effect of oxidation parameter the oxidants in the pm bs system include pm ho so 4 and rmnss 34 the oxidation performance was determined by the oxidant concentration cox and oxidation contact time tox as the concentrations of ho so 4 and rmnss are difficult to measure and for ease of presentation and discussion the oxidation ct value coxtox of the pm bs system is roughly represented by the product of pm 0 and tox pm 0 tox table s3 in the supporting information different coxtox resulted in different exposures to oxidants and rmns which corresponded to the different effects of oxidation and adsorption 35 fig 2a shows the behavior of uf fouling upon the effect of pm bs coagulation pre treatment at different coxtox when coxtox was increased from 25 min mg l 1 to 75 min mg l 1 the decay rate of j j0 decreased significantly but a further increase in coxtox from 75 min mg l 1 to 100 min mg l 1 caused subtle improvement moreover with an increase in running time denoted by filtration cycles j j0 became more sensitive to the increase in coxtox a similar phenomenon was also observed in a uf system equipped with uv chlorine oxidation pre treatment where the tmp difference became more sensitive to the chlorine dosage as the filtration cycles increased 36 the effect of coxtox on rt and rir was similar to that on j j0 fig 2b indicating that pm bs coagulation pretreatment simultaneously controlled reversible and irreversible membrane fouling it should be mentioned that there was a revival of rt once coxtox increased to over 75 min mg l 1 it is widely accepted that an increase in coxtox enhances the destruction of organics thus lowering the molecular weight and increasing the hydrophilicity the increased hydrophilic and small molecule organics were believed to be related to enhanced organic accumulation in the membrane pores which is closely related to rir 37 3 2 2 effects of coagulation parameters fig 3a shows the effects of the three different coagulants on the membrane flux the coagulant dosage was set at the suggested value of 20 mg l 1 according to the relevant design standard 38 the results indicated that pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment presented the best performance in preventing membrane flux decline followed by pafc and fecl3 this was consistent with the results reported by yu et al 39 pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment also yielded the best recovery rate of j j0 after backwashing which can be interpreted as the smallest rt and rir fig 3a al based salts are active in the typical ph range between 6 and 8 in terms of the removal of nom and turbidity while iron based salts are active at ph 4 6 40 in addition iron based coagulation has been reported to yield a higher increase rate of uf tmp than al based coagulation because of the more evident residual of smaller particles especially nanoscale particles in treated water 39 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that pac coagulation has the best performance in treating neutral water thus pac was used in the subsequent experiments further studies on the effect of pac dosage on uf fouling are shown in fig 3b when the coagulant dosage increased from 10 to 20 mg l 1 the decline of j j0 received significant mitigation and j j0 was recovered by backwashing however j j0 and its recovery rate did not improve when the pac dosage exceeded 20 mg l 1 with respect of membrane resistance dosing pac over 10 mg l 1 is suggested as a much smaller rt was obtained at this dose notably an increase in pac dosage from 10 to 15 mg l 1 reduced the proportion of rir in rt rir rt however a coagulant dosage over 15 mg l 1 did not result in an additional reduction of rir rt an underdose of coagulant usually has an adverse effect on uf fouling while an overdose is always effective for reducing fouling 41 the coagulant dosage is believed to be related to the properties of the filter cake layer 42 under a low coagulant dosage 10 mg l 1 pac small flocs are formed and they tend to form a dense filter cake layer causing high resistance to membrane fouling with an increase in coagulant dosage 15 25 mg l 1 pac larger flocs are formed and produce a loose filter cake layer which lowers the resistance to membrane fouling coagulant addition of 15 mg l 1 was speculated to preemptively load the cake layer on the membrane surface which prevented direct rir related foulant deposition on the membrane surface this illustrates an almost constant rir rt the coagulation process strongly depends on the hydraulic condition velocity gradient g reaction time t and consists of two stages fast mixing gf tf and flocculation gs ts 41 therefore the effect of the gt value table s3 in supporting information on membrane fouling alleviation by pm bs pac coagulation pretreatment was studied the effect of gt on j j0 is shown in fig 3c when the gt value increased from 0 to 12 48 103 the decline rate of j j0 and its recovery rate after backwashing improved but further gt increase did not provide an additional benefit in decreasing the decay rate of j j0 rir showed a similar evolution to j j0 when the gt value varied from 0 to 18 72 103 whereas rt continuously decreased as the gt value increased the gt value is associated with the floc characteristics such as size 43 when a low gt value was applied the flocs were small leading to unsatisfactory membrane fouling reduction when the flocculation time was sufficient corresponding to a high gt large flocs were formed which reduced membrane fouling choosing an appropriate settling time tset can decrease the remaining particles in the supernatant for flocculation which helps reduce membrane fouling therefore the effects of settling time on coagulation were investigated fig 3d when tset increased from 0 to 15 min the decay rate of j j0 reduced but tset over 15 min resulted in only a minor improvement a tset of 15 min also made the control of rt obtain a good result fig 3d interestingly extending tset to 30 min led to a significant rir reduction but negligible rt reduction considering that rir mainly resulted from hydrophilic and lmw organics the decrease in rir was speculated to be caused by the enhanced irreversible foulant adsorption by flocculant hydrolysate and flocs due to the extended sedimentation time adsorption time 40 3 3 mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs c s pre treatment 3 3 1 effect of pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment on water quality the main foulants of uf membranes can be roughly divided into three categories inorganic or organic particles colloid particulates dissolved components and colloids inorganic dissolved components e g iron manganese and silica and biological organisms such as bacteria interactions among the four often intensify membrane fouling 44 thus the indexes related to the four types of fouling were monitored before and after pretreatment as shown in fig 4a the turbidity of water pretreated by coagulation and pm bs coagulation was 1 82 and 1 13 ntu respectively the uf treatment eliminated the turbidity difference caused by these two pre treatments and produced water with a turbidity of 0 14 ntu that is fewer particles suspended and or colloids were deposited on the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation fig 4b presents the size distribution of particles in the treated water of the two pre treatment processes and in the uf effluent coagulation pre treatment resulted in 84 of the residual particles concentrate at 5 50 μm and 11 at 100 300 μm uf treatment after coagulation further decreased the size of the residual particles to 10 μm accounting for 92 pm bs coagulation pre treatment narrowed the size of the residual particles to 2 30 μm accounting for 92 and subsequent uf decreased the size to 10 μm by incorporating information on turbidity removal it can be concluded that pm bs coagulation pre treatment effectively reduced particles with small and large sizes which is beneficial for controlling irreversible fouling caused by pore blockage for small particles and pore constriction cake formation for large particles zeta potential is an important indicator of colloidal particle 10 6 10 4 mm stability and it can also characterize the deposition tendency adhesion efficiency of colloidal particles on the membrane surface as shown in fig 4c coagulation pre treatment reduced the zeta potential of raw water from 11 57 to 8 54 mv and pm bs coagulation pre treatment reduced the zeta potential to 2 35 mv at the initial stage of membrane fouling the interaction of the membrane with foulants determines the development of the subsequent fouling behavior the competitive adhesion of colloidal particles with dissolved organics such as biopolymers influences the dominant fouling type 23 the lower zeta potential of the feeding water produced by pm bs coagulation pre treatment facilitates inorganic colloidal particles such as silicate colloidal particles which compete with dissolved organic foulants to blind the membrane surface inorganic cations such as ca mg and si are usually involved in the formation of organic and inorganic fouling through bridging as shown in fig 4d there was a small concentration difference for ca mg si in the treated water after coagulation pre treatment and pm bs coagulation pre treatment illustrating that pm bs coagulation resulted in a slight improvement in ca mg si removal compared to coagulation alone furthermore the rejection of ca mg si by uf after coagulation was more evident than that by uf after pm bs coagulation this means that more ca mg si participated in the uf membrane fouling process following coagulation pre treatment pm bs oxidation can destroy the complex of ca mg si cations with organics and the oxidation products of organics become low mw organics with coordination functional groups such as carboxyl legends of ca mg si cations were believed to shift from high mw organics to low mw organics fig 4e which more easily penetrated through the uf membrane this may explain the low rejection of ca mg si by uf following pm bs coagulation dom is considered one of the main membrane foulants in the uf process 45 among dom biopolymers such as proteins are important irreversible membrane foulants therefore dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved organic nitrogen don and their fine components were tested to evaluate the removal performance of the total organic foulants and typical irreversible organic foulants as shown in fig 4f g pm bs coagulation pre treatment showed better removal of doc don and tryptophan protein like and humic acid like organics region iv v of eem spectra 46 than coagulation pre treatment uf treatment following the two pre treatment steps produced water with similar concentrations of doc and don this means that less doc and don were rejected by the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation pre treatment corresponding to a light total membrane fouling and irreversible fouling 47 48 in addition to the blocking of microorganisms in the uf membrane membrane fouling is caused by its growth decomposition metabolism and aggregation activities on the surface of the uf membrane 24 as shown in fig 5 the pm bs coagulation pre treatment left fewer microorganisms in the feeding water of the uf leading to fewer microorganisms being captured on the membrane surface this can be directly verified by clsm orthogonal images of the biofilm collected from the uf membrane inserts in fig 5 in terms of biofilm thickness and distribution sparsity fewer microorganisms were found on the surface of the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation in addition pm bs coagulation pre treatment eliminated the microorganisms owing to the oxidation of pm bs resulting in fewer living attached microorganisms 44 7 on the membrane surface than that in coagulation pre treatment 89 3 3 3 2 effect of pm bs coagulation pre treatment on characteristics of membrane surface the surface micromorphology of the uf membranes was observed using sem and afm as shown in fig 6a the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation had a loose cake layer than that after coagulation moreover the roughness of the membrane used was higher than that of the clean membrane fig 6b notably the roughness of the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation was much lower than that of the uf membrane following coagulation as surface roughness is strongly positively related to membrane fouling pm bs coagulation pre treatment outperformed coagulation pretreatment in terms of roughness control the surface zeta potential of the uf membrane was also observed fig 6c the clean uf membrane showed a higher surface charge than that of the uf membrane and the surface charge of the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation was the lowest this phenomenon can be explained by the electrical neutralization of mno2 particles and mn ii in the pm bs coagulation effluent 26 as poor surface charge facilitates the attachment of organic and biological foulants with negative charges 49 pm bs coagulation pre treatment seems to have a negative effect on membrane fouling control from the surface charge point of view nevertheless the weakened repulse effect can cause negatively charged foulant to compete with neutral polysaccharides and may reduce irreversible membrane fouling such as transparent extracellular polymer tep associated membrane fouling which is considered one of the most troublesome characteristics of membrane fouling 3 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior of uf membrane after pm bs coagulation pre treatment based on xdlvo theory the synthetic effect induced by the change in all physicochemical properties of the uf membrane finally changes the interfacial free energy δgtot which determines the interaction between the membrane and foulants therefore δgtot can be used to measure the antifouling ability of the membrane table 1 presents the δgtot values of the uf membranes in different systems the clean uf membrane exhibited a lower δgtot than the used membranes and the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation exhibited the highest δgtot the negative value of δgtot indicates mutual attraction between the membrane and the foulant attaching lmw organics with high hydrophilicity causes a decrease in the lifshitz van der waals δglw and lewis acid base γab components corresponding to a decreased δgtot 50 as the organic foulants in the treated water of pm bs coagulation had the lowest average molecular weight fig 4e the uf membrane showed the lowest value of δgtot after pm bs coagulation and thus the least membrane fouling 3 3 4 proposed mechanism based on the above mentioned findings and discussion the mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs coagulation pre treatment can be summarized as follows 1 change the feeding water quality e g composition and properties of organic matter molecular size and hydrophobicity amount and properties of particulate matter particle size and zeta potential and quantity and metabolic activity of microorganisms of the uf influent and then affect the development of membrane fouling 2 adjust the physical and chemical properties of the uf membrane surface e g zeta potential roughness and hydrophobicity and then affect the membrane fouling behavior the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 7 4 conclusion the present study found that pm bs pre oxidation combined with coagulation can efficiently mitigate uf membrane fouling there was an optimal oxidation ct value of the pm bs stage which corresponded to proper exposure to oxidants and active manganese species and thus appropriate transformation of foulants pac was found to perform the best among the investigated coagulants and optimal values for coagulant dosage gt value and sedimentation time could be obtained to achieve satisfactory membrane fouling alleviation performance this suggests that it is necessary to choose a proper set of process parameters to pre treat a specific type of water with pm bs coagulation pm bs coagulation pre treatment changed the uf feed water quality related to organic matter particulate matter and microorganisms and affected the development of membrane fouling the alteration of the uf feed water quality unavoidably adjusted the physicochemical properties of the uf membrane surface and affected

12524,coagulation is an effective pre treatment step for ultrafiltration uf drinking water treatment but is limited by the inability to regulate membrane fouling particularly organic and biological fouling herein we propose a permanganate bisulfite pm bs pre oxidation enhanced coagulation process pm bs coagulation as uf pre treatment and apply it to treat samples of natural surface waters the results indicate that pm bs coagulation demonstrated superior performance in mitigating membrane fouling for the four different types of real water the specific membrane flux decline of uf following

while preserving a low membrane fouling propensity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration pre treatment membrane fouling control bisulfite activated permanganate enhanced coagulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there has been a substantial growth in ultrafiltration uf applications in drinking water treatment in recent decades 1 3 compared to conventional treatments uf shows great advantages in the removal of pathogens and particulate impurities which significantly improves the quality of treated water particularly with respect to its biological security furthermore uf has a lower environmental footprint despite these advantages the extended application of the uf process in full scale waterworks needs to overcome several bottlenecks such as membrane fouling high energy cost and low rejection of low molecular weight organics of these membrane fouling after long term operation which results in decreased membrane productivity and increased energy consumption is the main obstacle 4 although physical washing e g air scouring crossflow circulation and chemical cleaning can mitigate fouling these steps not only consume extensive energy and cleaning chemicals but also compromise membrane health and limit its lifespan 5 such a fouling control strategy is intrinsically a passive coping strategy i e remediation after pollution to overcome the limitations of passive cleaning efforts have been directed toward other controlling strategies including modification of the membrane surface e g adding cationic polymeric material 6 loading precious metals 7 inoculating quorum quenchers 8 precoating diatomite 9 pre treatment prior to membrane e g pre oxidation 10 adsorption 11 media membrane filtration 12 and coagulation 13 feed spacer innovation 14 introduction of an electromagnetic field 15 optimization of the operation mode e g batch running 16 and vibration of the membrane 17 and integrated use of these methods 18 19 among the aforementioned methods of membrane fouling control coagulation is the most widely used pretreatment method for uf processes in full scale waterworks 20 coagulation has been proven to be an effective and cheap option to control membrane fouling and improve general water quality owing to its ability to remove a wide range of potential foulants in raw water including particles organic colloids microbes and natural organic matter nom 5 however coagulation also has some weaknesses such as the inefficient removal of low molecular weight mw organics particularly the hydrophilic fraction 21 these low mw and hydrophilic organics include biopolymers or their depolymerized products one class of irreversible membrane foulants and assimilable organics nutrients for biofilm 22 in addition the coordination reactions between dissolved organic matter dom and hydrolysis products of metal ion coagulants can also result in the reduction of coagulation efficiency via the occupation of active sites on the flocculation particles therefore it is widely accepted that coagulation alone is ineffective in controlling organic and biological membrane fouling fortunately the successful combination of coagulation with permanganate pre oxidation or magnetic ion exchange in membrane fouling control gives confidence in the development of efficient membrane fouling control methods based on coagulation 23 the secret to the success of these combination methods based on coagulation is utilizing oxidation to mineralize dom or change the physicochemical properties and using adsorption to remove dom especially the low mw and hydrophilic organics which compensates for the drawbacks of coagulation in recent years activated permanganate oxidation technology characterized by the formation of reactive manganese species rmns and radicals has received considerable attention because of its high efficiency in removing trace organic matter 24 potassium permanganate pm can be activated by fe ii s iv sulfite bisulfite uv irradiation ultrasonication electric field peroxide electron rich moiety bearing organics humic acids benzoquinone oxidoreductase and 1 benzotriazolol 25 our previous work verified that bisulfite bs activated pm pm bs oxidation combined with coagulation showed great improvement in the removal of dom total nitrogen heavy metal ions emerging trace organic matter and nano zno particles compared to the combination of coagulation with pm or hypochlorite pre oxidation 26 the enhanced removal of these impurities by pm bs involves oxidation adsorption and assisted coagulation based on successful precedents activated pm oxidation has the potential to make up the short slab for coagulation in membrane fouling control to date there is little information on the efficiency and mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs oxidation combined with coagulation therefore pm bs a typical activated pm process was coupled with coagulation as a pre treatment step in the uf process the capability of membrane fouling control in this combined pretreatment process was first evaluated using typical source water for waterworks then the effects of the operational parameters e g oxidation and coagulation parameters were studied and sorted finally the alleviation of membrane fouling by the combined pre treatment process was clarified

determination membrane fouling resistance was adopted to characterize uf membrane fouling and was determined based on the darcy formula 29 31 the total resistance of membrane filtration rt reversible fouling resistance rr and irreversible fouling resistance rir were determined according to a previous study 32 the detailed procedure is described in text s1 of supporting information 2 7 determination of membrane interfacial free energy based on a previously reported method 33 surface tension parameters including lifshitz van der waals γlw electron donor γ and electron acceptor γ components of the membrane surface energy were calculated based on the measurements of contact angles with water ethylene glycol and diiodomethane as solvents table s2 in supporting information the surface tension parameters of the membrane surface were obtained by measuring the contact angles of the three probe liquids and combining them with the extended young equation the detailed calculation procedure is presented in text s2 of the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency of membrane fouling alleviation for pm bs coagulation process to evaluate the efficiency of mitigating uf membrane fouling by pm bs coagulation pre treatment four different raw water samples w1 w2 w3 and w4 were used as test waters and the fouling behavior characterized by changes in membrane flux and fouling resistance of the uf membrane was monitored as shown in fig 1 pm bs coagulation pre treatment generally performed better in alleviating membrane fouling for the four raw waters than coagulation pre treatment alone after four filtration cycles the specific flux j j0 decrease in uf following pm bs coagulation was 4 2 22 less than that of uf following coagulation these results indicate that pm bs coagulation pre treatment indeed possesses a good capability to alleviate membrane fouling and the fouling mitigation performance is related to the raw water quality in addition pm bs coagulation pre treatment decreased rt by 21 7 74 9 compared to coagulation pre treatment regarding the most threatening irreversible fouling resistance rir pm bs coagulation pre treatment also behaved better than coagulation pre treatment alone for all four raw water samples pm bs coagulation pre treatment made subsequent uf obtain a j j0 recovery rate of 17 6 58 5 after backwashing which was higher than the coagulation pre treatment 11 6 50 2 these phenomena can be explained by the smaller rir resulting from pm bs coagulation pretreatment which also yielded a lower proportion of rir rir rt overall pm bs coagulation as an effective step to alleviate uf fouling exhibited good adaptability to different types of raw water 3 2 the influence of operational parameters the above mentioned results confirm that pm bs coagulation pre treatment can mitigate uf membrane fouling from the viewpoint of practical applications it is necessary to further identify the key parameters of pm bs coagulation pretreatment to achieve full utility thus taking raw water w1 as a representative the effects of the operational parameters of pm bs coagulation pretreatment on uf membrane fouling control were evaluated 3 2 1 effect of oxidation parameter the oxidants in the pm bs system include pm ho so 4 and rmnss 34 the oxidation performance was determined by the oxidant concentration cox and oxidation contact time tox as the concentrations of ho so 4 and rmnss are difficult to measure and for ease of presentation and discussion the oxidation ct value coxtox of the pm bs system is roughly represented by the product of pm 0 and tox pm 0 tox table s3 in the supporting information different coxtox resulted in different exposures to oxidants and rmns which corresponded to the different effects of oxidation and adsorption 35 fig 2a shows the behavior of uf fouling upon the effect of pm bs coagulation pre treatment at different coxtox when coxtox was increased from 25 min mg l 1 to 75 min mg l 1 the decay rate of j j0 decreased significantly but a further increase in coxtox from 75 min mg l 1 to 100 min mg l 1 caused subtle improvement moreover with an increase in running time denoted by filtration cycles j j0 became more sensitive to the increase in coxtox a similar phenomenon was also observed in a uf system equipped with uv chlorine oxidation pre treatment where the tmp difference became more sensitive to the chlorine dosage as the filtration cycles increased 36 the effect of coxtox on rt and rir was similar to that on j j0 fig 2b indicating that pm bs coagulation pretreatment simultaneously controlled reversible and irreversible membrane fouling it should be mentioned that there was a revival of rt once coxtox increased to over 75 min mg l 1 it is widely accepted that an increase in coxtox enhances the destruction of organics thus lowering the molecular weight and increasing the hydrophilicity the increased hydrophilic and small molecule organics were believed to be related to enhanced organic accumulation in the membrane pores which is closely related to rir 37 3 2 2 effects of coagulation parameters fig 3a shows the effects of the three different coagulants on the membrane flux the coagulant dosage was set at the suggested value of 20 mg l 1 according to the relevant design standard 38 the results indicated that pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment presented the best performance in preventing membrane flux decline followed by pafc and fecl3 this was consistent with the results reported by yu et al 39 pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment also yielded the best recovery rate of j j0 after backwashing which can be interpreted as the smallest rt and rir fig 3a al based salts are active in the typical ph range between 6 and 8 in terms of the removal of nom and turbidity while iron based salts are active at ph 4 6 40 in addition iron based coagulation has been reported to yield a higher increase rate of uf tmp than al based coagulation because of the more evident residual of smaller particles especially nanoscale particles in treated water 39 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that pac coagulation has the best performance in treating neutral water thus pac was used in the subsequent experiments further studies on the effect of pac dosage on uf fouling are shown in fig 3b when the coagulant dosage increased from 10 to 20 mg l 1 the decline of j j0 received significant mitigation and j j0 was recovered by backwashing however j j0 and its recovery rate did not improve when the pac dosage exceeded 20 mg l 1 with respect of membrane resistance dosing pac over 10 mg l 1 is suggested as a much smaller rt was obtained at this dose notably an increase in pac dosage from 10 to 15 mg l 1 reduced the proportion of rir in rt rir rt however a coagulant dosage over 15 mg l 1 did not result in an additional reduction of rir rt an underdose of coagulant usually has an adverse effect on uf fouling while an overdose is always effective for reducing fouling 41 the coagulant dosage is believed to be related to the properties of the filter cake layer 42 under a low coagulant dosage 10 mg l 1 pac small flocs are formed and they tend to form a dense filter cake layer causing high resistance to membrane fouling with an increase in coagulant dosage 15 25 mg l 1 pac larger flocs are formed and produce a loose filter cake layer which lowers the resistance to membrane fouling coagulant addition of 15 mg l 1 was speculated to preemptively load the cake layer on the membrane surface which prevented direct rir related foulant deposition on the membrane surface this illustrates an almost constant rir rt the coagulation process strongly depends on the hydraulic condition velocity gradient g reaction time t and consists of two stages fast mixing gf tf and flocculation gs ts 41 therefore the effect of the gt value table s3 in supporting information on membrane fouling alleviation by pm bs pac coagulation pretreatment was studied the effect of gt on j j0 is shown in fig 3c when the gt value increased from 0 to 12 48 103 the decline rate of j j0 and its recovery rate after backwashing improved but further gt increase did not provide an additional benefit in decreasing the decay rate of j j0 rir showed a similar evolution to j j0 when the gt value varied from 0 to 18 72 103 whereas rt continuously decreased as the gt value increased the gt value is associated with the floc characteristics such as size 43 when a low gt value was applied the flocs were small leading to unsatisfactory membrane fouling reduction when the flocculation time was sufficient corresponding to a high gt large flocs were formed which reduced membrane fouling choosing an appropriate settling time tset can decrease the remaining particles in the supernatant for flocculation which helps reduce membrane fouling therefore the effects of settling time on coagulation were investigated fig 3d when tset increased from 0 to 15 min the decay rate of j j0 reduced but tset over 15 min resulted in only a minor improvement a tset of 15 min also made the control of rt obtain a good result fig 3d interestingly extending tset to 30 min led to a significant rir reduction but negligible rt reduction considering that rir mainly resulted from hydrophilic and lmw organics the decrease in rir was speculated to be caused by the enhanced irreversible foulant adsorption by flocculant hydrolysate and flocs due to the extended sedimentation time adsorption time 40 3 3 mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs c s pre treatment 3 3 1 effect of pm bs pac coagulation pre treatment on water quality the main foulants of uf membranes can be roughly divided into three categories inorganic or organic particles colloid particulates dissolved components and colloids inorganic dissolved components e g iron manganese and silica and biological organisms such as bacteria interactions among the four often intensify membrane fouling 44 thus the indexes related to the four types of fouling were monitored before and after pretreatment as shown in fig 4a the turbidity of water pretreated by coagulation and pm bs coagulation was 1 82 and 1 13 ntu respectively the uf treatment eliminated the turbidity difference caused by these two pre treatments and produced water with a turbidity of 0 14 ntu that is fewer particles suspended and or colloids were deposited on the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation fig 4b presents the size distribution of particles in the treated water of the two pre treatment processes and in the uf effluent coagulation pre treatment resulted in 84 of the residual particles concentrate at 5 50 μm and 11 at 100 300 μm uf treatment after coagulation further decreased the size of the residual particles to 10 μm accounting for 92 pm bs coagulation pre treatment narrowed the size of the residual particles to 2 30 μm accounting for 92 and subsequent uf decreased the size to 10 μm by incorporating information on turbidity removal it can be concluded that pm bs coagulation pre treatment effectively reduced particles with small and large sizes which is beneficial for controlling irreversible fouling caused by pore blockage for small particles and pore constriction cake formation for large particles zeta potential is an important indicator of colloidal particle 10 6 10 4 mm stability and it can also characterize the deposition tendency adhesion efficiency of colloidal particles on the membrane surface as shown in fig 4c coagulation pre treatment reduced the zeta potential of raw water from 11 57 to 8 54 mv and pm bs coagulation pre treatment reduced the zeta potential to 2 35 mv at the initial stage of membrane fouling the interaction of the membrane with foulants determines the development of the subsequent fouling behavior the competitive adhesion of colloidal particles with dissolved organics such as biopolymers influences the dominant fouling type 23 the lower zeta potential of the feeding water produced by pm bs coagulation pre treatment facilitates inorganic colloidal particles such as silicate colloidal particles which compete with dissolved organic foulants to blind the membrane surface inorganic cations such as ca mg and si are usually involved in the formation of organic and inorganic fouling through bridging as shown in fig 4d there was a small concentration difference for ca mg si in the treated water after coagulation pre treatment and pm bs coagulation pre treatment illustrating that pm bs coagulation resulted in a slight improvement in ca mg si removal compared to coagulation alone furthermore the rejection of ca mg si by uf after coagulation was more evident than that by uf after pm bs coagulation this means that more ca mg si participated in the uf membrane fouling process following coagulation pre treatment pm bs oxidation can destroy the complex of ca mg si cations with organics and the oxidation products of organics become low mw organics with coordination functional groups such as carboxyl legends of ca mg si cations were believed to shift from high mw organics to low mw organics fig 4e which more easily penetrated through the uf membrane this may explain the low rejection of ca mg si by uf following pm bs coagulation dom is considered one of the main membrane foulants in the uf process 45 among dom biopolymers such as proteins are important irreversible membrane foulants therefore dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved organic nitrogen don and their fine components were tested to evaluate the removal performance of the total organic foulants and typical irreversible organic foulants as shown in fig 4f g pm bs coagulation pre treatment showed better removal of doc don and tryptophan protein like and humic acid like organics region iv v of eem spectra 46 than coagulation pre treatment uf treatment following the two pre treatment steps produced water with similar concentrations of doc and don this means that less doc and don were rejected by the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation pre treatment corresponding to a light total membrane fouling and irreversible fouling 47 48 in addition to the blocking of microorganisms in the uf membrane membrane fouling is caused by its growth decomposition metabolism and aggregation activities on the surface of the uf membrane 24 as shown in fig 5 the pm bs coagulation pre treatment left fewer microorganisms in the feeding water of the uf leading to fewer microorganisms being captured on the membrane surface this can be directly verified by clsm orthogonal images of the biofilm collected from the uf membrane inserts in fig 5 in terms of biofilm thickness and distribution sparsity fewer microorganisms were found on the surface of the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation in addition pm bs coagulation pre treatment eliminated the microorganisms owing to the oxidation of pm bs resulting in fewer living attached microorganisms 44 7 on the membrane surface than that in coagulation pre treatment 89 3 3 3 2 effect of pm bs coagulation pre treatment on characteristics of membrane surface the surface micromorphology of the uf membranes was observed using sem and afm as shown in fig 6a the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation had a loose cake layer than that after coagulation moreover the roughness of the membrane used was higher than that of the clean membrane fig 6b notably the roughness of the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation was much lower than that of the uf membrane following coagulation as surface roughness is strongly positively related to membrane fouling pm bs coagulation pre treatment outperformed coagulation pretreatment in terms of roughness control the surface zeta potential of the uf membrane was also observed fig 6c the clean uf membrane showed a higher surface charge than that of the uf membrane and the surface charge of the uf membrane following pm bs coagulation was the lowest this phenomenon can be explained by the electrical neutralization of mno2 particles and mn ii in the pm bs coagulation effluent 26 as poor surface charge facilitates the attachment of organic and biological foulants with negative charges 49 pm bs coagulation pre treatment seems to have a negative effect on membrane fouling control from the surface charge point of view nevertheless the weakened repulse effect can cause negatively charged foulant to compete with neutral polysaccharides and may reduce irreversible membrane fouling such as transparent extracellular polymer tep associated membrane fouling which is considered one of the most troublesome characteristics of membrane fouling 3 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior of uf membrane after pm bs coagulation pre treatment based on xdlvo theory the synthetic effect induced by the change in all physicochemical properties of the uf membrane finally changes the interfacial free energy δgtot which determines the interaction between the membrane and foulants therefore δgtot can be used to measure the antifouling ability of the membrane table 1 presents the δgtot values of the uf membranes in different systems the clean uf membrane exhibited a lower δgtot than the used membranes and the uf membrane after pm bs coagulation exhibited the highest δgtot the negative value of δgtot indicates mutual attraction between the membrane and the foulant attaching lmw organics with high hydrophilicity causes a decrease in the lifshitz van der waals δglw and lewis acid base γab components corresponding to a decreased δgtot 50 as the organic foulants in the treated water of pm bs coagulation had the lowest average molecular weight fig 4e the uf membrane showed the lowest value of δgtot after pm bs coagulation and thus the least membrane fouling 3 3 4 proposed mechanism based on the above mentioned findings and discussion the mechanism of membrane fouling control by pm bs coagulation pre treatment can be summarized as follows 1 change the feeding water quality e g composition and properties of organic matter molecular size and hydrophobicity amount and properties of particulate matter particle size and zeta potential and quantity and metabolic activity of microorganisms of the uf influent and then affect the development of membrane fouling 2 adjust the physical and chemical properties of the uf membrane surface e g zeta potential roughness and hydrophobicity and then affect the membrane fouling behavior the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 7 4 conclusion the present study found that pm bs pre oxidation combined with coagulation can efficiently mitigate uf membrane fouling there was an optimal oxidation ct value of the pm bs stage which corresponded to proper exposure to oxidants and active manganese species and thus appropriate transformation of foulants pac was found to perform the best among the investigated coagulants and optimal values for coagulant dosage gt value and sedimentation time could be obtained to achieve satisfactory membrane fouling alleviation performance this suggests that it is necessary to choose a proper set of process parameters to pre treat a specific type of water with pm bs coagulation pm bs coagulation pre treatment changed the uf feed water quality related to organic matter particulate matter and microorganisms and affected the development of membrane fouling the alteration of the uf feed water quality unavoidably adjusted the physicochemical properties of the uf membrane surface and affected
