16205,combined pollution consisted of various types of microplastics mps was extensively detected in the environment however little is known about their interaction on degradation behavior during exposure in sunlight this study investigated the effects of polystyrene ps mps and mechanisms on photodegradation of pure and commercial polypropylene pp mps co existed in aquatic environment results showed that ps mps significantly accelerated photodegradation of co existed pp including faster oxidation and fragmentation photodegradation route of pp mps such as the reaction priority of partial chemical bindings was even altered with the presence of ps mps highlighting the important role of ps in photodegradation process of pp analysis of leachate and free radical indicated that the critical effects were derived from photosensitization of ps polymer itself and its released dissolved organic matter ps dom here more important role of ps itself in initial period and that of ps dom in later period among generated ros oh was the key species for accelerating photodegradation of pp by ps itself and its released dom which were generated from the reaction of polymer radical with dissolved oxygen the findings firstly reveal the important role of ps in photodegradation of co existed mps and suggested the shorter duration of micro plastics in combined system than that in the single which provide useful information to assess environmental behavior and fate of mps more holistically graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photodegradation combined pollution organic compounds free radicals 1 introduction in the past decades huge consumption of plastics result in the large amounts of plastic wastes in the environment geyer et al 2017 reina et al 2018 geyer et al 2017 estimated that 4900 million tons of plastic wastes were accumulated in the environment during 1950 2015 and 12 000 million tons would be generated by the end of 2050 bulk plastics are fragile to be broken down into smaller particles during outdoor exposure jahnke et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 microplastics mps defined as particles smaller than 5 mm arthur et al 2009 are the most abundant particles to receive wide attentions due to their direct and indirect threats to organisms galloway and lewis 2016 he et al 2018 mps are not only extensively detected in aquatic terrestrial and atmospheric environments wong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020c but also in drinking water and table salt koelmans et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b and even in human being amato lourenço et al 2021 it should be noted that the types of mp pollution in the environment are not singular but are complex numerous studies have detected the combined pollution of mps in surface water frequently consisted of polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc etc sighicelli et al 2018 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the combined pollution of various mps will result in their complicated interaction in view of their different properties which may further affect their migration transformation and risk battulga et al 2020 observed that ps foam collected from tuul river in mongolia adsorbed various types of small mp particles including pp pe and polyaminde in addition mps in the environment inevitably unerdgo photodegradation during solar irradiation and the photodegradation potentials are different among various types of mps due to their different ability to absorb ultraviolet uv and produce free radicals duan et al 2021 gewert et al 2015 song et al 2017 according to the maximum sensitivity for uv energy the order in bond dissociation energy of polymers is pe 402 kj mol ps 377 kj mol pp 322 kj mol duan et al 2021 song et al 2017 the phenyl ring in ps backbone is more easily excited by uv to be photodegraded than the hydrogen in pe and methyl in pp gewert et al 2015 a recent study indicated that ps and phenolformaldehyde resin pf exhibited a strong ability for producing free radicals under simulated sunlight while low ability occurred on pe and pvc zhu et al 2019 based on these information it is highly possible that the photodegradation of certain mps e g pp will be affected by the other type of mps e g ps once being co existed in the same environment owing to their different photochemical properties it has been reported that reactive oxygen species ros generated from irradiated ps mps could in turn attack polymer itself or surrounding pollutants to enhance their photodegradation lin et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020a compared to virgin mps aged ones are more photoreactive to generate ros because the carbonyl in aged mps increases the absorption of uv energy singh and sharma 2008 which is hence likely to affect photodegradation of co existed matters more significantly in addition to mp itself uv irradiation results in the release of volatile and dissolved organic matters dom from mps which composed of additives oligomers or monomers and oxygenated products lee et al 2020 lomonaco et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 zhu et al 2020b some mp derived dom might affect photodegradation of co existed mps by altering the absorption of uv energy and formation of free radicals khaled et al 2018 wang et al 2020 khaled et al 2018 observed that the decabromodiphenylether in ps enhanced 10 times increases in photodegradation rate of ps polymer because the formed br enhanced hydrogen abstraction and chain oxidation of ps however little is known regarding the effects of mps on photoaging degradation of other co existed mps in view of the complex pollution in real aquatic environment exploring photodegradation behavior of mps in combined system is important for predicting their duration periods of mps and assessing their environmental fate in this study four forms of mps including pure and commercial pp disposable box and virgin and aged ps and two types of dom released from aged ps ps dom and natural environment n dom were selected to investigate the role and mechanism of ps mps in photodegradation of pp in water pp and ps were selected since both mps were frequently detected in the same environment sighicelli et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 dynamic evolutions in photooxidation fragmentation and morphology variation of pp mediated by virgin and aged ps mps were investgated the specific role of ps itself and released dom in photodegradation of pp mps were firstly clarified via analysis of leachates by total organic carbon toc excitation emission matrice eem and high performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer tof lc ms the mechanisms of ps mps to affect photodegradation of pp were unraveled via electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement the obtained results would provide insight into environmental behavior of mps and contribute to our understanding of combined mp pollution in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of mps and leachates pure and commercial pp mps with 194 36 3 and 176 21 9 μm were purchased from china petrochemical corporation beijing china and yinlong co ltd chengdu china respectively virgin ps with 58 7 17 1 μm was manufactured by zhongcheng plastic factory guangzhou china aged ps 20 1 5 68 μm and released dom ps dom were prepared from uv irradiation of virgin ps mps in ultrapure water details in text s1 of supplementary material the properties of pure and commercial pp mps and virgin and aged ps mps were shown as fig s1 details on these mps and other reagents were described in text s2 of supplementary material 2 2 co exposure irradiation setup the co exposed experiments were designed to simulate the co occurrence of pp and ps mps in aquatic environments irradiation tests were carried out in a uv chamber equipped with three uv lamps 150 w which were frequently used for laboratory simulated photoaging photodegradation of mps due to the high sensitivity to uv energy e g 318 and 370 nm for ps and pp respectively chen et al 2019 song et al 2017 specifically 0 25 g of pp mps was added in 150 ml quartz conical flask containing 125 ml of ultrapure water then virgin or aged ps mps were spiked into each pp suspension respectively to reach the final concentrations of ps at 0 4 and 1 0 g l the pp ps ratios were selected mainly based on their annual productions in recent decades andrady 2011 plastics europe 2020 geyer et al 2017 after being pre sonicated for 30 min the flasks were immediately exposed to uv irradiation in chamber with agitation speed of 200 rpm and temperature at 25 c control samples including combined groups in dark condition and sole pp or ps mps in dark and uv conditions were conducted according to similar operation as above at each treatment time point 0 3 6 9 13 17 21 and 25 d 10 ml of suspensions were collected according to the crossed sampling methods the separation between pp and ps mps was operated based on density difference 0 91 g cm3 of pp and 1 04 g cm3 of ps curbell plastics 2021 fig s2 details on these operations were described in text s3 of supplementary material co exposure irradiation and dark tests of pp mps with ps dom or n dom 50 mgc l were operated as similar procedures above the collection of treated pp was operated by funnel filtration method 50 mgc l of ps dom n dom was selected due to similar concentration level 23 mgc l of n dom in the environment zuo and jones 1997 the natural photodegradation tests of commercial pp with and without ps mps were conducted in real surface water under simulated sunlight here the surface water was collected from weihe river in june 2021 108 6 e 34 14 n and the simulated sunlight was provided by a 500 w xenon lamp in photochemical reactor ceaulight china the detailed experimental setup was described in text s4 of supplementary material 2 3 characterization of mps and analysis of filtrates surface morphology of mps was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem nanosem 450 fei size distribution and average size were analyzed by measuring particles in sem images using nano measurer software version 1 2 5 fudan university chemical composition was examined by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy vetex70 bruker total organic carbon of leachate was determined by toc analyzer toc l shimadzu excitation emission matrices were obtained on a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu to analysis photoluminescence pl property of organic chemicals in leachate the structures of ps dom were identified by tof lc ms agilent 1200 series for hplc system ab sciex triple tof 5600 for ms system and cnw poly sery hlb cartidge by shanghai anpel laboratory technologies for solid phase extraction more details in text s5 of supplementary material 2 4 ros identification as reported the photoaging of polymer was controlled by radical involved reactions singh and sharma 2008 zhu et al 2020a to investigate photodegradation mechanisms of pp mediated by ps mps the environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs and ros oh o 2 and 1o2 were identified by epr spectrometer emxmicro 6 1 p l bruker the quenching tests were conducted to determine the contributions of various ros in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps by adding ros scavengers including 10 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa for oh 2 mg l superoxide dismutase sod for o 2 and 10 mm l histidine for 1o2 details on epr measurement and ros quenching were described in text s6 of supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated photooxidation of pp by ps mps ftir was adopted to examine the effects of virgin and aged ps mps on the photooxidation of pp mps several characteristic peaks were detected at 1160 1377 and 1460 cm 1 on virgin pp assigned to ch2 and ch3 bending and stretching vibrations fig s1b rajakumar et al 2009 however new peaks at 1242 and 1731 cm 1 were gradually raised on photodegraded pp mps as irradiation time prolonged from 0 d to 25 d fig 1 a which corresponded to c o and c o stretching vibrations hayes et al 2017 klapiszewski et al 2019 moreover various changes occurred on the native peaks of photodegraded pp such as a trend of initial decrease and then increase at 1160 cm 1 and minor change at 1377 1460 cm 1 this indicated the damage in crystalline region of pp possibly ascribed to the oxidation in chemical bindings brandon et al 2016 lv et al 2017 compared to sole pp the presence of ps mps did not significantly affect the types of absorption peaks of pp in combined systems other than higher increase in intensity of c o and c o fig 1a two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos were obtained by analyzing ftir spectra using 2d shige software version 1 3 to probe dynamic evolution of chemical bindings from initial to final term reaction of pp with the presence of ps mps here the data was presented as the red dot in the diagonal line of synchronous maps and the darker red represented the higher content of group in pp as shown in fig 1c we could clearly observe that the color of red points at 1160 1242 and 1731 cm 1 of pp mps become darker with the co existed of ps mps and more intense in the presence of aged ps mps while few change was observed at 1377 and 1460 cm 1 of pp with and without ps mps fig s3a this indicated that ps mps enhanced the photooxidation in pp mps but showed low effect on ch3 and ch2 in pp based on these results the asynchronous correlation spectra of typical peaks at 1160 1242 1377 1460 and 1731 cm 1 were analyzed shown in fig s3b and table 1 where the positive sign denoted that the time order of peak in row participating in the reaction were later than that in the column and the opposite case for the negative sign ding et al 2020 for example the positive cross peaks in ψ 1160 1243 1731 illustrated that the binding at 1731 cm 1 involved in photoreaction were later than those at 1160 and 1243 cm 1 while the negative ψ 1377 1460 1731 indicated the priority of 1731 cm 1 to 1377 and 1460 cm 1 in photoreaction process from asynchronous data in table 1 a critical phenomenon could be observed for the irradiation system of sole pp the chemical bindings in reaction followed the order as 1243 c o 1160 amorphous c h 1731 c o 1377 ch3 1460 ch2 however the opposite trend with 1460 1377 occurred in combined systems of pp with both virgin and aged ps mps concurrently the earlier reaction of 1160 cm 1 than 1243 cm 1 in combined system of pp and high concentration virgin ps mps was different from that in single pp system table 1 therefore the results indicated that the photodegradation routes of pp at least the reaction priority of partial chemical bindings could be altered by co existed ps mps in aquatic system carbonyl index ci calculated by the ratio of peak intensity at carbonyl to methyl a1715 a1377 was used to characterize photooxidation degree of pp in single and combined systems song et al 2017 in the dark the ci remained almost no change in the whole period regardless of single or combined groups the black square in fig 1b however for uv exposure the ci values showed a positively linear correlation versus irradiation time r 2 0 854 for single system and 0 915 0 925 and 0 933 0 933 for combined systems with virgin and aged ps respectively suggesting that uv was a necessity for photooxidation of pp mps moreover the oxidation degrees according to exposure duration were different with and without ps mps and also varied among virgin and aged ps fig 1b in single system the slope k value fitted from linear correlation of ci versus irradiation time was 0 009 smaller than 0 011 and 0 014 in combined systems with 0 4 and 1 0 g l of virgin ps moreover aged ps enhanced the photooxidation of pp mps significantly compared to virgin ps with 1 5 1 6 times of increase in k values than that in single group more details in table s1 in view of the favorable separation of pp and ps mps in combined systems validated by infrared spectra several critical results could be obtained 1 ps mps enhanced photooxidation of co existed pp mps 2 the enhanced effect was positively correlated to the concentration and aging degree of ps 3 the enhancement was only worked in uv but not in dark indirectly excluding the effect of adsorption on co existed pp and ps mps fig s4 presumably the important effect of ps mps for accelerating photooxidation of pp might result from the photosensitization of ps itself and or its released dom through generated ros by uv absorption more details in below 3 2 enhanced fragmentation by ps mps the size distribution and average size of pp in photochemical process were obtained to clarify the effect of ps mps on fragmentation behavior a total of 99 0 of virgin pp mps were 100 μm with the dominant size range of 150 200 μm dark treatments relatively decreased the proportion of large size range of pp mps e g the fractions with size 100 μm decreased to 76 9 62 5 and 66 2 after 21 d in dark for single and combined systems with virgin and aged ps mps respectively fig 2 a c indicating certain effect of physical agitation however it was negligible compared to more significant fragmentation of pp mps during uv irradiation especially the presence of ps mps enhanced the fragmentation of pp mps a case of 13 d irradiation was given that no pp particle with size 10 μm was detected in sole pp fig 2a while almost all particles were 10 μm in combined systems with fractions of 85 2 and 96 3 with virgin and aged ps fig 2b c the same case on 17 d among the generated fragments many more smaller sized particles were formed in combined than in single systems for example after 21 d of irradiation the percent of submicron particles 1 μm accounted for the total was only 1 98 in single system obviously lower than 24 5 and 20 6 in combined systems with 0 4 g l of virgin and aged ps respectively fig s5a in order to further describe the effect of ps mps on fragmentation of pp we plotted the profiles of ln d d 0 versus treatment time to quantitatively assess the fragmentation rate where d 0 and d denote the average sizes of pp at time 0 and t respectively as shown in fig 2d ln d d 0 followed a linear correlation with treatment time and the fragmentation rate was well described by first order kinetics with the rate constants of 0 22 0 25 and 0 26 d 1 for pp in single and combined systems with 0 4 g l of virgin and aged ps mps the data also indicated the enhanced fragmentation of pp by the co existed ps mps consistent with the results in photooxidation and size distribution fig 1 and fig 2a c the minor change in dark among various systems suggested the important role of uv light in initiating the enhanced effect of ps mps on fragmentation of pp mps fig s5b in addition to enhanced fragmentation the morphology variations of pp were also affected by the co existed ps mps low resolution fesem images showed that the fibrous like structures were generated on 25 d photodegraded pp fig 2e moreover the amounts of fiber structures in combined systems especially in aged ps system significantly exceeded those in the single these newly formed structures were seemingly resulted from the depolymerization of pp polymer chains tian et al 2019 despite more details required to validate the explanation digital images of 25 d irradiated solution also indicated the different phenomenon between single and combined systems where mp particles were favorably dispersed in the single but particle aggregates containing flocculent structures occupied in combined systems fig s6 suggesting more significant morphology variation in combined than in single systems however high resolution fesem images did not show the visible difference on surface layer of pp between single and combined systems in which rough structures occurred on all irradiated samples fig s7 this might be ascribed to the rapid fragmentation of pp in combined systems because once enough cracks were generated the fragmentation would occur to expose fresh surface to continue the next cracking fragmentation cycles fig 2a d 3 3 critical roles of ps itself and the released dom in ps mediated photodegradation of pp the above discussion validated the critical enhanced effects of ps mps on photodegradation of pp however which matter was the contributor for this effect here we focus on the role of ps itself and its dom in view of their potential photosensitization correlated to ps mps 3 3 1 ps itself fig 3 a showed that toc contents followed a trend of initial increase and then relative plateau with irradiation time prolonging which were also higher than those in dark fig s8 moreover toc contents in combined systems with ps mps were higher than that in the single and the content mediated by aged ps was also higher than that by virgin ones this indicated that the release rates of organic products from combined systems of pp with ps especially with aged ps were higher than the mineralization rate of generated organic products eem was adopted to analysis the release profiles of photoluminescent organic chemicals in leachates obviously no pl signal was observed in leachate from dark and uv treatment of sole pp indicating the negligible release of pp derived photoluminescent chemicals fig s9a however new pl signals were detected in leachates of combined systems with virgin and aged ps with an emission band of 300 535 nm and the maximum excitation ex at 220 295 nm and emission em at 410 nm fig s9b c which were assigned to the photoinduced humic like component coble 1996 tian et al 2019 lee et al 2020 reported that the signals at 235 290 410 nm ex em were the photolytic products released from irradiated ps and pvc polymers by comparing eem in single system of pp it can be confirmed that these matters represented organic products containing benzene ring from chain scission and oxidation of irradiated ps mps in order to reveal the dynamic evolution of photoluminescent products of ps versus irradiation time we picked up pl intensity at 295 410 nm ex em and plotted the profiles versus irradiation time in fig 3b obviously a trend of initial increase and then rapid decrease was observed for the pl intensity data under uv exposure of combined systems this indicated that a large amount of dom was released from irradiated ps mps in initial period but following the degradation dominated once the concentration achieved the plateau the positive correlation of pl intensity with concentrations of ps mps further indicated the stronger releasing ability of dom from high concentration ps consistent with the enhancing ability of ps mps on photooxidation of pp according to concentration see ci variation in fig 1b several studies demonstrated that uv irradiation caused the formation of ros e g oh and 1o2 on interfacial surface of ps mps via uv absorption by impurity or chromophore in polymer and these generated ros could in turn attack ps polymer to induce photoaging wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020a 2019 in current study the rapidly increased pl intensity of ps dom in leachates suggested that ps itself generated abundant amounts of ros because only the chemical attack of generated ros on ps mps could induce the rapid chain scission and oxidation and the release of organic products in leachate fig s9b c which would be validated via epr analysis and ros quenching tests therefore ps itself was the main contributor for accelerating the photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps however it should be noted that the critical role of ps itself might occur in initial and middle irradiation periods because after that the decrease in pl intensity occurred fig 3b this indicated that the photodegradation of released dom began to dominate compared to the generation of dom from irradiated ps from middle to later period potentially suggesting the fading on photosensitization of ps itself in later irradiation period the hypothesis could be further supported by the higher pl intensity of leachate in single irradiation system of virgin or aged ps mps without pp fig s10 because just without competition of pp mps many more ros generated from ps itself could be available to attack ps mps to further validate the critical role of ps itself the 25 d irradiated ps samples from virgin and aged ps mps were collected for ftir and sem characterizations fig s11 ftir spectra showed that compared to virgin ps a new absorption peak at 1740 cm 1 assigned to carbonyl was generated after 25 d irradiation panel 1 in fig s11a as for aged ps the carbonyl intensity was increased after irradiation panel 2 in fig s11a with ci value increased from 0 33 of 0 d irradiated ps to 0 38 of 25 d irradiated ones ci calculated from a1740 a1452 fesem image and size distribution indicated the surface damage and fragmentation on ps mps after uv irradiation fig s11b this demonstrated that both virgin and aged ps mps were involved in the photochemical reaction of pp suggesting the important role of ps itself in accelerating the photodegradation of pp mps theoretically ps that bonded to benzene ring in tertiary carbon would be more vulnerable to ros attack than pp that bonded to methyl group according to their molecular bonding stability gewert et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 the competitions for ros by ps mps could decrease the available amounts of ros for oxidizing pp while the enhanced photodegradation of pp by ps in current study indicated that pp could be also oxidized by the extra ros in view of the non selectivity of ros and their continuous generation from photosensitization of ps recent studies have demonstrated that ps mps inhibited the photodegradation of aqueous pollutants via the light screening effect wang et al 2021a 2021b however the light screening effect might not be important based on the enhancing effect of ps in photodegradation process of pp shown in fig 1 and 2 3 3 2 ps released dom in order to reveal the role of ps dom in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps we separated the leachate containing various types of dom from uv irradiated ps and investigated the effect of ps dom on photodegradation of pp via co incubation fig 4 a showed that compared to sole pp a steeper linear slope in ci values versus irradiation time was observed for pp with 50 mgc l of ps dom r2 0 937 suggesting the enhancement in photooxidation of pp infrared spectra in fig s12a few change of ci in dark indicated the poor interaction between pp and ps dom n dom was selected to evidence the effect of ps dom because ps dom might exhibit similar property with n dom in chemical components lee et al 2020 as shown in fig 4b the presence of n dom enhanced the increase in ci values of pp versus treatment time with 1 1 times of k value greater than that in the single we also observed the visible increase of ci values from 10 d to 25 d in dark of n dom pp system different from the minor change in that of ps dom pp given that uv irradiation was the prerequisite for photosensitization effect of n dom the increased ci value of pp in dark was possibly ascribed to the potential sorption of n dom on pp mps comparison in average size and size distribution demonstrated the more significant and rapid fragmentation of pp in combined system with ps dom than that in single system fig 4c d demonstrating the enhanced effect of ps dom on photodegradation of pp the critical role of ps dom could be also evidenced based on eem toc and lc ms ms analyses fig 3 b showed that pl intensity at 295 410 nm ex em ascribed to humic like component was rapidly decreased in combined system with ps dom under uv irradiation while in dark the intensity remained almost no change in the whole period indicating the low sorption of ps dom on pp mps fig s9d similar case was observed in the combined system with n dom fig s9e and also occurred in combined systems with ps mps in later irradiation periods fig s9b c this indicated the similar roles of n dom and ps dom in photodegradation of pp toc analysis showed that the contents in combined irradiation system of ps dom were lower than those in the single within 6 17 d fig 3a compared to minor difference of both systems in dark fig s8 theoretically if the photodegradation of pp was enhanced by ps dom the higher contents of organic products should be produced while the lower contents suggested that the formed organic products were self degraded by uv or oxidized by ros the generated ros also exhibited ability for attacking pp mps and thus accelerated their photodegradation as discussed in section 3 3 1 tof lc ms analysis showed that the dom in leachate from irradiated ps mps consisted of various chemicals including plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate p277 and chain scission and oxidation products of ps polymer such as phenol p93 acetophenone p119 benzoic acid p121 3 phenyl glutaric acid p207 and benzoic anhydride p225 etc shown in fig s13 and table s2 moreover many types of organic products could not be identified in leachate data not shown which indicated the production of abundant organic compounds numerous studies have demonstrated that the chromophores e g quinone and aromatic ketone structures in n dom could absorb uv energy to form a lower energy excited state 3n dom which could efficiently react with oxygen and water molecules to produce ros by energy transfer dalrymple et al 2010 li et al 2017 niu et al 2014 ps dom was very likely to exhibit the similar photosensitization property with n dom because both of matters have similar chromophores and pl characteristics fig s9d e and s13 these results indicated that dom released from ps mps possessed ability for accelerating photooxidation of pp based on release profiles of dom in combined systems mediated by ps mps fig 3b ps dom played an important role in later period of photogradation of pp while in initial period ps itself was the main contributor in combined system 3 4 mechanisms of ps mps for accelerating photodegradation of pp 3 4 1 identification of reactive species in this part we intended to explore how ps mps accelerated the photodegradation of co existed pp various types of reactive species including epfrs and ros oh o 2 and 1o2 were identified by epr spectrometer as shown in fig 5 a no change was observed in epr spectra of sole pp mps in both uv and dark conditions however distinct epr signals were detected in combined irradiation systems suggesting the formation of epfrs on irradiated pp mps besides the signal intensity of epfrs was positively increased according to systems with ps dom virgin and aged ps mps this potentially suggested the concentration sequence of epfrs as aged ps virgin ps ps dom sole higher intensity of epfrs on aged ps than virgin ones suggested the higher absorption ability for uv energy possibly due to the more abundant oxygen functional groups e g carbonyl in fig s1b singh and sharma 2008 although epfrs were not capable of oxidizing pp mps directly they could react with dissolved oxygen to yield ros via electron transfer zhu et al 2020a 2019 fig 5 a showed that no signal assigned to oh was observed in leachate from uv and dark treatment of sole pp while visible oh signal with intensity 1 2 2 1 was detected in leachates from irradiated pp mps with virgin and aged ps mps and also in that from co existed pp with ps dom despite being relatively weaker this implied that ps itself and released dom contributed to the formation of oh suggesting the important role of oh for chemical attack on pp mps this further validated the enhanced potentials of ps mps on photodegradation of pp via uv absorption by ps itself and released dom epr spectra of o 2 showed that no signal was detected in leachates for all groups the panel 3 in fig 5a zhu et al 2020 explained that the loss of o 2 signal was possibly ascribed to the low efficiency of trapping dmpo and the instability of dmpoooh adduct in aqueous media as for 1o2 a 3 line epr signal with an intensity of 1 1 1 was detected in the leachates of all systems which might be the response of temp and its products nardi et al 2014 further comparisons showed that the intensity of 1o2 in combined systems were relatively stronger than that in the single the panel 4 in fig 5a potentially indicating many more generation of 1o2 in combined systems it had been reported that 1o2 was generated from the reaction of triplet states ps and dissolved oxygen rochman et al 2013 zhu et al 2020a here ps dom might also be excited by uv energy to generate 1o2 as discussed in section 3 3 2 the quenching tests were conducted to explore the contributions of ros in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps as shown in fig 5b the presence of ros scavengers exhibited different inhibition effects on photodegradation of pp after addition of ipa the ci values of pp were significantly decreased by 18 0 44 3 and 39 7 in combined systems mediated by virgin and aged ps and ps dom respectively also 9 3 of decrease in ci value occurred in single system of pp however relatively small decrease in ci values occurred after addition of l histidine and sod where the presence of l histidine resulted in 0 0 4 4 and 27 0 of decrease in the single and combined systems with virgin and aged ps and ps dom respectively and 3 4 2 2 14 1 and 36 6 of decrease for sod in the same systems these results suggested that oh played a more important role than 1o2 and o 2 in the photodegradation of pp mps in the presence of ps mps which followed the order of oh o 2 1o2 overall epr and ros quenching results indicated that the mechanism of ps mps for accelerating the photodegradation of co existed pp mps were mainly controlled by ros involved processes 3 4 2 proposed mechanisms based on above discussions the mechanisms of ps mps for accelerating photodegradation of pp was proposed fig 6 in initial irradiation periods the impurity or chromophore in ps absorb uv energy to generate epfrs on the one hand epfrs reacted with dissolved oxygen and extracted hydrogen to form hydrogen peroxide further decomposed into oh fig 5a on the other hand 1o2 was produced from the transfer energy of ps itself or epfrs to dissolved oxygen the panel 4 in fig 5a here the photochemical reaction proceeded to the medium to later periods where a series of radical involved reactions resulted in chain scission and oxidation of ps and further release of dom in leachate fig 3 in this stage the carbonyl and aromatic moieties in ps dom absorbed uv energy to form epfrs which further form 3ps dom via transfer energy 3ps dom exhibited low oxidizing capacity while it could produce 1o2 by reacting with dissolved oxygen and also produce oh by reacting with water molecules fig 5a niu et al 2014 due to strong oxidative potential e 0 2 8 v oh in the generated ros could indiscriminatingly attack surrounding matters including pp and ps mps and the generated dom fig 5b as for pp its photodegradation e g oxidation fragmentation and chain scission was therefore enhanced in combined systems compared to the slow photoinitiation and degradation in single system details about photodegradation of pp in single and combined systems was outlined in fig 6 3 5 natural photodegradation of commercial pp in the presence of ps mps we further assessed the real effect of ps mps on photodegradtaion of commercial pp box in weihe river surface water under simulated sunlight ftir spectra showed that after 16 d of sunlight irradiation a new absorption peak at 1720 cm 1 was formed assigned to c o stretching vibration respectively in individual and combined systems fig s14 compared to minor change in dark control the ci values in simulated sunlight showed an overall increase with irradiation time fig 7 a similar with those in uv irradiation systems fig 1b however the increasing rate in sunlight was weaker than that in uv system indicating a higher susceptibility of mps for uv energy in addition the presence of ps mps enhanced the ci increase of pp after 16 d of irradiation the ci values of pp were increased to 0 09 and 0 10 in the presence of virgin and aged ps respectively 1 2 and 1 3 times higher than that of sole pp 0 08 similarly enhanced effects occurred on the fragmentation of pp mps where average sizes were decreased from 176 μm of virgin to 125 107 and 112 μm in single and combined systems by virgin and aged ps mps after 16 d of irradiation fig 7b as also indicated by size distribution in various systems fig s15 fesem images showed the similar morphology variation of commercial pp but with a higher extent in combined systems compared to those in the single fig s16 these results were in accordance with the enhanced photodegradation in uv irradiation indicating that ps mps accelerated the deterioration and photodegradation of commercial pp material after being co exposed in the environment and that the time period for the degradation of co existed micro plastics would be shortened compared to traditional laboratory data using one type of polymer 4 conclusion in this study the new behavior of ps mps for affecting photodegradation of co existed pp was investigated to improve understanding of environmental behavior of mps in aquatic environments our results showed that ps mps significantly accelerated the photodegradation of co existed pp including the faster oxidation and fragmentation especially the photodegradation route of pp e g reaction priority of partial chemical bindings was changed by the presence of ps mps the critical effects of ps mps were mainly derived from polymer itself and its released dom with the more important role of ps itself in initial period and that of ps dom in later period here oh generated from the reaction of polymer radical with oxygen and water molecules played an important role in accelerated photodegradation process of pp mps by ps itself and released dom the findings firstly revealed the critical behavior of ps mps and mechanism to accelerate photodegradation of co existed pp mps and suggested the shorter time period for micro plastic degradation in combined system than in the single which are helpful for tracing the source of mps and assessing their combined pollution in the environment however the associated limitations should not be ignored in current study where the contributions between ps itself and its dom and the potential relationship between the structures of ps mps and dom and their enhancing potential are not clear also the variability and figure of merits on analytical method of mp released organic compounds are not validated further study should be conducted to solve these limitations

16205,combined pollution consisted of various types of microplastics mps was extensively detected in the environment however little is known about their interaction on degradation behavior during exposure in sunlight this study investigated the effects of polystyrene ps mps and mechanisms on photodegradation of pure and commercial polypropylene pp mps co existed in aquatic environment results showed that ps mps significantly accelerated photodegradation of co existed pp including faster oxidation and fragmentation photodegradation route of pp mps such as the reaction priority of partial chemical bindings was even altered with the presence of ps mps highlighting the important role of ps in photodegradation process of pp analysis of leachate and free radical indicated that the critical effects were derived from photosensitization of ps polymer itself and its released dissolved organic matter ps dom here more important role of ps itself in initial period and that of ps dom in later period among generated ros oh was the key species for accelerating photodegradation of pp by ps itself and its released dom which were generated from the reaction of polymer radical with dissolved oxygen the findings firstly reveal the important role of ps in photodegradation of co existed mps and suggested the shorter duration of micro plastics in combined system than that in the single which provide useful information to assess environmental behavior and fate of mps more holistically graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photodegradation combined pollution organic compounds free radicals 1 introduction in the past decades huge consumption of plastics result in the large amounts of plastic wastes in the environment geyer et al 2017 reina et al 2018 geyer et al 2017 estimated that 4900 million tons of plastic wastes were accumulated in the environment during 1950 2015 and 12 000 million tons would be generated by the end of 2050 bulk plastics are fragile to be broken down into smaller particles during outdoor exposure jahnke et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 microplastics mps defined as particles smaller than 5 mm arthur et al 2009 are the most abundant particles to receive wide attentions due to their direct and indirect threats to organisms galloway and lewis 2016 he et al 2018 mps are not only extensively detected in aquatic terrestrial and atmospheric environments wong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020c but also in drinking water and table salt koelmans et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b and even in human being amato lourenço et al 2021 it should be noted that the types of mp pollution in the environment are not singular but are complex numerous studies have detected the combined pollution of mps in surface water frequently consisted of polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc etc sighicelli et al 2018 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the combined pollution of various mps will result in their complicated interaction in view of their different properties which may further affect their migration transformation and risk battulga et al 2020 observed that ps foam collected from tuul river in mongolia adsorbed various types of small mp particles including pp pe and polyaminde in addition mps in the environment inevitably unerdgo photodegradation during solar irradiation and the photodegradation potentials are different among various types of mps due to their different ability to absorb ultraviolet uv and produce free radicals duan et al 2021 gewert et al 2015 song et al 2017 according to the maximum sensitivity for uv energy the order in bond dissociation energy of polymers is pe 402 kj mol ps 377 kj mol pp 322 kj mol duan et al 2021 song et al 2017 the phenyl ring in ps backbone is more easily excited by uv to be photodegraded than the hydrogen in pe and methyl in pp gewert et al 2015 a recent study indicated that ps and phenolformaldehyde resin pf exhibited a strong ability for producing free radicals under simulated sunlight while low ability occurred on pe and pvc zhu et al 2019 based on these information it is highly possible that the photodegradation of certain mps e g pp will be affected by the other type of mps e g ps once being co existed in the same environment owing to their different photochemical properties it has been reported that reactive oxygen species ros generated from irradiated ps mps could in turn attack polymer itself or surrounding pollutants to enhance their photodegradation lin et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020a compared to virgin mps aged ones are more photoreactive to generate ros because the carbonyl in aged mps increases the absorption of uv energy singh and sharma 2008 which is hence likely to affect photodegradation of co existed matters more significantly in addition to mp itself uv irradiation results in the release of volatile and dissolved organic matters dom from mps which composed of additives oligomers or monomers and oxygenated products lee et al 2020 lomonaco et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 zhu et al 2020b some mp derived dom might affect photodegradation of co existed mps by altering the absorption of uv energy and formation of free radicals khaled et al 2018 wang et al 2020 khaled et al 2018 observed that the decabromodiphenylether in ps enhanced 10 times increases in photodegradation rate of ps polymer because the formed br enhanced hydrogen abstraction and chain oxidation of ps however little is known regarding the effects of mps on photoaging degradation of other co existed mps in view of the complex pollution in real aquatic environment exploring photodegradation behavior of mps in combined system is important for predicting their duration periods of mps and assessing their environmental fate in this study four forms of mps including pure and commercial pp disposable box and virgin and aged ps and two types of dom released from aged ps ps dom and natural environment n dom were selected to investigate the role and mechanism of ps mps in photodegradation of pp in water pp and ps were selected since both mps were frequently detected in the same environment sighicelli et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 dynamic evolutions in photooxidation fragmentation and morphology variation of pp mediated by virgin and aged ps mps were investgated the specific role of ps itself and released dom in photodegradation of pp mps were firstly clarified via analysis of leachates by total organic carbon toc excitation emission matrice eem and high performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer tof lc ms the mechanisms of ps mps to affect photodegradation of pp were unraveled via electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement the obtained results would provide insight into environmental behavior of mps and contribute to our understanding of combined mp pollution in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of mps and leachates pure and commercial pp mps with 194 36 3 and 176 21 9 μm were purchased from china petrochemical corporation beijing china and yinlong co ltd chengdu china respectively virgin ps with 58 7 17 1 μm was manufactured by zhongcheng plastic factory guangzhou china aged ps 20 1 5 68 μm and released dom ps dom were prepared from uv irradiation of virgin ps mps in ultrapure water details in text s1 of supplementary material the properties of pure and commercial pp mps and virgin and aged ps mps were shown as fig s1 details on these mps and other reagents were described in text s2 of supplementary material 2 2 co exposure irradiation setup the co exposed experiments were designed to simulate the co occurrence of pp and ps mps in aquatic environments irradiation tests were carried out in a uv chamber equipped with three uv lamps 150 w which were frequently used for laboratory simulated photoaging photodegradation of mps due to the high sensitivity to uv energy e g 318 and 370 nm for ps and pp respectively chen et al 2019 song et al 2017 specifically 0 25 g of pp mps was added in 150 ml quartz conical flask containing 125 ml of ultrapure water then virgin or aged ps mps were spiked into each pp suspension respectively to reach the final concentrations of ps at 0 4 and 1 0 g l the pp ps ratios were selected mainly based on their annual productions in recent decades andrady 2011 plastics europe 2020 geyer et al 2017 after being pre sonicated for 30 min the flasks were immediately exposed to uv irradiation in chamber with agitation speed of 200 rpm and temperature at 25 c control samples including combined groups in dark condition and sole pp or ps mps in dark and uv conditions were conducted according to similar operation as above at each treatment time point 0 3 6 9 13 17 21 and 25 d 10 ml of suspensions were collected according to the crossed sampling methods the separation between pp and ps mps was operated based on density difference 0 91 g cm3 of pp and 1 04 g cm3 of ps curbell plastics 2021 fig s2 details on these operations were described in text s3 of supplementary material co exposure irradiation and dark tests of pp mps with ps dom or n dom 50 mgc l were operated as similar procedures above the collection of treated pp was operated by funnel filtration method 50 mgc l of ps dom n dom was selected due to similar concentration level 23 mgc l of n dom in the environment zuo and jones 1997 the natural photodegradation tests of commercial pp with and without ps mps were conducted in real surface water under simulated sunlight here the surface water was collected from weihe river in june 2021 108 6 e 34 14 n and the simulated sunlight was provided by a 500 w xenon lamp in photochemical reactor ceaulight china the detailed experimental setup was described in text s4 of supplementary material 2 3 characterization of mps and analysis of filtrates surface morphology of mps was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem nanosem 450 fei size distribution and average size were analyzed by measuring particles in sem images using nano measurer

toc l shimadzu excitation emission matrices were obtained on a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu to analysis photoluminescence pl property of organic chemicals in leachate the structures of ps

extraction more details in text s5 of supplementary material 2 4 ros identification as reported the photoaging of polymer was controlled by radical involved reactions singh and sharma 2008 zhu et al 2020a to investigate photodegradation mechanisms of pp mediated by ps mps the environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs and ros oh o 2 and 1o2 were identified by epr spectrometer emxmicro 6 1 p l bruker the quenching tests were conducted to determine the contributions of various ros in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps by adding ros scavengers including 10 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa for oh 2 mg l superoxide dismutase sod for o 2 and 10 mm l histidine for 1o2 details on epr measurement and ros quenching were described in text s6 of supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated photooxidation of pp by ps mps ftir was adopted to examine the effects of virgin and aged ps mps on the photooxidation of pp mps several characteristic peaks were detected at 1160 1377 and 1460 cm 1 on virgin pp assigned to ch2 and ch3 bending and stretching vibrations fig s1b rajakumar et al 2009 however new peaks at 1242 and 1731 cm 1 were gradually raised on photodegraded pp mps as irradiation time prolonged from 0 d to 25 d fig 1 a which corresponded to c o and c o stretching vibrations hayes et al 2017 klapiszewski et al 2019 moreover various changes occurred on the native peaks of photodegraded pp such as a trend of initial decrease and then increase at 1160 cm 1 and minor change at 1377 1460 cm 1 this indicated the damage in crystalline region of pp possibly ascribed to the oxidation in chemical bindings brandon et al 2016 lv et al 2017 compared to sole pp the presence of ps mps did not significantly affect the types of absorption peaks of pp in combined systems other than higher increase in intensity of c o and c o fig 1a two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos were obtained by analyzing ftir spectra using 2d shige software version 1 3 to probe dynamic evolution of chemical bindings from initial to final term reaction of pp with the presence of ps mps here the data was presented as the red dot in the diagonal line of synchronous maps and the darker red represented the higher content of group in pp as shown in fig 1c we could clearly observe that the color of red points at 1160 1242 and 1731 cm 1 of pp mps become darker with the co existed of ps mps and more intense in the presence of aged ps mps while few change was observed at 1377 and 1460 cm 1 of pp with and without ps mps fig s3a this indicated that ps mps enhanced the photooxidation in pp mps but showed low effect on ch3 and ch2 in pp based on these results the asynchronous correlation spectra of typical peaks at 1160 1242 1377 1460 and 1731 cm 1 were analyzed shown in fig s3b and table 1 where the positive sign denoted that the time order of peak in row participating in the reaction were later than that in the column and the opposite case for the negative sign ding et al 2020 for example the positive cross peaks in ψ 1160 1243 1731 illustrated that the binding at 1731 cm 1 involved in photoreaction were later than those at 1160 and 1243 cm 1 while the negative ψ 1377 1460 1731 indicated the priority of 1731 cm 1 to 1377 and 1460 cm 1 in photoreaction process from asynchronous data in table 1 a critical phenomenon could be observed for the irradiation system of sole pp the chemical bindings in reaction followed the order as 1243 c o 1160 amorphous c h 1731 c o 1377 ch3 1460 ch2 however the opposite trend with 1460 1377 occurred in combined systems of pp with both virgin and aged ps mps concurrently the earlier reaction of 1160 cm 1 than 1243 cm 1 in combined system of pp and high concentration virgin ps mps was different from that in single pp system table 1 therefore the results indicated that the photodegradation routes of pp at least the reaction priority of partial chemical bindings could be altered by co existed ps mps in aquatic system carbonyl index ci calculated by the ratio of peak intensity at carbonyl to methyl a1715 a1377 was used to characterize photooxidation degree of pp in single and combined systems song et al 2017 in the dark the ci remained almost no change in the whole period regardless of single or combined groups the black square in fig 1b however for uv exposure the ci values showed a positively linear correlation versus irradiation time r 2 0 854 for single system and 0 915 0 925 and 0 933 0 933 for combined systems with virgin and aged ps respectively suggesting that uv was a necessity for photooxidation of pp mps moreover the oxidation degrees according to exposure duration were different with and without ps mps and also varied among virgin and aged ps fig 1b in single system the slope k value fitted from linear correlation of ci versus irradiation time was 0 009 smaller than 0 011 and 0 014 in combined systems with 0 4 and 1 0 g l of virgin ps moreover aged ps enhanced the photooxidation of pp mps significantly compared to virgin ps with 1 5 1 6 times of increase in k values than that in single group more details in table s1 in view of the favorable separation of pp and ps mps in combined systems validated by infrared spectra several critical results could be obtained 1 ps mps enhanced photooxidation of co existed pp mps 2 the enhanced effect was positively correlated to the concentration and aging degree of ps 3 the enhancement was only worked in uv but not in dark indirectly excluding the effect of adsorption on co existed pp and ps mps fig s4 presumably the important effect of ps mps for accelerating photooxidation of pp might result from the photosensitization of ps itself and or its released dom through generated ros by uv absorption more details in below 3 2 enhanced fragmentation by ps mps the size distribution and average size of pp in photochemical process were obtained to clarify the effect of ps mps on fragmentation behavior a total of 99 0 of virgin pp mps were 100 μm with the dominant size range of 150 200 μm dark treatments relatively decreased the proportion of large size range of pp mps e g the fractions with size 100 μm decreased to 76 9 62 5 and 66 2 after 21 d in dark for single and combined systems with virgin and aged ps mps respectively fig 2 a c indicating certain effect of physical agitation however it was negligible compared to more significant fragmentation of pp mps during uv irradiation especially the presence of ps mps enhanced the fragmentation of pp mps a case of 13 d irradiation was given that no pp particle with size 10 μm was detected in sole pp fig 2a while almost all particles were 10 μm in combined systems with fractions of 85 2 and 96 3 with virgin and aged ps fig 2b c the same case on 17 d among the generated fragments many more smaller sized particles were formed in combined than in single systems for example after 21 d of irradiation the percent of submicron particles 1 μm accounted for the total was only 1 98 in single system obviously lower than 24 5 and 20 6 in combined systems with 0 4 g l of virgin and aged ps respectively fig s5a in order to further describe the effect of ps mps on fragmentation of pp we plotted the profiles of ln d d 0 versus treatment time to quantitatively assess the fragmentation rate where d 0 and d denote the average sizes of pp at time 0 and t respectively as shown in fig 2d ln d d 0 followed a linear correlation with treatment time and the fragmentation rate was well described by first order kinetics with the rate constants of 0 22 0 25 and 0 26 d 1 for pp in single and combined systems with 0 4 g l of virgin and aged ps mps the data also indicated the enhanced fragmentation of pp by the co existed ps mps consistent with the results in photooxidation and size distribution fig 1 and fig 2a c the minor change in dark among various systems suggested the important role of uv light in initiating the enhanced effect of ps mps on fragmentation of pp mps fig s5b in addition to enhanced fragmentation the morphology variations of pp were also affected by the co existed ps mps low resolution fesem images showed that the fibrous like structures were generated on 25 d photodegraded pp fig 2e moreover the amounts of fiber structures in combined systems especially in aged ps system significantly exceeded those in the single these newly formed structures were seemingly resulted from the depolymerization of pp polymer chains tian et al 2019 despite more details required to validate the explanation digital images of 25 d irradiated solution also indicated the different phenomenon between single and combined systems where mp particles were favorably dispersed in the single but particle aggregates containing flocculent structures occupied in combined systems fig s6 suggesting more significant morphology variation in combined than in single systems however high resolution fesem images did not show the visible difference on surface layer of pp between single and combined systems in which rough structures occurred on all irradiated samples fig s7 this might be ascribed to the rapid fragmentation of pp in combined systems because once enough cracks were generated the fragmentation would occur to expose fresh surface to continue the next cracking fragmentation cycles fig 2a d 3 3 critical roles of ps itself and the released dom in ps mediated photodegradation of pp the above discussion validated the critical enhanced effects of ps mps on photodegradation of pp however which matter was the contributor for this effect here we focus on the role of ps itself and its dom in view of their potential photosensitization correlated to ps mps 3 3 1 ps itself fig 3 a showed that toc contents followed a trend of initial increase and then relative plateau with irradiation time prolonging which were also higher than those in dark fig s8 moreover toc contents in combined systems with ps mps were higher than that in the single and the content mediated by aged ps was also higher than that by virgin ones this indicated that the release rates of organic products from combined systems of pp with ps especially with aged ps were higher than the mineralization rate of generated organic products eem was adopted to analysis the release profiles of photoluminescent organic chemicals in leachates obviously no pl signal was observed in leachate from dark and uv treatment of sole pp indicating the negligible release of pp derived photoluminescent chemicals fig s9a however new pl signals were detected in leachates of combined systems with virgin and aged ps with an emission band of 300 535 nm and the maximum excitation ex at 220 295 nm and emission em at 410 nm fig s9b c which were assigned to the photoinduced humic like component coble 1996 tian et al 2019 lee et al 2020 reported that the signals at 235 290 410 nm ex em were the photolytic products released from irradiated ps and pvc polymers by comparing eem in single system of pp it can be confirmed that these matters represented organic products containing benzene ring from chain scission and oxidation of irradiated ps mps in order to reveal the dynamic evolution of photoluminescent products of ps versus irradiation time we picked up pl intensity at 295 410 nm ex em and plotted the profiles versus irradiation time in fig 3b obviously a trend of initial increase and then rapid decrease was observed for the pl intensity data under uv exposure of combined systems this indicated that a large amount of dom was released from irradiated ps mps in initial period but following the degradation dominated once the concentration achieved the plateau the positive correlation of pl intensity with concentrations of ps mps further indicated the stronger releasing ability of dom from high concentration ps consistent with the enhancing ability of ps mps on photooxidation of pp according to concentration see ci variation in fig 1b several studies demonstrated that uv irradiation caused the formation of ros e g oh and 1o2 on interfacial surface of ps mps via uv absorption by impurity or chromophore in polymer and these generated ros could in turn attack ps polymer to induce photoaging wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020a 2019 in current study the rapidly increased pl intensity of ps dom in leachates suggested that ps itself generated abundant amounts of ros because only the chemical attack of generated ros on ps mps could induce the rapid chain scission and oxidation and the release of organic products in leachate fig s9b c which would be validated via epr analysis and ros quenching tests therefore ps itself was the main contributor for accelerating the photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps however it should be noted that the critical role of ps itself might occur in initial and middle irradiation periods because after that the decrease in pl intensity occurred fig 3b this indicated that the photodegradation of released dom began to dominate compared to the generation of dom from irradiated ps from middle to later period potentially suggesting the fading on photosensitization of ps itself in later irradiation period the hypothesis could be further supported by the higher pl intensity of leachate in single irradiation system of virgin or aged ps mps without pp fig s10 because just without competition of pp mps many more ros generated from ps itself could be available to attack ps mps to further validate the critical role of ps itself the 25 d irradiated ps samples from virgin and aged ps mps were collected for ftir and sem characterizations fig s11 ftir spectra showed that compared to virgin ps a new absorption peak at 1740 cm 1 assigned to carbonyl was generated after 25 d irradiation panel 1 in fig s11a as for aged ps the carbonyl intensity was increased after irradiation panel 2 in fig s11a with ci value increased from 0 33 of 0 d irradiated ps to 0 38 of 25 d irradiated ones ci calculated from a1740 a1452 fesem image and size distribution indicated the surface damage and fragmentation on ps mps after uv irradiation fig s11b this demonstrated that both virgin and aged ps mps were involved in the photochemical reaction of pp suggesting the important role of ps itself in accelerating the photodegradation of pp mps theoretically ps that bonded to benzene ring in tertiary carbon would be more vulnerable to ros attack than pp that bonded to methyl group according to their molecular bonding stability gewert et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 the competitions for ros by ps mps could decrease the available amounts of ros for oxidizing pp while the enhanced photodegradation of pp by ps in current study indicated that pp could be also oxidized by the extra ros in view of the non selectivity of ros and their continuous generation from photosensitization of ps recent studies have demonstrated that ps mps inhibited the photodegradation of aqueous pollutants via the light screening effect wang et al 2021a 2021b however the light screening effect might not be important based on the enhancing effect of ps in photodegradation process of pp shown in fig 1 and 2 3 3 2 ps released dom in order to reveal the role of ps dom in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps we separated the leachate containing various types of dom from uv irradiated ps and investigated the effect of ps dom on photodegradation of pp via co incubation fig 4 a showed that compared to sole pp a steeper linear slope in ci values versus irradiation time was observed for pp with 50 mgc l of ps dom r2 0 937 suggesting the enhancement in photooxidation of pp infrared spectra in fig s12a few change of ci in dark indicated the poor interaction between pp and ps dom n dom was selected to evidence the effect of ps dom because ps dom might exhibit similar property with n dom in chemical components lee et al 2020 as shown in fig 4b the presence of n dom enhanced the increase in ci values of pp versus treatment time with 1 1 times of k value greater than that in the single we also observed the visible increase of ci values from 10 d to 25 d in dark of n dom pp system different from the minor change in that of ps dom pp given that uv irradiation was the prerequisite for photosensitization effect of n dom the increased ci value of pp in dark was possibly ascribed to the potential sorption of n dom on pp mps comparison in average size and size distribution demonstrated the more significant and rapid fragmentation of pp in combined system with ps dom than that in single system fig 4c d demonstrating the enhanced effect of ps dom on photodegradation of pp the critical role of ps dom could be also evidenced based on eem toc and lc ms ms analyses fig 3 b showed that pl intensity at 295 410 nm ex em ascribed to humic like component was rapidly decreased in combined system with ps dom under uv irradiation while in dark the intensity remained almost no change in the whole period indicating the low sorption of ps dom on pp mps fig s9d similar case was observed in the combined system with n dom fig s9e and also occurred in combined systems with ps mps in later irradiation periods fig s9b c this indicated the similar roles of n dom and ps dom in photodegradation of pp toc analysis showed that the contents in combined irradiation system of ps dom were lower than those in the single within 6 17 d fig 3a compared to minor difference of both systems in dark fig s8 theoretically if the photodegradation of pp was enhanced by ps dom the higher contents of organic products should be produced while the lower contents suggested that the formed organic products were self degraded by uv or oxidized by ros the generated ros also exhibited ability for attacking pp mps and thus accelerated their photodegradation as discussed in section 3 3 1 tof lc ms analysis showed that the dom in leachate from irradiated ps mps consisted of various chemicals including plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate p277 and chain scission and oxidation products of ps polymer such as phenol p93 acetophenone p119 benzoic acid p121 3 phenyl glutaric acid p207 and benzoic anhydride p225 etc shown in fig s13 and table s2 moreover many types of organic products could not be identified in leachate data not shown which indicated the production of abundant organic compounds numerous studies have demonstrated that the chromophores e g quinone and aromatic ketone structures in n dom could absorb uv energy to form a lower energy excited state 3n dom which could efficiently react with oxygen and water molecules to produce ros by energy transfer dalrymple et al 2010 li et al 2017 niu et al 2014 ps dom was very likely to exhibit the similar photosensitization property with n dom because both of matters have similar chromophores and pl characteristics fig s9d e and s13 these results indicated that dom released from ps mps possessed ability for accelerating photooxidation of pp based on release profiles of dom in combined systems mediated by ps mps fig 3b ps dom played an important role in later period of photogradation of pp while in initial period ps itself was the main contributor in combined system 3 4 mechanisms of ps mps for accelerating photodegradation of pp 3 4 1 identification of reactive species in this part we intended to explore how ps mps accelerated the photodegradation of co existed pp various types of reactive species including epfrs and ros oh o 2 and 1o2 were identified by epr spectrometer as shown in fig 5 a no change was observed in epr spectra of sole pp mps in both uv and dark conditions however distinct epr signals were detected in combined irradiation systems suggesting the formation of epfrs on irradiated pp mps besides the signal intensity of epfrs was positively increased according to systems with ps dom virgin and aged ps mps this potentially suggested the concentration sequence of epfrs as aged ps virgin ps ps dom sole higher intensity of epfrs on aged ps than virgin ones suggested the higher absorption ability for uv energy possibly due to the more abundant oxygen functional groups e g carbonyl in fig s1b singh and sharma 2008 although epfrs were not capable of oxidizing pp mps directly they could react with dissolved oxygen to yield ros via electron transfer zhu et al 2020a 2019 fig 5 a showed that no signal assigned to oh was observed in leachate from uv and dark treatment of sole pp while visible oh signal with intensity 1 2 2 1 was detected in leachates from irradiated pp mps with virgin and aged ps mps and also in that from co existed pp with ps dom despite being relatively weaker this implied that ps itself and released dom contributed to the formation of oh suggesting the important role of oh for chemical attack on pp mps this further validated the enhanced potentials of ps mps on photodegradation of pp via uv absorption by ps itself and released dom epr spectra of o 2 showed that no signal was detected in leachates for all groups the panel 3 in fig 5a zhu et al 2020 explained that the loss of o 2 signal was possibly ascribed to the low efficiency of trapping dmpo and the instability of dmpoooh adduct in aqueous media as for 1o2 a 3 line epr signal with an intensity of 1 1 1 was detected in the leachates of all systems which might be the response of temp and its products nardi et al 2014 further comparisons showed that the intensity of 1o2 in combined systems were relatively stronger than that in the single the panel 4 in fig 5a potentially indicating many more generation of 1o2 in combined systems it had been reported that 1o2 was generated from the reaction of triplet states ps and dissolved oxygen rochman et al 2013 zhu et al 2020a here ps dom might also be excited by uv energy to generate 1o2 as discussed in section 3 3 2 the quenching tests were conducted to explore the contributions of ros in photodegradation of pp mediated by ps mps as shown in fig 5b the presence of ros scavengers exhibited different inhibition effects on photodegradation of pp after addition of ipa the ci values of pp were significantly decreased by 18 0 44 3 and 39 7 in combined systems mediated by virgin and aged ps and ps dom respectively also 9 3 of decrease in ci value occurred in single system of pp however relatively small decrease in ci values occurred after addition of l histidine and sod where the presence of l histidine resulted in 0 0 4 4 and 27 0 of decrease in the single and combined systems with virgin and aged ps and ps dom respectively and 3 4 2 2 14 1 and 36 6 of decrease for sod in the same systems these results suggested that oh played a more important role than 1o2 and o 2 in the photodegradation of pp mps in the presence of ps mps which followed the order of oh o 2 1o2 overall epr and ros quenching results indicated that the mechanism of ps mps for accelerating the photodegradation of co existed pp mps were mainly controlled by ros involved processes 3 4 2 proposed mechanisms based on above discussions the mechanisms of ps mps for accelerating photodegradation of pp was proposed fig 6 in initial irradiation periods the impurity or chromophore in ps absorb uv energy to generate epfrs on the one hand epfrs reacted with dissolved oxygen and extracted hydrogen to form hydrogen peroxide further decomposed into oh fig 5a on the other hand 1o2 was produced from the transfer energy of ps itself or epfrs to dissolved oxygen the panel 4 in fig 5a here the photochemical reaction proceeded to the medium to later periods where a series of radical involved reactions resulted in chain scission and oxidation of ps and further release of dom in leachate fig 3 in this stage the carbonyl and aromatic moieties in ps dom absorbed uv energy to form epfrs which further form 3ps dom via transfer energy 3ps dom exhibited low oxidizing capacity while it could produce 1o2 by reacting with dissolved oxygen and also produce oh by reacting with water molecules fig 5a niu et al 2014 due to strong oxidative potential e 0 2 8 v oh in the generated ros could indiscriminatingly attack surrounding matters including pp and ps mps and the generated dom fig 5b as for pp its photodegradation e g oxidation fragmentation and chain scission was therefore enhanced in combined systems compared to the slow photoinitiation and degradation in single system details about photodegradation of pp in single and combined systems was outlined in fig 6 3 5 natural photodegradation of commercial pp in the presence of ps mps we further assessed the real effect of ps mps on photodegradtaion of commercial pp box in weihe river surface water under simulated sunlight ftir spectra showed that after 16 d of sunlight irradiation a new absorption peak at 1720 cm 1 was formed assigned to c o stretching vibration respectively in individual and combined systems fig s14 compared to minor change in dark control the ci values in simulated sunlight showed an overall increase with irradiation time fig 7 a similar with those in uv irradiation systems fig 1b however the increasing rate in sunlight was weaker than that in uv system indicating a higher susceptibility of mps for uv energy in addition the presence of ps mps enhanced the ci increase of pp after 16 d of irradiation the ci values of pp were increased to 0 09 and 0 10 in the presence of virgin and aged ps respectively 1 2 and 1 3 times higher than that of sole pp 0 08 similarly enhanced effects occurred on the fragmentation of pp mps where average sizes were decreased from 176 μm of virgin to 125 107 and 112 μm in single and combined systems by virgin and aged ps mps after 16 d of irradiation fig 7b as also indicated by size distribution in various systems fig s15 fesem images showed the similar morphology variation of commercial pp but with a higher extent in combined systems compared to those in the single fig s16 these results were in accordance with the enhanced photodegradation in uv irradiation indicating that ps mps accelerated the deterioration and photodegradation of commercial pp material after being co exposed in the environment and that the time period for the degradation of co existed micro plastics would be shortened compared to traditional laboratory data using one type of polymer 4 conclusion in this study the new behavior of ps mps for affecting photodegradation of co existed pp was investigated to improve understanding of environmental behavior of mps in aquatic environments our results showed that ps mps significantly accelerated the photodegradation of co existed pp including the faster oxidation and fragmentation especially the photodegradation route of pp e g reaction priority of partial chemical bindings was changed by the presence of ps mps the critical effects of ps mps were mainly derived from polymer itself and its released dom with the more important role of ps itself in initial period and that of ps dom in later period here oh generated from the reaction of polymer radical with oxygen and water molecules played an important role in accelerated photodegradation process of pp mps by ps itself and released dom the findings firstly revealed the critical behavior of ps mps and mechanism to accelerate photodegradation of co existed pp mps and suggested the shorter time period for micro plastic degradation in combined system than in the single which are helpful for tracing the source of mps and assessing their combined pollution in the environment however the associated limitations should not be ignored in current study where the contributions between ps itself and its dom and the potential relationship between the structures of ps mps and dom and their enhancing potential are not clear also the variability and figure of merits on analytical method of mp released organic compounds are not validated further study should be conducted to solve these limitations

16206,organic phosphorus po plays a key role in eutrophication and ecological equilibrium in lake systems however characterizing the composition of po in lake sediments has been a bottleneck hindering further understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of po here multiple methods of 31p nmr spectroscopy and molecular weight mw ultrafiltration were combined to detect po composition characteristics from a novel angle in ten lake sediments of china the results showed that sediment po mainly consisted of monoester mono p 14 8 8 of the naoh edta total p on average diester di p 1 4 1 4 and phosphonate phos p 0 1 0 1 while the abundance of po was largely underestimated by 31p nmr methods some specific species of mono p were successfully determined and the contents of these species followed a decreasing order inositol hexakisphosphate ihp6 rna mononucleotides rna mnp β glycerophosphate β gly d glucose 6 phosphate glu 6 α glycerophosphate α gly which was largely dependent upon their bioreactivity a significant relationship between mw and po components was observed despite the great differences among sediment samples for refractory po components ihp6 was mainly rich in the mw 3 kda while phos p was almost only detected in the mw 3 kda which largely attributed to their metal binding affinities and characteristics the abundance of bioreactive po species α gly β gly glu 6 di p in high mw hmw 3 kda were all higher than that of low mw lmw 3 kda due to microbial degradation and self assembly if the hmw organic molecules were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts the high percentage of α gly β gly glu 6 and di p in the hmw portion would highlights their high reactivity from the perspective of mw these insights revealed the dynamics of the mw distribution of po components and provide valuable information to better understand the po composition and bioreactivity in sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 31p nmr

lake eutrophication wu and wang 2017 horppila et al 2019 accurate estimation of internal p loading from sediments is important for water quality risk assessment and lake management rippey et al 2021 it has been widely recognized that internal p loading can trigger a positive feedback of lake eutrophication orihel et al 2017 tu et al 2021 in which the release of inorganic pi and the degradation of organic p po produce orthophosphate through chemical decomposition photodegradation and biomineralization processes søndergaard et al 2003 ahlgren et al 2011 li et al 2019 li et al 2021 however due to the complex composition of po and to the limitation of analytical technologies venkatesan et al 2018 the contribution of po to internal p loading has not been well understood as one of the major parts of p in the environment po is a complex mixture where p is integrated into organic matter and forms different fractions bedrock et al 1995 worsfold et al 2008 cade menun 2005 ding et al 2010 with an increasing attention on po and advanced analytical techniques a few studies have demonstrated that po are highly bioavailable zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 studies have reported that po could be utilized concurrently with inorganic p as a p source to aquatic ecosystems and its nutrient value is greater when total p supplies are limited björkman and karl 2003 ruttenberg and dyhrman 2005 although studies on the abundance composition circulation and characteristics of po have been widely investigated the structural and compositional characterization of po at molecular level remains missing thus restricting the estimation of po species that contribute to internal p loadings the complexity and lack of compositional information on po in sediments hampers our understanding of its bioreactivity fates and environmental implications among numerous analytical techniques for identifying the species of po compounds in sediments and soil ivanoff et al 1998 liu et al 2013 venkatesan et al 2018 hurtarte et al 2020 ni et al 2021 31p nmr spectroscopy is most frequently used due to its comprehensive and non destructive performance cade menun 2005 worsfold et al 2008 the 31p nmr spectroscopy method can identify specific po species including inositol phosphates sugar phosphates dna and rna fragments phospholipids phosphate esters etc wu and xing 2009 mclaren et al 2015a giles et al 2015 as a basic feature of dissolved organic molecules mw is usually closely related with their chemical compositions mclaren et al 2015b demonstrated that the speciation of po in soil have a great variation in mws hmw dissolved organic molecules usually have stronger bindings to metal ions than that of lmw ones lakshman et al 1993 christl and kretzschmar 2001 chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 and hence influence the bioreactivity of specific po components such as phosphonate and inositol hexaphosphate metal compounds mw is also an important factor influencing the bioreactivity of dissolved po in the environment studies have shown that the bulks of high mw hmw dissolved organic molecules are more bio reactive therefore can be more rapidly utilized by microbes than those with low mw lmw amon and benner 1994 arnosti et al 1994 amon and benner 1996 benner and amon 2015 hence studying the mw distribution of po composition might shed light on the internal mechanism about the bioreactivity of po in sediments sediment systems are of high heterogeneity in terms of the composition of po compounds specifically the compounds with different mws exhibit distinctive characteristics in content and abundance ged and boyer 2013 mclaren et al 2015b which in turn influence their reactivities and fates however current knowledge on the mw distribution for different components of po in sediments remains unclear thus there is an urgent need to explore the response of mw fraction to the composition of po in sediments in this study the naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta method was used to efficiently extract po cade menun and preston 1996 turner et al 2003a while 31p nmr and mw ultrafiltration were combined to explore the mw distribution characteristics of each identified po components using samples of ten lakes from the eastern plain and yunnan guizhou plateau of china additionally the plausible explanations for the mw distribution of po components and environmental implications were discussed this study is expected to provide further insights about the compositional characteristics of po at molecular level 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection the eastern plain and yunnan guizhou plateau in china possess a vast number of lakes most of which face eutrophication risks ten lakes from those regions were selected as the study sites see fig 1 among the selected lakes from the eastern plain some are located at middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and huai river others at lower reaches of yellow river and hai river or along the beijing hangzhou grand canal most of the lakes are shallow with the eutrophication being a major concern le et al 2010 lake baiyang id by sampling

wuhan dong wd 30 34 38 n 114 23 59 e were selected in this area with trophic level index being 58 51 59 51 58 and 65 respectively chinese ecological environment bullet 2018 lakes in yunnan guizhou plateau mainly located in the middle of the area where the lake dianchi dc 24 52 14 n 102 43 29 e lake yilonghu ylh 23 39 26 n 102 36 32 e lake erhai eh 25 40 5 88 n 100 13 58 8 e and lake lugu lg 27 42 44 n 100 46 50 e were selected whose trophic level index is 58 61 42 and 14 respectively overall these sampling sites are in remote areas with little influence from anthropogenic activities therefore they can represent the natural states of the lake environment in addition the selected lakes are characterized by distinctive climatic regimes as well as by the spatial heterogeneity in water depths and trophic levels analysis based on the samples of those lakes can better capture the general patterns in po s composition as well as mw distribution therefore enabling more general conclusions in total ten surface sediment samples from ten lakes were collected in august and september 2018 fig 1 at each sampling site the sediments were first obtained by a columnar sampler then the sediments from the bottom of the lakes down to a depth of 5 cm were collected into sealed dark plastic bags and kept at 4 c in laboratory the sediments were freeze dried and grounded through a 100 mesh 0 149 mm sieve after removing gravels and plant fragments 2 2 naoh edta extraction naoh edta extraction can provide a close estimate to the total extractable p facilitating the subsequent po characterization with 31p nmr spectroscopy cade menun and preston 1996 2 g dried sediments were extracted with 50 ml of sodium hydroxide ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid mixture 0 25 m naoh 25 mm edta at 25 c after 16 h of oscillation extracts were centrifuged at 5 000 r min for 15 min and then the supernatants were passed through a 0 45 μm glass filter keyilong experimental equipment co ltd tianjin china preheated for 3 h at 450 c a portion of the extract was used for mw ultrafiltration the rest were used to measure the content of the naoh edta extractable total p and the naoh edta extractable pi the naoh edta extractable total p was measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after digestion while the naoh edta extractable pi was direct measured by molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method without digestion the naoh edta extractable po was calculated as the difference between the naoh edta extractable total p and the naoh edta extractable pi the analysis of the total p content in sediment was performed following the european testing standards ruban et al 1999 the extraction rate with naoh edta was calculated as the naoh edta extractable total p divided by the total p in sediments 2 3 mw ultrafiltration the naoh edta extract was transferred to an ultrafiltration device model 8400 millipore corporation massachusetts usa containing 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda filtration membranes made of regenerated cellulose model ym millipore corporation the extract was successively passed through 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda filter membranes to reduce concentration difference which could affect the subsequent filtering processes the naoh edta extractable total p was divided into four mw groups after ultrafiltration zhang et al 2016 namely 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively each mw group was defined as follows 1 ω 10 kda ω raw ω 10 kda 2 ω 3 10 kda ω 10 kda ω 3 kda 3 ω 1 3 kda ω 3 kda ω 1 kda where ω 10 kda ω 3 kda and ω 1 kda represents the concentration of the naoh edta extractable total p in the components of 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively 2 4 solution 31p nmr spectroscopy the filtrate of each mw fraction was freeze dried to powder the solid samples were dissolved in a solvent prepared with 1 ml of 1m naoh 0 1 ml of deuterium oxide d2o and 0 1 ml of 1 m na2s and then treated by ultrasonification for 30 min next the mixture was kept for 24 hours at 4 c then it was filtered and placed in a 5 mm nmr tube solution 31p nmr spectra were analyzed at 161 98 mhz on a brukerav 600 mhz nmr spectrometer equpiped with a 5 mm broad band probe the spectrometer was configured with 12 microsecond acquisition time 5 hz spinning speed 5 second relaxation delay and 6 400 accumulated scans the peak areas were calculated by integrating over predetermined spectral regions using mestrenova 9 0 software mestrelab res co spain p species with different mws were identified by comparing their chemical shifts with those of standardized ones 85 h3po4 was used as an external standard each naoh edta extractable p components showed a distinct chemical shift orthophosphate orth p 5 to 7 ppm pyrophosphate pyro p 4 to 5 ppm orthophosphate monoesters mono p 3 to 6 ppm orthophosphate diester di p 1 to 2 5 ppm and phosphonate phos p 19 to 24 ppm cade menun et al 2005 wu and xing 2009 mono p can be further divided into α glycerophosphate α gly 4 9 ppm β glycerophosphate β gly 4 6 ppm d glucose 6 phosphate glu 6 5 14 to 5 34 ppm rna mononucleotides rna mnp 4 0 4 1 4 5 5 4 ppm inositol hexakisphosphate ihp6 4 7 4 4 4 2 3 9 ppm and other mono p components mclaren et al 2015b di p includes lipid p 0 to 2 ppm rna 1 9 to 0 2 ppm dna 0 36 ppm and other di p feng et al 2018 the relative abundance of each p species was calculated as its individual peak area divided by the total detected peak area 3 results and discussions 3 1 identification of sediment po composition as shown in fig 2 a the naoh edta extraction rate of the total p ranged between 23 and 63 45 12 7 on average which is similar to the results reported for sediments and soil samples shinohara et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the non extractable p such as refractory po e g phytate p and immobile pi e g ca bound p might not be bioavailable bowman and cole 1978 shinohara et al 2012 the naoh edta extractable p species including orth p mono p di p pyro p and phos p were determined in the raw sediments by 31p nmr peaks fig s1 di p was not detected at by py th dc sampling sites which could be attributed to its high bioreactivity di p can be easily transformed into orth p and mono p as a result of the degradation of enzyme and microorganisms as well as the chemical hydrolysis during the alkaline extraction pretreatment of 31p nmr makarov et al 2002 ahlgren et al 2006a shinohara et al 2012 the content of the naoh edta extractable p components in raw sediments as derived from nmr peak areas fig 2b showed a decreasing order orth p 66 95 of naoh edta total p mono p 1 30 di p 0 3 pyro p 0 1 phos p 0 0 5 with an average portion of 84 9 5 14 8 8 1 4 1 4 0 5 0 4 and 0 1 0 1 respectively compared with the naoh edta pi content the content of orth p 31p nmr all had higher values except for the sample at lg with a ratio of orth p 31p nmr over the naoh edta extractable pi ranging between 0 89 and 1 58 1 21 0 23 on average fig s2 in contrast the content of po i e sum of mono p di p and phos p by 31p nmr all had lower values than that of the naoh edta extractable po except for the samples at lg with the ratio of orth p over the naoh edta extractable po ranging between 0 20 and 1 23 0 59 0 35 on average these results indicate that the alkaline condition and the enrichment process of naoh edta extraction in the 31p nmr pretreatment would cause chemical degradation of po compounds since the chemical shift of 31p nmr spectra is sensitive to ph and salt lyophilization in naoh edta can hydrolyze po leadingg to the increase of orth p release from p compounds turner et al 2003a barbara et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 as a consequence characterizing po using 31p nmr method would underestimate the content of po in lake sediments several compounds namely α gly β gly rna mnp glu 6 and ihp6 were detected in the mono p range by 31p nmr fig 2c fig s3 α gly and β gly are usually recognized as the products from phospholipids degradation turner et al 2003a doolette et al 2009 he et al 2011 feng et al 2016 representing the labile mono p results showed that α gly only accounts for 0 0 7 0 4 0 1 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p and β gly accounts for 0 1 5 1 0 0 4 on average glu 6 is involved in biochemical reactions of pentose phosphate and glycolysis feng et al 2016 which can easily be utilized by microorganisms and accounts for 0 1 4 0 5 0 5 on average of the naoh edta total p rna mnp is generally considered as the products from rna degradation turner et al 2003a bünemann et al 2008 which occurs in sediments and water ahlgren et al 2006b reitzel et al 2007 results showed that rna mnp is the second dominating mono p form accounting for 0 3 9 1 3 1 2 5 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p in sediments consistent with the results reported in the study in lake kasumigaura where the mnp accounted for the largest portion of po in suspended particles shinohara et al 2016 ihp6 in sediments has been shown to be recalcitrant turner et al 2003b turner and weckström 2009 jørgensen et al 2011 and it is the dominant form of mono p accounting for 0 5 8 4 3 8 2 4 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p the content of mono p components followed an increasing order labile part α gly glu 6 β gly rna mnp non labile part ihp6 parts suggesting that the content of mono p components in sediments largely depends upon their bioreactivity 3 2 mw abundances and distribution of sediment po components mw is a key physicochemical property of organic molecules but the relationship between po compositional characteristics and their mw distribution in sediments is largely unknown the combination of mw ultrafiltration and 31p nmr method provides a mean to characterize the mw distribution of po components the naoh edta extractable total p was mainly in 1 kda portion with an average relative abundance of 62 15 fig 3 a fig s4a in comparison the relative abundance in 10 kda 3 10 kda and 1 3 kda fraction was 13 11 11 11 and 14 10 on average respectively showing little difference among the mw fractions these results indicated that the majority of the naoh edta extractable total p in sediments falls into the lmw fraction 1 kda similar to naoh edta extractable total p orth p was mainly contained in the lmw portion with 57 25 of orth p on average in 1 kda group fig 3b fig s4b the rest of the fractions accounted for 13 11 in 10 kda 11 8 in 3 10 kda and 19 27 in 1 3 kda respectively this is consistent with the results of venkatesan et al 2018 and yang et al 2021 who found 74 100 of orth p in lmw 400 600 da portion in lake water and that orth p was exclusively present in the 1 kda part in open bay water this is largely attributed to inorganic nutrient which can be consumend during bacterial degradation of the hmw fraction and then turn into the lmw fraction amon and benner 1996 pyro p commonly representing labile p can be utilized directly by aquatic organisms read et al 2014 or be easily transformed to orth p in the presence of alkaline phosphatase reitzel et al 2006 ahlgren et al 2006a in this study pyro p was concentrated in the hmw portion with the mw 10 kda portion accounting for 61 34 of the total pyro p fig 3e fig s4e the proportions of the 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda fractions were 11 31 20 27 and 7 10 respectively the causes for the pyro p distribution with the mw fractions might be two fold 1 the hmw ester or poly p can be easily hydrolyzed into pyro p since pyro p is the hydrolysis product of ester or poly p during the alkaline extraction procedure hupfer et al 1995 2 the hmw pyro p may have strong binding affinity on metal ions chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 thus forming more stable compounds in sediments the largest naoh edta extractable po group in all lakes was mono p fig 2b which mainly consists of sugar phophates mononucleotides phospholipids degradation production of ribouncleic acid rna and inositol p paytan et al 2003 turner et al 2003a b the abundance of mono p increased steadily with the decrease of mw i e 11 10 12 11 34 30 and 41 23 for the 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively this trend can be attributed to the bacterial degradation of the hmw mono p which leads to the breakdown of molecular chain and produces more mono p with small mw di p represents lipid dna and rna associated p makarov et al 2002 paraskova et al 2013 and is relatively homogeneous in mw distribution the percentage of di p in 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda is 10 13 8 15 and 16 22 respectively while the 3 10 kda portion reaches 33 35 among the sampling sites fig 3d fig s4d this trend indicates that the content of di p is independent of the mw this can be explained by the fact that di p is highly bioreactive since di p could be easily transformed to orth p and mono p ahlgren et al 2006a shinohara et al 2012 phos p is highly stable and resistant to chemical hydrolysis due to the c p bond suzumura et al 1998 turner et al 2002 therefore it was only concentrated in the hmw portion 10 kda 3 10 kda whereas none was detected in the lmw fractions 1 3 kda 1 kda fig 3f fig s4f phos p can be effectively integrated with metal ions showing high structural stability due to metal bond silbernagel et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 weng and zheng 2020 the strong binding affinity on metal ions in hmw fractions chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 enhanced the stability of hmw phos p and hence increased its abundance in sediments as shown in fig 4 and fig s5 the distribution of mono p species showed great variations with mws the nmr peaks representing α gly and glu 6 substances mainly appeared in the 10 kda and 3 10 kda fractions while were almost undetectable in the 1 3 kda and 1 kda ones the rna mnp and β gly species showed little dependence on mws whereas the amount of ihp6 increased with the increasing mw namely 2 5 2 4 3 8 6 8 4 2 3 9 and 6 7 4 7 mg kg 1 for the 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively ihp6 is easily sorbed onto metal ions and forms insoluble metal phytate turner and weckström 2009 jørgensen et al 2011 variations in ihp6 were closely related to simultaneous changes in amorphous metal oxides turner et al 2007 mcdowell et al 2007 therefore the strong binding affinity in higher mw chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 would favor insoluble metal phytate and thus reduces the accumulation of dissolved ihp6 with higher mw this explains the increase of ihp6 with decreasing mw the linkage between po components and mw distribution is important for further understanding the compositional characteristics of po in sediments and the subsequent assessment of its bioreactivity the overall trend of the mw distribution of po components showed a general pattern irrespective of the sample difference a clear dividing point in the mw distribution of po components can be seen in the 3 kda portion fig 5 the high bioreactive po species e g α gly β gly glu 6 di p showed a similar trend with mws in the sediments i e the relative abundance in the 3 kda portion was much higher than that in the 3 kda one such high percentage of hmw bioreactive po species in the sediments may be linked to the source characteristics microbial degradation and self assembly of dissolved organic molecules for example liberated or freshly photosynthesized dissolved organic molecules usually correspond to hmw materials benner and amon 2015 furthermore xu and guo 2018 observed a significant transformation of lmw 1 kda precursors into colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and microparticles 0 45 μm during microbial incubation kerner et al 2003 found that diffusion drives aggregation of low to high molecular mass dissolved organic carbon and further to larger micelle like microparticles for po refractory components ihp6 mainly existed in the 3 kda portion whereas phos p was rich in the 3 kda portion which could be ascribed to their metal binding characteristics as discussed in section 3 2 3 3 implications the characterization of po structure and composition is challenging but is a critical step for understanding the biogeochemical cycles of p different approaches were used to analyze size distribution components bioreactivity and fates of po venkatesan et al 2018 hurtarte et al 2020 kurek et al 2020 gao et al 2021 however very few studies have examined the molecular size dependent abundance and composition of po in sediments as a fundamental parameter mw influences the abundance and composition properties and thus alters the bioreactivity and fates of po here significant differences in mw distribution of different po components were observed in particular the abundance of high bioreactive po species e g α gly β gly glu 6 di p in the hmw fraction 3 kda was much higher than that of lmw 3 kda if self assembly made dissolved organic molecules more readily available to phagotrophic organisms xu and guo 2018 and if the hmw or colloidal ones were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts guo et al 2009 benner and amon 2015 the high percentage of α gly β gly glu 6 and di p in the hmw portion would highlight their high reactivity and confirm those assumptions from the perspective of mw fig 5 the results shown in this study therefore provide new evidence to explain the compositional heterogeneity and bioreactivity of sediment po from the perspective of mw our findings highlight the strong heterogeneity in molecular size chemical composition and bioreactivity of po in sediments previous studies mostly focused on the chemical transformations of po while little attention was paid to the molecular size transformation of po from the perspective of mw future studies should focus on investigating molecular size and compositional transformation of po to better understand its bioreactivity fate and environmental impact for example organic molecules can transform from the hmw fraction into the lmw one through disaggregation and biodegradation wang and guo 2001 santschi et al 2006 and then the lmw fraction is formed into hmw substances via colloidal pumping and self assembly santschi 2018 xu and guo 2018 studying the bioreactivity of po components in sediments with respect to different mws is another urgent issue to sum up understanding the relationship between po components and their mw distribution might offer new or even breakthrough insights about the biogeochemical cycle of p for this end new methods are required to better characterize po molecular composition in sediments 4 conclusions this study explored the compositional characteristics of po in sediments at molecular level by linking the mw distribution with different po components results showed that sediment po mainly consisted of mono p 14 8 8 of naoh edta extractable total p on average di p 1 4 1 4 and phos p 0 1 0 1 while the abundance of po was largely underestimated by using 31p nmr method some species of mono p were successfully identified and the content of these species followed a decreasing order as ihp6 rna mnp β gly glu 6 α gly which was largely dependent upon their bioreactivity a significant relationship between mw distribution and po components was observed despite the great differences among sediment samples for the refractory po components ihp6 was mainly rich in mw 3 kda while phos p was almost only detectable in the mw 3 kda which might be due to the metal binding affinities due to microbial degradation and self assembly the abundance of bioreactive po species α gly β gly glu 6 di p in hmw 3 kda portions were all higher than that of lmw ones 3 kda if the hmw or colloidal ones were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts the high percentage of α gly β gly glu

16206,organic phosphorus po plays a key role in eutrophication and ecological equilibrium in lake systems however characterizing the composition of po in lake sediments has been a bottleneck hindering further understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of po here multiple methods of 31p nmr spectroscopy and molecular weight mw ultrafiltration were combined to detect po composition characteristics from a novel angle in ten lake sediments of china the results showed that sediment po mainly consisted of monoester mono p 14 8 8 of the naoh edta total p on average diester di p 1 4 1 4 and phosphonate phos p 0 1 0 1 while the abundance of po was largely underestimated by 31p nmr methods some specific species of mono p were successfully determined and the contents of these species followed a decreasing order inositol hexakisphosphate ihp6 rna mononucleotides rna mnp β glycerophosphate β gly d glucose 6 phosphate glu 6 α glycerophosphate α gly which was largely dependent upon their bioreactivity a significant relationship between mw and po components was observed despite the great differences among sediment samples for refractory po components ihp6 was mainly rich in the mw 3 kda while phos p was almost only detected in the mw 3 kda which largely attributed to their metal binding affinities and characteristics the abundance of bioreactive po species α gly β gly glu 6 di p in high mw hmw 3 kda were all higher than that of low mw lmw 3 kda due to microbial degradation and self assembly if the hmw organic molecules were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts the high percentage of α gly β gly glu 6 and di p in the hmw portion would highlights their high reactivity from the perspective of mw these insights revealed the dynamics of the

lake eutrophication wu and wang 2017 horppila et al 2019 accurate estimation of internal p loading from sediments is important for water quality risk assessment and lake management rippey et al 2021 it has been widely recognized that internal p loading can trigger a positive feedback of lake eutrophication orihel et al 2017 tu et al 2021 in which the release of inorganic pi and the degradation of organic p po produce orthophosphate through chemical decomposition photodegradation and biomineralization processes søndergaard et al 2003 ahlgren et al 2011 li et al 2019 li et al 2021 however due to the complex composition of po and to the limitation of analytical technologies venkatesan et al 2018 the contribution of po to internal p loading has not been well understood as one of the major parts of p in the environment po is a complex mixture where p is integrated into organic matter and forms different fractions bedrock et al 1995 worsfold et al 2008 cade menun 2005 ding et al 2010 with an increasing attention on po and advanced analytical techniques a few studies have demonstrated that po are highly bioavailable zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 studies have reported that po could be utilized concurrently with inorganic p as a p source to aquatic ecosystems and its nutrient value is greater when total p supplies are limited björkman and karl 2003 ruttenberg and dyhrman 2005 although studies on the abundance composition circulation and characteristics of po have been widely investigated the structural and compositional characterization of po at molecular level remains missing thus restricting the estimation of po species that contribute to internal p loadings the complexity and lack of compositional information on po in sediments hampers our understanding of its bioreactivity fates and environmental implications among numerous analytical techniques for identifying the species of po compounds in sediments and soil ivanoff et al 1998 liu et al 2013 venkatesan et al 2018 hurtarte et al 2020 ni et al 2021 31p nmr spectroscopy is most frequently used due to its comprehensive and non destructive performance cade menun 2005 worsfold et al 2008 the 31p nmr spectroscopy method can identify specific po species including inositol phosphates sugar phosphates dna and rna fragments phospholipids phosphate esters etc wu and xing 2009 mclaren et al 2015a giles et al 2015 as a basic feature of dissolved organic molecules mw is usually closely related with their chemical compositions mclaren et al 2015b demonstrated that the speciation of po in soil have a great variation in mws hmw dissolved organic molecules usually have stronger bindings to metal ions than that of lmw ones lakshman et al 1993 christl and kretzschmar 2001 chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 and hence influence the bioreactivity of specific po components such as phosphonate and inositol hexaphosphate metal compounds mw is also an important factor influencing the bioreactivity of dissolved po in the environment studies have shown that the bulks of high mw hmw dissolved organic molecules are more bio reactive therefore can be more rapidly utilized by microbes than those with low mw lmw amon and benner 1994 arnosti et al 1994 amon and benner 1996 benner and amon 2015 hence studying the mw distribution of po composition might shed light on the internal mechanism about the bioreactivity of po in sediments sediment systems are of high heterogeneity in terms of the composition of po compounds specifically the compounds with different mws exhibit distinctive characteristics in content and abundance ged and boyer 2013 mclaren et al 2015b which in turn influence their reactivities and fates however current knowledge on the mw distribution for different components of po in sediments remains unclear thus there is an urgent need to explore the response of mw fraction to the composition of po in sediments in this study the naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta method was used to efficiently extract po cade menun and preston 1996 turner et al 2003a while 31p nmr and mw ultrafiltration were combined to explore the mw distribution characteristics of each identified po components using samples of ten lakes from the eastern plain and yunnan guizhou plateau of china additionally the plausible explanations for the mw distribution of po components and environmental implications were discussed this study is expected to provide further insights about the compositional characteristics of po at molecular level 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection the eastern plain and yunnan guizhou plateau in china possess a vast number of lakes most of which face eutrophication risks ten lakes from those regions were selected as the study sites see fig 1 among the selected lakes from the eastern plain some are located at middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and huai river others at lower reaches of yellow river and hai river or along the beijing hangzhou grand canal most of the lakes are shallow with the eutrophication being a major concern le et al 2010 lake baiyang id by sampling

plateau mainly located in the middle of the area where the lake dianchi dc 24 52 14 n 102 43 29 e lake yilonghu ylh 23 39 26 n 102 36 32 e lake erhai eh 25 40 5 88 n 100 13 58 8 e and lake lugu lg 27 42 44 n 100 46 50 e were selected whose trophic level index is 58 61 42 and 14 respectively overall these sampling sites are in remote areas with little influence from anthropogenic activities therefore they can represent the natural states of the lake environment in addition the selected lakes are characterized by distinctive climatic regimes as well as by the spatial heterogeneity in water depths and trophic levels analysis based on the samples of those lakes can better capture the general patterns in po s composition as well as mw distribution therefore enabling more general conclusions in total ten surface sediment samples from ten lakes were collected in august and september 2018 fig 1 at each sampling site the sediments were first obtained by a columnar sampler then the sediments from the bottom of the lakes down to a depth of 5 cm were collected into sealed dark plastic bags and kept at 4 c in laboratory the sediments were freeze dried and grounded through a 100 mesh 0 149 mm sieve after removing gravels and plant fragments 2 2 naoh edta extraction naoh edta extraction can provide a close estimate to the total extractable p facilitating the subsequent po characterization with 31p nmr spectroscopy cade menun and preston 1996 2 g dried sediments were extracted with 50 ml of sodium hydroxide ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid mixture 0 25 m naoh 25 mm edta at 25 c after 16 h of oscillation extracts were centrifuged at 5 000 r min for 15 min and then the supernatants were passed through a 0 45 μm glass filter keyilong experimental equipment co ltd tianjin china preheated for 3 h at 450 c a portion of the extract was used for mw ultrafiltration the rest were used to measure the content of the naoh edta extractable total p and the naoh edta extractable pi the naoh edta extractable total p was measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after digestion while the naoh edta extractable pi was direct measured by molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method without digestion the naoh edta extractable po was calculated as the difference between the naoh edta extractable total p and the naoh edta extractable pi the analysis of the total p content in sediment was performed following the european testing standards ruban et al 1999 the extraction rate with naoh edta was calculated as the naoh edta extractable total p divided by the total p in sediments 2 3 mw ultrafiltration the naoh edta extract was transferred to an ultrafiltration device model 8400 millipore corporation massachusetts usa containing 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda filtration membranes made of regenerated cellulose model ym millipore corporation the extract was successively passed through 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda filter membranes to reduce concentration difference which could affect the subsequent filtering processes the naoh edta extractable total p was divided into four mw groups after ultrafiltration zhang et al 2016 namely 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively each mw group was defined as follows 1 ω 10 kda ω raw ω 10 kda 2 ω 3 10 kda ω 10 kda ω 3 kda 3 ω 1 3 kda ω 3 kda ω 1 kda where ω 10 kda ω 3 kda and ω 1 kda represents the concentration of the naoh edta extractable total p in the components of 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively 2 4 solution 31p nmr spectroscopy the filtrate of each mw fraction was freeze dried to powder the solid samples were dissolved in a solvent prepared with 1 ml of 1m naoh 0 1 ml of deuterium oxide d2o and 0 1 ml of 1 m na2s and then treated by ultrasonification for 30 min next the mixture was kept for 24 hours at 4 c then it was filtered and placed in a 5 mm nmr tube solution 31p nmr spectra were analyzed at 161 98 mhz on a brukerav 600 mhz nmr spectrometer equpiped with a 5 mm broad band probe the spectrometer was configured with 12 microsecond acquisition time 5 hz spinning speed 5 second relaxation delay and 6 400 accumulated scans the peak areas were calculated by integrating over predetermined spectral regions using mestrenova 9 0 software mestrelab res co spain p species with different mws were identified by comparing their chemical shifts with those of standardized ones 85 h3po4 was used as an external standard each naoh edta extractable p components showed a distinct chemical shift orthophosphate orth p 5 to 7 ppm pyrophosphate pyro p 4 to 5 ppm orthophosphate monoesters mono p 3 to 6 ppm orthophosphate diester di p 1 to 2 5 ppm and phosphonate phos p 19 to 24 ppm cade menun et al 2005 wu and xing 2009 mono p can be further divided into α glycerophosphate α gly 4 9 ppm β glycerophosphate β gly 4 6 ppm d glucose 6 phosphate glu 6 5 14 to 5 34 ppm rna mononucleotides rna mnp 4 0 4 1 4 5 5 4 ppm inositol hexakisphosphate ihp6 4 7 4 4 4 2 3 9 ppm and other mono p components mclaren et al 2015b di p includes lipid p 0 to 2 ppm rna 1 9 to 0 2 ppm dna 0 36 ppm and other di p feng et al 2018 the relative abundance of each p species was calculated as its individual peak area divided by the total detected peak area 3 results and discussions 3 1 identification of sediment po composition as shown in fig 2 a the naoh edta extraction rate of the total p ranged between 23 and 63 45 12 7 on average which is similar to the results reported for sediments and soil samples shinohara et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the non extractable p such as refractory po e g phytate p and immobile pi e g ca bound p might not be bioavailable bowman and cole 1978 shinohara et al 2012 the naoh edta extractable p species including orth p mono p di p pyro p and phos p were determined in the raw sediments by 31p nmr peaks fig s1 di p was not detected at by py th dc sampling sites which could be attributed to its high bioreactivity di p can be easily transformed into orth p and mono p as a result of the degradation of enzyme and microorganisms as well as the chemical hydrolysis during the alkaline extraction pretreatment of 31p nmr makarov et al 2002 ahlgren et al 2006a shinohara et al 2012 the content of the naoh edta extractable p components in raw sediments as derived from nmr peak areas fig 2b showed a decreasing order orth p 66 95 of naoh edta total p mono p 1 30 di p 0 3 pyro p 0 1 phos p 0 0 5 with an average portion of 84 9 5 14 8 8 1 4 1 4 0 5 0 4 and 0 1 0 1 respectively compared with the naoh edta pi content the content of orth p 31p nmr all had higher values except for the sample at lg with a ratio of orth p 31p nmr over the naoh edta extractable pi ranging between 0 89 and 1 58 1 21 0 23 on average fig s2 in contrast the content of po i e sum of mono p di p and phos p by 31p nmr all had lower values than that of the naoh edta extractable po except for the samples at lg with the ratio of orth p over the naoh edta extractable po ranging between 0 20 and 1 23 0 59 0 35 on average these results indicate that the alkaline condition and the enrichment process of naoh edta extraction in the 31p nmr pretreatment would cause chemical degradation of po compounds since the chemical shift of 31p nmr spectra is sensitive to ph and salt lyophilization in naoh edta can hydrolyze po leadingg to the increase of orth p release from p compounds turner et al 2003a barbara et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 as a consequence characterizing po using 31p nmr method would underestimate the content of po in lake sediments several compounds namely α gly β gly rna mnp glu 6 and ihp6 were detected in the mono p range by 31p nmr fig 2c fig s3 α gly and β gly are usually recognized as the products from phospholipids degradation turner et al 2003a doolette et al 2009 he et al 2011 feng et al 2016 representing the labile mono p results showed that α gly only accounts for 0 0 7 0 4 0 1 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p and β gly accounts for 0 1 5 1 0 0 4 on average glu 6 is involved in biochemical reactions of pentose phosphate and glycolysis feng et al 2016 which can easily be utilized by microorganisms and accounts for 0 1 4 0 5 0 5 on average of the naoh edta total p rna mnp is generally considered as the products from rna degradation turner et al 2003a bünemann et al 2008 which occurs in sediments and water ahlgren et al 2006b reitzel et al 2007 results showed that rna mnp is the second dominating mono p form accounting for 0 3 9 1 3 1 2 5 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p in sediments consistent with the results reported in the study in lake kasumigaura where the mnp accounted for the largest portion of po in suspended particles shinohara et al 2016 ihp6 in sediments has been shown to be recalcitrant turner et al 2003b turner and weckström 2009 jørgensen et al 2011 and it is the dominant form of mono p accounting for 0 5 8 4 3 8 2 4 on average of the naoh edta extractable total p the content of mono p components followed an increasing order labile part α gly glu 6 β gly rna mnp non labile part ihp6 parts suggesting that the content of mono p components in sediments largely depends upon their bioreactivity 3 2 mw abundances and distribution of sediment po components mw is a key physicochemical property of organic molecules but the relationship between po compositional characteristics and their mw distribution in sediments is largely unknown the combination of mw ultrafiltration and 31p nmr method provides a mean to characterize the mw distribution of po components the naoh edta extractable total p was mainly in 1 kda portion with an average relative abundance of 62 15 fig 3 a fig s4a in comparison the relative abundance in 10 kda 3 10 kda and 1 3 kda fraction was 13 11 11 11 and 14 10 on average respectively showing little difference among the mw fractions these results indicated that the majority of the naoh edta extractable total p in sediments falls into the lmw fraction 1 kda similar to naoh edta extractable total p orth p was mainly contained in the lmw portion with 57 25 of orth p on average in 1 kda group fig 3b fig s4b the rest of the fractions accounted for 13 11 in 10 kda 11 8 in 3 10 kda and 19 27 in 1 3 kda respectively this is consistent with the results of venkatesan et al 2018 and yang et al 2021 who found 74 100 of orth p in lmw 400 600 da portion in lake water and that orth p was exclusively present in the 1 kda part in open bay water this is largely attributed to inorganic nutrient which can be consumend during bacterial degradation of the hmw fraction and then turn into the lmw fraction amon and benner 1996 pyro p commonly representing labile p can be utilized directly by aquatic organisms read et al 2014 or be easily transformed to orth p in the presence of alkaline phosphatase reitzel et al 2006 ahlgren et al 2006a in this study pyro p was concentrated in the hmw portion with the mw 10 kda portion accounting for 61 34 of the total pyro p fig 3e fig s4e the proportions of the 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda fractions were 11 31 20 27 and 7 10 respectively the causes for the pyro p distribution with the mw fractions might be two fold 1 the hmw ester or poly p can be easily hydrolyzed into pyro p since pyro p is the hydrolysis product of ester or poly p during the alkaline extraction procedure hupfer et al 1995 2 the hmw pyro p may have strong binding affinity on metal ions chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 thus forming more stable compounds in sediments the largest naoh edta extractable po group in all lakes was mono p fig 2b which mainly consists of sugar phophates mononucleotides phospholipids degradation production of ribouncleic acid rna and inositol p paytan et al 2003 turner et al 2003a b the abundance of mono p increased steadily with the decrease of mw i e 11 10 12 11 34 30 and 41 23 for the 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively this trend can be attributed to the bacterial degradation of the hmw mono p which leads to the breakdown of molecular chain and produces more mono p with small mw di p represents lipid dna and rna associated p makarov et al 2002 paraskova et al 2013 and is relatively homogeneous in mw distribution the percentage of di p in 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda is 10 13 8 15 and 16 22 respectively while the 3 10 kda portion reaches 33 35 among the sampling sites fig 3d fig s4d this trend indicates that the content of di p is independent of the mw this can be explained by the fact that di p is highly bioreactive since di p could be easily transformed to orth p and mono p ahlgren et al 2006a shinohara et al 2012 phos p is highly stable and resistant to chemical hydrolysis due to the c p bond suzumura et al 1998 turner et al 2002 therefore it was only concentrated in the hmw portion 10 kda 3 10 kda whereas none was detected in the lmw fractions 1 3 kda 1 kda fig 3f fig s4f phos p can be effectively integrated with metal ions showing high structural stability due to metal bond silbernagel et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 weng and zheng 2020 the strong binding affinity on metal ions in hmw fractions chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 enhanced the stability of hmw phos p and hence increased its abundance in sediments as shown in fig 4 and fig s5 the distribution of mono p species showed great variations with mws the nmr peaks representing α gly and glu 6 substances mainly appeared in the 10 kda and 3 10 kda fractions while were almost undetectable in the 1 3 kda and 1 kda ones the rna mnp and β gly species showed little dependence on mws whereas the amount of ihp6 increased with the increasing mw namely 2 5 2 4 3 8 6 8 4 2 3 9 and 6 7 4 7 mg kg 1 for the 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively ihp6 is easily sorbed onto metal ions and forms insoluble metal phytate turner and weckström 2009 jørgensen et al 2011 variations in ihp6 were closely related to simultaneous changes in amorphous metal oxides turner et al 2007 mcdowell et al 2007 therefore the strong binding affinity in higher mw chen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 would favor insoluble metal phytate and thus reduces the accumulation of dissolved ihp6 with higher mw this explains the increase of ihp6 with decreasing mw the linkage between po components and mw distribution is important for further understanding the compositional characteristics of po in sediments and the subsequent assessment of its bioreactivity the overall trend of the mw distribution of po components showed a general pattern irrespective of the sample difference a clear dividing point in the mw distribution of po components can be seen in the 3 kda portion fig 5 the high bioreactive po species e g α gly β gly glu 6 di p showed a similar trend with mws in the sediments i e the relative abundance in the 3 kda portion was much higher than that in the 3 kda one such high percentage of hmw bioreactive po species in the sediments may be linked to the source characteristics microbial degradation and self assembly of dissolved organic molecules for example liberated or freshly photosynthesized dissolved organic molecules usually correspond to hmw materials benner and amon 2015 furthermore xu and guo 2018 observed a significant transformation of lmw 1 kda precursors into colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and microparticles 0 45 μm during microbial incubation kerner et al 2003 found that diffusion drives aggregation of low to high molecular mass dissolved organic carbon and further to larger micelle like microparticles for po refractory components ihp6 mainly existed in the 3 kda portion whereas phos p was rich in the 3 kda portion which could be ascribed to their metal binding characteristics as discussed in section 3 2 3 3 implications the characterization of po structure and composition is challenging but is a critical step for understanding the biogeochemical cycles of p different approaches were used to analyze size distribution components bioreactivity and fates of po venkatesan et al 2018 hurtarte et al 2020 kurek et al 2020 gao et al 2021 however very few studies have examined the molecular size dependent abundance and composition of po in sediments as a fundamental parameter mw influences the abundance and composition properties and thus alters the bioreactivity and fates of po here significant differences in mw distribution of different po components were observed in particular the abundance of high bioreactive po species e g α gly β gly glu 6 di p in the hmw fraction 3 kda was much higher than that of lmw 3 kda if self assembly made dissolved organic molecules more readily available to phagotrophic organisms xu and guo 2018 and if the hmw or colloidal ones were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts guo et al 2009 benner and amon 2015 the high percentage of α gly β gly glu 6 and di p in the hmw portion would highlight their high reactivity and confirm those assumptions from the perspective of mw fig 5 the results shown in this study therefore provide new evidence to explain the compositional heterogeneity and bioreactivity of sediment po from the perspective of mw our findings highlight the strong heterogeneity in molecular size chemical composition and bioreactivity of po in sediments previous studies mostly focused on the chemical transformations of po while little attention was paid to the molecular size transformation of po from the perspective of mw future studies should focus on investigating molecular size and compositional transformation of po to better understand its bioreactivity fate and environmental impact for example organic molecules can transform from the hmw fraction into the lmw one through disaggregation and biodegradation wang and guo 2001 santschi et al 2006 and then the lmw fraction is formed into hmw substances via colloidal pumping and self assembly santschi 2018 xu and guo 2018 studying the bioreactivity of po components in sediments with respect to different mws is another urgent issue to sum up understanding the relationship between po components and their mw distribution might offer new or even breakthrough insights about the biogeochemical cycle of p for this end new methods are required to better characterize po molecular composition in sediments 4 conclusions this study explored the compositional characteristics of po in sediments at molecular level by linking the mw distribution with different po components results showed that sediment po mainly consisted of mono p 14 8 8 of naoh edta extractable total p on average di p 1 4 1 4 and phos p 0 1 0 1 while the abundance of po was largely underestimated by using 31p nmr method some species of mono p were successfully identified and the content of these species followed a decreasing order as ihp6 rna mnp β gly glu 6 α gly which was largely dependent upon their bioreactivity a significant relationship between mw distribution and po components was observed despite the great differences among sediment samples for the refractory po components ihp6 was mainly rich in mw 3 kda while phos p was almost only detectable in the mw 3 kda which might be due to the metal binding affinities due to microbial degradation and self assembly the abundance of bioreactive po species α gly β gly glu 6 di p in hmw 3 kda portions were all higher than that of lmw ones 3 kda if the hmw or colloidal ones were biologically and chemically more reactive than its lmw counterparts the high percentage of α gly β gly glu

16207,dissolved organic matter dom plays a crucial role in the coastal carbon cycle however eutrophication induced algal blooms and lateral transport from connected tidal marshes may significantly affect dom cycling which remains poorly understood by combining a suite of bulk and optical techniques and the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry we determined dom concentration and composition along two typical river estuary transects namely liao and daliao rivers northeast china with contrasting eutrophic state and distribution of tidal marshes the daliao river is characterized by a higher eutrophication degree and is surrounded with lower reed coverage than the liao river compared to the liao river significantly higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations were observed in the daliao river where higher stable carbon isotope δ13c values and protein like fluorescent components characterized relatively higher autochthonous dom further molecular analysis revealed higher peptide and sugar like compounds but lower isomeric percentages of several molecular formulas in the daliao river suggesting higher molecular lability but lower isomeric complexity than the liao river associations between optical and molecular signatures among all dom samples revealed that a red shifted humic like c3 component was significantly correlated with molecular formulas with lower molecular weight and aromaticity and higher h c indicating that c3 was likely a result of phytoplankton production coupled with further heterotrophic processing moreover we found that reed marshes could introduce to both rivers a series of carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds highly unsaturated compounds and polyphenols with high molecular weight and low h c this study suggests that eutrophication and reed marsh affect the dom quality and can be a potential source of recalcitrant dom compounds to coastal rivers and estuaries which warrants further investigations considering the increasing worldwide eutrophication and sea level rise in coastal delta environments graphical abstract image graphical

introduction dissolved organic matter dom a complex mixture of organic compounds represents one of the largest reactive reservoirs of carbon on earth as important interfaces between land and ocean

driven by the interplay of watershed land use geomorphology hydrology microbial activity and photodegradation shaping its quality and quantity stubbins et al 2010 jaffé et al 2012 d he et al 2020 both biodegradation and photodegradation have a profound influence on the dom composition during its passage from freshwater to marine environments with reactive compounds e g proteins and sugars being

benner and kaiser 2011 seidel et al 2015 ward et al 2017 d he et al 2020 pang et al 2021 other factors such as geomorphology and watershed land use also affect dom dynamics in coastal rivers with low elevation lu et al 2013 for instance the coastal river may inherit signatures from its connected wetlands by lateral transport and the delta s low elevation likely further facilitates the lateral transport process liu et al 2020 with increased anthropogenic activities due to population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification coastal river networks are subjected to concomitant eutrophication and algal blooms martínez et al 2007 canuel and hardison 2016 paerl et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 understanding the effect of eutrophication induced algal blooms on the composition and

quantitative characterization of chromophoric and fluorescent fractions of dom cdom and fdom respectively providing valuable information on sources and transformation of dom in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2014 although algal blooms usually introduce labile dom as evidenced by high protein like fluorescence meng et al 2013 recent studies have noticed the in situ accumulation of refractory humic like dom during algal blooms in estuaries asmala et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 therefore the dom cycling within eutrophic estuaries is still not well understood canuel

g wagner et al 2015a however to the best of our knowledge very few studies have focused on the molecular complexity of dom in eutrophic coastal rivers assessing how eutrophication affects the dom cycling in coastal rivers is critical for further foreseeing dom cycling with an expected increase of future anthropogenic and climatic perturbations parel et al 2018 the liao and daliao rivers in china flow into liaodong bay of bohai sea a semi enclosed temperate chinese water body located close to the most inner part of bohai sea both coastal rivers are subjected to a different degree of eutrophication liu et al 2020 with water retention time of up to 2 months based on numerical modeling wang 2013 these two rivers serve as a typical case to track how eutrophication affects dom cycling meanwhile the liao river is connected with natural reed wetlands whereas the daliao river is mainly surrounded by rice paddies in this context the objectives are to i compare the differences in quantity quality and sources of dom between the liao and daliao rivers and ii evaluate how eutrophication and watershed characteristics e g land coverage and morphology would affect dom composition at the molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the liao and daliao rivers are located on the liao river delta lrd which has a catchment area of ca 219 600 km2 fig 1 the lrd is the principal industrial base in the northeast part of china with oil chemical and steel factories being distributed to several big cities such as fushun shenyang panjin and yingkou with the rapid economic development in the past ca fifty years this lrd has been undergoing a significant increase in population and nutrient load gao et al 2014 the concentrations of po4 3 and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din all increased more than 10 times in the past 15 years zhang et al 2016 and some of the rivers in lrd including daliao river were classified as grade iv based on the national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 recent water quality monitoring reports revealed that both rivers were subject to anthropogenic influences including agricultural intensification and domestic and industrial wastewater soa 2013 although both rivers have similar biogeographic backgrounds the water eutrophication status is more severe in the daliao river than the liao river ma et al 2015 thus the lrd serves as an ideal setting for examining how anthropogenic disturbances e g eutrophication and watershed characteristics reed wetland and rice paddies affect the dom cycling in coastal rivers 2 2 sample collection and in situ measurements to minimize the difference in allochthonous terrestrial dom from upstream and capture the eutrophication status the sampling was performed

optical properties the liao river dom had significantly higher averaged suva254 and hix values whereas the daliao river dom had significantly higher averaged bix and fi values table s2 similar eems were observed for the liao river dom in which excitation emission usually maximize at 252 422 nm whereas eems of the dom from the daliao river usually maximized at 252 475 nm and 273 288 314 333 nm and a considerable spatial variation was observed fig s2 the apparent difference in eems was further illustrated by parafac analysis see si for details and six fluorescent components were obtained including four humic like components c1 to c4 and two protein like components c5 and c6 fig 3 c1 showed an excitation emission ex em maximum at 252 303 402 nm c2 at 273 482 nm c3 at 252 484 nm c4 at 261 354 422 nm c5 at 288 333 nm and c6 at 273 314 nm fig 3 c5 tryptophan like and c6 tyrosine like showed higher relative abundances in the daliao river with the maximum at the dl1 and dl2 sites table

daliao river than the liao river fig 3 3 3 molecular composition of dom as determined by ft icr ms and im q tof lcms between 4441 and 5637 molecular formulas were identified in each dom sample with a mass range from 177 to 650 da table 2 fig s3 no apparent trends of dom molecular diversity were observed from the upstream to the river mouth in both rivers table 2 a total of 9491 unique molecular formulas were identified across the whole sample set in which the numbers of cho chon chos and chons formulas were 3574 3728 1600 and 589 respectively meanwhile the number of common formulas that were detected in all samples is only 2712 in which cho chon chos and chons formulas were 1256 1133 286 and 37 respectively a sharp difference between the liao and daliao rivers was observed regarding the number of molecular formulas which was also evidenced by the van krevelen diagram plot of molecular formulae o c to h c ratios figs s4 s5 significant differences were observed for most molecular parameters between the liao and daliao rivers fig 4 the averaged h c was higher in the daliao river whereas averaged o c was higher in the liao river fig 4 significantly higher averaged relative abundances of chos and chons formulas were observed in the daliao river than in the liao river table 2 further examination revealed that some of the s containing formulas were likely associated with a major class of surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates las and dialkyl tetralin sulfonates dats gonsior et al 2011 the s containing formulas decreased gradually from upstream to the river mouth in both rivers in both rivers highly unsaturated compounds represent 70 by intensity whereas the black carbon like compound group only represents 0 5 of all detected compounds table 3 higher relative intensities of polyphenol and cram formulas were observed in the liao river table 3 the relative contribution of t peaks ranged from 2 6 to 3 3 and 2 3 to 2 8 in the liao and daliao rivers respectively higher relative abundances of t peaks were observed in the liao river than the daliao river the averaged relative abundance of black carbon like compounds was higher in the liao river higher mlbl and relative abundances of peptide and sugar like formulas were detected in the daliao river fig 4 within the freshwater sites of both rivers sites lh2 5 dl4 adjacent to reed wetlands were characterized by lower h c lower unsaturated aliphatic compounds but higher ai dbe polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds and cram than those of the sites surrounded by rice paddies lh1 and dl1 3 fig 5 fig s6 the unique formulas that were present at locations adjacent to reed wetlands but not detected at sites surrounded by rice paddies lh1 or dl1 3 and at sites affected by marine inputs lh6 dl5 and dl6 were scanned out fig 5 the numbers of these potential reed wetland related molecular formulas were from 420 to 775 in the liao river and 435 in the daliao river fig 5e the averaged h c values of these reed wetland related molecular formulas were significantly lower o c ai and mw were significantly higher than that of the overall dom from the sites surrounded by reed wetlands fig 5a

out and visualized by van krevelen diagram fig 5e these molecular formulas were mainly classified as cram and or highly unsaturated compounds presenting lower h c but higher o c ai and mw fig 5a d considering an individual dom molecular formula could have several structural isomers isomeric information and variations on several molecular formulas were assessed through im ms lu et al 2018 as a result the isomeric percentage calculated as number of different formulas possessing isomer total number of different formulas 100 of dom ranged from 8 2 to 14 8 ave 12 6 2 5 and 4 0 to 9 5 ave 6 6 2

analysis using ft icr ms based parameters as loadings pca yielded three separate groups likely corresponded to the dom source and sample background including group a high salinity 11 3 samples of both rivers lh6 dl5 and dl6 the group b low salinity 1 8 samples of the liao river and the group c low salinity 1 3 samples of the daliao river with high autochthonous inputs fig 7 pc1 separates samples mainly by eutrophication status autochthonous inputs pc2 differentiates samples by salinity terrestrial vs marine inputs brackish samples lh6 dl5 and dl6 were separated from freshwater samples 4 discussion 4 1 eutrophication serves as a dominant factor affecting dom chemistry anthropogenic nutrient inputs are causing increased eutrophication and algal blooms in coastal areas cloern 2001 in this context the accumulation and decomposition of phytoplankton is an essential source of dom usually leading to a positive correlation between doc and chla concentrations in coastal waters rochelle newall and fisher 2002 the chla and doc concentrations and δ13c values of dom in both the liao and daliao rivers are higher than most of the world large rivers with less degree of eutrophication such as the amazon river delaware river and chinese coastal rivers such as the yangtze river and the pearl river he et al 2019 fig s1 indicating relatively more autochthonous input of dom in both the liao and daliao rivers because autochthonous inputs of doc from bacteria and phytoplankton 23 were usually more enriched in 13c than that of allochthonous sources from terrestrial c3 plants 27 bianchi and canuel 2011 the mlbl values in both the liao and daliao rivers are higher than the pearl river he et al 2019 and the yangtze river zhou et al 2021 in china the pca further suggests that eutrophication related autochthonous input is the most dominant controlling factor leading to differences in dom chemistry between the liao and daliao rivers which is also supported by the significant p 0 05 negative correlation between pc1 score and tsi fig s7 considering that rice paddies surround the daliao river high erosion rates or artificial drainage channels accompanied agricultural runoff likely aid the mobilization and transport of soil derived dom resulting in higher quantities of humic high mw and aromatic dom to the river graeber et al 2012 however this is not the case observed here instead higher mlbl values higher relative abundances of peptide and sugar like formulas and more aliphatic signature higher h c of dom in the daliao river suggested relatively more autochthonous and labile input of dom in the daliao river than the liao river in agreement with the higher chla concentrations and abundance of protein like fluorescence obtained from prrafac figs 2 4 moreover the im ms results revealed a significantly much lower isomer percentage in dom from the daliao river than the liao river and previously investigated texas rivers fig 6 and gulf of mexico samples ca 11 to 22 of esi negative mode lu et al 2021 further suggesting less diverse biochemical pathways and higher relative contributions of autochthonous dom in the daliao river liu and lu 2019 this higher autochthonous input associated lower isomer percentage of dom is consistent with a previous study at a tributary of the yangtze river d he et al 2020 longer water residence time and bloom of algae caused by heavy loads of nutrients instead could be the principal factors contributing to the stronger autochthonous signature of dom in the daliao river than that of the liao river zhang et al 2016 in contrast the liao river may inherit relatively more terrestrial derived dom from soils or reed wetlands due to lateral transport discussed in section 4 3 the daliao river is characterized by significantly higher relative abundances of chos and chons formulas than the liao river abundant s containing formulas 47 to 56 by intensity with most of them being unsaturated aliphatic and peptide like formulae have been observed in the phytoplankton derived dom pool mangal et al 2016 s containing formulas were also detected in natural ecosystems such as a subtropical coastal wetland and soil and sediment pore waters of the continental shelf and marine systems likely resulting from the early diagenetic sulfurization of cho formulas schmidt et al 2009 2017 lu et al 2020 the chos formulas detected in this study include a series of surfactant like formulas gonsior et al 2011 melendez perez et al 2016 and are characterized by a wide range of h c and o c values fig s5c suggesting both algal and anthropogenic e g sewage inputs wagner et al 2015b 4 2 phytoplankton derived humic like fluorescence and its molecular signature linking optical and molecular properties to further constrain the sources of dom in coastal rivers the associations between optical and molecular properties were investigated which have been studied in several aquatic ecosystems such as a drinking water reservoir herzsprung et al 2012 boreal rivers stubbins et al 2014 and lakes kellerman et al 2015 the open ocean martínez pérez et al 2017 and a subtropical coastal wetland wagner et al 2015a here the optical properties typical optical indices and parafac components represented a part of the molecular formulas up to 2026 about 35 by relative intensity figs s8 s9 c1 c2 and c4 correlated broadly with molecular families with higher o c higher ai and lower h c whereas c5 and c6 correlated with molecular families with lower o c lower ai and higher h c table 3 figs s8 s10 table s3 c1 and c4 correlated with molecular formulas with the highest averaged molecular weight mw 420 da whereas c5 correlated with molecular formulas with the lowest averaged mw 344 da optical indices such as suva254 and hix were positively correlated with a terrestrial derived group of compounds enriched in aromatic formulas e g higher mw lower h c and more aromatic signature fig s9 table s4 which are photoreactive and quickly degrade when exposed to sunlight stubbins et al 2010 the fi index broadly represents autochthonous pools of dom associated with microbial activity was found to associate with unsaturated aliphatic and peptide like formulas which are bio labile table 3 figs s8 s9 therefore optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms generally agree in both rivers although both optical and molecular parameters suggested relatively higher autochthonous dom inputs in the daliao river than the liao river the averaged relative abundance of humic like c3 component is significantly higher in the daliao river the red shifted humic like c3 component with a longer emission wavelength is likely attributed to the diagenetic transformation of the original fluorophores with relatively lower emission wavelength due to microbial processing burdige et al 2004 phytoplankton derived organic matter could directly result in the formation of unstructured humic like cdom fluorescence facilitated by aggregation and microbial processing of precursor particulate organic matter pom biomolecules containing discrete yet unidentified fluorophores during a cultural study kinsey et al 2018 recent field observations suggested that algal blooms likely contribute in situ humic like fdom in coastal oceans kwon et al 2018 the underlying reasons could be the positive priming effect preferential degradation of refractory dom by addition of labile dom due to the labile algal dom input which increases the reworking of dom by the heterotrophic activity of microbes bianchi 2011 linking molecular signature with optical proxies revealed that c3 is positively correlated with formulas with more aliphatic signature higher h c than other humic like components c1 c2 and c4 figs s8 s10 considering large watersheds with a low elevation gradient tend to have long water residence times and flow paths that allow extensive dom transformation by heterotrophic microbes lambert et al 2015 c3 is likely originated from phytoplankton and subsequently reworked by heterotrophic processing burdige et al 2004 which is further supported by the significantly p 0 05 positive correlation between chla concentrations and the abundances of c3 fig s11 asmala et al 2018 observed the in situ accumulation of refractory compounds in coastal environments due to eutrophication a recent cultural study suggests that 60 days of microbial processing of phytoplankton derived photosynthate could significantly contribute to humic like molecules with recalcitrant signatures zheng et al 2019 therefore we speculate that the formation of this phytoplankton derived humic like component may serve as a potential source of refractory dom transported to the coastal ocean jiao et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 4 3 tidal marsh and marine inputs contribute to changes in dom chemistry the transport of dom from watershed to rivers is facilitated by a pronounced river and landscape connectivity in the low gradient area with extensive wetland cover fig 1 austnes et al 2010 in this context the lateral input of tidal marsh reed wetlands here could contribute to the dom pool in rivers evidenced by the spatial distribution of dom composition figs 5 7 fig s6 for instance lh1 is surrounded by rice paddies whereas lh2 to lh5 is connected with reed wetlands fig 1 the δ13c values were much lower for lh2 to lh5 than lh1 the δ13c values of reed tissues in the lrd are from 25 8 to 25 1 liu et al 2020 which are higher than rice plant tissues in lrd 29 5 to 26 8 and most terrestrial plants about 29 medeiros et al 2016 the increase of δ13c from lh1 to lh2 could be caused by the dom input from reed wetlands lh4 showed the highest δ13c values and corresponded with the highest spm concentration table 1 also suggesting the input of reed wetland material to the liao river similar evidence was observed for the daliao river where the highest δ13c value and spm concentration were observed at dl4 table 1 ft icr ms further suggested the input from reed wetlands to both rivers both lh5 and dl4 showed the highest relative intensity of polyphenol like formulas in each river fig s6 therefore the lateral transport caused the addition of dom derived from salt marsh macrophytes or salt marsh sediments due to leaching to the connected rivers which is more pronounced during low hydroperiod and the succession stage of the reed plants during our sampling period schiebel et al 2019 lu et al 2020 dl5 dl6 and lh6 samples at pc2 all show positive scores fig 7 separating them from all the freshwater sites suggesting that marine inputs also serve as a significant factor affecting dom chemistry in particular these three sites were characterized by higher δ13c values lower relative intensities of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds than those of the freshwater sites tables 1 and 3 considering the low elevation of lrd c a 0 5 m and high amplitudes of tides up to c a 4 m the marine dom is easily introduced to these locations through tides wang 2013 therefore in addition to the eutrophication which plays the dominant control to dom chemistry reed marsh and tides induced marine water intrusion also contribute to the changes in dom composition in the liao and daliao rivers 4 4 current limitations and implications for dom cycling in coastal rivers there are still some limitations in this case study in particular we only performed investigations in november late fall to early winter due to the following reasons i the wetland vegetation especially the reed will form more detritus and should contribute significant organic matter to the estuaries as observed in the yellow river delta zhang et al 2020 ii the river discharge is significantly lower in fall and winter than in summer leading to shallower water for both rivers therefore during the high tide period the tide induced water inundation may facilitate organic matter release from the surrounding reed wetlands we suspect the sampling time in this study may better capture the apparent signal derived from wetland vegetation especially the reed however more samplings biomass and water samples are needed to better constrain the seasonal variability of dom chemistry and the underlying controlling factors eutrophication has been a global concern affecting estuarine ecosystems worldwide le moal et al 2019 estuaries with low riverine inputs discharge of allochthonous carbon and high inputs of inorganic nutrients may act as reactors where autochthonous dom input dominates over the allochthonous markager et al 2011 staehr et al 2018 dom from different sources with different compositions can be more or less susceptible to microbial and chemical degradation and processing obernosterer and benner 2004 if projections of eutrophication are confirmed to continue with industry and economy development diaz et al 2011 the present analysis suggests that dom composition will likely have a more aliphatic character in the future moreover variations in dom composition due to the increase of eutrophication may act together with other factors e g changes in water residence time light availability and land use to influence biological and abiotic processing in estuaries for instance autochthonous dom is typically considered highly bioavailable and expected to be utilized rapidly in the microbial loop hopkinson et al 1998 which will further affect or prime the processing of the whole dom pool including the refractory part in estuaries bianchi 2011 although the analyses are restricted to the lrd it is reasonable to expect that similar changes could be observed in eutrophic estuaries that experience similar conditions of geomorphology and hydrology for example the yellow river delta and pearl river delta in china and the gulf of mexico in america and in other areas worldwide our study links the dom cycling in coastal river systems to eutrophication land coverage and watershed morphology since riverine fluxes of dom will increase in the future based on numerous modeling studies canuel and hardison 2016 a further basin scale understanding of dom spatiotemporal dynamics in coastal rivers that drain into ecologically significant estuaries is needed to mitigate the influence of future climatic and anthropogenic stressors on dom cycling from the landscape to coastal environments in the context of the global c budget mccluney et al 2014 canuel et al 2016 5 conclusion the optical and molecular composition of dom along two coastal rivers with different extent of eutrophication status and coverage of coastal wetlands was compared the molecular composition information and further principal component analysis showed significant potential in grouping the sampling sites according to the similarity in the dom composition which made it possible to identify the areas of most significant impact by in situ autochthonous inputs and lateral transport from salt marshes increases in algal blooms due to anthropogenic nutrient input may increase the autochthonous production of dom and the relative importance of autochthonous dom compared to that of allochthonous dom since autochthonous dom is usually very bio labile it may affect the processing of the whole dom along the river to ocean continuum more importantly with the low elevation of delta and high amplitudes of tides the reed wetland also contributes a series of formulas with high molecular weight and aromaticity but low h c to the rivers through the lateral transport complicating the dom cycling from the river to estuary continuum considering the substantial heterogeneity of dom composition in two rivers connected with coastal oceans and increase of riverine fluxes will likely increase in the future improving the understanding of watershed level heterogeneity is critical in addition considering eutrophic estuaries with similar conditions of geomorphology and hydrology are widely distributed in the world further studies are

16207,dissolved organic matter dom plays a crucial role in the coastal carbon cycle however eutrophication induced algal blooms and lateral transport from connected tidal marshes may significantly affect dom cycling which remains poorly understood by combining a suite of bulk and optical techniques and the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry we determined dom concentration and composition along two typical river estuary transects namely liao and daliao rivers northeast china with contrasting eutrophic state and distribution of tidal marshes the daliao river is characterized by a higher eutrophication degree and is surrounded with lower reed coverage than the liao river compared to the liao river significantly higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations were observed in the daliao river where higher stable carbon isotope δ13c values and protein like fluorescent components characterized relatively higher autochthonous dom further molecular analysis revealed higher peptide and sugar like compounds but lower isomeric percentages of several molecular formulas in the daliao river suggesting higher molecular lability but lower isomeric complexity than the liao river associations between optical and molecular signatures among all dom samples revealed that a red shifted humic like c3 component was significantly correlated with molecular formulas with lower molecular weight and aromaticity and higher h c indicating that c3 was likely a result of phytoplankton production coupled with further heterotrophic processing moreover we found that reed marshes could introduce to both rivers a series of carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds highly unsaturated compounds and polyphenols with high molecular weight and low h c this study suggests that eutrophication and reed marsh affect the dom quality and can be a potential source of recalcitrant dom compounds to coastal rivers and estuaries which warrants further investigations considering the increasing worldwide eutrophication and sea level rise in coastal delta environments graphical abstract image graphical

driven by the interplay of watershed land use geomorphology hydrology microbial activity and photodegradation shaping its quality and quantity stubbins et al 2010 jaffé et al 2012 d he et al 2020 both

benner and kaiser 2011 seidel et al 2015 ward et al 2017 d he et al 2020 pang et al 2021 other factors such as geomorphology and watershed land use also affect dom dynamics in coastal rivers with low elevation lu et al 2013 for instance the coastal river may inherit signatures from its connected wetlands by lateral transport and the delta s low elevation likely further facilitates the lateral transport process liu et al 2020 with increased anthropogenic activities due to population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification coastal river networks are subjected to concomitant eutrophication and algal blooms martínez et al 2007 canuel and hardison 2016 paerl et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 understanding the effect of eutrophication induced algal blooms on the composition and

quantitative characterization of chromophoric and fluorescent fractions of dom cdom and fdom respectively providing valuable information on sources and transformation of dom in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2014 although algal blooms usually introduce labile dom as evidenced by high protein like fluorescence meng et al 2013 recent studies have noticed the in situ accumulation of refractory humic like dom during algal blooms in estuaries asmala et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 therefore the dom cycling within eutrophic estuaries is still not well understood canuel and hardison 2016 zhou et al 2021 linking with the origin lability transformation and ultimate fate the molecular composition of dom is gaining increasing interest nebbioso and piccolo 2013 with the

measurements and ft icr ms were coupled and linked to assess which molecular families track with different parafac components or non parafac optical indices thus better constraining the dom cycling e g wagner et al 2015a however to the best of our knowledge very few studies have focused on the molecular complexity of dom in eutrophic coastal rivers assessing how eutrophication affects the dom cycling in coastal rivers is critical for further foreseeing dom cycling with an expected increase of future anthropogenic and climatic perturbations parel et al 2018 the liao and daliao rivers in china flow into liaodong bay of bohai sea a semi enclosed temperate chinese water body located close to the most inner part of bohai sea both coastal rivers are subjected to a different degree of eutrophication liu et al 2020 with water retention time of up to 2 months based on numerical modeling wang 2013 these two rivers serve as a typical case to track how eutrophication affects dom cycling meanwhile the liao river is connected with natural reed wetlands whereas the daliao river is mainly surrounded by rice paddies in this context the objectives are to i compare the differences in quantity quality and sources of dom between the liao and daliao rivers and ii evaluate how eutrophication and watershed characteristics e g land coverage and morphology would affect dom composition at the molecular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the liao and daliao rivers are located on the liao river delta lrd which has a catchment area of ca 219 600 km2 fig 1 the lrd is the principal industrial base in the northeast part of china with oil chemical and steel factories being distributed to several big cities such as fushun shenyang panjin and yingkou with the rapid economic development in the past ca fifty years this lrd has been undergoing a significant increase in population and nutrient load gao et al 2014 the concentrations of po4 3 and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din all increased more than 10 times in the past 15 years zhang et al 2016 and some of the rivers in lrd including daliao river were classified as grade iv based on the national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 recent water quality monitoring reports revealed that both rivers were subject to anthropogenic influences including agricultural intensification and domestic and industrial wastewater soa 2013 although both rivers have similar biogeographic backgrounds the water eutrophication status is more severe in the daliao river than the liao river ma et al 2015 thus the lrd serves as an ideal setting for examining how anthropogenic disturbances e g eutrophication and watershed characteristics reed wetland and rice paddies affect the dom cycling in coastal rivers 2 2 sample collection and in situ measurements to minimize the difference in allochthonous terrestrial dom from upstream and capture the eutrophication status the sampling was performed

optical properties the liao river dom had significantly higher averaged suva254 and hix values whereas the daliao river dom had significantly higher averaged bix and fi values table s2 similar eems were observed for the liao river dom in which excitation emission usually maximize at 252 422 nm whereas eems of the dom from the daliao river usually maximized at 252 475 nm and 273 288 314 333 nm and a considerable spatial variation was observed fig s2 the apparent difference in eems was further illustrated by parafac analysis see si for details and six fluorescent components were obtained including four humic like components c1 to c4 and two protein like components c5 and c6 fig 3 c1 showed an excitation emission ex em maximum at 252 303 402 nm c2 at 273 482 nm c3 at 252 484 nm c4 at 261 354 422 nm c5 at 288 333 nm and c6 at 273 314 nm fig 3 c5 tryptophan like and c6 tyrosine like showed higher relative abundances in the daliao river with the maximum at the dl1 and dl2 sites table

daliao river than the liao river fig 3 3 3 molecular composition of dom as determined by ft icr ms and im q tof lcms between 4441 and 5637 molecular formulas were identified in each dom sample with a mass range from 177 to 650 da table 2 fig s3 no apparent trends of dom molecular diversity were observed from the upstream to the river mouth in both rivers table 2 a total of 9491 unique molecular formulas were identified across the whole sample set in which the numbers of cho chon chos and chons formulas were 3574 3728 1600 and 589 respectively meanwhile the number of common formulas that were detected in all samples is only 2712 in which cho chon chos and chons formulas were 1256 1133 286 and 37 respectively a sharp difference between the liao and daliao rivers was observed regarding the number of molecular formulas which was also evidenced by the van krevelen diagram plot of molecular formulae o c to h c ratios figs s4 s5 significant differences were observed for most molecular parameters between the liao and daliao rivers fig 4 the averaged h c was higher in the daliao river whereas averaged o c was higher in the liao river fig 4 significantly higher averaged relative abundances of chos and chons formulas were observed in the daliao river than in the liao river table 2 further examination revealed that some of the s containing formulas were likely associated with a major class of surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates las and dialkyl tetralin sulfonates dats gonsior et al 2011 the s containing formulas decreased gradually from upstream to the river mouth in both rivers in both rivers highly unsaturated compounds represent 70 by intensity whereas the black carbon like compound group only represents 0 5 of all detected compounds table 3 higher relative intensities of polyphenol and cram formulas were observed in the liao river table 3 the relative contribution of t peaks ranged from 2 6 to 3 3 and 2 3 to 2 8 in the liao and daliao rivers respectively higher relative abundances of t peaks were observed in the liao river than the daliao river the averaged relative abundance of black carbon like compounds was higher in the liao river higher mlbl and relative abundances of peptide and sugar like formulas were detected in the daliao river fig 4 within the freshwater sites of both rivers sites lh2 5 dl4 adjacent to reed wetlands were characterized by lower h c lower unsaturated aliphatic compounds but higher ai dbe polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds and cram than those of the sites surrounded by rice paddies lh1 and dl1 3 fig 5 fig s6 the unique formulas that were present at locations adjacent to reed wetlands but not detected at sites surrounded by rice paddies lh1 or dl1 3 and at sites affected by marine inputs lh6 dl5 and dl6 were scanned out fig 5 the numbers of these potential reed wetland related molecular formulas were from 420 to 775 in the liao river and 435 in the daliao river fig 5e the averaged h c values of these reed wetland related molecular formulas were significantly lower o c ai and mw were significantly higher than that of the overall dom from the sites surrounded by reed wetlands fig 5a

out and visualized by van krevelen diagram fig 5e these molecular formulas were mainly classified as cram and or highly unsaturated compounds presenting lower h c but higher o c ai and mw fig 5a d considering an individual dom molecular formula could have several structural isomers isomeric information and variations on several molecular formulas were assessed through im ms lu et al 2018 as a result the isomeric percentage calculated as number of different formulas possessing isomer total number of different formulas 100 of dom ranged from 8 2 to 14 8 ave 12 6 2 5 and 4 0 to 9 5 ave 6 6 2

analysis using ft icr ms based parameters as loadings pca yielded three separate groups likely corresponded to the dom source and sample background including group a high salinity 11 3 samples of both rivers lh6 dl5 and dl6 the group b low salinity 1 8 samples of the liao river and the group c low salinity 1 3 samples of the daliao river with high autochthonous inputs fig 7 pc1 separates samples mainly by eutrophication status autochthonous inputs pc2 differentiates samples by salinity terrestrial vs marine inputs brackish samples lh6 dl5 and dl6 were separated from freshwater samples 4 discussion 4 1 eutrophication serves as a dominant factor affecting dom chemistry anthropogenic nutrient inputs are causing increased eutrophication and algal blooms in coastal areas cloern 2001 in this context the accumulation and decomposition of phytoplankton is an essential source of dom usually leading to a positive correlation between doc and chla concentrations in coastal waters rochelle newall and fisher 2002 the chla and doc concentrations and δ13c values of dom in both the liao and daliao rivers are higher than most of the world large rivers with less degree of eutrophication such as the amazon river delaware river and chinese coastal rivers such as the yangtze river and the pearl river he et al 2019 fig s1 indicating relatively more autochthonous input of dom in both the liao and daliao rivers because autochthonous inputs of doc from bacteria and phytoplankton 23 were usually more enriched in 13c than that of allochthonous sources from terrestrial c3 plants 27 bianchi and canuel 2011 the mlbl values in both the liao and daliao rivers are higher than the pearl river he et al 2019 and the yangtze river zhou et al 2021 in china the pca further suggests that eutrophication related autochthonous input is the most dominant controlling factor leading to differences in dom chemistry between the liao and daliao rivers which is also supported by the significant p 0 05 negative correlation between pc1 score and tsi fig s7 considering that rice paddies surround the daliao river high erosion rates or artificial drainage channels accompanied agricultural runoff likely aid the mobilization and transport of soil derived dom resulting in higher quantities of humic high mw and aromatic dom to the river graeber et al 2012 however this is not the case observed here instead higher mlbl values higher relative abundances of peptide and sugar like formulas and more aliphatic signature higher h c of dom in the daliao river suggested relatively more autochthonous and labile input of dom in the daliao river than the liao river in agreement with the higher chla concentrations and abundance of protein like fluorescence obtained from prrafac figs 2 4 moreover the im ms results revealed a significantly much lower isomer percentage in dom from the daliao river than the liao river and previously investigated texas rivers fig 6 and gulf of mexico samples ca 11 to 22 of esi negative mode lu et al 2021 further suggesting less diverse biochemical pathways and higher relative contributions of autochthonous dom in the daliao river liu and lu 2019 this higher autochthonous input associated lower isomer percentage of dom is consistent with a previous study at a tributary of the yangtze river d he et al 2020 longer water residence time and bloom of algae caused by heavy loads of nutrients instead could be the principal factors contributing to the stronger autochthonous signature of dom in the daliao river than that of the liao river zhang et al 2016 in contrast the liao river may inherit relatively more terrestrial derived dom from soils or reed wetlands due to lateral transport discussed in section 4 3 the daliao river is characterized by significantly higher relative abundances of chos and chons formulas than the liao river abundant s containing formulas 47 to 56 by intensity with most of them being unsaturated aliphatic and peptide like formulae have been observed in the phytoplankton derived dom pool mangal et al 2016 s containing formulas were also detected in natural ecosystems such as a subtropical coastal wetland and soil and sediment pore waters of the continental shelf and marine systems likely resulting from the early diagenetic sulfurization of cho formulas schmidt et al 2009 2017 lu et al 2020 the chos formulas detected in this study include a series of surfactant like formulas gonsior et al 2011 melendez perez et al 2016 and are characterized by a wide range of h c and o c values fig s5c suggesting both algal and anthropogenic e g sewage inputs wagner et al 2015b 4 2 phytoplankton derived humic like fluorescence and its molecular signature linking optical and molecular properties to further constrain the sources of dom in coastal rivers the associations between optical and molecular properties were investigated which have been studied in several aquatic ecosystems such as a drinking water reservoir herzsprung et al 2012 boreal rivers stubbins et al 2014 and lakes kellerman et al 2015 the open ocean martínez pérez et al 2017 and a subtropical coastal wetland wagner et al 2015a here the optical properties typical optical indices and parafac components represented a part of the molecular formulas up to 2026 about 35 by relative intensity figs s8 s9 c1 c2 and c4 correlated broadly with molecular families with higher o c higher ai and lower h c whereas c5 and c6 correlated with molecular families with lower o c lower ai and higher h c table 3 figs s8 s10 table s3 c1 and c4 correlated with molecular formulas with the highest averaged molecular weight mw 420 da whereas c5 correlated with molecular formulas with the lowest averaged mw 344 da optical indices such as suva254 and hix were positively correlated with a terrestrial derived group of compounds enriched in aromatic formulas e g higher mw lower h c and more aromatic signature fig s9 table s4 which are photoreactive and quickly degrade when exposed to sunlight stubbins et al 2010 the fi index broadly represents autochthonous pools of dom associated with microbial activity was found to associate with unsaturated aliphatic and peptide like formulas which are bio labile table 3 figs s8 s9 therefore optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms generally agree in both rivers although both optical and molecular parameters suggested relatively higher autochthonous dom inputs in the daliao river than the liao river the averaged relative abundance of humic like c3 component is significantly higher in the daliao river the red shifted humic like c3 component with a longer emission wavelength is likely attributed to the diagenetic transformation of the original fluorophores with relatively lower emission wavelength due to microbial processing burdige et al 2004 phytoplankton derived organic matter could directly result in the formation of unstructured humic like cdom fluorescence facilitated by aggregation and microbial processing of precursor particulate organic matter pom biomolecules containing discrete yet unidentified fluorophores during a cultural study kinsey et al 2018 recent field observations suggested that algal blooms likely contribute in situ humic like fdom in coastal oceans kwon et al 2018 the underlying reasons could be the positive priming effect preferential degradation of refractory dom by addition of labile dom due to the labile algal dom input which increases the reworking of dom by the heterotrophic activity of microbes bianchi 2011 linking molecular signature with optical proxies revealed that c3 is positively correlated with formulas with more aliphatic signature higher h c than other humic like components c1 c2 and c4 figs s8 s10 considering large watersheds with a low elevation gradient tend to have long water residence times and flow paths that allow extensive dom transformation by heterotrophic microbes lambert et al 2015 c3 is likely originated from phytoplankton and subsequently reworked by heterotrophic processing burdige et al 2004 which is further supported by the significantly p 0 05 positive correlation between chla concentrations and the abundances of c3 fig s11 asmala et al 2018 observed the in situ accumulation of refractory compounds in coastal environments due to eutrophication a recent cultural study suggests that 60 days of microbial processing of phytoplankton derived photosynthate could significantly contribute to humic like molecules with recalcitrant signatures zheng et al 2019 therefore we speculate that the formation of this phytoplankton derived humic like component may serve as a potential source of refractory dom transported to the coastal ocean jiao et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 4 3 tidal marsh and marine inputs contribute to changes in dom chemistry the transport of dom from watershed to rivers is facilitated by a pronounced river and landscape connectivity in the low gradient area with extensive wetland cover fig 1 austnes et al 2010 in this context the lateral input of tidal marsh reed wetlands here could contribute to the dom pool in rivers evidenced by the spatial distribution of dom composition figs 5 7 fig s6 for instance lh1 is surrounded by rice paddies whereas lh2 to lh5 is connected with reed wetlands fig 1 the δ13c values were much lower for lh2 to lh5 than lh1 the δ13c values of reed tissues in the lrd are from 25 8 to 25 1 liu et al 2020 which are higher than rice plant tissues in lrd 29 5 to 26 8 and most terrestrial plants about 29 medeiros et al 2016 the increase of δ13c from lh1 to lh2 could be caused by the dom input from reed wetlands lh4 showed the highest δ13c values and corresponded with the highest spm concentration table 1 also suggesting the input of reed wetland material to the liao river similar evidence was observed for the daliao river where the highest δ13c value and spm concentration were observed at dl4 table 1 ft icr ms further suggested the input from reed wetlands to both rivers both lh5 and dl4 showed the highest relative intensity of polyphenol like formulas in each river fig s6 therefore the lateral transport caused the addition of dom derived from salt marsh macrophytes or salt marsh sediments due to leaching to the connected rivers which is more pronounced during low hydroperiod and the succession stage of the reed plants during our sampling period schiebel et al 2019 lu et al 2020 dl5 dl6 and lh6 samples at pc2 all show positive scores fig 7 separating them from all the freshwater sites suggesting that marine inputs also serve as a significant factor affecting dom chemistry in particular these three sites were characterized by higher δ13c values lower relative intensities of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds than those of the freshwater sites tables 1 and 3 considering the low elevation of lrd c a 0 5 m and high amplitudes of tides up to c a 4 m the marine dom is easily introduced to these locations through tides wang 2013 therefore in addition to the eutrophication which plays the dominant control to dom chemistry reed marsh and tides induced marine water intrusion also contribute to the changes in dom composition in the liao and daliao rivers 4 4 current limitations and implications for dom cycling in coastal rivers there are still some limitations in this case study in particular we only performed investigations in november late fall to early winter due to the following reasons i the wetland vegetation especially the reed will form more detritus and should contribute significant organic matter to the estuaries as observed in the yellow river delta zhang et al 2020 ii the river discharge is significantly lower in fall and winter than in summer leading to shallower water for both rivers therefore during the high tide period the tide induced water inundation may facilitate organic matter release from the surrounding reed wetlands we suspect the sampling time in this study may better capture the apparent signal derived from wetland vegetation especially the reed however more samplings biomass and water samples are needed to better constrain the seasonal variability of dom chemistry and the underlying controlling factors eutrophication has been a global concern affecting estuarine ecosystems worldwide le moal et al 2019 estuaries with low riverine inputs discharge of allochthonous carbon and high inputs of inorganic nutrients may act as reactors where autochthonous dom input dominates over the allochthonous markager et al 2011 staehr et al 2018 dom from different sources with different compositions can be more or less susceptible to microbial and chemical degradation and processing obernosterer and benner 2004 if projections of eutrophication are confirmed to continue with industry and economy development diaz et al 2011 the present analysis suggests that dom composition will likely have a more aliphatic character in the future moreover variations in dom composition due to the increase of eutrophication may act together with other factors e g changes in water residence time light availability and land use to influence biological and abiotic processing in estuaries for instance autochthonous dom is typically considered highly bioavailable and expected to be utilized rapidly in the microbial loop hopkinson et al 1998 which will further affect or prime the processing of the whole dom pool including the refractory part in estuaries bianchi 2011 although the analyses are restricted to the lrd it is reasonable to expect that similar changes could be observed in eutrophic estuaries that experience similar conditions of geomorphology and hydrology for example the yellow river delta and pearl river delta in china and the gulf of mexico in america and in other areas worldwide our study links the dom cycling in coastal river systems to eutrophication land coverage and watershed morphology since riverine fluxes of dom will increase in the future based on numerous modeling studies canuel and hardison 2016 a further basin scale understanding of dom spatiotemporal dynamics in coastal rivers that drain into ecologically significant estuaries is needed to mitigate the influence of future climatic and anthropogenic stressors on dom cycling from the landscape to coastal environments in the context of the global c budget mccluney et al 2014 canuel et al 2016 5 conclusion the optical and molecular composition of dom along two coastal rivers with different extent of eutrophication status and coverage of coastal wetlands was compared the molecular composition information and further principal component analysis showed significant potential in grouping the sampling sites according to the similarity in the dom composition which made it possible to identify the areas of most significant impact by in situ autochthonous inputs and lateral transport from salt marshes increases in algal blooms due to anthropogenic nutrient input may increase the autochthonous production of dom and the relative importance of autochthonous dom compared to that of allochthonous dom since autochthonous dom is usually very bio labile it may affect the processing of the whole dom along the river to ocean continuum more importantly with the low elevation of delta and high amplitudes of tides the reed wetland also contributes a series of formulas with high molecular weight and aromaticity but low h c to the rivers through the lateral transport complicating the dom cycling from the river to estuary continuum considering the substantial heterogeneity of dom composition in two rivers connected with coastal oceans and increase of riverine fluxes will likely increase in the future improving the understanding of watershed level heterogeneity is critical in addition considering eutrophic estuaries with similar conditions of geomorphology and hydrology are widely distributed in the world further studies are

16208,seafood is a major source of hg exposure for humans and rivers are an important source of hg for adjacent seas the yellow river is an extremely high sediment river that is heavily influenced by anthropogenic water facilities especially sediment regulations which might result in significant intra and inter year flux variations on pollutants overestimations of hg flux were found in previous studies on high sediment rivers and a comprehensive study of hg transport along such a river has not yet been attempted in this study we quantified the fates of hg and methylmercury mehg in the yellow river and its main branches as well as the impacts of anthropogenic activities including deposition of contaminants in the reservoirs diversion in the downstream and sediment regulation by sampling in 2017 and 2018 and comparing the two typical years with and without sediment regulation the total hg thg and mehg concentrations in the yellow river and its tributaries were high and extremely high mehg thg ratios were found in the three sampled reservoirs the river discharges substantial amounts of thg and mehg into the bohai sea and particulate hg in the humid period accounts for a large proportion a significant increase in hg flux into the ocean was found in 2018 compared with that in 2017 which was primarily attributed to the altered hydrology caused by sediment regulation substantial amounts of hg were impounded in the reservoirs and only a small fraction was discharged downstream of the reservoir in the non regulation years moreover hg fluxes to the coastal ocean were impacted by downstream water diversion in non regulation years whereas the contributions of diversions in regulation years were small in conclusion models showed that in recent 15 years sediment regulation can enhance the hg burden and risk to coastal ecosystem of bohai sea graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mercury methylmercury yellow river high sediment river sediment regulation 1 introduction mercury is a global pollutant and methylmercury mehg is most likely to cause adverse health effects driscoll et al 2013 streets et al 2017 mercury is mainly converted to mehg by microbial methylation in sediments of rivers lakes and seas parks et al 2013 in fish mehg accounts for more than 80 of total hg thg and accumulates along the food chain ullrich et al 2001 thereby resulting in a very high risk houserová et al 2007 the main mehg exposure route for humans is aquatic products especially marine products thus the aquatic environment especially nearshore waters is essential for human exposure to mehg worldwide sunderland et al 2018 more than 90 of the mehg ingested by the u s population originates from marine fish and shellfish sunderland 2006 atmospheric deposition has long been considered the main source of marine hg jiskra et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 the global flux of hg to the sea from rivers is estimated to be 300 t y 1 which is approximately 10 of the atmospheric hg deposition outridge et al 2018 other studies have estimated larger amounts of 1000 t y 1 cossa et al 1996 liu et al 2021b and 2000 t y 1 sunderland and mason 2007 these studies suggest that in addition to atmospheric deposition riverine input is an important source of hg in marine environments it has been estimated that 11 to 50 of the particulate hg discharged by rivers enters the open ocean global average 28 while the rest settles within estuarine deltas amos et al 2014 thus nearshore waters are more significantly influenced by riverine inputs of hg than open ocean for nearshore waters riverine input rather than atmospheric deposition is likely the dominant source of hg liu et al 2021b mason et al 2012 however in china the greatest emitter of hg worldwide wu et al 2016 in addition to human exposure via seafood human exposure to mehg via farmed freshwater fish plays an important role because of the dietary structure liu et al 2018 in 2017 50 t of thg was estimated to be released into the aquatic environment in china liu et al 2021a the yellow river is the second longest river in china after the yangtze river and the sixth longest river in the world it has an extremely large sediment load fig s1 and its hg export heavily influences the thg and mehg patterns in adjacent seas yu et al 2021a the yellow river was once the world s largest carrier of fluvial sediment but its sediment load has decreased by approximately 90 since the 1950s owing to the afforestation of the loess plateau and the influence of dams such as the longyangxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams wang et al 2016 in reservoirs worldwide the mehg concentration in water and sediment may increase significantly kamman et al 2005 and this dam effect has attracted much attention methylating microorganisms are prevalent in sediments of various types of aqueous environments carl and gilmour 2008 king et al 2002 and in other anaerobic microenvironments such as particulate organic carbon surfaces in the water column the yellow river has been heavily influenced by sediment regulation since 2002 such large scale management of a river system to maintain downstream river health is unprecedented therefore a scientific assessment of pollutants is necessary this study aimed to assess the transport and fate of hg in the yellow river using large scale field work and laboratory tests combined with material flow simulations the purpose of this study was to determine whether dam construction sediment regulation and water diversion significantly affect the transport of hg in the watershed and to provide quantitative evidence of hg and mehg discharge to the sea in a high sediment river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment regulation the aim of sediment regulation which is mainly performed by the sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams fig 1 in the lower midstream is to release the sediment stored in the reservoirs and to reduce sediment accumulation in the lower reaches of the river wu et al 2020 therefore the regulation is divided into two periods annually namely drainage and flushing during the drainage period the xiaolangdi reservoir drains clear water with a low sediment content which is maintained for approximately 10 d and the sediment accumulated in the downstream channel is rapidly flushed out bi et al 2019 subsequently during the flushing period a large amount of sediment is flushed from the xiaolangdi reservoir and upstream sanmenxia reservoir which discharge highly turbid water with a suspended sediment concentration of 60 100 kg m 3 li et al 2017 after regulation the water output and sediment concentration of the xiaolangdi reservoir returned to normal values below 500 m3 s 1 and 5 kg m 3 respectively wu et al 2020 the yellow river delivers an average of 28 of the annual runoff and 41 of the sediment to the bohai sea during regulation more details are provided in supplementary information si 1 2 2 samples the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources of china publishes the annual yellow river sediment bulletin yrcc 2020 the bulletin records the monthly runoff and sediment load at the stations of the mainstream and major tributaries of the yellow river in this study sample collection was conducted once during the dry period march to may and once during the humid period july to august in 2017 at the stations in the bulletin fig s1 for the three reservoir stations of longyangxia upstream sanmenxia and xiaolangdi lower midstream two samples were collected upstream and downstream of each dam fig s2 a total of 52 water samples were collected from the yellow river basin in 2017 in addition to 104 samples of suspended particulate matter spm membranes fig 1 in 2018 two samples and four membranes were collected from the river mouth lijin station during dry and humid periods respectively more sampling details are provided in si 2 and table s1 2 3 mercury analysis thg in solid samples was measured by gold amalgamation and atomic absorption spectrometry using a direct hg analyzer dma 80 milestone italy following epa method 7473 yu et al 2021b samples were measured in duplicate simultaneously and certified reference material pacs 3 marine sediment national research council of canada was used for quality control with a recovery rate of 90 to 103 and a detection limit of 0 02 ng for liquid samples thg measurement followed epa method 1631 munson et al 2014 using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs on a tekran 2600 canada the method detection limit was 0 1 ng l 1 with a measured recovery between 82 and 119 mehg measurement followed epa method 1630 yu et al 2021a using gas chromatographic cvafs tekran 2700 canada the detection limit was 0 01 ng l 1 for mehg more details regarding hg analysis are described in si 3 2 4 other analyses surface water parameters such as temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured directly in situ using a portable analyzer sx721 sanxin china dissolved organic carbon in water was determined using a toc l ssm 5000a shimadzu japan 2 5 distribution coefficient the distribution coefficient kd is a value describing the partition of hg between the dissolved and particulate phases and is usually expressed by its logarithm logkd as follows amos et al 2013 chen et al 2018 1 log k d log c p h g 1000 c d h g where cphg and cdhg are the mass concentrations of thg in the particulate state ng g 1 and concentrations in the dissolved state ng l 1 and 1000 is the unit conversion 2 6 river transport model in this study based on the measured concentrations of thg and mehg in both the dissolved and particulate states in the yellow river combined with the runoff and sediment load data the transport of thg and mehg between different tributaries in the yellow river was analyzed using the material flow method for the mainstream the hg flux at each sampling section sk was the sum of the dissolved and particulate states at that site 2 s k c d k f d k c p k s s d k where sk is the hg flux transported in section k in the mainstream t y 1 cdk is the hg concentration in the dissolved state in section k ng l 1 cpk is the hg content in the particulate state in section k ng g 1 fdk is the runoff in section k m3 y 1 and ssdk is the sediment load in section k t y 1 the transport of hg from one site to the next can be expressed as follows 3 s k t k c k e k s k 1 where tk is the hg flux input to the mainstream water from all tributaries in segment k of the mainstream channel t y 1 which is calculated as follows 4 t k a c d k a f d k a c p k a s s d k a where cdk a is the amount of hg in the dissolved state in tributary a ng l 1 cpk a is the amount of hg in the particulate state in tributary a ng g

segment represents hg loss due to water consumption calculated by water consumption volumes multiplied by unfiltered hg concentrations specially for segments below xiaolangdi dam the water consumption was performed by water diversion projects and much sediment load was diverted away from the river in those segments the diversion fluxes were calculated by the sum of water hg flux and sediment hg flux which was calculated by water diversion volume wk multiplied by filtered hg concentrations cdk and sediment diversion mass sk multiplied by mass hg concentrations cpk respectively 5 c k c d k w k c p k s k meanwhile ek is the hg flux possibly negative input and outputs from other sources and fates in the mainstream channel in segment k t y 1 in most cases in this study ek was not quantified and named others however at some specific sampling sites i e upstream and downstream of the dams longyangxia xiaolangdi and sanmenxia the ek flux changes could be equated to net siltation net flushing because the distance between the two sampling sites was less than 1 km and the inputs of other natural and anthropogenic sources to the mainstream within this section were negligible meanwhile previous research has confirmed that anthropogenic hg emission from waste water in china remained relatively unchanged for two consecutive years liu et al 2016 and the variance of ek between 2017 and 2018 mainly represents the difference of hg siltation erosion in each segment in this study the dissolved and particulate hg cdk and cpk respectively were measured values and the runoff volume and sediment load fdk and ssdk respectively were obtained from the yellow river sediment bulletin the water consumption water and sediment diversion were obtained from the yellow river water resource bulletin 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of thg and mehg concentrations in the river in 2017 among all 28 mainstream samples and 24 tributary samples there were three orders of magnitude differences in unfiltered thg in the river fig 2 the unfiltered thg concentrations in the river were generally higher in summer 174 0 357 0 ng l 1 mean s d n 14 for mainstream and 389 0 762 3 ng l 1 n 12 for tributaries and lower 44 1 51 2 ng l 1 n 14 for mainstream and 41 9 38 5 ng l 1 n 12 for tributaries in spring p 0 05 thg concentrations in the yellow river are much higher than in many large rivers around the world for which similar monitoring data are available all within 10 ng l 1 such as the yukon mckenzie mississippi north america and mekong southeast asia rivers buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 noh et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 in china the thg concentration in the yellow river was significantly higher p 0 05 than the 16 major rivers average value of 19 0 5 7 ng l 1 n 16 liu et al 2021c there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between thg and do and a positive correlation between thg and redox potential p 0 05 table s2 and s3 these correlations can be partly explained by hg speciation in natural waters due to the extremely low solubility of hg0 in water it tends to volatilize easily into the atmosphere even in seawater with low hg concentrations obrist et al 2018 in high redox potential waters thg concentration increases due to the overall oxidizing environment where hg is less likely to be reduced to hg0 and thg is less likely to be dissipated from the water column by volatilization showing a significant positive correlation between thg concentration and redox potential in the mainstream the unfiltered mehg concentrations also varied in 28 mainstream samples and 24 tributary samples fig 2 but the differences were significantly smaller than the three orders of magnitude range for thg the mehg concentration in the mainstream was much higher than that in most other rivers as described above and was also significantly higher p 0 05 than the mehg concentrations of 0 1 ng l 1 to 1 2 ng l 1 n 173 in the yangtze river liu 2019 and the mean mehg concentration of 0 34 0 10 ng l 1 in 16 major rivers flowing to the seas around china liu et al 2021c the highest mehg thg ratio fig 2 reached 44 5 which is extremely rare in surface waters mostly in the range of 0 1 to 10 0 buck et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the mehg thg ratios at the sampling sites upstream and downstream the dams were much higher than the river average values except for the summer values upstream and downstream the sanmenxia dam because of the long term siltation of the dam carin 1963 and smaller runoff volume in 2017 at the time of sampling the sanmenxia dam was in an open state and the rivers in front of and behind the dam were in a flowing state especially in summer fig s2 in the other two dams there were static reservoirs in front of the dams and flowing rivers behind the dams among them the highest value for the longyangxia dam occurred in spring whereas the highest value for the xiaolangdi dam was found in summer this difference occurred because the summer thg concentration at longyangxia station was higher than that in spring 6 3 ng l 1 upstream and 38 4 ng l 1 downstream the dam in spring 69 2 ng l 1 upstream and 100 1 ng l 1 downstream the dam in summer whereas the summer thg concentration at xiaolangdi station was lower than that in spring 38 7 ng l 1 upstream and 17 5 ng l 1 downstream the dam in spring 4 1 ng l 1 upstream and 4 1 ng l 1 downstream the dam in summer such extremely high mehg thg ratios have also been observed in other reservoirs in which the mehg thg ratios could increase from 5 to 10 to 60 to 80 after water storage st louis et al 2004 the operations of dams posed key effects on hg methylation in the yellow river 3 2 mercury distribution in two phases in the yellow river average dissolved thg particulate thg and spm were 31 27 ng l 1 242 79 ng g 1 and 99 64 mg l 1 in spring and 27 45 ng l 1 246 29 ng g 1 and 2976 86 mg l 1 in summer for the main stream respectively for branches they were 21 40 ng l 1 166 75 ng g 1 695 08 mg l 1 in spring and 45 49 ng l 1 88 42 ng g 1 and 11 089 75 mg l 1 in summer respectively significant correlations of spm and unfiltered thg were confirmed p 0 001 both in mainstream and branches which shows that spatial and seasonal variation of thg in water column might be attributed mainly to the variations in spm concentrations shown by field photos in figs s2 and s3 for example among all the six pre and post dam sites the longyangxia and xiaolangdi dams had higher percentages of dissolved thg fig 3 as indicated by the clear water and low spm concentrations upstream and downstream the dams compared with sanmenxia table s3 compared to summer in spring the sanmenxia dam also had a retention effect and the spm concentrations were extremely low however since the dissolved thg concentrations were also low at this site 3 0 ng l 1 upstream the dam and 1 9 ng l 1 downstream the dam the percentage of particulate thg increased slightly but remained low in summer because of the higher location of the drainage gate relative to the sediment gate the water released downstream of the dam at that time was from upper layer of water before the dam as a result the particulate matter content was lower than that before the dam the concentration of particulate thg was lower than that before the dam and the concentration of dissolved thg was higher than that before the dam the changes in thg and the percentage of the particulate state upstream and downstream the dam corresponded significantly to the particulate matter retention effect of the dam as a result it might be not proper to discuss particulate hg by the volume concentration ng l 1 in this study mass concentration ng g 1 was applied table s4 based on the measured values we found that the logkd for thg in the mainstream of the yellow river were 4 08 0 63 and 4 01 0 61 in spring and summer respectively whereas that in the tributaries of the yellow river were 3 84 0 42 and 3 55 0 69 in spring and summer respectively overall the logkd values of the mainstream were higher than those of the tributaries generally the flows in the tributaries were faster than those in the mainstream in addition the particles in the tributaries of the yellow river are often eroded from natural sources and have larger particle sizes and smaller surface areas thus it is difficult to reach the equilibrium state between the solid and liquid phases and a large amount of dissolved thg remains in the water phase and does not enter the particulate phase in previous studies the logkd of many rivers was found to be approximately 4 5 such as for the churchill river 4 5 mackenzie river 4 6 and yukon river 4 3 lamborg et al 2016 noh et al 2013 quémerais et al 1999 studies conducted in 16 river mouths in china showed that the mean logkd value was 4 3 0 39 liu 2019 these studies also indicated that there is an extremely significant negative correlation between logkd and spm considering that the sediment load in the yellow river is much higher than the global average and much higher than that of other rivers in china the logkd in this study should be lower than those results in this study the logkd values for both the mainstream and branches of the yellow river were significantly negatively correlated with spm p 0 001 fig 4 a and logthg p 0 001 fig 4b combining the two results we can link spm and thg in the river by using the logkd value as a bridge fig 4c after regressing the values we obtain the following equations 6 log t h g y r 0 47 log s p m y r 0 69 r 2 0 57 7 log t h g b r 0 78 log s p m b r 0 49 r 2 0 82 where yr and br represent the mainstream and branches respectively these equations can be used to predict the thg concentration by spm in addition because the logkd values could also be predicted by spm it is possible to estimate the dissolved and particulate thg concentrations from spm similar regulations have been reported by previous studies on rivers both at continental level liu et al 2021c and worldwide liu et al 2021b 3 3 thg and mehg transport in the yellow river without sediment regulation sediment regulation was not conducted in 2017 si 1 this study simulated thg transport in 2017 based on a river transport model we quantified the inputs of thg and mehg fluxes to the mainstream yellow river from each tributary using measured concentrations and runoff and sediment load data from the sediment bulletin in the mainstream yellow river a segment is defined as the space between two sampling points the variations in the thg and mehg fluxes from the beginning to the end of the segment originated from five known components namely transport to the downstream tributary input the above two components were calculated from actual measurements dam interception water consumption and diversion of water and sediment in 2017 the yellow river transported a total of 0 54 t of thg fig 5 a and 14 9 kg of mehg to the bohai sea fig 6 the fluxes of thg and mehg to the sea from the yellow river were much lower than those transported in the middle reaches of the river the maximum transport fluxes of thg and mehg in the yellow river in 2017 were located at tongguan station and were spatially consistent with the highest values of sediment load in the yellow river in that year the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea contributed during the humid period accounted for 81 1 and 36 3 of the total flux that year respectively and the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea contributed by the particulate state accounted for 77 0 and 46 3 of the total flux that year respectively the runoff and sediment load during the dry period at river mouth in 2017 were higher than those in the humid period thereby leading to a higher mehg flux in the dry period than in the humid period whereas the thg flux in the humid period was still higher than that in the dry period because the concentration of particulate thg in the humid period was higher than that in the dry period among all the yellow river tributaries the input of thg 3527 kg from the wuding river was much higher than that of the other rivers which was largely attributed to the sediment load caused by the floods in 2017 when approximately two times the sediment of the weihe river was remitted to the yellow river in the year however because the runoff of the weihe and taohe rivers was much higher than that of the other tributaries their mehg inputs were significantly higher than those of the other tributaries in contrast the mehg input from the wuding river was limited because it has lower runoff and most of the sediment input from the wuding river originated from eroded soil which has a low mehg content in the mainstream yellow river the xiaolangdi dam sequestered the majority of the thg flux whereas the sanmenxia dam had a limited sequestration effect with most of the thg flux passing through the dam in the absence of sediment regulation in 2017 most of the thg in the river was sequestered in the xiaolangdi dam and did not enter the downstream channel table s5 however huayuankou station which is immediately downstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir had a high thg flux with an increase of more than 2000 kg after removing the influence of tributary inputs it is conceivable that in this section of the river the clear water released from xiaolangdi upstream the annual sediment post xiaolangdi in that year was only 2 0 105 t 0 2 of the 1 1 108 t of sediment post sanmenxia whereas the runoff in these sections was very similar flushed the particulate matter silted up in the riverbed into the water 5 8 106 t of sediment load at huayuankou station in 2017 in addition the thg flux at huayuankou station was not just from flushing because a maximum dissolved thg concentration of 146 0 ng l 1 was monitored at this station in spring which was much higher than the mainstream average of 31 3 ng l 1 in spring anthropogenic sources within this segment also contributed to the high thg concentration due to the dense population and industrial development from luoyang to zhengzhou in 2017 1510 kg and 7769 kg of thg was silted before the sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams respectively this is an extremely high deposition flux which is comparable to the annual hg deposition flux of all natural lakes in china 11 4 t yu et al 2021b in the up and mid reaches much water has been consumed for agricultural use which caused some hg loss table s6 in the lower reaches of the yellow river after the xiaolangdi dam the yellow river has almost no more water replenishment from tributaries and its runoff and sediment load are in a net decrease process a large amount of river water is introduced into the channels on both sides of the river yrcc 2020 on the one hand the diversion of water has significantly reduced the runoff of the yellow river downstream and on the other hand it has simultaneously removed a large amount of suspended sediment as well as particulate hg from the river channel table s7 in 2017 the downstream diversion reduced thg and mehg in the yellow river by 1937 kg and 62 8 kg respectively which was the main reason for the dissipation of hg fluxes in the lower yellow river the diverted fluxes of thg and mehg exceeded the fluxes into the sea similar to the dams diversion also greatly and decisively changed the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea in the yellow river in 2017 we also found a significant increase in the downstream mehg flux compared with the upper reaches the lower reaches of the yellow river have lower channel ratios and a quiescent water flow thus mehg exchange between the sediment water interface is more likely to occur downstream the more quiescent water flow is less likely to stir up the sediment thereby leaving the sediment in a stable reductive environment which is also conducive to microbial methylation yu et al 2021b the calculations of the amount of hg trapped by dams and reduced by diversion are provided in si 5 and si 6 3 4 thg and mehg transport in the yellow river with sediment regulation sediment regulation restarted in 2018 si 1 thg fluxes to the sea in 2018 was calculated based on two samples collected at the river mouth and we estimated the hg transport in other stations in 2018 based on the logkd values then corrected them using the measured samples si 7 the main differences in the thg transport processes in the yellow river between a typical regulation year and a non regulation year are described via a comparison between 2017 and 2018 fig 5b compared with that in 2017 the most important change in the transport of thg in the yellow river in 2018 was that the impact of the sanmenxia dam on the thg flux changed from net deposition to net release a total of 1060 kg of thg was net sequestered by the sanmenxia dam in 2017 whereas 5584 kg of thg was net released by the sanmenxia dam in 2018 however the xiaolangdi reservoir remained in net siltation in 2018 sequestering 7649 kg of thg which was similar to the 7769 kg sequestered in 2017 in 2018 with regulation there was a significant increase in the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea from the yellow river and the increase in the particulate state was much higher than that in the dissolved state for the up and mid streams tributary inputs decreased for wuding river and increased for weihe river and the water consumption volumes were nearly same to those in 2017 table s6 and the thg losses due to water consumption in 2017 and 2018 were similar to each other meanwhile below xiaolangdi the diversion project removed 3744 kg of thg from the yellow river channel in 2018 compared with that in 2017 the thg flux removed from the lower reaches of the yellow river 3744 kg was doubled but it was low compared with the flux from the yellow river to the sea 9752 kg this indicated that in the years when the sediment regulation project was implemented although the diversion still affected the yellow river seaward hg flux it was no longer a decisive factor owing to the significant increase in downstream runoff due to regulation the others term in the lower yellow river below huayuankou station changed from a negative value in 2017 to a positive value in 2018 the siltation of thg to the river channel in the mainstream below huayuankou decreased in 2018 compared with that in 2017 and might have changed from net siltation to net flushing this indicates that regulation was successful in its goal of flushing the whole river channeldownstream of the downstream changes in several other sections are also worthy of attention in the tuoketuo to longmen segment the net siltation in 2017 changed to net flushing in 2018 which might be related to the flood in wuding river in 2017 in 2018 the thg and mehg fluxes to sea rose up to 9752 and 39 2 kg based on two field samples which was approximately 18 and 2 6 times of the fluxes in 2017 respectively this research pointed out that sediment regulation significantly affects the flux of pollutants to the sea which has already been reported by previous studies the nutrient flux from the yellow river to the bohai sea was 8 20 times higher during sediment regulation liu et al 2011 after sediment regulation started in 2002 the chlorophyll content of the bohai sea increased significantly in summer and autumn even exceeding that in spring thereby changing the previous pattern that the spring chlorophyll content was the highest among the four seasons ding et al 2020 as a result the high algal productivity might be linked to hg methylation in situ in the estuary tsui et al 2010 3 5 riverine thg flux to the sea the natural conditions temperature and precipitation and anthropogenic factors sediment regulation and water diversion in the yellow river basin varied greatly in different years which could have led to significant differences in the runoff and sediment load to the sea reflecting the impact of the yellow river on the fate of hg in the bohai sea and yellow sea using only the thg fluxes into the sea measured in 2017 and 2018 is clearly insufficient from 2006 to 2019 the yellow river transferred an annual average of 4 3 2 9 t of thg to the bohai sea of which 3 8 2 7 t was in the particulate state accounting for 90 fig 7 there was a trough in the thg flux to the sea from 2014 to 2017 whereas in 2018 and 2019 the two highest values were identified previous studies have estimated the flux of thg to the sea in the yellow river to be 1300 1660 t y 1 which is even higher than that to the sea in the amazon basin the world s largest basin zhang et al 2015 another estimate was 9 9 t in 2016 of which only 0 1 t was in the dissolved state and the remaining was in the particulate state liu et al 2021c however based on field investigations in this study these results are debatable according to the monthly runoff and sediment load in 2016 the yellow river discharged 0 18 t and 0 63 t of thg in the dissolved and particulate states respectively in this study the difference between this result and those of previous studies mainly originated from the particulate state this is because the sediment content of the yellow river is much higher than that of major rivers worldwide the logkd values measured in this study were much lower than the global average amos et al 2014 and the regression values from the estuarine waters of 16 rivers in china liu et al 2021c however the fluxes in 2018 and 2019 in this study were all between 9 0 t and 10 0 t and the 14 y average hg flux in this study 4 3 2 9 t was comparable to the result of 9 9 t liu et al 2021b this study concluded that the particulate hg fluxes to the sea in the yellow river have been overestimated by previous authors and the flux cannot be calculated based on the dissolved concentration and general logkd the thg fluxes to the sea from the yangtze and xijiang rivers the main tributaries of the pearl river in 2016 were 46 t and 7 0 t respectively liu et al 2021c comparing them with the multi year average the yellow river can be ranked approximately third on average or as the second largest hg exporting river in regulation years in china the runoff in the yellow river is much lower than that in the xijiang river and the yellow river has a much lower flux of dissolved thg and much higher flux of particulate thg compared with those of the xijiang river 5 8 t and 1 2 t respectively the unstable fluctuation of the thg transport flux in the yellow river is mainly due to the variations in runoff and sediment load which are significantly impacted by anthropogenic hydro activities such as dams sediment regulation and downstream diversion in addition the yellow river has high hg transport compared with rivers with similar runoff table s8 for the bohai sea in 2017 the input of the yellow river was the major hg source accounting for more than 95 of all river inputs or more than 55 of all hg sources yu 2021 4 conclusions this study found that anthropogenic facilities and activities could significantly affect hg transport in the yellow river overall the thg and mehg concentrations in the yellow river and its tributaries were high compared with those of other major rivers in china and worldwide especially in the particulate state and extremely high mehg thg ratios up to 50 were found in the reservoirs of the river the thg and mehg concentrations were significantly correlated with spm ph do and redox potential the river discharged substantial amounts of thg 0 54 t and mehg 14 9 kg into the adjacent sea in 2017 and the particulate state in the humid period was responsible for a large proportion of the annual thg flux the mehg flux was mainly in the dry period and in the dissolved state however the thg flux to the sea increased to 9 8 t in 2018 this alteration was primarily attributed to the altered hydrology caused by sediment regulation substantial amounts of hg were impounded in the reservoirs and only a small fraction was discharged downstream of the reservoir in the non regulation years sediment regulation induced remarkable resuspension of this trapped hg in the reservoirs and downstream segments of the river and had a significant effect on the segments upstream of the dams mercury fluxes to the adjacent sea were impacted by downstream water diversion in non regulation years whereas the contributions of diversions in regulation years were small this research indicates that sediment regulation enhances the hg burden on the bohai sea and finds that previous studies have overestimated the particulate hg flux to the adjacent seas in high sediment rivers such as the yellow river the results of this research can provide helpful references for other high sediment rivers especially for which heavy anthropogenic facilities have been constructed the enhanced burden of hg in the bohai sea by sediment regulation should draw more attention this work

16208,seafood is a major source of hg exposure for humans and rivers are an important source of hg for adjacent seas the yellow river is an extremely high sediment river that is heavily influenced by anthropogenic water facilities especially sediment regulations which might result in significant intra and inter year flux variations on pollutants overestimations of hg flux were found in previous studies on high sediment rivers and a comprehensive study of hg transport along such a river has not yet been attempted in this study we quantified the fates of hg and methylmercury mehg in the yellow river and its main branches as well as the impacts of anthropogenic activities including deposition of contaminants in the reservoirs diversion in the downstream and sediment regulation by sampling in 2017 and 2018 and comparing the two typical years with and without sediment regulation the total hg thg and mehg concentrations in the yellow river and its tributaries were high and extremely high mehg thg ratios were found in the three sampled reservoirs the river discharges substantial amounts of thg and mehg into the bohai sea and particulate hg in the humid period accounts for a large proportion a significant increase in hg flux into the ocean was found in 2018 compared with that in 2017 which was primarily attributed to the altered hydrology caused by sediment regulation substantial amounts of hg were impounded in the reservoirs and only a small fraction was discharged downstream of the reservoir in the non regulation years moreover hg fluxes to the coastal ocean were impacted by downstream water diversion in non regulation years whereas the contributions of diversions in regulation years were small in conclusion models showed that in recent 15 years sediment regulation can enhance the hg burden and risk to coastal ecosystem of bohai sea graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mercury methylmercury yellow river high sediment river sediment regulation 1 introduction mercury is a global pollutant and methylmercury mehg is most likely to cause adverse health effects driscoll et al 2013 streets et al 2017 mercury is mainly converted to mehg by microbial methylation in sediments of rivers lakes and seas parks et al 2013 in fish mehg accounts for more than 80 of total hg thg and accumulates along the food chain ullrich et al 2001 thereby resulting in a very high risk houserová et al 2007 the main mehg exposure route for humans is aquatic products especially marine products thus the aquatic environment especially nearshore waters is essential for human exposure to mehg worldwide sunderland et al 2018 more than 90 of the mehg ingested by the u s population originates from marine fish and shellfish sunderland 2006 atmospheric deposition has long been considered the main source of marine hg jiskra et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 the global flux of hg to the sea from rivers is estimated to be 300 t y 1 which is approximately 10 of the atmospheric hg deposition outridge et al 2018 other studies have estimated larger amounts of 1000 t y 1 cossa et al 1996 liu et al 2021b and 2000 t y 1 sunderland and mason 2007 these studies suggest that in addition to atmospheric deposition riverine input is an important source of hg in marine environments it has been estimated that 11 to 50 of the particulate hg discharged by rivers enters the open ocean global average 28 while the rest settles within estuarine deltas amos et al 2014 thus nearshore waters are more significantly influenced by riverine inputs of hg than open ocean for nearshore waters riverine input rather than atmospheric deposition is likely the dominant source of hg liu et al 2021b mason et al 2012 however in china the greatest emitter of hg worldwide wu et al 2016 in addition to human exposure via seafood human exposure to mehg via farmed freshwater fish plays an important role because of the dietary structure liu et al 2018 in 2017 50 t of thg was estimated to be released into the aquatic environment in china liu et al 2021a the yellow river is the second longest river in china after the yangtze river and the sixth longest river in the world it has an extremely large sediment load fig s1 and its hg export heavily influences the thg and mehg patterns in adjacent seas yu et al 2021a the yellow river was once the world s largest carrier of fluvial sediment but its sediment load has decreased by approximately 90 since the 1950s owing to the afforestation of the loess plateau and the influence of dams such as the longyangxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams wang et al 2016 in reservoirs worldwide the mehg concentration in water and sediment may increase significantly kamman et al 2005 and this dam effect has attracted much attention methylating microorganisms are prevalent in sediments of various types of aqueous environments carl and gilmour 2008 king et al 2002 and in other anaerobic microenvironments such as particulate organic carbon surfaces in the water column the yellow river has been heavily influenced by sediment regulation since 2002 such large scale management of a river system to maintain downstream river health is unprecedented therefore a scientific assessment of pollutants is necessary this study aimed to assess the transport and fate of hg in the yellow river using large scale field work and laboratory tests combined with material flow simulations the purpose of this study was to determine whether dam construction sediment regulation and water diversion significantly affect the transport of hg in the watershed and to provide quantitative evidence of hg and mehg discharge to the sea in a high sediment river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment regulation the aim of sediment regulation which is mainly performed by the sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams fig 1 in the lower midstream is to release the sediment stored in the reservoirs and to reduce sediment accumulation in the lower reaches of the river wu et al 2020 therefore the regulation is divided into two periods annually namely drainage and flushing during the drainage period the xiaolangdi reservoir drains clear water with a low sediment content which is maintained for approximately 10 d and the sediment accumulated in the downstream channel is rapidly flushed out bi et al 2019 subsequently during the flushing period a large amount of sediment is flushed from the xiaolangdi reservoir and upstream sanmenxia reservoir which discharge highly turbid water with a suspended sediment concentration of 60 100 kg m 3 li et al 2017 after regulation the water output and sediment concentration of the xiaolangdi reservoir returned to normal values below 500 m3 s 1 and 5 kg m 3 respectively wu et al 2020 the yellow river delivers an average of 28 of the annual runoff and 41 of the sediment to the bohai sea during regulation more details are provided in supplementary information si 1 2 2 samples the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources of china publishes the annual yellow river sediment bulletin yrcc 2020 the bulletin records the monthly runoff and sediment load at the stations of the mainstream and major tributaries of the yellow river in this study sample collection was conducted once during the dry period march to may and once during the humid period july to august in 2017 at the stations in the bulletin fig s1 for the three reservoir stations of longyangxia upstream sanmenxia and xiaolangdi lower midstream two samples were collected upstream and downstream of each dam fig s2 a total of 52 water samples were collected from the yellow river basin in 2017 in addition to 104 samples of suspended particulate matter spm membranes fig 1 in 2018 two samples and four membranes were collected from the river mouth lijin station during dry and humid periods respectively more sampling details are provided in si 2 and table s1 2 3 mercury analysis thg in solid samples was measured by gold amalgamation and atomic absorption spectrometry using a direct hg analyzer dma 80 milestone italy following epa method 7473 yu et al 2021b samples were measured in duplicate simultaneously and certified reference material pacs 3 marine sediment national research council of canada was used for quality control with a recovery rate of 90 to 103 and a detection limit of 0 02 ng for liquid samples thg measurement followed epa method 1631 munson et al 2014 using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs on a tekran 2600 canada the method detection limit was 0 1 ng l 1 with a measured recovery between 82 and 119 mehg measurement followed epa method 1630 yu et al 2021a using gas chromatographic cvafs tekran 2700 canada the detection limit was 0 01 ng l 1 for mehg more details regarding hg analysis are described in si 3 2 4 other analyses surface water parameters such as temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured directly in situ using a portable analyzer sx721 sanxin china dissolved organic carbon in water was determined using a toc l ssm 5000a shimadzu japan 2 5 distribution coefficient the distribution coefficient kd is a value describing the partition of hg between the dissolved and particulate phases and is usually expressed by its logarithm logkd as follows amos et al 2013 chen et al 2018 1 log k d log c p h g 1000 c d h g where cphg and cdhg are the mass concentrations of thg in the particulate state ng g 1 and concentrations in the dissolved state ng l 1 and 1000 is the unit conversion 2 6 river transport model in this study based on the measured concentrations of thg and mehg in both the dissolved and particulate states in the yellow river combined with the runoff and sediment load data the transport of thg and mehg between different tributaries in the yellow river was analyzed using the material flow method for the mainstream the hg flux at each sampling section sk was the sum of the dissolved and particulate states at that site 2 s k c d k f d k c p k s s d k where sk is the hg flux transported in section k in the mainstream t y 1 cdk is the hg concentration in the dissolved state in section k ng l 1 cpk is the hg content in the particulate state in section k ng g 1 fdk is the runoff in section k m3 y 1 and ssdk is the sediment load in section k t y 1 the transport of hg from one site to the next can be expressed as follows 3 s k t k c k e k s k 1 where tk is the hg flux input to the mainstream water from all tributaries in segment k of the mainstream channel t y 1 which is calculated as follows 4 t k a c d k a f d k a c p k a s s d k a where cdk a is the amount of hg in the dissolved state in tributary a ng l 1 cpk a is the amount of hg in the particulate state in tributary a ng g 1 fdk a is the runoff volume of the tributary converging to the main stream m3 y 1 and ssdk a is the amount of sediment transported by the confluence of tributary a to the mainstream t y 1 ck in each segment represents hg loss due to water consumption calculated by water consumption volumes multiplied by unfiltered hg concentrations specially for segments below xiaolangdi dam the water consumption was performed by water diversion projects and much sediment load was diverted away from the river in those segments the diversion fluxes were calculated by the sum of water hg flux and sediment hg flux which was calculated by water diversion volume wk multiplied by filtered hg concentrations cdk and sediment diversion mass sk multiplied by mass hg concentrations cpk respectively 5 c k c d k w k c p k s k meanwhile ek is the hg flux possibly negative input and outputs from other sources and fates in the mainstream channel in segment k t y 1 in most cases in this study ek was not quantified and named others however at some specific sampling sites i e upstream and downstream of the dams longyangxia xiaolangdi and sanmenxia the ek flux changes could be equated to net siltation net flushing because the distance between the two sampling sites was less than 1 km and the inputs of other natural and anthropogenic sources to the mainstream within this section were negligible meanwhile previous research has confirmed that anthropogenic hg emission from waste water in china remained relatively unchanged for two consecutive years liu et al 2016 and the variance of ek between 2017 and 2018 mainly represents the difference of hg siltation erosion in each segment in this study the dissolved and particulate hg cdk and cpk respectively were measured values and the runoff volume and sediment load fdk and ssdk respectively were obtained from the yellow river sediment bulletin the water consumption water and sediment diversion were obtained from the yellow river water resource bulletin 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of thg and mehg concentrations in the river in 2017 among all 28 mainstream samples and 24 tributary samples there were three orders of magnitude differences in unfiltered thg in the river fig 2 the unfiltered thg concentrations in the river were generally higher in summer 174 0 357 0 ng l 1 mean s d n 14 for mainstream and 389 0 762 3 ng l 1 n 12 for tributaries and lower 44 1 51 2 ng l 1 n 14 for mainstream and 41 9 38 5 ng l 1 n 12 for tributaries in spring p 0 05 thg concentrations in the yellow river are much higher than in many large rivers around the world for which similar monitoring data are available all within 10 ng l 1 such as the yukon mckenzie mississippi north america and mekong southeast asia rivers buck et al 2015 emmerton et al 2013 noh et al 2013 schuster et al 2011 in china the thg concentration in the yellow river was significantly higher p 0 05 than the 16 major rivers average value of 19 0 5 7 ng l 1 n 16 liu et al 2021c there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between thg and do and a positive correlation between thg and redox potential p 0 05 table s2 and s3 these correlations can be partly explained by hg speciation in natural waters due to the extremely low solubility of hg0 in water it tends to volatilize easily into the atmosphere even in seawater with low hg concentrations obrist et al 2018 in high redox potential waters thg concentration increases due to the overall oxidizing environment where hg is less likely to be reduced to hg0 and thg is less likely to be dissipated from the water column by volatilization showing a significant positive correlation between thg concentration and redox potential in the mainstream the unfiltered mehg concentrations also varied in 28 mainstream samples and 24 tributary samples fig 2 but the differences were significantly smaller than the three orders of magnitude range for thg the mehg concentration in the mainstream was much higher than that in most other rivers as described above and was also significantly higher p 0 05 than the mehg concentrations of 0 1 ng l 1 to 1 2 ng l 1 n 173 in the yangtze river liu 2019 and the mean mehg concentration of 0 34 0 10 ng l 1 in 16 major rivers flowing to the seas around china liu et al 2021c the highest mehg thg ratio fig 2 reached 44 5 which is extremely rare in surface waters mostly in the range of 0 1 to 10 0 buck et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the mehg thg ratios at the sampling sites upstream and downstream the dams were much higher than the river average values except for the summer values upstream and downstream the sanmenxia dam because of the long term siltation of the dam carin 1963 and smaller runoff volume in 2017 at the time of sampling the sanmenxia dam was in an open state and the rivers in front of and behind the dam were in a flowing state especially in summer fig s2 in the other two dams there were static reservoirs in front of the dams and flowing rivers behind the dams among them the highest value for the longyangxia dam occurred in spring whereas the highest value for the xiaolangdi dam was found in summer this difference occurred because the summer thg concentration at longyangxia station was higher than that in spring 6 3 ng l 1 upstream and 38 4 ng l 1 downstream the dam in spring 69 2 ng l 1 upstream and 100 1 ng l 1 downstream the dam in summer whereas the summer thg concentration at xiaolangdi station was lower than that in spring 38 7 ng l 1 upstream and 17 5 ng l 1 downstream the dam in spring 4 1 ng l 1 upstream and 4 1 ng l 1 downstream the dam in summer such extremely high mehg thg ratios have also been observed in other reservoirs in which the mehg thg ratios could increase from 5 to 10 to 60 to 80 after water storage st louis et al 2004 the operations of dams posed key effects on hg methylation in the yellow river 3 2 mercury distribution in two phases in the yellow river average dissolved thg particulate thg and spm were 31 27 ng l 1 242 79 ng g 1 and 99 64 mg l 1 in spring and 27 45 ng l 1 246 29 ng g 1 and 2976 86 mg l 1 in summer for the main stream respectively for branches they were 21 40 ng l 1 166 75 ng g 1 695 08 mg l 1 in spring and 45 49 ng l 1 88 42 ng g 1 and 11 089 75 mg l 1 in summer respectively significant correlations of spm and unfiltered thg were confirmed p 0 001 both in mainstream and branches which shows that spatial and seasonal variation of thg in water column might be attributed mainly to the variations in spm concentrations shown by field photos in figs s2 and s3 for example among all the six pre and post dam sites the longyangxia and xiaolangdi dams had higher percentages of dissolved thg fig 3 as indicated by the clear water and low spm concentrations upstream and downstream the dams compared with sanmenxia table s3 compared to summer in spring the sanmenxia dam also had a retention effect and the spm concentrations were extremely low however since the dissolved thg concentrations were also low at this site 3 0 ng l 1 upstream the dam and 1 9 ng l 1 downstream the dam the percentage of particulate thg increased slightly but remained low in summer because of the higher location of the drainage gate relative to the sediment gate the water released downstream of the dam at that time was from upper layer of water before the dam as a result the particulate matter content was lower than that before the dam the concentration of particulate thg was lower than that before the dam and the concentration of dissolved thg was higher than that before the dam the changes in thg and the percentage of the particulate state upstream and downstream the dam corresponded significantly to the particulate matter retention effect of the dam as a result it might be not proper to discuss particulate hg by the volume concentration ng l 1 in this study mass concentration ng g 1 was applied table s4 based on the measured values we found that the logkd for thg in the mainstream of the yellow river were 4 08 0 63 and 4 01 0 61 in spring and summer respectively whereas that in the tributaries of the yellow river were 3 84 0 42 and 3 55 0 69 in spring and summer respectively overall the logkd values of the mainstream were higher than those of the tributaries generally the flows in the tributaries were faster than those in the mainstream in addition the particles in the tributaries of the yellow river are often eroded from natural sources and have larger particle sizes and smaller surface areas thus it is difficult to reach the equilibrium state between the solid and liquid phases and a large amount of dissolved thg remains in the water phase and does not enter the particulate phase in previous studies the logkd of many rivers was found to be approximately 4 5 such as for the churchill river 4 5 mackenzie river 4 6 and yukon river 4 3 lamborg et al 2016 noh et al 2013 quémerais et al 1999 studies conducted in 16 river mouths in china showed that the mean logkd value was 4 3 0 39 liu 2019 these studies also indicated that there is an extremely significant negative correlation between logkd and spm considering that the sediment load in the yellow river is much higher than the global average and much higher than that of other rivers in china the logkd in this study should be lower than those results in this study the logkd values for both the mainstream and branches of the yellow river were significantly negatively correlated with spm p 0 001 fig 4 a and logthg p 0 001 fig 4b combining the two results we can link spm and thg in the river by using the logkd value as a bridge fig 4c after regressing the values we obtain the following equations 6 log t h g y r 0 47 log s p m y r 0 69 r 2 0 57 7 log t h g b r 0 78 log s p m b r 0 49 r 2 0 82 where yr and br represent the mainstream and branches respectively these equations can be used to predict the thg concentration by spm in addition because the logkd values could also be predicted by spm it is possible to estimate the dissolved and particulate thg concentrations from spm similar regulations have been reported by previous studies on rivers both at continental level liu et al 2021c and worldwide liu et al 2021b 3 3 thg and mehg transport in the yellow river without sediment regulation sediment regulation was not conducted in 2017 si 1 this study simulated thg transport in 2017 based on a river transport model we quantified the inputs of thg and mehg fluxes to the mainstream yellow river from each tributary using measured concentrations and runoff and sediment load data from the sediment bulletin in the mainstream yellow river a segment is defined as the space between two sampling points the variations in the thg and mehg fluxes from the beginning to the end of the segment originated from five known components namely transport to the downstream tributary input the above two components were calculated from actual measurements dam interception water consumption and diversion of water and sediment in 2017 the yellow river transported a total of 0 54 t of thg fig 5 a and 14 9 kg of mehg to the bohai sea fig 6 the fluxes of thg and mehg to the sea from the yellow river were much lower than those transported in the middle reaches of the river the maximum transport fluxes of thg and mehg in the yellow river in 2017 were located at tongguan station and were spatially consistent with the highest values of sediment load in the yellow river in that year the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea contributed during the humid period accounted for 81 1 and 36 3 of the total flux that year respectively and the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea contributed by the particulate state accounted for 77 0 and 46 3 of the total flux that year respectively the runoff and sediment load during the dry period at river mouth in 2017 were higher than those in the humid period thereby leading to a higher mehg flux in the dry period than in the humid period whereas the thg flux in the humid period was still higher than that in the dry period because the concentration of particulate thg in the humid period was higher than that in the dry period among all the yellow river tributaries the input of thg 3527 kg from the wuding river was much higher than that of the other rivers which was largely attributed to the sediment load caused by the floods in 2017 when approximately two times the sediment of the weihe river was remitted to the yellow river in the year however because the runoff of the weihe and taohe rivers was much higher than that of the other tributaries their mehg inputs were significantly higher than those of the other tributaries in contrast the mehg input from the wuding river was limited because it has lower runoff and most of the sediment input from the wuding river originated from eroded soil which has a low mehg content in the mainstream yellow river the xiaolangdi dam sequestered the majority of the thg flux whereas the sanmenxia dam had a limited sequestration effect with most of the thg flux passing through the dam in the absence of sediment regulation in 2017 most of the thg in the river was sequestered in the xiaolangdi dam and did not enter the downstream channel table s5 however huayuankou station which is immediately downstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir had a high thg flux with an increase of more than 2000 kg after removing the influence of tributary inputs it is conceivable that in this section of the river the clear water released from xiaolangdi upstream the annual sediment post xiaolangdi in that year was only 2 0 105 t 0 2 of the 1 1 108 t of sediment post sanmenxia whereas the runoff in these sections was very similar flushed the particulate matter silted up in the riverbed into the water 5 8 106 t of sediment load at huayuankou station in 2017 in addition the thg flux at huayuankou station was not just from flushing because a maximum dissolved thg concentration of 146 0 ng l 1 was monitored at this station in spring which was much higher than the mainstream average of 31 3 ng l 1 in spring anthropogenic sources within this segment also contributed to the high thg concentration due to the dense population and industrial development from luoyang to zhengzhou in 2017 1510 kg and 7769 kg of thg was silted before the sanmenxia and xiaolangdi dams respectively this is an extremely high deposition flux which is comparable to the annual hg deposition flux of all natural lakes in china 11 4 t yu et al 2021b in the up and mid reaches much water has been consumed for agricultural use which caused some hg loss table s6 in the lower reaches of the yellow river after the xiaolangdi dam the yellow river has almost no more water replenishment from tributaries and its runoff and sediment load are in a net decrease process a large amount of river water is introduced into the channels on both sides of the river yrcc 2020 on the one hand the diversion of water has significantly reduced the runoff of the yellow river downstream and on the other hand it has simultaneously removed a large amount of suspended sediment as well as particulate hg from the river channel table s7 in 2017 the downstream diversion reduced thg and mehg in the yellow river by 1937 kg and 62 8 kg respectively which was the main reason for the dissipation of hg fluxes in the lower yellow river the diverted fluxes of thg and mehg exceeded the fluxes into the sea similar to the dams diversion also greatly and decisively changed the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea in the yellow river in 2017 we also found a significant increase in the downstream mehg flux compared with the upper reaches the lower reaches of the yellow river have lower channel ratios and a quiescent water flow thus mehg exchange between the sediment water interface is more likely to occur downstream the more quiescent water flow is less likely to stir up the sediment thereby leaving the sediment in a stable reductive environment which is also conducive to microbial methylation yu et al 2021b the calculations of the amount of hg trapped by dams and reduced by diversion are provided in si 5 and si 6 3 4 thg and mehg transport in the yellow river with sediment regulation sediment regulation restarted in 2018 si 1 thg fluxes to the sea in 2018 was calculated based on two samples collected at the river mouth and we estimated the hg transport in other stations in 2018 based on the logkd values then corrected them using the measured samples si 7 the main differences in the thg transport processes in the yellow river between a typical regulation year and a non regulation year are described via a comparison between 2017 and 2018 fig 5b compared with that in 2017 the most important change in the transport of thg in the yellow river in 2018 was that the impact of the sanmenxia dam on the thg flux changed from net deposition to net release a total of 1060 kg of thg was net sequestered by the sanmenxia dam in 2017 whereas 5584 kg of thg was net released by the sanmenxia dam in 2018 however the xiaolangdi reservoir remained in net siltation in 2018 sequestering 7649 kg of thg which was similar to the 7769 kg sequestered in 2017 in 2018 with regulation there was a significant increase in the thg and mehg fluxes to the sea from the yellow river and the increase in the particulate state was much higher than that in the dissolved state for the up and mid streams tributary inputs decreased for wuding river and increased for weihe river and the water consumption volumes were nearly same to those in 2017 table s6 and the thg losses due to water consumption in 2017 and 2018 were similar to each other meanwhile below xiaolangdi the diversion project removed 3744 kg of thg from the yellow river channel in 2018 compared with that in 2017 the thg flux removed from the lower reaches of the yellow river 3744 kg was doubled but it was low compared with the flux from the yellow river to the sea 9752 kg this indicated that in the years when the sediment regulation project was implemented although the diversion still affected the yellow river seaward hg flux it was no longer a decisive factor owing to the significant increase in downstream runoff due to regulation the others term in the lower yellow river below huayuankou station changed from a negative value in 2017 to a positive value in 2018 the siltation of thg to the river channel in the mainstream below huayuankou decreased in 2018 compared with that in 2017 and might have changed from net siltation to net flushing this indicates that regulation was successful in its goal of flushing the whole river channeldownstream of the downstream changes in several other sections are also worthy of attention in the tuoketuo to longmen segment the net siltation in 2017 changed to net flushing in 2018 which might be related to the flood in wuding river in 2017 in 2018 the thg and mehg fluxes to sea rose up to 9752 and 39 2 kg based on two field samples which was approximately 18 and 2 6 times of the fluxes in 2017 respectively this research pointed out that sediment regulation significantly affects the flux of pollutants to the sea which has already been reported by previous studies the nutrient flux from the yellow river to the bohai sea was 8 20 times higher during sediment regulation liu et al 2011 after sediment regulation started in 2002 the chlorophyll content of the bohai sea increased significantly in summer and autumn even exceeding that in spring thereby changing the previous pattern that the spring chlorophyll content was the highest among the four seasons ding et al 2020 as a result the high algal productivity might be linked to hg methylation in situ in the estuary tsui et al 2010 3 5 riverine thg flux to the sea the natural conditions temperature and precipitation and anthropogenic factors sediment regulation and water diversion in the yellow river basin varied greatly in different years which could have led to significant differences in the runoff and sediment load to the sea reflecting the impact of the yellow river on the fate of hg in the bohai sea and yellow sea using only the thg fluxes into the sea measured in 2017 and 2018 is clearly insufficient from 2006 to 2019 the yellow river transferred an annual average of 4 3 2 9 t of thg to the bohai sea of which 3 8 2 7 t was in the particulate state accounting for 90 fig 7 there was a trough in the thg flux to the sea from 2014 to 2017 whereas in 2018 and 2019 the two highest values were identified previous studies have estimated the flux of thg to the sea in the yellow river to be 1300 1660 t y 1 which is even higher than that to the sea in the amazon basin the world s largest basin zhang et al 2015 another estimate was 9 9 t in 2016 of which only 0 1 t was in the dissolved state and the remaining was in the particulate state liu et al 2021c however based on field investigations in this study these results are debatable according to the monthly runoff and sediment load in 2016 the yellow river discharged 0 18 t and 0 63 t of thg in the dissolved and particulate states respectively in this study the difference between this result and those of previous studies mainly originated from the particulate state this is because the sediment content of the yellow river is much higher than that of major rivers worldwide the logkd values measured in this study were much lower than the global average amos et al 2014 and the regression values from the estuarine waters of 16 rivers in china liu et al 2021c however the fluxes in 2018 and 2019 in this study were all between 9 0 t and 10 0 t and the 14 y average hg flux in this study 4 3 2 9 t was comparable to the result of 9 9 t liu et al 2021b this study concluded that the particulate hg fluxes to the sea in the yellow river have been overestimated by previous authors and the flux cannot be calculated based on the dissolved concentration and general logkd the thg fluxes to the sea from the yangtze and xijiang rivers the main tributaries of the pearl river in 2016 were 46 t and 7 0 t respectively liu et al 2021c comparing them with the multi year average the yellow river can be ranked approximately third on average or as the second largest hg exporting river in regulation years in china the runoff in the yellow river is much lower than that in the xijiang river and the yellow river has a much lower flux of dissolved thg and much higher flux of particulate thg compared with those of the xijiang river 5 8 t and 1 2 t respectively the unstable fluctuation of the thg transport flux in the yellow river is mainly due to the variations in runoff and sediment load which are significantly impacted by anthropogenic hydro activities such as dams sediment regulation and downstream diversion in addition the yellow river has high hg transport compared with rivers with similar runoff table s8 for the bohai sea in 2017 the input of the yellow river was the major hg source accounting for more than 95 of all river inputs or more than 55 of all hg sources yu 2021 4 conclusions this study found that anthropogenic facilities and activities could significantly affect hg transport in the yellow river overall the thg and mehg concentrations in the yellow river and its tributaries were high compared with those of other major rivers in china and worldwide especially in the particulate state and extremely high mehg thg ratios up to 50 were found in the reservoirs of the river the thg and mehg concentrations were significantly correlated with spm ph do and redox potential the river discharged substantial amounts of thg 0 54 t and mehg 14 9 kg into the adjacent sea in 2017 and the particulate state in the humid period was responsible for a large proportion of the annual thg flux the mehg flux was mainly in the dry period and in the dissolved state however the thg flux to the sea increased to 9 8 t in 2018 this alteration was primarily attributed to the altered hydrology caused by sediment regulation substantial amounts of hg were impounded in the reservoirs and only a small fraction was discharged downstream of the reservoir in the non regulation years sediment regulation induced remarkable resuspension of this trapped hg in the reservoirs and downstream segments of the river and had a significant effect on the segments upstream of the dams mercury fluxes to the adjacent sea were impacted by downstream water diversion in non regulation years whereas the contributions of diversions in regulation years were small this research indicates that sediment regulation enhances the hg burden on the bohai sea and finds that previous studies have overestimated the particulate hg flux to the adjacent seas in high sediment rivers such as the yellow river the results of this research can provide helpful references for other high sediment rivers especially for which heavy anthropogenic facilities have been constructed the enhanced burden of hg in the bohai sea by sediment regulation should draw more attention this work

16209,haloacetaldehydes hals are the third largest disinfection by product dbp ubiquitously detected in finished drinking water and have relatively higher toxicity than currently regulated dbps to efficiently alleviate them this study investigated a green chemical free technology by using ultraviolet vacuum ultraviolet uv vuv on degrading three refractory chlorinated hals cl hals the results indicate that the rates of cl hals decomposition in tap water irradiated by uv vuv were 23 70 times higher than those irradiated by uv proving that vuv instead of uv played the key role in degrading cl hals increasing cl hals dosage ph and dissolved oxygen do all decreased the cl hals degradations significantly and the rates in tap water were apparently lower than those in ultrapure water unlike previous studies this study proved that both oxidation and reduction were present during the vuv process photooxidation via oxidative radicals like oh mineralized cl hals leading to substantial drops of total organic carbon photoreduction via reductive radicals like h dehalogenated cl hals resulting in formation of considerable intermediate organics e g formic acid and acetic acid no matter what pathway the mass balances of chlorine were always maintained meaning that dehalogenation occurred instantaneously rather than sequentially although the overall photodegradation rates dropped with rising ph and do photoreduction was increased with rising ph while photooxidation was elevated with rising do the results hence provide insights to better understand the vuv technology in controlling micropollutants in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words haloacetaldehydes vuv hydroxyl radical advanced reduction process advanced oxidation process 1 introduction disinfection by products dbps formed in drinking water disinfection process is a growing concern because of their potential adverse health effects jeong et al 2015 richardson et al 2007 to date over 700 individual dbps have been identified and many of them are cytotoxic genotoxic teratogenic or carcinogenic crebelli et al 1984 1990 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2002 2010 2004 richardson et al 2007 warr et al 1993 after the regulated dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals are the third most abundant and frequently detected dbp group krasner et al 2006 weinberg et al 2002 and hals are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude more toxic than thms and haas wagner and plewa 2017 hence the occurrence of hals in drinking water have raised considerable attention among hals dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloroacetaldehyde tcal are commonly present in drinking water and the toxicities of chlorinated hals cl hals were generally ranked as monochloroacetaldehyde mcal dcal tcal jeong et al 2015 for example it was once reported that tcal was present in over 95 0 of disinfected samples in canada with the highest concentration being 263 0 µg l williams et al 1997 under the u s epa information collection rule tcal s median and maximum concentrations were 1 7 and 46 0 µg l respectively mcguire et al 2003 in a chinese survey study the average levels of dcal and tcals in treated water were 3 0 and 7 8 µg l respectively wang et al 2019 in order to prevent their potential toxicity china and japan governments have promulgated the maximum contaminant limits mcls of tcal as 10 and 30 µg l respectively standards for drinking water quality in japan 2003 standards for drinking water quality in china 2006 thus it is necessary to control cl hals in drinking water to safeguard human health ultraviolet uv photolysis and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have emerged as promising technologies for destroying organic contaminants from water wang et al 2020b xiao et al 2014 zare afifi and blatchley 2016 in literatures some uv technologies employing medium pressure mercury uv lamp hansen et al 2013 low pressure mercury uv lamp gan et al 2019 uv assisted with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chuang et al 2016 and uv in tandem with peroxymonosulfate pms zhang et al 2021 have been studied before to degrade tcal however the ability of uv alone i e without adding any additives catalysts is unsatisfying in terms of cost efficiency hansen et al 2013 huang et al 2021 while additive catalyst assisted uv processes are often expensive and complicated to operate or difficult to recover catalyst so there are desires to search for greener handier and more robust methods for micropollutants removal now recently vacuum uv vuv as a robust and chemical free method for degrading micropollutants has gained considerable interests xie et al 2018 the most common source for vuv radiation is low pressure mercury vapor lamp that emits both 185 nm vuv 10 0 of power output and 254 nm uv 90 0 of power output oppenländer 2007 unlike other uv based technologies vuv photons can generate a series of radicals in situ by water homolysis and ionization processes reaction 2 without adding any additives or catalysts buxton et al 1988 zoschke et al 2014 thus making it appealing to users the in situ generated radicals include not only oxidative radicals like hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 but also reductive radicals like solvated electron e aq and hydrogen radical h buxton et al 1988 because reductive radicals e aq and h could be scavenged by dissolved oxygen do in water reaction 4 ma et al 2011 vuv technology is often regarded as an aop that can oxidize pesticides moussavi et al 2014 pharmaceuticals and personal care products kim and tanaka 2009 iodinated dbps hu et al 2019 parachlorophenol laurent et al 1993 and taste and odor compounds kutschera et al 2009 only in a few studies researchers regarded vuv as a reduction tool such as trichloroacetic acid moussavi and rezaei 2017 and dichloroacetonitrile photolysis kiattisaksiri et al 2016 wu et al 2020 despite so no study has ever applied vuv for cl hals removal nor examined systematically the ability of vuv in treating micropollutant on varying operating conditions before thus leaving some knowledge gaps to be filled reaction 1 h 2 o h ν 185 nm oh h φ 0 33 reaction 2 h 2

understand the vuv technology this study is intended to 1 examine the ability of vuv in removing three commonly found cl hals known to be refractory based on earlier uv studies chuang et al 2016 2 understand some factors affecting the cl hals degradation efficiencies of vuv including cl hals dosage ph do and water matrix 3 identify the general products and pathways of the vuv photodegradation processes and 4 elucidate the roles importance of oxidative and reductive radicals on the cl hals degradations under varying ph and do conditions 2 methods and experiments 2 1 chemical reagents all reagents used in this study were analytical grade and purchased from aladdin inc or sigma aldrich co ltd and samples were prepared using ultrapure water with an electrical resistance of 18 2 mω cm tcal was selected because it was regulated and extensively studied before which make efficiency comparison of different methods possible mcal and dcal were selected as they were proven to be more refractory to uv huang et al 2021 and more toxic than tcal jeong et al 2015 each cl hal compound was dissolved in ultrapure water to obtain stock solution at 1 0 g l level and was stocked at 4 0 c in the dark methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 were used for hals extraction prior to measurement according to the epa method 551 sodium hydroxide naoh was prepared to adjust solution ph the stock solution of h2o2 1 0 g l was made by dilution of 30 0 w w h2o2 solution inorganic ions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were obtained from corresponding sodium salts 2 2 photoreactor and operation procedure all experiments were conducted in a column shape photoreactor the reactor is shown in fig s1 in brief a stainless steel sterilizer with a length of 320 mm and a water volume of 450 ml was used the lamp was surrounded by a quartz sleeve with a diameter of 23 mm a 12 w low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 185 nm and 254 nm uv named as vuv lamp herein was purchased from uv tec co china and was installed in the middle of the reactor for uv tests the vuv lamp was replaced by an uv lamp containing the same power input but emitting only 254 nm uv named as uv lamp the photonic intensity was estimated to be 0 6 μeinstein l s for the 185 nm vuv and 13 5 μeinstein l s for the 254 nm uv according to literature methods wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the optical path length of the uv lamp was determined to be 1 6 cm in a control study the h2o2 formation capacities by two types of lamps were compared fig s2 which shows that only the lamp emitting vuv can yield noticeable h2o2 meaning that only uv cannot generate oh because h2o2 is an indicator of oh presence the solution ph was adjusted by naoh without using buffer to avoid introducing other anions e g phosphorous into water and interfering with subsequent analyses the do concentration in fresh ultrapure water was approximately 8 5 mg l at 20 0 c similar to an earlier study yang and jonsson 2014 for low do tests the do level was reduced to approximately 1 5 0 5 mg l by bubbling nitrogen gas n2 prior to tests and continuously pumping n2 on the surface of water along tests to prevent reoxygenation of water all experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room with a temperature of 20 0 c in dark no significant hydrolysis of the three cl hals was observed even at a high solution temperature of 45 c blank and duplicate experiments were conducted for all tests the error bars shown in figures of this study represent standard deviations of at least duplicate tests analysis of variance anova tests were performed using spss software version 26 to test the significance of influencing factors with a threshold of α 0 05 i e p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of mcal dcal and tcal were determined by using a gas chromatographer gc 580 perkinelmer clarus america equipped with a zb 624 analytical column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm and an electron capture detector according to the us epa method 551 1 the potential photolysis products of cl hals including acetic acid aa formic acid fa and chloride were measured by an ion chromatography ic ic 2010 tosoh inc japan equipped with an as 15 150 mm 3 mm column and both conductivity and uv spd 20a shimadzu japan detectors h2o2 was analyzed by the same ic in which h2o2 was deprotonated to hydroperoxyl ion ho2 at a ph higher than its acid dissociation coefficient pka 11 6 followed by separation of ho2 by ic column and quantification of h2o2 by the uv detector at 210 nm wavelength song et al 2017 the method detection limit of h2o2 was 3 µg l the total organic carbon toc content was measured by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu inc japan according to the us epa method 415 3 and ph was determined by a ph meter le438 mettler toledo switzerland do content was monitored by an optical sensor starter 400d ohaus usa which was not interfered by most aqueous compounds under the conditions of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis kinetics to distinguish the roles of uv and vuv fig 1 a firstly demonstrates the degradations of 20 0 µg l cl hals dosed into a real typical tap water under both uv vuv and uv systems as observed 91 1 of cl hals were degraded by uv vuv within 20 min whereas less than 10 4 of cl hals were degraded by uv by simulating them into pseudo first order kinetics it was found that the rate constants k derived from vuv treatment were 23 70 times higher than those derived from uv irradiation in an earlier study it was reported that it took 1 2 h to achieve 90 0 removal of 20 0 µg l cl hals by uv in ultrapure water huang et al 2021 which is longer than the time required for vuv in this study too proving that 185 nm vuv is indeed more robust in degrading cl hals than 254 nm uv among cl hals mcal dcal and tcal have similar decay rates but no consistent trend which was somehow unexpected considering that they have increasing numbers of chlorine atoms this suggests that their decays cannot be simply explained by single electron withdrawing or electron donating process but by both oxidation electron withdrawing and reduction electron donating processes driven by multiple types of reactive species to have a preliminary comparison of different photolysis processes the half lives of tcal from a series of uv based studies were summarized supporting information text s1 given that time based kinetics may have bias due to the lamp differences time based rate constant k unit s 1 was converted to fluence based rate constant k f k uv fluence rate unit s 1 cm2mj 1 or mw cm 2 to allow better comparison of efficiencies among different processes in this study the k f values of vuv in the tap water were 1 8 10 4 2 2 10 4 and 3 0 10 4 cm2 mj 1 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively the k f of tcal was lower than that 7 1 10 4 cm2 mj 1 of uv h2o2 process which was obtained by degrading 1 6 µg l tcal at ph 5 5 chuang et al 2016 for the uv pms process the k f of tcal was 4 4 10 4 cm2 mj 1 for decomposing 1 65 mg l tcal using 50 µm pms zhang et al 2021 which was slightly greater than that of vuv too interestingly the k f of 200 µg l tcal degradation was very high 6 7 10 3 cm2 mj 1 in water irradiated by a special medium pressure uv lamp which emits mostly vuv hansen et al 2013 although the experimental conditions of studies vary significantly and therefore those data may not be comparable the vuv technology has been shown to comparable in efficiency to these conventional advanced uv processes while the obvious advantage of vuv is its chemical free feature 3 2 influencing factors to test the applicability of uv vuv technology in real samples the potential influences of several factors were investigated including water matrix cl hals dosage solution ph and do on the photodegradation performance given that the photodegradations of 20 0 µg l cl hals in ultrapure water by vuv were too fast to measure kinetics 99 removal within 3 min data not shown the water samples were dosed with a high concentration of cl hals i e 10 mg l to obtain k values of cl hals in ultrapure water fig 1b which is also conducive to identify as many as possible reaction products as observed although the concentrations of cl hals dosed into ultrapure water were 500 times higher than those dosed into tap water the k values derived from uv vuv in ultrapure water were only slightly higher than those in tap water 3 2 1 water matrix in this section the photodegradation efficiencies of three cl hals dosed into ultrapure water tap water and lake water separately were compared the water quality characteristics of samples are presented in table s1 as shown in fig 2 a the k values of mcal dcal and tcal in tap water were lowered by 81 1 82 0 and 65 3 respectively than those in ultrapure water indicating that the overall effect of tap water matrix on cl hals photodegradation is inhibitive the reason may be ascribed to the presence of abundant ions in tap water which are described as tds table s1 as they might scavenge oh e g chloride and bicarbonate react with oh and generate lowly reactive radicals hu et al 2019 in comparison the k values of mcal dcal and tcal in lake water were 87 2 88 4 and 88 4 lower than those in pure water respectively even smaller than the k values in tap water the stronger inhibition effect might be due to the higher level of dissolved natural organic matter dom nom in terms of non purgeable organic carbon npoc in lake water and its corresponding high absorbance of vuv not to mention that nom may act as oh scavenger hu et al 2019 3 2 2 cl hals dosage as cl hals exist in varying concentrations in different water samples huang et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 krasner et al 2006 wang et al 2019 and the impacts of pollutants dosage could be either facilitative or inhibitive for different compounds under different photolysis processes wang et al 2020a this study examined the impacts of cl hals dosage on the vuv ability in treating cl hals as can be observed from fig 2b the k values were lowered by 29 1 39 0 and 28 4 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively when the cl hals dosages increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mg l the finding indicates that higher levels of cl hals led to lower ability of vuv probably because cl hals and their reaction intermediate products compete for incident irradiation verma and sillanpää 2015 or radicals generated in the process han et al 2004 however it also suggests that trace cl hals which often occur in real samples at µg l levels are expected to be degraded even faster than the findings of this study so that the treatment efficiencies reported herein at mg l levels may underestimate rather than overestimate the ability of vuv technology in controlling micropollutants like cl hals this can be also confirmed by the extremely rapid degradation of 20 0 µg l cl hals in ultrapure water 99 in 3 min data not shown 3 2 3 ph as seen from fig 2c increasing ph from 6 8 to 10 0 decreased the k values by 27 0 27 6 and 30 6 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively indicating that increasing ph is overall detrimental to cl hals degradations since the impacts of direct photolysis via uv and vuv are negligible the decreases of photolysis ability at high ph can only be attributed to the evolutions of reactive species on the one hand it was reported that h with reduction potential of 2 3 v can be shifted to e aq with reduction potential of 2 9 v when ph exceeds 9 7 reactions 3 buxton et al 1988 wu et al 2020 which can accelerate the removals of cl hals on the other hand the oxidation potential of oh can drop from 2 38 v at acidic condition to 1 55 v under alkaline condition nosaka and nosaka 2017 thus lowering the oxidations of cl hals in this study since the net effects of rising ph were inhibitive to cl hals photodegradations it suggests that the oxidative radical oh is more sensitive to ph rise than the reductive radicals h e aq in the vuv process in earlier studies the photodegradations of iodinated dbps hu et al 2019 sulfamethazine li et al 2017 and methylene blue li et al 2016 in uv vuv process were depressed by increasing ph too suggesting that they may share similar reaction mechanisms reaction 6 oh oh h 2 o 2 reaction 7 oh ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 reaction 8 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h notably increasing ph is able to enhance carbon dioxide co2 dissolution from atmosphere and produce bicarbonate and carbonate anions in water which are known oh scavengers patra et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 so the inhibited vuv performance at increasing ph may be attributed to oh consumption partly by hydroxide anion and partly by carbonate bicarbonate anions 3 2 4 dissolved oxygen do in water is an important factor that can either promote or inhibit the degradation of contaminants in many processes kiattisaksiri et al 2016 so this study compared a high level 8 5 0 5 mg l and a low level 1 5 0 5 mg l of do to understand the effect of do on cl hals photodegradation as shown in fig 2d the k values of mcal dcal and tcal at high do were lower than those at low do by 22 7 10 9 and 19 1 respectively as h and e aq cannot be depleted by o2 under low do condition reactions 4 and 5 arany et al 2013 bielski 1984 they may help reduce more cl hals at low do than that at high do similar phenomenon was reported in dichloroacetonitrile degradation by vuv which also found that increasing do exerted a negative effect on vuv performance kiattisaksiri et al 2016 in addition it was once confirmed that 8 0 mg l of o2 can consume 90 of h and e aq but cannot alter oh content wu et al 2020 so the reductive radicals favored low do and consequently facilitated cl hals photodegradations at low do water 3 3 reaction products and pathways 3 3 1 chlorine balance herein the photodegradation pathways of cl hals were determined by quantifying as many as possible intermediate and end products to the best of our experimental ability fig 3 and fig 4 present the chlorine cl and carbon c mass balances for the cl hals photodegradations at both high and low do levels as observed the contents of cl kept increasing and equaled to the decreases of cl hals so that the amounts of total chlorine cltotal a sum of parent and daughter cl containing compounds maintained almost constant with over 95 5 recoveries throughout the whole processes regardless of do levels and cl hal types this indicates that the c cl bonds in cl hals were cleaved instantaneously and completely rather than sequentially or partially in the uv vuv process in an earlier study employing uv pms for tcal degradation cl balances were also reported zhang et al 2021 suggesting that many oxidative radicals like oh and so4 can contribute to c cl ruptures in cl hals 3 3 2 carbon balance fig 3 and fig 4 also show the evolutions of carbon containing species during the cl hals photodegradations at high and low do levels the amounts of calculated total organic carbon toccal a sum of measurable individual organic compounds and measured toc tocdet a measure of nonpurgeable toc both decreased synchronously and similarly along time under high do conditions meaning that cl hals photodegradation was mainly caused by mineralization under such conditions which resulted in formation of mostly chloride and carbon dioxide but little nondetectable intermediate organics in contrast much lower removals of tocdet were observed at low do water than those at high do water although the degradation degrees of cl hals were elevated the reduced tocdet could be ascribed to the relatively weaker oxidation ability of process at lower do than that at high do fig 2d in addition there were huge gaps between tocdet and toccal and the gaps increased within first 10 15 min and decreased later implying that many intermediate organic products were produced in the beginning stage of irradiation processes and then they were decomposed later under the low do conditions the gaps between toccal and tocdet at low do generally followed the order of mcal dcal tcal suggesting that intermediate organics are more likely formed in lowly halogenated compounds 3 3 2 individual products both fa and aa were observed during the mcal degradation process at high do water fig 3a but only fa was found at low do water fig 4a the concentrations of fa and aa increased within the first 6 min and then dropped until they became undetectable after 30 min irradiation since aa was derived from c cl cleavage but not c c bond breakage while fa formation was derived from both c cl and c c bonds cleavages the absence of aa at low do suggests relatively faster and synchronous c c and c cl cleavages at low do than that at high do compared to mcal dcal photolysis produced noticeable fa but little aa in both high and low do waters while tcal photodegradation did not yield fa or aa at all notably the degradation of tcal did not yield dcal or mcal and the degradations of dcal did not yield mcal either confirming aforementioned results that c cl bonds were cleaved instantaneously rather than stepwise these differences in small molecular intermediate products suggest slight differences of reaction pathways among cl hals which might merit exploration too in the future to help better understand the pathways of vuv process the products of this study with a few literature findings were also compared in one uv pms study tcal degradation was reported to be accomplished by h abstraction carbon oxidation oh substitution and dehalogenation processes according to the wiberg bond orders thus resulting in final products of cl co2 and h2o zhang et al 2021 it is believed that chemical bonds with lower bond energies c cl c c c h o h c o are easier to be broken so that the photodegradation pathways of halogenated dbps may involve photoinduced homolysis solvent induced gemination hydrolysis and formation of c o groups which are expected to produce hydrogen halides hx x means chloride bromide and iodide and non halogenated organic acids rcooh r refers to functional groups like h cn conh2 no2 cho or cooh lei et al 2021 however these references did not consider the impacts of do which may partially explain why those estimations are different from the finding of this study for example when oh attacks c cl and c c bonds to liberate cl from mcal it forms little carbonous residue however when electron withdrawing aldehyde group cho reacts with nucleophilic o2 to form carboxyl group zhang et al 2021 and carbon centered radicals ch2cho through h abstraction process the ch2cho may produce aa kwok et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 in contrast mcal degradation under low do condition proceeded with cleavage of c cl bond first by e aq attack wu et al 2020 and then cleavage of c c bond and hydroxylation to produce fa goldberg et al 1995 maier et al 1998 pliego and almeida 1999 the fact that aa was not generated at low do was due to the lack of o2 which is produced by the reaction between oxygen and e aq and or h wu et al 2020 3 4 presences and roles of radicals among different dbps it was reported that dbps with decreasing numbers of halogen substitution often have higher oh reaction rate constants chuang et al 2016 lei et al 2021 yet lower susceptibility to uv direct photolysis huang et al 2021 therefore the degradation of mcal is expected to be faster than that of tcal if cl hals are decomposed mainly by oh or slower if they are mainly degraded by uv however this study did not observe a clear trend among cl hals under all experimental conditions implying that multiple mechanisms including vuv induced photooxidation photoreduction and direct uv vuv photolysis may coexist in the degradation processes in theory since the concentrations of cl hals are low and 185 nm vuv photons are mostly absorbed by water see supporting information text s2 direct photolysis of cl hals by vuv is less likely to be the main mechanism responsible for the degradations of cl hals 6 3 fig s3 hence vuv induced reactive species should play important roles on degrading cl hals in this study however identifying and quantifying radicals in a complicated vuv system are difficult so the radicals in the system were assessed by two separate approaches one is to verify the presences of radicals and the other is to distinguish the contributions of radicals 3 4 1 verification of radicals presences to prove the copresences of contrasting radicals in the cl hals degradation processes the formation of two characteristic products specific to typical oxidative and reductive radicals were analyzed given that h2o2 can be formed by oh recombination and upon irradiation of h2o2 by uv it forms oh an appearance of h2o2 was selected to evidence the presence of oh li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 as presented in fig s4a the degradations of cl hals by uv vuv have simultaneously formed considerable amounts of h2o2 reaching up to 1 6 1 3 and 0 5 mg l respectively for mcal dcal tcal thus proving the presence of oh in this system surprisingly the levels of h2o2 formed in the presence of cl hals were even higher than those in the absence of cl hals regardless of ph fig s5 suggesting that h2o2 was generated not only by vuv directly but also by other formation pathways indirectly e g o2 du et al 2021 wang et al 2021 among cl hals the trends of maximum h2o2 formation levels were generally opposite to the trends of mineralization rates i e ktoc fig s5 meaning that less chlorinated compound tend not to be mineralized but to form h2o2 the differences among cl hals regarding their mineralization rates and h2o2 formation trends are hard to explain currently which may merit more researches in the future similarly the presences of h and or e aq were confirmed by monitoring the conversions from no3 to no2 in ultrapure water irradiated by vuv similar to another study han and mohseni 2020 as shown in fig s4b the concentrations of no3 first went down and then rose back meanwhile no2 was formed with a trend exactly opposite to the changes of no3 meaning that nearly 100 conversion of no3 into no2 in theory 254 nm uv photolysis of no3 is also able to produce no2 however the specific yields of no2 were 25 even under favorable high ph 11 condition mack and bolton 1999 hence the complete conversions from no3 into no2 in vuv photolysis process confirmed the presences of reductive radicals like h and or e aq reaction 4 and 5 reactions 9 11 gonzalez and braun 1995 1996a 1996b mack and bolton 1999 yang et al 2021 of course as no2 could react with oh to generate no2 reaction 12 and do could scavenge no3 2 to form no2 reaction 13 which can be converted back to no3 han and mohseni 2020 no2 was formed first and transformed back to no3 later among cl hals the maximum no2 was observed for mcal fig s4b which also caused the highest formation of h2o2 this relationship somehow confirms that o2 as a product of reaction of e aq and o2 also contributed to h2o2 formation du et al 2021 reaction 9 n o 3 h n o 3 h n o 2 o h reaction 10 no 3 e aq n o 3 2 h 2 o n o 2 2 o h reaction 11 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h reaction 12 n o 2 oh n o 2 o h reaction 13 n o 3 2 o 2 n o 2 o 2 note that although many explanations in this study involve oxidative and reductive radicals the concentrations of radicals are unable to be quantified by scavengers or probes because coexisting radicals can self destruct and interconvert among each other rapidly in such complicated system han et al 2004 wang et al 2020c even though their copresences can be proven by advanced methods like electron spin resonance esr or electron paramagnetic resonance epr techniques which are very expensive in equipment and consumables they reached the same purpose as above while quantifications of radicals are still impossible ranguelova and mason 2011 wang et al 2021 so it is unnecessary to apply these costly approaches 3 4 2 roles of radicals in varying ph conditions in order to explore the contributions of different reactive species on the degradations of cl hals at varying ph levels 6 8 8 5 and 10 0 in the uv vuv system the trends of h2o2 formation were firstly evaluated as can be seen from fig s6 the formation potentials of h2o2 generally decreased as initial ph increased suggesting that there was a descending availability of oh for h2o2 formation with rising ph which consequently weakened the oxidation capacity of the system since solution ph always decreased along time fig s7 it is speculated that the irradiation process had produced many acidic compounds meanwhile fig s8 shows the mitigation rates of both cl hals and toc with the differences between cl hals and toc at low ph ph 6 8 and 8 5 being smaller than those at ph 10 0 which confirms that cl hals degradation was achieved mainly by photooxidation at low ph but by photoreduction at high ph next the k values of each contributor to the cl hals removals were compared specifically the contribution of photooxidation was determined by the mineralization rate the role of 254 nm uv photolysis was obtained by experimental control tests the role of 185 nm vuv direct photolysis was deemed negligible supporting information text s2 and the role of photoreduction was calculated by the difference between total degradation and the sum of photooxidation and 254 nm uv fig 5 shows that the overall k values were generally decreased by 27 0 27 6 and 30 1 while the mineralization rates dropped by 71 5 62 5 and 30 6 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively when ph increased from 6 8 to 10 0 in the uv vuv system the relatively higher decreases of photooxidation rate than the overall photodegradation rate decreases mean that photoreduction was enhanced when ph increased especially when ph was above 9 7 buxton et al 1988 as a result the contributions of photoreduction for mcal dcal tcal decomposition were 22 1 9 7 and 4 8 at ph 6 8 respectively but significantly raised to 69 7 53 2 and 32 5 at ph 10 0 3 4 3 roles of radicals in varying do conditions similar to above analyses in varying ph conditions the roles of radicals on the photodegradations of three cl hals at varying do levels 8 5 0 5 vs 1 5 0 5 mg l were studied by comparing the changes of ph h2o2 toc and cl hals in the uv vuv system as shown in figure s9 the solution ph decreased in the first 6 min before it reached steady state for the two initial do waters similar to those at different initial ph water because the ph values of solutions were always smaller than 9 7 h was supposed to be the major reductive radicals in the tested vuv system fig s10 shows that the concentrations of h2o2 generated at high do were significantly higher than those at low do suggesting that higher oxidation ability exists in higher do water shen et al 2011 in terms of cl hals degradations fig s11 shows that the rates of cl hals removals in low do water were higher than those in high do water whereas the rates of toc mineralization were opposite these phenomena indicate that decreasing do disfavored photooxidation but favored photoreduction and overall photodegradation of cl hals fig 6 shows that when do concentration rose from 1 5 to 8 5 mg l the degradation rates of cl hals dropped by 22 7 10 9 and 19 1 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively whereas the corresponding photooxidation rates increased by 62 1 57 6 and 47 1 respectively which matches well with the increasing h2o2 formation at high do as for photoreduction as h rapidly reacted with do to form less reactive radical o2 at high do it is reasonable to see decreasing reducing ability and lower photoreduction on the cl hals degradation specifically for ph of 6 8 the contributions of photoreduction on mcal dcal tcal degradation were 76 1 65 4 and 56 0 respectively at do of 1 5 mg l but substantially dropped to 22 1 9 7 and 4 7 at do of 8 5 mg l since the enhancement of photooxidation was insufficient to offset the reduction of photoreduction the removals of cl hals degradation were decreased with rising do 4 conclusions in general this study evaluated a green chemical technology i e uv vuv on degrading three cl hals under varying conditions and influencing factors through this study not only the robustness but also the tenability of vuv were proven specific conclusions are achieved as following degrading cl hals by uv vuv photolysis was highly efficient and environment friendly while over 91 1 cl hals were degraded by uv vuv in a tap water less than 10 0 of cl hals were decomposable by uv only within 20 min the time based half life was the lowest of all tested uv based processes reported before and the fluence based rate constants were similar or comparable to other uv additive processes increasing cl hals dosage ph and do decreased the photodegradation rates for the uv vuv irradiation process in addition the cl hals degradations were lower in tap and lake waters than that in ultrapure water chloride was the only chlorine containing reaction product and the mass balances of cl were always maintained along time regardless of do levels and cl hal types suggesting that c cl bond was cleaved instantaneously rather than sequentially for the tested cl hals in contrast the mass balances of carbon were not met well for all samples the toc mitigations were synchronous to cl hals photodegradations at high do water forming little intermediate organics however huge gaps were observed at low do water meaning formation of substantial intermediate organics under this condition by tracking the formation of h2o2 and no2 the copresence of oxidizing radicals like oh and reducing radicals like h e aq was qualitatively confirmed increasing ph increased h e aq while increasing do increased oh which matched well with the trends of cl hals and toc removals unlike conventional esr epr technology the radicals verification approach is cheaper and equally trustworthy which is useful for such complicated system both photooxidation and photoreduction contributed significantly to the cl hals degradations while photooxidation dominated under high do and or low ph conditions photoreduction dominated under low do and or high ph conditions meanwhile the differences among cl hals regarding their overall degradation mineralization h2o2 and no2 formation trends may merit more researches in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16209,haloacetaldehydes hals are the third largest disinfection by product dbp ubiquitously detected in finished drinking water and have relatively higher toxicity than currently regulated dbps to efficiently alleviate them this study investigated a green chemical free technology by using ultraviolet vacuum ultraviolet uv vuv on degrading three refractory chlorinated hals cl hals the results indicate that the rates of cl hals decomposition in tap water irradiated by uv vuv were 23 70 times higher than those irradiated by uv proving that vuv instead of uv played the key role in degrading cl hals increasing cl hals dosage ph and dissolved oxygen do all decreased the cl hals degradations significantly and the rates in tap water were apparently lower than those in ultrapure water unlike previous studies this study proved that both oxidation and reduction were present during the vuv process photooxidation via oxidative radicals like oh mineralized cl hals leading to substantial drops of total organic carbon photoreduction via reductive radicals like h dehalogenated cl hals resulting in formation of considerable intermediate organics e g formic acid and acetic acid no matter what pathway the mass balances of chlorine were always maintained meaning that dehalogenation occurred instantaneously rather than sequentially although the overall photodegradation rates dropped with rising ph and do photoreduction was increased with rising ph while photooxidation was elevated with rising do the results hence provide insights to better understand the vuv technology in controlling micropollutants in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words haloacetaldehydes vuv hydroxyl radical advanced reduction process advanced oxidation process 1 introduction disinfection by products dbps formed in drinking water disinfection process is a growing concern because of their potential adverse health effects jeong et al 2015 richardson et al 2007 to date over 700 individual dbps have been identified and many of them are cytotoxic genotoxic teratogenic or carcinogenic crebelli et al 1984 1990 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2002 2010 2004 richardson et al 2007 warr et al 1993 after the regulated dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals are the third most abundant and frequently detected dbp group krasner et al 2006 weinberg et al 2002 and hals are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude more toxic than thms and haas wagner and plewa 2017 hence the occurrence of hals in drinking water have raised considerable attention among hals dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloroacetaldehyde tcal are commonly present in drinking water and the toxicities of chlorinated hals cl hals were generally ranked as monochloroacetaldehyde mcal dcal tcal jeong et al 2015 for example it was once reported that tcal was present in over 95 0 of disinfected samples in canada with the highest concentration being 263 0 µg l williams et al 1997 under the u s epa information collection rule tcal s median and maximum concentrations were 1 7 and 46 0 µg l respectively mcguire et al 2003 in a chinese survey study the average levels of dcal and tcals in treated water were 3 0 and 7 8 µg l respectively wang et al 2019 in order to prevent their potential toxicity china and japan governments have promulgated the maximum contaminant limits mcls of tcal as 10 and 30 µg l respectively standards for drinking water quality in japan 2003 standards for drinking water quality in china 2006 thus it is necessary to control cl hals in drinking water to safeguard human health ultraviolet uv photolysis and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have emerged as promising technologies for destroying organic contaminants from water wang et al 2020b xiao et al 2014 zare afifi and blatchley 2016 in literatures some uv technologies employing medium pressure mercury uv lamp hansen et al 2013 low pressure mercury uv lamp gan et al 2019 uv assisted with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chuang et al 2016 and uv in tandem with peroxymonosulfate pms zhang et al 2021 have been studied before to degrade tcal however the ability of uv alone i e without adding any additives catalysts is unsatisfying in terms of cost efficiency hansen et al 2013 huang et al 2021 while additive catalyst assisted uv processes are often expensive and complicated to operate or difficult to recover catalyst so there are desires to search for greener handier and more robust methods for micropollutants removal now recently vacuum uv vuv as a robust and chemical free method for degrading micropollutants has gained considerable interests xie et al 2018 the most common source for vuv radiation is low pressure mercury vapor lamp that emits both 185 nm vuv 10 0 of power output and 254 nm uv 90 0 of power output oppenländer 2007 unlike other uv based technologies vuv photons can generate a series of radicals in situ by water homolysis and ionization processes reaction 2 without adding any additives or catalysts buxton et al 1988 zoschke et al 2014 thus making it appealing to users the in situ generated radicals include not only oxidative radicals like hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 but also reductive radicals like solvated electron e aq and hydrogen radical h buxton et al 1988 because reductive radicals e aq and h could be scavenged by dissolved oxygen do in water reaction 4 ma et al 2011 vuv technology is often regarded as an aop that can oxidize pesticides moussavi et al 2014 pharmaceuticals and personal care products kim and tanaka 2009 iodinated dbps hu et al 2019 parachlorophenol laurent et al 1993 and taste and odor compounds kutschera et al 2009 only in a few studies researchers regarded vuv as a reduction tool such as trichloroacetic acid moussavi and rezaei 2017 and dichloroacetonitrile photolysis kiattisaksiri et al 2016 wu et al 2020 despite so no study has ever applied vuv for cl hals removal nor examined systematically the ability of vuv in treating micropollutant on varying operating conditions before thus leaving some knowledge gaps to be filled reaction 1 h 2 o h ν 185 nm oh h φ 0 33 reaction 2 h 2

understand the vuv technology this study is intended to 1 examine the ability of vuv in removing three commonly found cl hals known to be refractory based on earlier uv studies chuang et al 2016 2 understand some factors affecting the cl hals degradation efficiencies of vuv including cl hals dosage ph do and water matrix 3 identify the general products and pathways of the vuv photodegradation processes and 4 elucidate the roles importance of oxidative and reductive radicals on the cl hals degradations under varying ph and do conditions 2 methods and experiments 2 1 chemical reagents all reagents used in this study were analytical grade and purchased from aladdin inc or sigma aldrich co ltd and samples were prepared using ultrapure water with an electrical resistance of 18 2 mω cm tcal was selected because it was regulated and extensively studied before which make efficiency comparison of different methods possible mcal and dcal were selected as they were proven to be more refractory to uv huang et al 2021 and more toxic than tcal jeong et al 2015 each cl hal compound was dissolved in ultrapure water to obtain stock solution at 1 0 g l level and was stocked at 4 0 c in the dark methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 were used for hals extraction prior to measurement according to the epa method 551 sodium hydroxide naoh was prepared to adjust solution ph the stock solution of h2o2 1 0 g l was made by dilution of 30 0 w w h2o2 solution inorganic ions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were obtained from corresponding sodium salts 2 2 photoreactor and operation procedure all experiments were conducted in a column shape photoreactor the reactor is shown in fig s1 in brief a stainless steel sterilizer with a length of 320 mm and a water volume of 450 ml was used the lamp was surrounded by a quartz sleeve with a diameter of 23 mm a 12 w low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 185 nm and 254 nm uv named as vuv lamp herein was purchased from uv tec co china and was installed in the middle of the reactor for uv tests the vuv lamp was replaced by an uv lamp containing the same power input but emitting only 254 nm uv named as uv lamp the photonic intensity was estimated to be 0 6 μeinstein l s for the 185 nm vuv and 13 5 μeinstein l s for the 254 nm uv according to literature methods wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the optical path length of the uv lamp was determined to be 1 6 cm in a control study the h2o2 formation capacities by two types of lamps were compared fig s2 which shows that only the lamp emitting vuv can yield noticeable h2o2 meaning that only uv cannot generate oh because h2o2 is an indicator of oh presence the solution ph was adjusted by naoh without using buffer to avoid introducing other anions e g phosphorous into water and interfering with subsequent analyses the do concentration in fresh ultrapure water was approximately 8 5 mg l at 20 0 c similar to an earlier study yang and jonsson 2014 for low do tests the do level was reduced to approximately 1 5 0 5 mg l by bubbling nitrogen gas n2 prior to tests and continuously pumping n2 on the surface of water along tests to prevent reoxygenation of water all experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room with a temperature of 20 0 c in dark no significant hydrolysis of the three cl hals was observed even at a high solution temperature of 45 c blank and duplicate experiments were conducted for all tests the error bars shown in figures of this study represent standard deviations of at least duplicate tests analysis of variance anova tests were performed using spss software version 26 to test the significance of influencing factors with a threshold of α 0 05 i e p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of mcal dcal and tcal were determined by using a gas chromatographer gc 580 perkinelmer clarus america equipped with a zb 624 analytical column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm and an electron capture detector according to the us epa method 551 1 the potential photolysis products of cl hals including acetic acid aa formic acid fa and chloride were measured by an ion chromatography ic ic 2010 tosoh inc japan equipped with an as 15 150 mm 3 mm column and both conductivity and uv spd 20a shimadzu japan detectors h2o2 was analyzed by the same ic in which h2o2 was deprotonated to hydroperoxyl ion ho2 at a ph higher than its acid dissociation coefficient pka 11 6 followed by separation of ho2 by ic column and quantification of h2o2 by the uv detector at 210 nm wavelength song et al 2017 the method detection limit of h2o2 was 3 µg l the total organic carbon toc content was measured by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu inc japan according to the us epa method 415 3 and ph was determined by a ph meter le438 mettler toledo switzerland do content was monitored by an optical sensor starter 400d ohaus usa which was not interfered by most aqueous compounds under the conditions of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis kinetics to distinguish the roles of uv and vuv fig 1 a firstly demonstrates the degradations of 20 0 µg l cl hals dosed into a real typical tap water under both uv vuv and uv systems as observed 91 1 of cl hals were degraded by uv vuv within 20 min whereas less than 10 4 of cl hals were degraded by uv by simulating them into pseudo first order kinetics it was found that the rate constants k derived from vuv treatment were 23 70 times higher than those derived from uv irradiation in an earlier study it was reported that it took 1 2 h to achieve 90 0 removal of 20 0 µg l cl hals by uv in ultrapure water huang et al 2021 which is longer than the time required for vuv in this study too proving that 185 nm vuv is indeed more robust in degrading cl hals than 254 nm uv among cl hals mcal dcal and tcal have similar decay rates but no consistent trend which was somehow unexpected considering that they have increasing numbers of chlorine atoms this suggests that their decays cannot be simply explained by single electron withdrawing or electron donating process but by both oxidation electron withdrawing and reduction electron donating processes driven by multiple types of reactive species to have a preliminary comparison of different photolysis processes the half lives of tcal from a series of uv based studies were summarized supporting information text s1 given that time based kinetics may have bias due to the lamp differences time based rate constant k unit s 1 was converted to fluence based rate constant k f k uv fluence rate unit s 1 cm2mj 1 or mw cm 2 to allow better comparison of efficiencies among different processes in this study the k f values of vuv in the tap water were 1 8 10 4 2 2 10 4 and 3 0 10 4 cm2 mj 1 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively the k f of tcal was lower than that 7 1 10 4 cm2 mj 1 of uv h2o2 process which was obtained by degrading 1 6 µg l tcal at ph 5 5 chuang et al 2016 for the uv pms process the k f of tcal was 4 4 10 4 cm2 mj 1 for decomposing 1 65 mg l tcal using 50 µm pms zhang et al 2021 which was slightly greater than that of vuv too interestingly the k f of 200 µg l tcal degradation was very high 6 7 10 3 cm2 mj 1 in water irradiated by a special medium pressure uv lamp which emits mostly vuv hansen et al 2013 although the experimental conditions of studies vary significantly and therefore those data may not be comparable the vuv technology has been shown to comparable in efficiency to these conventional advanced uv processes while the obvious advantage of vuv is its chemical free feature 3 2 influencing factors to test the applicability of uv vuv technology in real samples the potential influences of several factors were investigated including water matrix cl hals dosage solution ph and do on the photodegradation performance given that the photodegradations of 20 0 µg l cl hals in ultrapure water by vuv were too fast to measure kinetics 99 removal within 3 min data not shown the water samples were dosed with a high concentration of cl hals i e 10 mg l to obtain k values of cl hals in ultrapure water fig 1b which is also conducive to identify as many as possible reaction products as observed although the concentrations of cl hals dosed into ultrapure water were 500 times higher than those dosed into tap water the k values derived from uv vuv in ultrapure water were only slightly higher than those in tap water 3 2 1 water matrix in this section the photodegradation efficiencies of three cl hals dosed into ultrapure water tap water and lake water separately were compared the water quality characteristics of samples are presented in table s1 as shown in fig 2 a the k values of mcal dcal and tcal in tap water were lowered by 81 1 82 0 and 65 3 respectively than those in ultrapure water indicating that the overall effect of tap water matrix on cl hals photodegradation is inhibitive the reason may be ascribed to the presence of abundant ions in tap water which are described as tds table s1 as they might scavenge oh e g chloride and bicarbonate react with oh and generate lowly reactive radicals hu et al 2019 in comparison the k values of mcal dcal and tcal in lake water were 87 2 88 4 and 88 4 lower than those in pure water respectively even smaller than the k values in tap water the stronger inhibition effect might be due to the higher level of dissolved natural organic matter dom nom in terms of non purgeable organic carbon npoc in lake water and its corresponding high absorbance of vuv not to mention that nom may act as oh scavenger hu et al 2019 3 2 2 cl hals dosage as cl hals exist in varying concentrations in different water samples huang et al 2017 koudjonou et al 2008 krasner et al 2006 wang et al 2019 and the impacts of pollutants dosage could be either facilitative or inhibitive for different compounds under different photolysis processes wang et al 2020a this study examined the impacts of cl hals dosage on the vuv ability in treating cl hals as can be observed from fig 2b the k values were lowered by 29 1 39 0 and 28 4 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively when the cl hals dosages increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mg l the finding indicates that higher levels of cl hals led to lower ability of vuv probably because cl hals and their reaction intermediate products compete for incident irradiation verma and sillanpää 2015 or radicals generated in the process han et al 2004 however it also suggests that trace cl hals which often occur in real samples at µg l levels are expected to be degraded even faster than the findings of this study so that the treatment efficiencies reported herein at mg l levels may underestimate rather than overestimate the ability of vuv technology in controlling micropollutants like cl hals this can be also confirmed by the extremely rapid degradation of 20 0 µg l cl hals in ultrapure water 99 in 3 min data not shown 3 2 3 ph as seen from fig 2c increasing ph from 6 8 to 10 0 decreased the k values by 27 0 27 6 and 30 6 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively indicating that increasing ph is overall detrimental to cl hals degradations since the impacts of direct photolysis via uv and vuv are negligible the decreases of photolysis ability at high ph can only be attributed to the evolutions of reactive species on the one hand it was reported that h with reduction potential of 2 3 v can be shifted to e aq with reduction potential of 2 9 v when ph exceeds 9 7 reactions 3 buxton et al 1988 wu et al 2020 which can accelerate the removals of cl hals on the other hand the oxidation potential of oh can drop from 2 38 v at acidic condition to 1 55 v under alkaline condition nosaka and nosaka 2017 thus lowering the oxidations of cl hals in this study since the net effects of rising ph were inhibitive to cl hals photodegradations it suggests that the oxidative radical oh is more sensitive to ph rise than the reductive radicals h e aq in the vuv process in earlier studies the photodegradations of iodinated dbps hu et al 2019 sulfamethazine li et al 2017 and methylene blue li et al 2016 in uv vuv process were depressed by increasing ph too suggesting that they may share similar reaction mechanisms reaction 6 oh oh h 2 o 2 reaction 7 oh ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 reaction 8 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h notably increasing ph is able to enhance carbon dioxide co2 dissolution from atmosphere and produce bicarbonate and carbonate anions in water which are known oh scavengers patra et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 so the inhibited vuv performance at increasing ph may be attributed to oh consumption partly by hydroxide anion and partly by carbonate bicarbonate anions 3 2 4 dissolved oxygen do in water is an important factor that can either promote or inhibit the degradation of contaminants in many processes kiattisaksiri et al 2016 so this study compared a high level 8 5 0 5 mg l and a low level 1 5 0 5 mg l of do to understand the effect of do on cl hals photodegradation as shown in fig 2d the k values of mcal dcal and tcal at high do were lower than those at low do by 22 7 10 9 and 19 1 respectively as h and e aq cannot be depleted by o2 under low do condition reactions 4 and 5 arany et al 2013 bielski 1984 they may help reduce more cl hals at low do than that at high do similar phenomenon was reported in dichloroacetonitrile degradation by vuv which also found that increasing do exerted a negative effect on vuv performance kiattisaksiri et al 2016 in addition it was once confirmed that 8 0 mg l of o2 can consume 90 of h and e aq but cannot alter oh content wu et al 2020 so the reductive radicals favored low do and consequently facilitated cl hals photodegradations at low do water 3 3 reaction products and pathways 3 3 1 chlorine balance herein the photodegradation pathways of cl hals were determined by quantifying as many as possible intermediate and end products to the best of our experimental ability fig 3 and fig 4 present the chlorine cl and carbon c mass balances for the cl hals photodegradations at both high and low do levels as observed the contents of cl kept increasing and equaled to the decreases of cl hals so that the amounts of total chlorine cltotal a sum of parent and daughter cl containing compounds maintained almost constant with over 95 5 recoveries throughout the whole processes regardless of do levels and cl hal types this indicates that the c cl bonds in cl hals were cleaved instantaneously and completely rather than sequentially or partially in the uv vuv process in an earlier study employing uv pms for tcal degradation cl balances were also reported zhang et al 2021 suggesting that many oxidative radicals like oh and so4 can contribute to c cl ruptures in cl hals 3 3 2 carbon balance fig 3 and fig 4 also show the evolutions of carbon containing species during the cl hals photodegradations at high and low do levels the amounts of calculated total organic carbon toccal a sum of measurable individual organic compounds and measured toc tocdet a measure of nonpurgeable toc both decreased synchronously and similarly along time under high do conditions meaning that cl hals photodegradation was mainly caused by mineralization under such conditions which resulted in formation of mostly chloride and carbon dioxide but little nondetectable intermediate organics in contrast much lower removals of tocdet were observed at low do water than those at high do water although the degradation degrees of cl hals were elevated the reduced tocdet could be ascribed to the relatively weaker oxidation ability of process at lower do than that at high do fig 2d in addition there were huge gaps between tocdet and toccal and the gaps increased within first 10 15 min and decreased later implying that many intermediate organic products were produced in the beginning stage of irradiation processes and then they were decomposed later under the low do conditions the gaps between toccal and tocdet at low do generally followed the order of mcal dcal tcal suggesting that intermediate organics are more likely formed in lowly halogenated compounds 3 3 2 individual products both fa and aa were observed during the mcal degradation process at high do water fig 3a but only fa was found at low do water fig 4a the concentrations of fa and aa increased within the first 6 min and then dropped until they became undetectable after 30 min irradiation since aa was derived from c cl cleavage but not c c bond breakage while fa formation was derived from both c cl and c c bonds cleavages the absence of aa at low do suggests relatively faster and synchronous c c and c cl cleavages at low do than that at high do compared to mcal dcal photolysis produced noticeable fa but little aa in both high and low do waters while tcal photodegradation did not yield fa or aa at all notably the degradation of tcal did not yield dcal or mcal and the degradations of dcal did not yield mcal either confirming aforementioned results that c cl bonds were cleaved instantaneously rather than stepwise these differences in small molecular intermediate products suggest slight differences of reaction pathways among cl hals which might merit exploration too in the future to help better understand the pathways of vuv process the products of this study with a few literature findings were also compared in one uv pms study tcal degradation was reported to be accomplished by h abstraction carbon oxidation oh substitution and dehalogenation processes according to the wiberg bond orders thus resulting in final products of cl co2 and h2o zhang et al 2021 it is believed that chemical bonds with lower bond energies c cl c c c h o h c o are easier to be broken so that the photodegradation pathways of halogenated dbps may involve photoinduced homolysis solvent induced gemination hydrolysis and formation of c o groups which are expected to produce hydrogen halides hx x means chloride bromide and iodide and non halogenated organic acids rcooh r refers to functional groups like h cn conh2 no2 cho or cooh lei et al 2021 however these references did not consider the impacts of do which may partially explain why those estimations are different from the finding of this study for example when oh attacks c cl and c c bonds to liberate cl from mcal it forms little carbonous residue however when electron withdrawing aldehyde group cho reacts with nucleophilic o2 to form carboxyl group zhang et al 2021 and carbon centered radicals ch2cho through h abstraction process the ch2cho may produce aa kwok et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 in contrast mcal degradation under low do condition proceeded with cleavage of c cl bond first by e aq attack wu et al 2020 and then cleavage of c c bond and hydroxylation to produce fa goldberg et al 1995 maier et al 1998 pliego and almeida 1999 the fact that aa was not generated at low do was due to the lack of o2 which is produced by the reaction between oxygen and e aq and or h wu et al 2020 3 4 presences and roles of radicals among different dbps it was reported that dbps with decreasing numbers of halogen substitution often have higher oh reaction rate constants chuang et al 2016 lei et al 2021 yet lower susceptibility to uv direct photolysis huang et al 2021 therefore the degradation of mcal is expected to be faster than that of tcal if cl hals are decomposed mainly by oh or slower if they are mainly degraded by uv however this study did not observe a clear trend among cl hals under all experimental conditions implying that multiple mechanisms including vuv induced photooxidation photoreduction and direct uv vuv photolysis may coexist in the degradation processes in theory since the concentrations of cl hals are low and 185 nm vuv photons are mostly absorbed by water see supporting information text s2 direct photolysis of cl hals by vuv is less likely to be the main mechanism responsible for the degradations of cl hals 6 3 fig s3 hence vuv induced reactive species should play important roles on degrading cl hals in this study however identifying and quantifying radicals in a complicated vuv system are difficult so the radicals in the system were assessed by two separate approaches one is to verify the presences of radicals and the other is to distinguish the contributions of radicals 3 4 1 verification of radicals presences to prove the copresences of contrasting radicals in the cl hals degradation processes the formation of two characteristic products specific to typical oxidative and reductive radicals were analyzed given that h2o2 can be formed by oh recombination and upon irradiation of h2o2 by uv it forms oh an appearance of h2o2 was selected to evidence the presence of oh li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 as presented in fig s4a the degradations of cl hals by uv vuv have simultaneously formed considerable amounts of h2o2 reaching up to 1 6 1 3 and 0 5 mg l respectively for mcal dcal tcal thus proving the presence of oh in this system surprisingly the levels of h2o2 formed in the presence of cl hals were even higher than those in the absence of cl hals regardless of ph fig s5 suggesting that h2o2 was generated not only by vuv directly but also by other formation pathways indirectly e g o2 du et al 2021 wang et al 2021 among cl hals the trends of maximum h2o2 formation levels were generally opposite to the trends of mineralization rates i e ktoc fig s5 meaning that less chlorinated compound tend not to be mineralized but to form h2o2 the differences among cl hals regarding their mineralization rates and h2o2 formation trends are hard to explain currently which may merit more researches in the future similarly the presences of h and or e aq were confirmed by monitoring the conversions from no3 to no2 in ultrapure water irradiated by vuv similar to another study han and mohseni 2020 as shown in fig s4b the concentrations of no3 first went down and then rose back meanwhile no2 was formed with a trend exactly opposite to the changes of no3 meaning that nearly 100 conversion of no3 into no2 in theory 254 nm uv photolysis of no3 is also able to produce no2 however the specific yields of no2 were 25 even under favorable high ph 11 condition mack and bolton 1999 hence the complete conversions from no3 into no2 in vuv photolysis process confirmed the presences of reductive radicals like h and or e aq reaction 4 and 5 reactions 9 11 gonzalez and braun 1995 1996a 1996b mack and bolton 1999 yang et al 2021 of course as no2 could react with oh to generate no2 reaction 12 and do could scavenge no3 2 to form no2 reaction 13 which can be converted back to no3 han and mohseni 2020 no2 was formed first and transformed back to no3 later among cl hals the maximum no2 was observed for mcal fig s4b which also caused the highest formation of h2o2 this relationship somehow confirms that o2 as a product of reaction of e aq and o2 also contributed to h2o2 formation du et al 2021 reaction 9 n o 3 h n o 3 h n o 2 o h reaction 10 no 3 e aq n o 3 2 h 2 o n o 2 2 o h reaction 11 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h reaction 12 n o 2 oh n o 2 o h reaction 13 n o 3 2 o 2 n o 2 o 2 note that although many explanations in this study involve oxidative and reductive radicals the concentrations of radicals are unable to be quantified by scavengers or probes because coexisting radicals can self destruct and interconvert among each other rapidly in such complicated system han et al 2004 wang et al 2020c even though their copresences can be proven by advanced methods like electron spin resonance esr or electron paramagnetic resonance epr techniques which are very expensive in equipment and consumables they reached the same purpose as above while quantifications of radicals are still impossible ranguelova and mason 2011 wang et al 2021 so it is unnecessary to apply these costly approaches 3 4 2 roles of radicals in varying ph conditions in order to explore the contributions of different reactive species on the degradations of cl hals at varying ph levels 6 8 8 5 and 10 0 in the uv vuv system the trends of h2o2 formation were firstly evaluated as can be seen from fig s6 the formation potentials of h2o2 generally decreased as initial ph increased suggesting that there was a descending availability of oh for h2o2 formation with rising ph which consequently weakened the oxidation capacity of the system since solution ph always decreased along time fig s7 it is speculated that the irradiation process had produced many acidic compounds meanwhile fig s8 shows the mitigation rates of both cl hals and toc with the differences between cl hals and toc at low ph ph 6 8 and 8 5 being smaller than those at ph 10 0 which confirms that cl hals degradation was achieved mainly by photooxidation at low ph but by photoreduction at high ph next the k values of each contributor to the cl hals removals were compared specifically the contribution of photooxidation was determined by the mineralization rate the role of 254 nm uv photolysis was obtained by experimental control tests the role of 185 nm vuv direct photolysis was deemed negligible supporting information text s2 and the role of photoreduction was calculated by the difference between total degradation and the sum of photooxidation and 254 nm uv fig 5 shows that the overall k values were generally decreased by 27 0 27 6 and 30 1 while the mineralization rates dropped by 71 5 62 5 and 30 6 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively when ph increased from 6 8 to 10 0 in the uv vuv system the relatively higher decreases of photooxidation rate than the overall photodegradation rate decreases mean that photoreduction was enhanced when ph increased especially when ph was above 9 7 buxton et al 1988 as a result the contributions of photoreduction for mcal dcal tcal decomposition were 22 1 9 7 and 4 8 at ph 6 8 respectively but significantly raised to 69 7 53 2 and 32 5 at ph 10 0 3 4 3 roles of radicals in varying do conditions similar to above analyses in varying ph conditions the roles of radicals on the photodegradations of three cl hals at varying do levels 8 5 0 5 vs 1 5 0 5 mg l were studied by comparing the changes of ph h2o2 toc and cl hals in the uv vuv system as shown in figure s9 the solution ph decreased in the first 6 min before it reached steady state for the two initial do waters similar to those at different initial ph water because the ph values of solutions were always smaller than 9 7 h was supposed to be the major reductive radicals in the tested vuv system fig s10 shows that the concentrations of h2o2 generated at high do were significantly higher than those at low do suggesting that higher oxidation ability exists in higher do water shen et al 2011 in terms of cl hals degradations fig s11 shows that the rates of cl hals removals in low do water were higher than those in high do water whereas the rates of toc mineralization were opposite these phenomena indicate that decreasing do disfavored photooxidation but favored photoreduction and overall photodegradation of cl hals fig 6 shows that when do concentration rose from 1 5 to 8 5 mg l the degradation rates of cl hals dropped by 22 7 10 9 and 19 1 for mcal dcal and tcal respectively whereas the corresponding photooxidation rates increased by 62 1 57 6 and 47 1 respectively which matches well with the increasing h2o2 formation at high do as for photoreduction as h rapidly reacted with do to form less reactive radical o2 at high do it is reasonable to see decreasing reducing ability and lower photoreduction on the cl hals degradation specifically for ph of 6 8 the contributions of photoreduction on mcal dcal tcal degradation were 76 1 65 4 and 56 0 respectively at do of 1 5 mg l but substantially dropped to 22 1 9 7 and 4 7 at do of 8 5 mg l since the enhancement of photooxidation was insufficient to offset the reduction of photoreduction the removals of cl hals degradation were decreased with rising do 4 conclusions in general this study evaluated a green chemical technology i e uv vuv on degrading three cl hals under varying conditions and influencing factors through this study not only the robustness but also the tenability of vuv were proven specific conclusions are achieved as following degrading cl hals by uv vuv photolysis was highly efficient and environment friendly while over 91 1 cl hals were degraded by uv vuv in a tap water less than 10 0 of cl hals were decomposable by uv only within 20 min the time based half life was the lowest of all tested uv based processes reported before and the fluence based rate constants were similar or comparable to other uv additive processes increasing cl hals dosage ph and do decreased the photodegradation rates for the uv vuv irradiation process in addition the cl hals degradations were lower in tap and lake waters than that in ultrapure water chloride was the only chlorine containing reaction product and the mass balances of cl were always maintained along time regardless of do levels and cl hal types suggesting that c cl bond was cleaved instantaneously rather than sequentially for the tested cl hals in contrast the mass balances of carbon were not met well for all samples the toc mitigations were synchronous to cl hals photodegradations at high do water forming little intermediate organics however huge gaps were observed at low do water meaning formation of substantial intermediate organics under this condition by tracking the formation of h2o2 and no2 the copresence of oxidizing radicals like oh and reducing radicals like h e aq was qualitatively confirmed increasing ph increased h e aq while increasing do increased oh which matched well with the trends of cl hals and toc removals unlike conventional esr epr technology the radicals verification approach is cheaper and equally trustworthy which is useful for such complicated system both photooxidation and photoreduction contributed significantly to the cl hals degradations while photooxidation dominated under high do and or low ph conditions photoreduction dominated under low do and or high ph conditions meanwhile the differences among cl hals regarding their overall degradation mineralization h2o2 and no2 formation trends may merit more researches in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
