13605,water from the yellow river reservoir is treated by dissolved air flotation daf but the flocs formed are loose and easily desorbed to solve this problem a new air flotation process i e posi co coagulation dissolved air flotation posi ccdaf was developed by combining daf with microbubble surface modification technology the feasibility of the posi ccdaf process was verified by using chitosan to modify the surfaces of the microbubbles the optimal dosage ratio of chitosan coagulant was 0 4 and the optimal ph of the reflux water was 6 00 the removal characteristics of organic pollutants under the optimal conditions were studied the removal characteristics of natural organic matter nom with different molecular weights before and after adding chitosan were compared and the removal efficiency of disinfection byproduct precursors was evaluated microscopic analysis was used to observe the bubble floc adhesion process and flocs during the copolymerization process before and after the addition of chitosan the results showed that chitosan promoted the removal of hydrophobic macromolecular organics and the trihalomethane formation potential thmfp by ccdaf on the one hand the surface of modified microbubbles in posi ccdaf was positively charged which provided electrostatic force to enhance the adhesion of flocs during polymerization on the other hand the combination of chitosan and macromolecular organics in water formed a capture network which made the bubble flocs larger and caused them to adhere tightly improving the removal effect of air flotation keywords dissolved air flotation co coagulation dissolved air flotation chitosan modified microbubbles removal characteristics floc structure 1 introduction with economic development pollution along the yellow river is becoming increasingly serious leading to poor water quality in reservoirs in the lower reaches of the yellow river 1 when the temperature rises the growth of algae is accelerated in the nutrient rich water resulting in further deterioration of the water quality 2 the traditional coagulation sedimentation process has a good removal effect with regards to turbidity but the removal effect on organic matter and algae is poor 3 dissolved air flotation daf technology has unique advantages in the removal of algae and other pollutants 4 5 in the flotation process whether the colloidal particles and suspended substances in the water can adhere to the microbubbles mainly depends on the surface properties of the two components 6 the surface zeta potential of the bubbles has a direct impact on the interaction between the bubbles and particles in daf systems in the absence of chemical additives the bubbles in water carry negative charges over a wide range of ph values on the other hand the particles algae and natural organic matter nom in surface water also have negative charges in the normal ph range 7 when microbubbles come into contact with pollutants the electrostatic repulsion between them forms an energy barrier to inhibit collisions and adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs therefore flocculation is usually used as a pretreatment step prior to daf coagulants are added to water to reduce the negative charge on the surfaces of pollutants to overcome electrostatic repulsion and enhance their adhesion to bubbles 8 in recent years researchers have changed the surface properties of pollutants to achieve coagulation and have modified the surfaces of microbubbles by adding cationic chemicals into dissolved air water to obtain microbubbles with a positive charge on the surface thus eliminating the coagulation pretreatment process thus posi daf was born henderson et al 9 10 first performed experiments in which posi daf technology was applied to algal cell flotation and the cationic surfactant ctab and cationic polymer pdadmac were used to modify microbubble the removal efficiency values were 63 and 95 respectively shi et al 11 used chitosan cts modified microbubbles to remove nom from river water as a natural cationic polymer chitosan improved the removal effect of low molecular weight hydrophilic nom without secondary pollution which provided an alternative daf method to enhance the removal of nom posi daf technology achieves a high removal efficiency of algal cells and nom 12 however due to the lack of a coagulation process the particle removal effect is poor and thus it is difficult to practically apply this technology co coagulation dissolved air flotation ccdaf adds dissolved air water to the coagulation process and the bubbles and growing microflocs act together this process not only directly participates in the growth of flocs but also increases the collision and adhesion probability of the two components and reduces the coagulant dosage the microbubbles participate in the flocculation process which only changes the adhesion time between microbubbles and flocs the adhesion mechanism and the firmness between the flocs and microbubbles do not change substantially 13 wang et al 14 used ccdaf to treat water from the yellow river diversion reservoir and achieved better results than those obtained with traditional daf however due to the negative charge on the surfaces of microbubbles the flocs formed by ccdaf are loose and easily desorb during the rising process in this study chitosan was introduced into the air dissolving system to form surface modified bubbles which were introduced into the air flotation cell at the early stage of coagulation to participate in the copolymerization process this technology is called posi co coagulation dissolved air flotation posi ccdaf in this paper the feasibility of posi ccdaf technology was verified the removal efficiency values of turbidity algal cells organic pollutants and thmfp by ccdaf before and after adding chitosan were compared and the removal mechanism of posi ccdaf was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1

dehydrated with ethanol and kept dry in a natural and clean environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 process feasibility verification the turbidity algal cell removal rate and zeta potential of the chitosan modified microbubbles were used to preliminarily verify the feasibility of the process fig 3 a shows that the turbidity removal rate was the highest when the dosage of pafc was 5 mg l and when chitosan was used to modify the microbubbles with the rate increasing from 84 56 89 66 with the addition of chitosan the turbidity removal rate was improved to a certain extent at each pafc dosage in terms of the algal cell removal effect as the coagulant dosage was increased the effect of chitosan on the removal rate became more significant when the dosage of pafc was 1 mg l the removal rate only increased from 53 32 56 87 while when the dosage of pafc increased to 5 mg l it increased from 82 12 90 66 turbidity is sensitive to the effect of chitosan and it has a significant effect when the dosage is low but the effect of chitosan on the removal rate of algal cells is relatively slow although the effects of chitosan modified microbubbles on the turbidity and algal cell removal rates are different at different pafc dosages both parameters have different degrees of improvement under the condition of ph 7 the surfaces of microbubbles without surface modification were negatively charged the average zeta potential was between 48 and 31 mv while that of chitosan modified microbubbles was 20 10 mv according to yap et al 12 the zeta potentials of ctab modified microbubbles and polydadmac modified microbubbles were 47 10 mv and 42 12 mv respectively under the same conditions which indicated that ctab and polydadmac had poor adhesion efficiency on the surface of microbubbles and macromolecules not attached to the microbubbles could easily remain in the water and enter downstream treatment although the surface zeta potential of chitosan modified microbubbles was not high the free chitosan in the dissolved gas reflux water was less which indicates that it is feasible to use chitosan modified microbubbles to improve ccdaf 3 2 optimization of the process parameters the ph of the raw water and the dosage of chitosan will affect the performance and coagulation effects of chitosan and then affect the air flotation effluent in this section the turbidity and doc removal rates under different chitosan dosages and raw water ph conditions were investigated and the optimal chitosan dosage ratio and ph value for posi ccdaf treatment of the yellow river diversion reservoir water were obtained fig 4 shows the change rules of turbidity and doc in the process under different chitosan ch and pafc al dosing ratios the figure indicates that modifying the microbubbles with chitosan effectively improves the removal of turbidity and doc in the raw water at the same dosage ratio as the pafc dosage was increased the enhancement effect of chitosan on the removal rate gradually weakened when the dosage ratio was 0 6 and pafc was dosed at 1 mg l the addition of chitosan increased the turbidity removal rate by 11 6 and the doc removal rate by 5 8 when the dosage of pafc was increased to 5 mg l the removal rates only increased by 5 4 and 4 7 respectively upon increasing the dosage of pafc the removal rate of doc still improved but the turbidity removal rate improvement was very weak at the same dosage of pafc as the chitosan dosage was increased the improvement in the removal rate became more significant after the dosing ratio reached 0 4 the improvement effect of the process on the turbidity and doc removal rates was close to the peak when the dosage of pafc was 5 mg l the removal rates of turbidity and doc increased by 5 1 and 3 9 respectively compared with those without chitosan when the chitosan dosage ratio increased the removal effect of the process was no longer obvious when the dosage ratio reached 0 6 the removal efficiencies of turbidity and doc increased by only 5 3 and 4 7 respectively which are only 0 2 and 0 8 higher than those at a ratio of 0 4 although the removal effect of doc was slightly improved by increasing the dosages of pafc and chitosan the increase was not significant compared with the reagent dosage according to the research of shi et al 11 the optimal turbidity removal rate by posi ccdaf was 6 7 and 3 2 higher than those with conventional dissolved air flotation conv daf and dual coagulant dissolved air flotation duco daf respectively and the optimal removal rate of doc was 12 3 and 6 1 higher than those of conv daf and duco daf respectively these results further confirmed the advantages of posi ccdaf compared with other processes therefore for yellow river diversion reservoir water the most appropriate dosage of pafc is 5 mg l and the most appropriate dosage ratio of chitosan is 0 4 the adhesion effect of chitosan modified microbubbles on particles is strongly dependent on the ph value of the reflux water as the ph has a significant effect on the density of positive ionic charges of chitosan in water 15 16 as shown in fig 5 the removal efficiencies of turbidity and doc by posi ccdaf are higher when the dissolved air water is acidic than when it is alkaline under a low coagulant dosage the turbidity and doc removal rates were significantly improved by reducing the ph value of the dissolved gas return water when the coagulant dosage was 1 mg l the turbidity removal rate and doc removal rate of dissolved air water at a ph of 5 00 were 19 4 and 7 6 higher than those at a ph of 8 00 when the coagulant dosage increased to 5 mg l the turbidity removal rate reached the peak value of 92 1 and when the dissolved air water ph was 5 00 the turbidity removal rate was only 3 3 higher than that at a ph of 8 00 while the doc removal rate increased by 4 5 with increasing pafc dosage the effect of the ph value on the turbidity removal rate was no longer obvious and the trend of the doc removal rate with respect to the ph value gradually weakened the results showed that chitosan had the best strengthening effect on ccdaf when the ph value of the dissolved air return water was 5 00 which was consistent with the research results of shi et al 17 as shown in fig 6 the charge density of chitosan increases sharply with the decrease in the ph and the increase is not obvious when the ph value is less than 5 00 the increase in the charge density leads to the combination of microbubbles with more chitosan molecules under the action of electrostatic force and hydrophobic force resulting in more positively charged surface modified bubbles the electrostatic attraction and bridging effect of chitosan on the one hand promote its copolymerization and adhesion with floc particles on the other hand the microbubbles and negatively charged organic pollutant and algal cell binding can be significantly strengthened the ph value of the raw water was relatively high and a proper amount of acid agent could be added to adjust the ph value however when the reflux ratio of dissolved air was large adjusting the ph value of the dissolved air water to 5 00 would cause the ph value of the air flotation effluent to be lower than 7 00 and the chitosan could ionize more positive charges when the ph value was 6 00 therefore the optimal ph value of the dissolved air return water was set to 6 00 3 3 removal characteristics of organic pollutants the removal characteristics of organic matter can be described from the side reaction mechanism of the process fig 7 reveals that the content of organic matter with a molecular weight of 3 10 kda in queshan reservoir water is relatively large accounting for 45 2 of the total amount and the proportion of organic matter with a molecular weight above 3 kda is 77 4 therefore the organic matter content with higher molecular weight in the raw water was relatively high when the molecular weight was less than 1 kda the removal rate of ccdaf was only 10 3 while the removal rate of posi ccdaf was 15 4 the removal rate of ccdaf increased by 5 1 with the addition of chitosan when the molecular weight was 10 30 kda the removal rate of ccdaf was 47 8 while that of posi ccdaf was 64 3 and the removal rate increased by 16 5 the larger the molecular weight of the organic matter is the higher the removal rate of air flotation is and thus the more significant the improvement in the removal rate by chitosan is this relationship indicates that chitosan modified microbubbles are more likely to adhere to macromolecular organic compounds under copolymerization organics of different molecular weights may have different adhesion mechanisms to surface modified bubbles 18 on the one hand organics with higher molecular weights tend to have stronger hydrophobicity while hydrophobic organics are more likely to combine with microbubbles and chitosan molecules on the surfaces of microbubbles leading to an increase in the removal rate 19 on the other hand the macromolecular organics and chitosan may act as a bond between the microbubbles and flocs in the copolymerization process thus strengthening the adhesion strength between the microbubbles and flocs 20 however hydrophilic organic compounds cannot readily combine with microbubbles under the bridging action of chitosan molecules due to their low molecular weights the positive charge density of chitosan molecules in acidic dissolved air reflux water increases rapidly which causes the surfaces of the microbubbles to be positively charged 21 small molecule organic matter will adhere to the microbubbles under the action of electrostatic force thus improving the removal effect of air flotation fig 8 shows that trichloromethane tcm precursors in the raw water accounted for 79 6 of thmfp followed by dibromochloromethane dbcm 16 4 and bromodichloromethane bdcm 4 when only pafc was added the removal rate of tcm was 39 1 that of dbcm was 11 6 and that of bdcm was 18 8 when the dosage ratio of chitosan was 0 2 ccdaf showed a good removal effect and the removal rates of the three precursors i e tcm dbcm and bdcm reached 46 2 30 3 and 28 9 respectively when the dosage ratio of chitosan was 0 4 the improvement in the removal rate was not significant chitosan had a good enhancement effect on the removal of thmfp by ccdaf the removal rate of tcm was the highest and the removal rates of dbcm and bdcm were similar this result may be attributed to the facts that hydrophobic organics are more likely to produce tcm during the reaction with chlorine 22 23 and that hydrophobic organics are more likely to act as the adhesion medium between microbubbles and flocs under the bridging action of chitosan these results further confirmed the feasibility of the cts posiccdaf process to further study the removal of different types of dissolved organic matter by the process excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to qualitatively analyze the organic matter in the raw water and air flotation effluent the results are shown in fig 9 in fig 9a there are five fluorescence peaks b t1 t2 a and c in the raw water among which t2 is located in zone ii t1 and b are located in zone iv and c and a are both located in zone v 24 the results showed that the types of organic matter in the raw water were rich in which aromatic protein like substances ap like substances and soluble microbial products like substances smp like substances were dominant followed by humus like organic matter in the past few years the water of the yellow river diversion reservoir has been seriously affected by water blooms and industrial pollution resulting in rapid increases in ap like and smp like substances 25 fig 9b shows that when only pafc was added the fluorescence peaks were reduced to varying degrees compared with those of the raw water which indicated that all types of organic compounds in the ccdaf effluent had been effectively removed according to the analysis of fig 9c and d as the chitosan dosage increased peak b did not change significantly while peak a and peak c were effectively reduced indicating that the addition of chitosan modified microbubbles enhanced the removal effect of ccdaf on humic acid and fulvic acid which have high molecular weight and hydrophobicity however peaks t1 and t2 increased slightly and became more significant as the chitosan dosage increased this result may have occurred because the smaller molecular weight chitosan could not float up with the microbubbles resulting in free chitosan passing through the 0 45 μm membrane since chitosan is a type of polysaccharide peak t increased as the chitosan dosage increased 3 4 microscopic analysis of the adhesion process of bubble flocs the in situ dynamic observation and comparison of the adhesion process of microbubbles and floc particles before and after the addition of chitosan were carried out using a self developed microscopic analysis observation system the mechanism by which the cts posiccdaf enhanced the decontamination efficiency was analyzed from a microscopic point of view as shown in fig 10 a the particles were in a colloidal or suspended state before adding the coagulant the colloidal particles had aggregation stability under the action of brownian motion and the charge repulsion force and would not aggregate with each other in the initial settling process shown in fig 10b the particles began to destabilize and aggregate under the electrical neutralization of the coagulant forming small floc particles during the initial coagulation process no more linear or net flocs were formed and the adsorption bridging action between the flocs and coagulants or the net trapping and sweeping effect was weak the destabilization of particles mainly depended on the positive charge of the coagulant fig 10c and d indicate that the bubble flocs formed by conventional bubble copolymerization were smaller although microbubbles also entered the flocs the adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs was loose however the bubble flocs formed by copolymerization of the modified microbubbles had a larger volume the number of adhered microbubbles was larger and the flocs were firmer and denser when dissolved air water was first introduced the particles were not completely destabilized and there was no strong electrostatic attraction or adsorption bridging action between the negatively charged microbubble surfaces and the floc particles therefore the floc particles could not firmly adhere to the surfaces of microbubbles after modifying the surfaces of the microbubbles with chitosan the surfaces of the microbubbles were positively charged which not only provided electrostatic force for adhesion between the bubbles and flocs but also made the adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs more firm moreover the amino groups of chitosan preferentially combined with macromolecular organics with a negative electric potential in water forming a large adhesion network increasing the sweeping area and attachment points of microbubbles and providing bridging action for adhesion between the microbubbles and particles 15 26 27 as shown in fig 10e and f after copolymerization most of the floc particles in the water rose to the surface and were removed and only a small amount of flocs remained when chitosan was not added the residual floc particles were smaller more numerous and looser than those after adding chitosan these residual flocs may have come from two sources i e one source is flocs that did not adhere to and float on the microbubbles successfully during copolymerization and the other is residue caused by desorption from microbubbles during copolymerization after adding chitosan the residual or desorbed flocs were denser which is due to the long chain bridging action of free chitosan molecules which can provide a bridge and link between floc particles and coagulants and macromolecular organic pollutants 3 5 changes in the floc structure before and after adding chitosan to further demonstrate the adhesion mechanism of flocs obtained by microscopic observation the scum surface produced by ccdaf before and after adding chitosan was scanned by sem to intuitively compare and analyze the differences in the scum surface structure sem images of the scum after freeze drying are shown in fig 11 in which the figures labeled 1 show the surface condition of scum produced by ccdaf using only coagulant and the figures labeled 2 show the surface condition of scum produced by ccdaf after modification of the microbubbles with chitosan the magnification is from 1 00 kx to 20 00 kx when the surfaces of the microbubbles were not modified by chitosan the floc surface was smoother fig 11a 1 and the floc clusters were larger and porous with more gaps and uneven structural shapes fig 11b 1 c 1 the surfaces of the flocs mostly exhibited an uneven sheet structure and had a more colloidal morphology fig 11d 1 however after the microbubbles were modified by chitosan the surfaces of the flocs became rough fig 11b 2 mainly exhibiting rod shaped structures fig 11d 2 the surfaces were covered with a layer of flocs fig 11d 2 the pores were reduced fig 11c 2 and the flocs were denser chitosan contains a large number of hydrophobic acetylglucosamine units and the amino groups in its hydrophilic glucosamine units are positively charged after protonation while the microbubbles and hydrophobic macromolecular organic matter in water usually have negative charges thus chitosan can not only adhere firmly to the surface of microbubbles but can also adhere to hydrophobic macromolecular organics in water in fig 11d 2 the large number of flocs covering the particle surface may be a combination of residual chitosan molecules after microbubble rupture and long chains of macromolecular organic matter on the one hand this result shows that most of the chitosan molecules combine with particles through microbubbles and enter the scum layer on the other hand the surfaces of microbubbles and the free long chains of chitosan undergo adsorption bridging and provide a positive charge to overcome electrostatic repulsion which makes the flocs denser however according to the size of the chitosan molecules electrostatic attraction may be the main mechanism for strengthening the adhesion between the microbubbles and particles moreover the chitosan molecules provide more attachment sites for macromolecular organics 20 and the two types of molecules are adsorbed to each other to form a more complex molecular chain network which strengthens the adhesion between the microbubbles and floc particles and between the floc particles in general the surface long chain bridging effect of chitosan modified microbubbles may not be the main mechanism of particle removal and adhesion between chitosan and the particles mainly depends on positive charge modification of the microbubble surface by the chitosan molecules however chitosan molecules can provide more attachment sites for organics and can preferentially combine with hydrophobic macromolecular organics in water to form a more complex long chain network 10 28 thus providing a strong bridging effect between microbubbles and flocs the addition of chitosan makes the formed flocs denser and the microbubbles participate in the copolymerization process causing them to be firmly wrapped in flocs this process increases the difficulty of breakup and desorption and finally enhances the decontamination efficiency of ccdaf 4 conclusion 1 it is feasible to use chitosan surface modified microbubbles in the ccdaf process the zeta potential of chitosan modified microbubbles is stable at 20 10 mv which indicates that the adhesion efficiency of chitosan to microbubbles is high through the optimization of the process parameters when posi ccdaf is used to treat water from the yellow river diversion reservoir the optimal chitosan dosage ratio is ch al 0 4 and the optimal ph value of the reflux water is 6 00 2 chitosan enhanced the removal efficiency of organic pollutants by ccdaf the removal rate increased by 16 5 when the molecular weight was 10 30 kda but increased by only 5 1 when the molecular weight was less than 1 kda the results proved that the removal effect of the process on humic and fulvic acids with high molecular weights and hydrophobicity and tcm in thmfp was significantly improved 3 chitosan strengthens the adhesion force of bubble flocs it combines with macromolecular organics in water to form a capture network which not only provides more attachment sites for particles but also acts as a skeleton posi ccdaf provides a new method to enhance the adhesion of flocs in the process of drinking water treatment by air flotation declaration of competing interest this work was financially supported by the natural science

13605,water from the yellow river reservoir is treated by dissolved air flotation daf but the flocs formed are loose and easily desorbed to solve this problem a new air flotation process i e posi co coagulation dissolved air flotation posi ccdaf was developed by combining daf with microbubble surface modification technology the feasibility of the posi ccdaf process was verified by using chitosan to modify the surfaces of the microbubbles the optimal dosage ratio of chitosan coagulant was 0 4 and the optimal ph of the reflux water was 6 00 the removal characteristics of organic pollutants under the optimal conditions were studied the removal characteristics of natural organic matter nom with different molecular weights before and after adding chitosan were compared and the removal efficiency of disinfection byproduct precursors was evaluated microscopic analysis was used to observe the bubble floc adhesion process and flocs during the copolymerization process before and after the addition of chitosan the results showed that chitosan promoted the removal of hydrophobic macromolecular organics and the trihalomethane formation potential thmfp by ccdaf on the one hand the surface of modified microbubbles in posi ccdaf was positively charged which provided electrostatic force to enhance the adhesion of flocs during polymerization on the other hand the combination of chitosan and macromolecular organics in water formed a capture network which made the bubble flocs larger and caused them to adhere tightly improving the removal effect of air flotation keywords dissolved air flotation co coagulation dissolved air flotation chitosan modified microbubbles removal characteristics floc structure 1 introduction with economic development pollution along the yellow river is becoming increasingly serious leading to poor water quality in reservoirs in the lower reaches of the yellow river 1 when the temperature rises the growth of algae is accelerated in the nutrient rich water resulting in further deterioration of the water quality 2 the traditional coagulation sedimentation process has a good removal effect with regards to turbidity but the removal effect on organic matter and algae is poor 3 dissolved air flotation daf technology has unique advantages in the removal of algae and other pollutants 4 5 in the flotation process whether the colloidal particles and suspended substances in the water can adhere to the microbubbles mainly depends on the surface properties of the two components 6 the surface zeta potential of the bubbles has a direct impact on the interaction between the bubbles and particles in daf systems in the absence of chemical additives the bubbles in water carry negative charges over a wide range of ph values on the other hand the particles algae and natural organic matter nom in surface water also have negative charges in the normal ph range 7 when microbubbles come into contact with pollutants the electrostatic repulsion between them forms an energy barrier to inhibit collisions and adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs therefore flocculation is usually used as a pretreatment step prior to daf coagulants are added to water to reduce the negative charge on the surfaces of pollutants to overcome electrostatic repulsion and enhance their adhesion to bubbles 8 in recent years researchers have changed the surface properties of pollutants to achieve coagulation and have modified the surfaces of microbubbles by adding cationic chemicals into dissolved air water to obtain microbubbles with a positive charge on the surface thus eliminating the coagulation pretreatment process thus posi daf was born henderson et al 9 10 first performed experiments in which posi daf technology was applied to algal cell flotation and the cationic surfactant ctab and cationic polymer pdadmac were used to modify microbubble the removal efficiency values were 63 and 95 respectively shi et al 11 used chitosan cts modified microbubbles to remove nom from river water as a natural cationic polymer chitosan improved the removal effect of low molecular weight hydrophilic nom without secondary pollution which provided an alternative daf method to enhance the removal of nom posi daf technology achieves a high removal efficiency of algal cells and nom 12 however due to the lack of a coagulation process the particle removal effect is poor and thus it is difficult to practically apply this technology co coagulation dissolved air flotation ccdaf adds dissolved air water to the coagulation process and the bubbles and growing microflocs act together this process not only directly participates in the growth of flocs but also increases the collision and adhesion probability of the two components and reduces the coagulant dosage the microbubbles participate in the flocculation process which only changes the adhesion time between microbubbles and flocs the adhesion mechanism and the firmness between the flocs and microbubbles do not change substantially 13 wang et al 14 used ccdaf to treat water from the yellow river diversion reservoir and achieved better results than those obtained with traditional daf however due to the negative charge on the surfaces of microbubbles the flocs formed by ccdaf are loose and easily desorb during the rising process in this study chitosan was introduced into the air dissolving system to form surface modified bubbles which were introduced into the air flotation cell at the early stage of coagulation to participate in the copolymerization process this technology is called posi co coagulation dissolved air flotation posi ccdaf in this paper the feasibility of posi ccdaf technology was verified the removal efficiency

dehydrated with ethanol and kept dry in a natural and clean environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 process feasibility verification the turbidity algal cell removal rate and zeta potential of the chitosan modified microbubbles were used to preliminarily verify the feasibility of the process fig 3 a shows that the turbidity removal rate was the highest when the dosage of pafc was 5 mg l and when chitosan was used to modify the microbubbles with the rate increasing from 84 56 89 66 with the addition of chitosan the turbidity removal rate was improved to a certain extent at each pafc dosage in terms of the algal cell removal effect as the coagulant dosage was increased the effect of chitosan on the removal rate became more significant when the dosage of pafc was 1 mg l the removal rate only increased from 53 32 56 87 while when the dosage of pafc increased to 5 mg l it increased from 82 12 90 66 turbidity is sensitive to the effect of chitosan and it has a significant effect when the dosage is low but the effect of chitosan on the removal rate of algal cells is relatively slow although the effects of chitosan modified microbubbles on the turbidity and algal cell removal rates are different at different pafc dosages both parameters have different degrees of improvement under the condition of ph 7 the surfaces of microbubbles without surface modification were negatively charged the average zeta potential was between 48 and 31 mv while that of chitosan modified microbubbles was 20 10 mv according to yap et al 12 the zeta potentials of ctab modified microbubbles and polydadmac modified microbubbles were 47 10 mv and 42 12 mv respectively under the same conditions which indicated that ctab and polydadmac had poor adhesion efficiency on the surface of microbubbles and macromolecules not attached to the microbubbles could easily remain in the water and enter downstream treatment although the surface zeta potential of chitosan modified microbubbles was not high the free chitosan in the dissolved gas reflux water was less which indicates that it is feasible to use chitosan modified microbubbles to improve ccdaf 3 2 optimization of the process parameters the ph of the raw water and the dosage of chitosan will affect the performance and coagulation effects of chitosan and then affect the air flotation effluent in this section the turbidity and doc removal rates under different chitosan dosages and raw water ph conditions were investigated and the optimal chitosan dosage ratio and ph value for posi ccdaf treatment of the yellow river diversion reservoir water were obtained fig 4 shows the change rules of turbidity and doc in the process under different chitosan ch and pafc al dosing ratios the figure indicates that modifying the microbubbles with chitosan effectively improves the removal of turbidity and doc in the raw water at the same dosage ratio as the pafc dosage was increased the enhancement effect of chitosan on the removal rate gradually weakened when the dosage ratio was 0 6 and pafc was dosed at 1 mg l the addition of chitosan increased the turbidity removal rate by 11 6 and the doc removal rate by 5 8 when the dosage of pafc was increased to 5 mg l the removal rates only increased by 5 4 and 4 7 respectively upon increasing the dosage of pafc the removal rate of doc still improved but the turbidity removal rate improvement was very weak at the same dosage of pafc as the chitosan dosage was increased the improvement in the removal rate became more significant after the dosing ratio reached 0 4 the improvement effect of the process on the turbidity and doc removal rates was close to the peak when the dosage of pafc was 5 mg l the removal rates of turbidity and doc increased by 5 1 and 3 9 respectively compared with those without chitosan when the chitosan dosage ratio increased the removal effect of the process was no longer obvious when the dosage ratio reached 0 6 the removal efficiencies of turbidity and doc increased by only 5 3 and 4 7 respectively which are only 0 2 and 0 8 higher than those at a ratio of 0 4 although the removal effect of doc was slightly improved by increasing the dosages of pafc and chitosan the increase was not significant compared with the reagent dosage according to the research of shi et al 11 the optimal turbidity removal rate by posi ccdaf was 6 7 and 3 2 higher than those with conventional dissolved air flotation conv daf and dual coagulant dissolved air flotation duco daf respectively and the optimal removal rate of doc was 12 3 and 6 1 higher than those of conv daf and duco daf respectively these results further confirmed the advantages of posi ccdaf compared with other processes therefore for yellow river diversion reservoir water the most appropriate dosage of pafc is 5 mg l and the most appropriate dosage ratio of chitosan is 0 4 the adhesion effect of chitosan modified microbubbles on particles is strongly dependent on the ph value of the reflux water as the ph has a significant effect on the density of positive ionic charges of chitosan in water 15 16 as shown in fig 5 the removal efficiencies of turbidity and doc by posi ccdaf are higher when the dissolved air water is acidic than when it is alkaline under a low coagulant dosage the turbidity and doc removal rates were significantly improved by reducing the ph value of the dissolved gas return water when the coagulant dosage was 1 mg l the turbidity removal rate and doc removal rate of dissolved air water at a ph of 5 00 were 19 4 and 7 6 higher than those at a ph of 8 00 when the coagulant dosage increased to 5 mg l the turbidity removal rate reached the peak value of 92 1 and when the dissolved air water ph was 5 00 the turbidity removal rate was only 3 3 higher than that at a ph of 8 00 while the doc removal rate increased by 4 5 with increasing pafc dosage the effect of the ph value on the turbidity removal rate was no longer obvious and the trend of the doc removal rate with respect to the ph value gradually weakened the results showed that chitosan had the best strengthening effect on ccdaf when the ph value of the dissolved air return water was 5 00 which was consistent with the research results of shi et al 17 as shown in fig 6 the charge density of chitosan increases sharply with the decrease in the ph and the increase is not obvious when the ph value is less than 5 00 the increase in the charge density leads to the combination of microbubbles with more chitosan molecules under the action of electrostatic force and hydrophobic force resulting in more positively charged surface modified bubbles the electrostatic attraction and bridging effect of chitosan on the one hand promote its copolymerization and adhesion with floc particles on the other hand the microbubbles and negatively charged organic pollutant and algal cell binding can be significantly strengthened the ph value of the raw water was relatively high and a proper amount of acid agent could be added to adjust the ph value however when the reflux ratio of dissolved air was large adjusting the ph value of the dissolved air water to 5 00 would cause the ph value of the air flotation effluent to be lower than 7 00 and the chitosan could ionize more positive charges when the ph value was 6 00 therefore the optimal ph value of the dissolved air return water was set to 6 00 3 3 removal characteristics of organic pollutants the removal characteristics of organic matter can be described from the side reaction mechanism of the process fig 7 reveals that the content of organic matter with a molecular weight of 3 10 kda in queshan reservoir water is relatively large accounting for 45 2 of the total amount and the proportion of organic matter with a molecular weight above 3 kda is 77 4 therefore the organic matter content with higher molecular weight in the raw water was relatively high when the molecular weight was less than 1 kda the removal rate of ccdaf was only 10 3 while the removal rate of posi ccdaf was 15 4 the removal rate of ccdaf increased by 5 1 with the addition of chitosan when the molecular weight was 10 30 kda the removal rate of ccdaf was 47 8 while that of posi ccdaf was 64 3 and the removal rate increased by 16 5 the larger the molecular weight of the organic matter is the higher the removal rate of air flotation is and thus the more significant the improvement in the removal rate by chitosan is this relationship indicates that chitosan modified microbubbles are more likely to adhere to macromolecular organic compounds under copolymerization organics of different molecular weights may have different adhesion mechanisms to surface modified bubbles 18 on the one hand organics with higher molecular weights tend to have stronger hydrophobicity while hydrophobic organics are more likely to combine with microbubbles and chitosan molecules on the surfaces of microbubbles leading to an increase in the removal rate 19 on the other hand the macromolecular organics and chitosan may act as a bond between the microbubbles and flocs in the copolymerization process thus strengthening the adhesion strength between the microbubbles and flocs 20 however hydrophilic organic compounds cannot readily combine with microbubbles under the bridging action of chitosan molecules due to their low molecular weights the positive charge density of chitosan molecules in acidic dissolved air reflux water increases rapidly which causes the surfaces of the microbubbles to be positively charged 21 small molecule organic matter will adhere to the microbubbles under the action of electrostatic force thus improving the removal effect of air flotation fig 8 shows that trichloromethane tcm precursors in the raw water accounted for 79 6 of thmfp followed by dibromochloromethane dbcm 16 4 and bromodichloromethane bdcm 4 when only pafc was added the removal rate of tcm was 39 1 that of dbcm was 11 6 and that of bdcm was 18 8 when the dosage ratio of chitosan was 0 2 ccdaf showed a good removal effect and the removal rates of the three precursors i e tcm dbcm and bdcm reached 46 2 30 3 and 28 9 respectively when the dosage ratio of chitosan was 0 4 the improvement in the removal rate was not significant chitosan had a good enhancement effect on the removal of thmfp by ccdaf the removal rate of tcm was the highest and the removal rates of dbcm and bdcm were similar this result may be attributed to the facts that hydrophobic organics are more likely to produce tcm during the reaction with chlorine 22 23 and that hydrophobic organics are more likely to act as the adhesion medium between microbubbles and flocs under the bridging action of chitosan these results further confirmed the feasibility of the cts posiccdaf process to further study the removal of different types of dissolved organic matter by the process excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to qualitatively analyze the organic matter in the raw water and air flotation effluent the results are shown in fig 9 in fig 9a there are five fluorescence peaks b t1 t2 a and c in the raw water among which t2 is located in zone ii t1 and b are located in zone iv and c and a are both located in zone v 24 the results showed that the types of organic matter in the raw water were rich in which aromatic protein like substances ap like substances and soluble microbial products like substances smp like substances were dominant followed by humus like organic matter in the past few years the water of the yellow river diversion reservoir has been seriously affected by water blooms and industrial pollution resulting in rapid increases in ap like and smp like substances 25 fig 9b shows that when only pafc was added the fluorescence peaks were reduced to varying degrees compared with those of the raw water which indicated that all types of organic compounds in the ccdaf effluent had been effectively removed according to the analysis of fig 9c and d as the chitosan dosage increased peak b did not change significantly while peak a and peak c were effectively reduced indicating that the addition of chitosan modified microbubbles enhanced the removal effect of ccdaf on humic acid and fulvic acid which have high molecular weight and hydrophobicity however peaks t1 and t2 increased slightly and became more significant as the chitosan dosage increased this result may have occurred because the smaller molecular weight chitosan could not float up with the microbubbles resulting in free chitosan passing through the 0 45 μm membrane since chitosan is a type of polysaccharide peak t increased as the chitosan dosage increased 3 4 microscopic analysis of the adhesion process of bubble flocs the in situ dynamic observation and comparison of the adhesion process of microbubbles and floc particles before and after the addition of chitosan were carried out using a self developed microscopic analysis observation system the mechanism by which the cts posiccdaf enhanced the decontamination efficiency was analyzed from a microscopic point of view as shown in fig 10 a the particles were in a colloidal or suspended state before adding the coagulant the colloidal particles had aggregation stability under the action of brownian motion and the charge repulsion force and would not aggregate with each other in the initial settling process shown in fig 10b the particles began to destabilize and aggregate under the electrical neutralization of the coagulant forming small floc particles during the initial coagulation process no more linear or net flocs were formed and the adsorption bridging action between the flocs and coagulants or the net trapping and sweeping effect was weak the destabilization of particles mainly depended on the positive charge of the coagulant fig 10c and d indicate that the bubble flocs formed by conventional bubble copolymerization were smaller although microbubbles also entered the flocs the adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs was loose however the bubble flocs formed by copolymerization of the modified microbubbles had a larger volume the number of adhered microbubbles was larger and the flocs were firmer and denser when dissolved air water was first introduced the particles were not completely destabilized and there was no strong electrostatic attraction or adsorption bridging action between the negatively charged microbubble surfaces and the floc particles therefore the floc particles could not firmly adhere to the surfaces of microbubbles after modifying the surfaces of the microbubbles with chitosan the surfaces of the microbubbles were positively charged which not only provided electrostatic force for adhesion between the bubbles and flocs but also made the adhesion between the microbubbles and flocs more firm moreover the amino groups of chitosan preferentially combined with macromolecular organics with a negative electric potential in water forming a large adhesion network increasing the sweeping area and attachment points of microbubbles and providing bridging action for adhesion between the microbubbles and particles 15 26 27 as shown in fig 10e and f after copolymerization most of the floc particles in the water rose to the surface and were removed and only a small amount of flocs remained when chitosan was not added the residual floc particles were smaller more numerous and looser than those after adding chitosan these residual flocs may have come from two sources i e one source is flocs that did not adhere to and float on the microbubbles successfully during copolymerization and the other is residue caused by desorption from microbubbles during copolymerization after adding chitosan the residual or desorbed flocs were denser which is due to the long chain bridging action of free chitosan molecules which can provide a bridge and link between floc particles and coagulants and macromolecular organic pollutants 3 5 changes in the floc structure before and after adding chitosan to further demonstrate the adhesion mechanism of flocs obtained by microscopic observation the scum surface produced by ccdaf before and after adding chitosan was scanned by sem to intuitively compare and analyze the differences in the scum surface structure sem images of the scum after freeze drying are shown in fig 11 in which the figures labeled 1 show the surface condition of scum produced by ccdaf using only coagulant and the figures labeled 2 show the surface condition of scum produced by ccdaf after modification of the microbubbles with chitosan the magnification is from 1 00 kx to 20 00 kx when the surfaces of the microbubbles were not modified by chitosan the floc surface was smoother fig 11a 1 and the floc clusters were larger and porous with more gaps and uneven structural shapes fig 11b 1 c 1 the surfaces of the flocs mostly exhibited an uneven sheet structure and had a more colloidal morphology fig 11d 1 however after the microbubbles were modified by chitosan the surfaces of the flocs became rough fig 11b 2 mainly exhibiting rod shaped structures fig 11d 2 the surfaces were covered with a layer of flocs fig 11d 2 the pores were reduced fig 11c 2 and the flocs were denser chitosan contains a large number of hydrophobic acetylglucosamine units and the amino groups in its hydrophilic glucosamine units are positively charged after protonation while the microbubbles and hydrophobic macromolecular organic matter in water usually have negative charges thus chitosan can not only adhere firmly to the surface of microbubbles but can also adhere to hydrophobic macromolecular organics in water in fig 11d 2 the large number of flocs covering the particle surface may be a combination of residual chitosan molecules after microbubble rupture and long chains of macromolecular organic matter on the one hand this result shows that most of the chitosan molecules combine with particles through microbubbles and enter the scum layer on the other hand the surfaces of microbubbles and the free long chains of chitosan undergo adsorption bridging and provide a positive charge to overcome electrostatic repulsion which makes the flocs denser however according to the size of the chitosan molecules electrostatic attraction may be the main mechanism for strengthening the adhesion between the microbubbles and particles moreover the chitosan molecules provide more attachment sites for macromolecular organics 20 and the two types of molecules are adsorbed to each other to form a more complex molecular chain network which strengthens the adhesion between the microbubbles and floc particles and between the floc particles in general the surface long chain bridging effect of chitosan modified microbubbles may not be the main mechanism of particle removal and adhesion between chitosan and the particles mainly depends on positive charge modification of the microbubble surface by the chitosan molecules however chitosan molecules can provide more attachment sites for organics and can preferentially combine with hydrophobic macromolecular organics in water to form a more complex long chain network 10 28 thus providing a strong bridging effect between microbubbles and flocs the addition of chitosan makes the formed flocs denser and the microbubbles participate in the copolymerization process causing them to be firmly wrapped in flocs this process increases the difficulty of breakup and desorption and finally enhances the decontamination efficiency of ccdaf 4 conclusion 1 it is feasible to use chitosan surface modified microbubbles in the ccdaf process the zeta potential of chitosan modified microbubbles is stable at 20 10 mv which indicates that the adhesion efficiency of chitosan to microbubbles is high through the optimization of the process parameters when posi ccdaf is used to treat water from the yellow river diversion reservoir the optimal chitosan dosage ratio is ch al 0 4 and the optimal ph value of the reflux water is 6 00 2 chitosan enhanced the removal efficiency of organic pollutants by ccdaf the removal rate increased by 16 5 when the molecular weight was 10 30 kda but increased by only 5 1 when the molecular weight was less than 1 kda the results proved that the removal effect of the process on humic and fulvic acids with high molecular weights and hydrophobicity and tcm in thmfp was significantly improved 3 chitosan strengthens the adhesion force of bubble flocs it combines with macromolecular organics in water to form a capture network which not only provides more attachment sites for particles but also acts as a skeleton posi ccdaf provides a new method to enhance the adhesion of flocs in the process of drinking water treatment by air flotation declaration of competing interest this work was financially supported by the natural science

13606,a xanthate functionalized magnetic chitosan nanocomposite xfmcn was used for cd ii adsorption from high salinity water samples the xanthate functionalization was confirmed using the chns analysis showing the sulfur content of 2 28 in the composition of the nanocomposite bet surface area of 44 79 m2 g 1 was obtained for xfmcn the functionalization process resulted in a decrease in university of tehran isotherm model ut constant from 6 73 to 1 80 10 3 showing an increased affinity toward cadmium adsorption the impacts of contact time the initial concentration of cadmium adsorbent dosage ph temperature and interfering ions such as ca2 mg2 na so₄2 co₃2 no₃ were investigated the highest performance was at a contact time of 60 min and initial ph 7 the xanthate functionalization enhanced the selectivity of the adsorbent freundlich redlich peterson university of tehran ut and radke prausnitzi isotherm models described the equilibrium data well confirming multilayer adsorption the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity was 55 mg g 1 intraparticle diffusion and second order models were suitable for describing the experimental data thermodynamics results showed an exothermic and spontaneous process the adsorbed cadmium ion could easily be desorbed using hydrochloric acid 0 1 mol l 1 the recovery was studied up to five cycles exhibiting a slight decrease in the adsorbent performance keywords xanthate functionalization chitosan cadmium adsorption 1 introduction one of the worldwide environmental problems is the presence of toxic heavy metals in water bodies because of the illegal discharge of the industrial wastewaters into the environment and the hazardous effect of heavy metals on human health even at low concentrations cadmium is a hazardous heavy metal which can accumulate in living systems 1 2 exposure to cadmium causes damage to the lung kidney liver and reproductive organs 3 the major sources of cadmium are the wastewaters produced in ceramic electroplating battery fertilizers fungicides and mining industries 4 5 the concentration of 0 05 mg l 1 has been reported as the maximum recommended concentration of cd ii in surface water 3 therefore it is necessary to remove the cadmium before discharging of the related wastewaters to the environment removal of toxic metals from wastewaters is conducted using several techniques for example coagulation advanced oxidation chemical precipitation and reverse osmosis 4 6 8 however these methods require high energy or may also be inefficient in complex matrixes mainly at trace levels the chemical methods typically cause secondary contamination 6 9 compared with other treatment methods adsorption is generally highly efficient environmentally friendly inexpensive and easy to operate 10 in recent years the natural polymer based adsorbents such as chitosan have been reported for the contaminant adsorption from water and wastewater 11 14 one of the most abundant natural polymers is chitosan which is non toxic to the environment 15 16 it is an effective adsorbent showing great potential for the sorption of metal ions using its amine functional groups 4 however chitosan dissolves at lower ph levels which limits its applications in water treatment cross linking is one of the most effective methods to increase the stability of chitosan in an acidic medium which improves its properties 17 glutaraldehyde 18 epichlorohydrin 19 and tripolyphosphate 20 have been reported as a chitosan cross linking agent glutaraldehyde cross links chitosan through bond formation between amino groups of chitosan and aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde 18 cross linking reaction causes the blockage of amine groups and subsequently decreases the adsorption capacity of chitosan 3 therefore the glutaraldehyde has to be used optimally the type of functional groups of adsorbents has a significant role in adsorbing heavy metals as a consequence the functionalization process can enhance the performance of the adsorbent in previous studies several functional groups such as ethylenediamine 21 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 22 thiourea 23 cysteine 24 citric acid 25 and α ketoglutaric acid 26 have been incorporated in the structure of chitosan functional groups containing sulfur have a strong affinity for cd ii therefore cd ii can be effectively removed using sulfur containing adsorbents without being affected by other most commonly coexisting hard cations and anions such as na ca2 mg2 so₄2 co₃2 and no₃ 17 recently magnetic separation techniques have been widely used application of magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 in the composition of other adsorbents is one of the methods that are used today to prepare magnetic nanocomposites thereby obviating the need for applying the relatively difficult separation processes such as centrifugation after applying the external magnetic field in the target medium the magnetic nanocomposites are easily removed from the solution as a consequence we can reuse the adsorbent 2 27 therefore magnetic separation provides a fast efficient and economical way to separate adsorbent particles from the wastewater 28 in this study magnetic chitosan was synthesized cross linked with the optimal amount of glutaraldehyde and then modified with carbon disulfide to improve its efficiency in removing cadmium ions from the water continuing the high amount of foreign ions the impacts of effective parameters and interfering ions were investigated kinetics adsorption isotherms

desorption and regeneration studies one of the features of an absorbent is its reusability desorption of cd ii was performed using an hcl solution 0 1 mol l 1 briefly 0 06 g of the xfmcn was loaded with 50 ml of 50 mg l 1 cd ii and then the saturated adsorbent was washed with 50 ml of the hcl solution for 30 min then the amount of desorbed cd ii ion was calculated the adsorption desorption cycle was conducted five times 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of xmc the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 nanoparticles and xfcmn fig 1 a and b observed at 30 2 220 35 5 311 43 2 400 53 5 422 57 2 511 and 62 7 440 were according to the standard xrd pattern of cubic fe3o4 the same characteristic peaks were identified at the spectrum of the nanocomposite which revealed that the fe3o4 nanoparticles retained their crystalline structure 9 29 to specify the essential functional groups on the adsorbent the ft ir spectrum for fe3o4 mcn and xfmcn was recorded as shown in fig 1c in the spectrum of the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles the strong peak at 564 cm 1 is related to the fe o bond oh vibration was observed at 3433 cm 1 27 the peak related to the fe o bond was observed in the spectrum of the nanocomposite which confirms the proper synthesis of the magnetic chitosan the characteristic bands of chitosan were at 3427 cm 1 nh and oh and 1075 cm 1 coc 30 bending vibration of the nh bond was detected at 1580 cm 1 and the peaks related to the ch bond were at 2824 and 2926 cm 1 27 sun 2016 210 on the other hand the spectrum of cross linked magnetic chitosan composites using glutaraldehyde contained a cn bond which was observed at 1650 cm 1 indicating that the cross linking process had been prepared successfully through the reaction of the amine group of chitosan and the aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde 28 in the ftir spectrum of xfmcn the stretching vibration speaks relevant to ocs and cs bonds were not identified because of overlapping of the other peaks with the peaks related to xanthate functional groups therefore chns analysis was performed to confirm the functionalization of the chitosan and determine the amount of sulfur on the adsorbent surface table 1 approximately the sulfur content of 2 28 was detected in xfmcn composition indicating that the carbon disulfide has been successfully reacted with chitosan n2 adsorption and desorption were performed over a relative pressure of 0 1 as depicted in fig 1 d the average pore diameter of nanocomposite was 15 44 nm and the bet surface area for xfmcn was 44 79 m2 g 1 therefore the absorbent is classified as the mesopore moreover the dls analysis results fig s1 revealed a size distribution of 1000 nm for nanocomposites the sem images of the fe3o4 nanoparticles and nanocomposite were presented in fig 1 e and 1f the fe3o4 nanoparticles were spherical and the nanocomposite particles were larger than fe3o4 nanoparticles in order to test if the magnetization properties of the nanocomposite are enough to be separated through the magnetic separation procedure magnetization measurements were performed with the vsm the magnetization curves of fe3o4 nanoparticles and xfmcn are depicted in fig s2 the saturation magnetizations of fe3o4 nanoparticles and xfmcn were 59 and 19 emu g 1 respectively the decline in the magnetic saturation of xfmcn is due to an increase in the nonmagnetic mass of chitosan in the nonocomposite 31 3 2 effect of glutaraldehyde on the adsorbent performance the effect of the glutaraldehyde mcn mass ratio was examined in the range of 0 12 1 fig 2 at a glutaraldehyde mcn mass ratio of 0 12 the adsorption capacity was the least because of the low glutaraldehyde content the cross linking of chitosan was incomplete thereby releasing the chitosan into the solution and preventing cd ii ions uptake using the nanocomposite the maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at the mass ratio of 0 24 at the higher mass ratios more amounts of amine groups react with glutaraldehyde so the free amine groups decrease thereby reducing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent therefore the glutaraldehyde mc mass ratio of 0 24 was selected as the optimal amount for the cross linking step 3 3 optimization of the adsorption process the impact of the ph on the adsorption of cd ii was investigated by performing various experiments under different ph values 2 7 as can be seen in fig 3 a with the growth of ph to 7 the adsorption capacity increased and at ph 7 reached the maximum value of 46 mg g 1 the ph of the zero point of charge phzpc was obtained 5 4 for the adsorbent due ti the fact that the main functional group of the nanocomposite is dithiocarbamate at the phzpc and even lower ph values the electrostatic charge of the adsorbent is neutral the adsorption of cd ii in lower ph values is because the amine and s functional groups of the xfmcn prefer to chelate with hydrogen ions rather than cd ii due to the protonation of functional groups moreover in acidic medium the concentration of h was high leading to a competition between the h and cd ii ions for the adsorption in basic medium the adsorbent have the negative surface charge and the adsorption mechanism is due both electrostatic interaction and complex formation the impact of the adsorbent dosage was presented in fig 3 b the number of active sites in the solution rises with a growth of the adsorbent dosage therefore the amount of heavy metal adsorption increases the maximum response was achieved at the dosage higher than1 2 g l 1 the effect of contact time was studied in the range of 1 90 min fig 3c the adsorption rapidly increased up to 20 min after that a small increase in the adsorption was achieved and finally the equilibrium was obtained within 1 h the results showed that at the initial stages many vacant sites are accessible resulting in a large driving force however by increasing the contact time they are saturated leading to a decline in the adsorption rate 3 4 equilibrium studies the isotherm models investigated in the present study and the related results for the adsorption of cd ii ion by mcn and xfmcn have been presented in table 2 rmse and x2 error functions were applied to examine the performance of these models table 1s regarding the values obtained from rmse and x2 it can be concluded that the ut isotherm redlich peterson and radke prausnitz models fitted the experimental data however for the xfmcn the freundlich radke prausnitz redlich peterson and ut models presented the lower error fig 4 a and c show the calculated and corresponding experimental data which were consistent with the results of the error analysis table 1s fig 4b and d ut isotherm is a three parameter model considering the interaction between adsorbate particles furthermore this model can be applied for multilayer adsorption as a consequence it can predict the multilayer maximum adsorption capacity ut isotherm demonstrated the theoretical base of the redlich peterson empirical model thereby presenting an equation composed of redlich peterson constants for calculation of maximum adsorption capacity after functionalization kl of the adsorbent increased from 0 14 to 0 85 l mg 1 furthermore the ut desorption constant decreased from 6 73 to 1 80 10 3 showing increasing the affinity of the adsorbent toward the cd ii ions 32 the obtained maximum capacities using the langmuir model were 45 and 57 mg g 1 for mcn and xfmcn respectively this increased adsorption capacity is due to sulfur containing functional groups onto the xfmcn which enhance the interactions between the adsorbent cd ii ions the freundlich constant of n is the adsorption intensity the n values were 2 and 8 65 for cd ii adsorption onto mcn and xfmcn respectively which shows favorable adsorption 33 consequently cd ii ions were adsorbed by both adsorbents via physical interactions the surface is more heterogeneous when the nf value approaches infinitive 32 34 therefore the surface of xfmcn is more heterogeneous the e value of mcn and xfmcn were 0 79 and 8 31 thus the adsorption type is physical and ion exchange respectively a comparison of the adsorption capacity of xfmcn and some other adsorbent for cd ii removal is presented in table 3 3 5 comparison of mc with xfmcn the isotherm graph in fig 5 indicates that the xfmcn absorbed large amounts of cd ii at the low residual concentration while mcn adsorbed less amount of cd ii ions at the low values of ce therefore it can be concluded that the modified adsorbent can significantly reduce the concentration of cd ii therefore a very small amount of its capacity remained empty because of the strong interactions 3 6 kinetic studies the adsorption rate of the adsorbate is described using adsorption kinetics and provides useful information related to the adsorption mechanism the models examined in this study were presented in table 4 rmse and x2 were used for the reliability examination of the examined models the intraparticle diffusion and pseudo second order models were selected as the proper models results presented in table 4 showed that the calculated equilibrium sorption capacities of the pseudo second order model were consistent with the experimental data furthermore the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model indicated the multistep adsorption process fig s3 the intraparticle diffusion plots have more than one linear part showing that the adsorption is influenced by two or more stages 39 the first linear part with a zero intercept is an indication of controlling the adsorption only by the intraparticle diffusion 3 7 thermodynamic studies adsorption isotherms under different temperatures 283 298 313 323 and 333 k were applied for thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic parameters table 5 associated with the adsorption such as standard entropy δs j mol 1 k 1 standard free energy δg j mol 1 and standard enthalpy δh j mol 1 were obtained as follows 7 δ g o r t ln k e 8 ln k e δ h o r t δ s o r where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature in k ke l mol 1 is the langmuir constant the process was exothermic δh 44 64 kj mol 1 the δg values were all negative showing that the process is spontaneous in addition an increase in randomness was observed δs 105 33 j mol 1 3 8 effect of interfering ions and regeneration of the adsorbent there are always different co existing ions in natural waters and wastewaters in order to examine the performance of mcn and xfmcn in solutions with high salinity the effect of several ions was studied the experiments were performed on the sample solutions containing coexisting ions at a concentration of 250 mg l 1 and fe3 at a concentration of 1 mg l 1 ground water level of iron according to the results presented in fig 6 a in the presence of coexisting ions the removal percentage decreased slightly because of the high tendency of soft metal ions such as cd ii for interaction with the sulfur containing functional groups as a soft base the coexisting ions had less impact on the performance of the adsorbent in contrast co existence ions had a more adverse impact on the cd ii adsorption on mcn in fact the amine functional group on the mcn as an intermediate base reveals a low affinity to react with soft acid of cd ii thereby affecting by coexisting ions in this study the cd ii loaded xfmcn was regenerated by using an hcl solution with a concentration of 0 01 mol l 1 the regeneration and reusability of xfmcn were performed up to five adsorption desorption cycles and the removal efficiencies were above 90 after the five cycles fig 6b therefore xfmcn can be employed many times for the treatment of saline waters 4 conclusion a xanthate functionalized magnetic chitosan nanocomposite xfmcn was proposed as a selective adsorbent with a high affinity for the adsorption of cd ii from aqueous solutions with high salinity after the functionalization of magnetic chitosan nanocomposite mcn kl of the adsorbent increased from 0 14 to 0 85 l mg 1 furthermore the ut desorption constant decreased from 6 73 to 1 80 10 3 showing an increased affinity of adsorbent toward the cd ii ions the high value of the langmuir constant kl indicated that there is a strong interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate moreover the high value of δh 44 64 kj is an indication of its high affinity toward cd ii consequently the adsorbent could significantly reduce the cd ii concentration and on the other hand a very small amount of its capacity remained unoccupied after adsorption the obtained maximum capacities using langmuir were 45 and 57 mg g 1 for mcn and xfmcn respectively because of the high tendency of cd ii for interaction with the sulfur containing functional groups as a soft base the coexisting ions had a less adverse impact on the performance of xfmcn in contrast co existence ions had more influence on mcn

13606,a xanthate functionalized magnetic chitosan nanocomposite xfmcn was used for cd ii adsorption from high salinity water samples the xanthate functionalization was confirmed using the chns analysis showing the sulfur content of 2 28 in the composition of the nanocomposite bet surface area of 44 79 m2 g 1 was obtained for xfmcn the functionalization process resulted in a decrease in university of tehran isotherm model ut constant from 6 73 to 1 80 10 3 showing an increased affinity toward cadmium adsorption the impacts of contact time the initial concentration of cadmium adsorbent dosage ph temperature and interfering ions such as ca2 mg2 na so₄2 co₃2 no₃ were investigated the highest performance was at a contact time of 60 min and initial ph 7 the xanthate functionalization enhanced the selectivity of the adsorbent freundlich redlich peterson university of tehran ut and radke prausnitzi isotherm models described the equilibrium data well confirming multilayer adsorption the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity was 55 mg g 1 intraparticle diffusion and second order models were suitable for describing the experimental data thermodynamics results showed an exothermic and spontaneous process the adsorbed cadmium ion could easily be desorbed using hydrochloric acid 0 1 mol l 1 the recovery was studied up to five cycles exhibiting a slight decrease in the adsorbent performance keywords xanthate functionalization chitosan cadmium adsorption 1 introduction one of the worldwide environmental problems is the presence of toxic heavy metals in water bodies because of the illegal discharge of the industrial wastewaters into the environment and the hazardous effect of heavy metals on human health even at low concentrations cadmium is a hazardous heavy metal which can accumulate in living systems 1 2 exposure to cadmium causes damage to the lung kidney liver and reproductive organs 3 the major sources of cadmium are the wastewaters produced in ceramic electroplating battery fertilizers fungicides and mining industries 4 5 the concentration of 0 05 mg l 1 has been reported as the maximum recommended concentration of cd ii in surface water 3 therefore it is necessary to remove the cadmium before discharging of the related wastewaters to the environment removal of toxic metals from wastewaters is conducted using several techniques for example coagulation advanced oxidation chemical precipitation and reverse osmosis 4 6 8 however these methods require high energy or may also be inefficient in complex matrixes mainly at trace levels the chemical methods typically cause secondary contamination 6 9 compared with other treatment methods adsorption is generally highly efficient environmentally friendly inexpensive and easy to operate 10 in recent years the natural polymer based adsorbents such as chitosan have been reported for the contaminant adsorption from water and wastewater 11 14 one of the most abundant natural polymers is chitosan which is non toxic to the environment 15 16 it is an effective adsorbent showing great potential for the sorption of metal ions using its amine functional groups 4 however chitosan dissolves at lower ph levels which limits its applications in water treatment cross linking is one of the most effective methods to increase the stability of chitosan in an acidic medium which improves its properties 17 glutaraldehyde 18 epichlorohydrin 19 and tripolyphosphate 20 have been reported as a chitosan cross linking agent glutaraldehyde cross links chitosan through bond formation between amino groups of chitosan and aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde 18 cross linking reaction causes the blockage of amine groups and subsequently decreases the adsorption capacity of chitosan 3 therefore the glutaraldehyde has to be used optimally the type of functional groups of adsorbents has a significant role in adsorbing heavy metals as a consequence the functionalization process can enhance the performance of the adsorbent in previous studies several functional groups such as ethylenediamine 21 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 22 thiourea 23 cysteine 24 citric acid 25 and α ketoglutaric acid 26 have been incorporated in the structure of chitosan functional groups containing sulfur have a strong affinity for cd ii therefore cd ii can be effectively removed using sulfur containing adsorbents without being affected by other most commonly coexisting hard cations and anions such as na ca2 mg2 so₄2 co₃2 and no₃ 17 recently magnetic separation techniques have been widely used application of magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 in the composition of other adsorbents is one of the methods that are used today to prepare magnetic nanocomposites thereby obviating the need for applying the relatively difficult separation processes such as centrifugation after applying the external magnetic field in the target medium the magnetic nanocomposites are easily removed from the solution as a consequence we can reuse the adsorbent 2 27 therefore magnetic separation provides a fast efficient and economical way to separate adsorbent particles from the wastewater 28 in this study magnetic chitosan was synthesized cross linked with the optimal amount of glutaraldehyde and then modified with carbon disulfide to improve its efficiency in removing cadmium ions from the water continuing the high amount of foreign ions the impacts of effective parameters and interfering ions were investigated kinetics adsorption isotherms

and regeneration of the adsorbent there are always different co existing ions in natural waters and wastewaters in order to examine the performance of mcn and xfmcn in solutions with high salinity the effect of several ions was studied the experiments were performed on the sample solutions containing coexisting ions at a concentration of 250 mg l 1 and fe3 at a concentration of 1 mg l 1 ground water level of iron according to the results presented in fig 6 a in the presence of coexisting ions the removal percentage decreased slightly because of the high tendency of soft metal ions such as cd ii for interaction with the sulfur containing functional groups as a soft base the coexisting ions had less impact on the performance of the adsorbent in contrast co existence ions had a more adverse impact on the cd ii adsorption on mcn in fact the amine functional group on the mcn as an intermediate base reveals a low affinity to react with soft acid of cd ii thereby affecting by coexisting ions in this study the cd ii loaded xfmcn was regenerated by using an hcl solution with a concentration of 0 01 mol l 1 the regeneration and reusability of xfmcn were performed up to five adsorption desorption cycles and the removal efficiencies were above 90 after the five cycles fig 6b therefore xfmcn can be employed many times for the treatment of saline waters 4 conclusion a xanthate functionalized magnetic chitosan nanocomposite xfmcn was proposed as a selective adsorbent with a high affinity for the adsorption of cd ii from aqueous solutions with high salinity after the functionalization of magnetic chitosan nanocomposite mcn kl of the adsorbent increased from 0 14 to 0 85 l mg 1 furthermore the ut desorption constant decreased from 6 73 to 1 80 10 3 showing an increased affinity of adsorbent toward the cd ii ions the high value of the langmuir constant kl indicated that there is a strong interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate moreover the high value of δh 44 64 kj is an indication of its high affinity toward cd ii consequently the adsorbent could significantly reduce the cd ii concentration and on the other hand a very small amount of its capacity remained unoccupied after adsorption the obtained maximum capacities using langmuir were 45 and 57 mg g 1 for mcn and xfmcn respectively because of the high tendency of cd ii for interaction with the sulfur containing functional groups as a soft base the coexisting ions had a less adverse impact on the performance of xfmcn in contrast co existence ions had more influence on mcn

13607,differences in aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles generated in wastewater during sulfide precipitation processes cannot be adequately explained by their zeta potentials herein different aggregation performances among cus cds and as2s3 particles produced by sulfide precipitation in strongly acidic wastewater were found to depend on the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of these particles density functional theory dft calculation revealed the mechanism of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the metal sulfide particles which verified the hydrophobic particles preferred to self aggregate whereas the hydrophilic particles were more likely to bind to h2o molecules and disperse in wastewater metal sulfide particles generated under different conditions also have different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and on which the aggregation performances of the particles depend it was confirmed that the different aggregation performances among cus cds and zns particles generated in low ph wastewater were also determined by their different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity rather than their zeta potentials this study explains the reason of different aggregation performances among precipitates produced by sulfide precipitation in wastewater additionally this study has revealed that in strongly acidic wastewater the tiny and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles were difficult to be separated by settling and coagulation method which provides an instruction to further study for the downstream separation process of the metal sulfide particles formed by sulfide precipitation keywords metal sulfide particles hydrophilicity hydrophobicity aggregation density functional theory 1 introduction the mining metallurgy and metal processing industries produce a large quantity of wastewater which is generally in low ph or even with high acidity and contains various heavy metals such as copper nickel cadmium arsenic etc 1 6 as the rapid reaction rate between metal ions and sulfide less of sludge production and the selective precipitation of heavy metals metal sulfide precipitation has become a common treatment for wastewater containing heavy metals 7 9 however tiny metal sulfide particles with poor settling performance are generally produced during the precipitation of metals by sulfide 10 11 this phenomenon is partly attributed to the high levels of supersaturation in the precipitation processes that limit crystal growth 12 the solution chemical properties such as ph residual sulfide reagents hs h2s and s2 and ionic strength also considerably affect the particle zeta potentials that determine the aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles in wastewater 13 the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory is frequently used to model particle interactions in water media in terms of repulsive electrostatic double layer forces and attractive van der waals forces 14 15 the key parameter determining the particle aggregation rate in aqueous media especially small hydrophilic particles is the electrical diffuse layer potential which is determined by the particle charge and the soluble salt level and usually expressed by the experimentally measured zeta potential 16 however the existence of hydrophobic interactions for amphiphilic and hydrophobic particles makes the particle zeta potential insufficient for predicting particle aggregation thus a modified dlvo theory has been proposed to model the aggregation of these particles in liquid media 17 18 density functional theory dft calculations have shown that there are different binding energies for h2o molecules adsorbed onto the surfaces of various metal sulfide particles such as fes2 zns pbs cu2s sb2s3 and mos2 verifying the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of these materials 19 20 hence variations in the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfides affect the interactions of these particles in wastewater which cannot be adequately described using the particle zeta potentials alone in addition to considering particle zeta potentials m gim krumm et al used optical microscopy computational chemistry analysis and settling test to evaluate the effect of operating conditions during sulfide precipitation on the aggregation of precipitates of copper sulfide and zinc sulfide in a cyanide solution 21 the aggregation of the hydrophilic zinc sulfide precipitates was found to be mainly influenced by the precipitate zeta potentials as determined by the solution ph and the sulfide reagent dosage whereas the aggregation performance of the hydrophobic copper sulfide precipitates largely depended on hydrophobic interactions that were significantly influenced by mechanical forces induced by agitation and pumping 21 in a previous study we found that although cus particles had a more negative zeta potential than cds particles in strongly acidic wastewater the cus particles were more unstable and spontaneously aggregated to form large floc like aggregates whereas the cds particles were stably dispersed in the wastewater 22 hence different metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation in wastewater generally exhibit different aggregation performances which cannot always be explained in terms of the particle zeta potentials however underlying mechanisms other than the particle zeta potentials have not been identified to explain the aforementioned difference in the aggregation performance the aggregation performance of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater was investigated in this study to determine the source of the difference in the aggregation performance the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the particles were characterized and the effect of these properties on the particle aggregation performance was analyzed a density functional theory dft calculation was performed to elucidate the mechanism by which the particles exhibited hydrophilicity hydrophobicity finally the effect of these properties on the aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles generated under different conditions and in low ph wastewater was determined a theoretical description of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles generated in wastewater by sulfide precipitation and the effect of these properties on the aggregation performance of the particles is provided in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of metal sulfide suspensions the materials and reagents used in this study are described in the supporting information si first the strongly acidic wastewater with different h2so4 concentrations which contained cu ii 200 mg l cd ii 200 mg l and as iii 200 mg l respectively were prepared additionally the wastewater without h2so4 and containing cu ii 200 mg l cd ii 200 mg l or zn ii 200 mg l respectively was also prepared the initial ph of the prepared cu ii cd ii and zn ii wastewater without h2so4 were 5 19 5 70 and 5 55 respectively then 1000 ml of the above mentioned prepared wastewater were poured into a sulfide precipitation device fig s1 and h2s was continuously introduced at 10 ml min for 60 min after completion of the reaction the final ph values of the wastewater containing cu ii cd ii and zn ii without h2so4 were 2 33 2 35 and 2 44 respectively the redox potentials were also measured during metal sulfide precipitation processes and the results shown in fig s2 indicated that the eh values were very negative after sulfide precipitation which implied that the reductive chemicals h2s hs or s existed in the suspensions the residual h2s hs or s in suspensions only affects the surface charge of the metal sulfide particles 22 in strongly wastewater or in wastewater with ph of 2 33 2 35 and 2 44 it was only h2s in the suspensions fig s3 the residual h2s easily escaped and could not keep in constant concentration to investigate the reason causing the difference in aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles the metal sulfide particle suspensions with different h2so4 concentrations were prepared in which the metal sulfide particles had different zeta potentials and the residual h2s was excluded the produced metal sulfide particles were collected by filtration and fully washed using deionized water to remove absorbed h2s finally the metal sulfide particles were redispersed under 15 min of ultrasonic mixing 25 100 w into 1000 ml solutions with the same h2so4 concentrations or the same ph values after sulfide precipitation and the metal sulfide particle suspensions were thus prepared 2 2 analyses of zeta potentials particle sizes and microscopic images after the suspensions were prepared the aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation using h2s in wastewater was investigated by determining the zeta potentials and particle sizes and obtaining microscopic images of the particles first 1 ml of each suspension was withdrawn and placed in an electrophoresis cell and a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern co u k was used to determine the zeta potentials of the metal sulfide particles at room temperature and each sample was analyzed three times to obtain an average value the sizes of the metal sulfide particles in the suspensions were measured by using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern co u k the prepared suspensions were continuously added to solutions with the same sulfuric acid concentrations or the same ph values under stirring at 2000 r min until the shading rate of the particle size analyzer was reached the average of three measurements was used for the particle size finally the morphologies of metal sulfide particles before and after aggregation were observed an open head dropper was used to withdraw approximately 1 ml of each metal sulfide suspension under agitation speeds of 200 r min and 50 r min which was then dropped onto a glass slide the metal sulfide particles in the suspensions were then observed under an optical microscope ub2031 coic co china 2 3 contact angles of metal sulfide particles the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles was determined by a contact angle method that has been described in previous studies 23 24 the samples were prepared for the contact angle measurements by filtration thorough washing and freeze drying followed by fabrication into 1 cm radius circular and sheet samples using a tablet press an oca20 video based contact angle meter dataphysics instruments ltd germany was used to measure the contact angles between the metal sulfide particles and solutions with different h2so4 concentrations or suspensions with the same ph values after sulfide precipitation 2 4 xrd characterization of metal sulfide particles the phase composition of the generated metal sulfide particles was characterized by x ray diffraction the generated metal sulfide particles were filtered fully washed and then freeze dried for 12 h the completely dried metal sulfide particles were characterized by xrd x pert pro mpd pan analytical holland and the xrd spectra were analyzed using mdi jade 6 0 software 2 5 computational method all the calculations were carried out by using the projector augmented wave method within the framework of density functional theory dft 25 as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp the generalized gradient approximation gga and the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe exchange functional were used the plane wave energy cutoff was set to 500 ev and the monkhorst pack method 26 was employed for brillouin zone sampling the convergence criteria of the energy and force calculations were set to 10 5 ev atom and 0 01 ev å 1 respectively because the adsorption energies of one water molecule on the metal sulfide surfaces are relatively small and it is difficult to break a certain oh bond in hoh the dft calculation only considered the adsorption of an entire water molecule on the metal sulfide surfaces previous studies about metal sulfides adsorption of water using dft calculation also only considered the adsorption of an entire water molecule 19 20 27 the interactions between one h2o molecule and metal sulfide surfaces were investigated by calculating the electrostatic potential energies eel the adsorption energies ead and the bond distances for h2o molecules adsorbed onto the surfaces of the metal sulfide particles the dft d2 method was used to account for vdw interactions between one h2o molecule and a metal sulfide surface 28 the adsorption energies ead were calculated as the energy difference of the system before and after the adsorption of one h2o molecule as shown in eq 1 29 1 ead e h2o metal sulfides e h2o e metal sulfides where e h2o metal sulfides e h2o and e metal sulfides represent the dft energies of one h2o molecule adsorbed on a metal sulfide surface an isolated h2o molecule and the clean metal sulfide surface respectively the atomic charges of the isolated h2o molecule the clean metal sulfide surface and the h2o molecule adsorbed onto the metal sulfide surface were evaluated using the atoms in molecules method bader charge analysis including the effect of dipoles 30 the electrostatic potential energies eel were a part of the dft energy which were extracted from the outcar output files of vasp software 2 6 computational models the xrd spectra fig s4 show that in the strongly acidic wastewater containing cu ii cd ii and as iii respectively the obtained copper precipitates cadmium precipitates and arsenic precipitates generated by h2s were covellite cus hawleyite cds and amorphous orpiment as2s3 which was consistent with previous research results 22 31 however in the case of cadmium precipitates produced by h2s in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 the precipitates were identified as greenockite cds fig s5 the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes of metal sulfides t 298 k are shown in table 1 covellite cus possesses a hexagonal crystal structure and has a space group of p63 mmc the common cleavage plane is 001 face along with bond cu s each cu atom on the surface coordinates with adjacent four s atoms while each s atom coordinates with adjacent three cu atoms fig s6 a hawleyite cds has a cubic structure with a space group of f 3m with a 111 surface each cd atom of the surface coordinates with three s atoms while each s atom coordinates with two cd atoms fig s6 b amorphous orpiment as2s3 has a layer structure with a space group of p121 n1 the macromolecular layers in orpiment as2s3 contain distinctive spiral chains of ass composition running parallel to 100 surface 32 the slab model of amorphous as2s3 is shown in fig s6 c greenockite cds is a hexagonal crystal with a space group of p63 mmc whose cleavage plane is 001 face the slab model is shown in fig s6 d all surfaces were obtained from the bulk metal sulfides with the optimum unit cell volume and were modeled using a supercell approach the k mesh for covellite cus hawleyite cds orpiment as2s3 and greenockite cds are 2 2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 and 2 2 1 respectively a vacuum region of 15 å was applied to prevent interactions between neighboring configurations 33 the atomic coordinates in the models under dft calculation for metal sulfides binding h2o molecule are shown in table s1 s2 s3 and s4 to reduce the calculation work appropriately the model of single molecule adsorption on sulfide supercell expanding to approximately 10 å was selected in this study although the water molecule coverage concentration in the calculated models is lower than the actual system the calculation model can also reflect the difference in the adsorption of water molecules on different metal sulfide surfaces 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater zeta potential is generally used in combination with particle size to evaluate the stability and aggregation performance of particles in the wastewater fig 1 shows the zeta potentials and particle sizes of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater with residual and adsorbed h2s and hs being removed the results indicated that increasing the h2so4 concentration from 0 102 m to 0 510 m resulted in an increase in the particle zeta potential from 11 70 mv to 8 20 mv for cus from 20 33 mv to 3 79 mv for cds and from 35 97 mv to 15 03 mv for as2s3 fig 1 a according to the double layer theory 34 the negative surface charges of metal sulfide particles will have marked charge neutralization upon an increase in the h concentration thereby decreasing the absolute value of the particle zeta potentials the particle size distribution and d50 of metal sulfide particles in strongly acidic wastewater are shown in fig s7 and fig 1 b respectively the results indicated that the particle size distribution of cus particles transferred to a range of large particle size and the average particle size increased from 13 43 μm to 24 2 μm when the h2so4 concentration increased from 0 102 m to 0 204 m while the particle size distribution and average particles size of cus particles almost kept unchanged when h2so4 concentration increased from 0 306 m to 0 510 m in the case of cds particles the particle size distribution gradually transferred to the range of large particle size and the average particle size increased from 1 33 μm to 8 72 μm as h2so4 concentration increased from 0 102 m to 0 510 m additionally no significant change was observed for the particle size distribution of as2s3 with the increase of h2so4 concentration and the average particle size of as2s3 was arranged from 7 50 μm to 8 98 μm moreover with the increase of h2so4 concentration the variation of d10 and d90 was consistent with the change trend of particle size distribution and average particle size described above fig s8 therefore for cds particles the aggregation performance depended on the particle zeta potentials while the aggregation performance of cus and as2s3 particles didn t depend on their zeta potentials moreover the optical micrographs of cus cds and as2s3 precipitates formed in strongly acidic wastewater containing 0 204 m h2so4 fig 2 a 2 b and 2 c show that the cus and as2s3 precipitates were floc like aggregates while the cds precipitates were fine particles as the agitation rate decreased from 200 r min to 50 r min the cus and as2s3 particles tended to aggregate into more large flocs whereas the cds particles remained stably as homogenous fine granular particles in wastewater fig 2 d 2 e and 2 f however fig 1 a shows that the measured zeta potentials of the cus cds and as2s3 particles in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 204 m h2so4 were 8 20 mv 17 20 mv and 27 47 mv respectively indicating that the cds particles should have had a higher tendency to aggregate than as2s3 particles and the as2s3 particles should be more difficult to aggregate than cus and cds particles hence the obtained optical microimages and zeta potentials for cus cds and as2s3 particles implied that the aggregation performances of these particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater were different and which could not be explained by their zeta potentials 3 2 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater hydrophilicity hydrophobicity are well known important characteristics of metal sulfide particles that determine the interactions between metal sulfide particles and solvent water 19 20 the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater was assessed using the contact angle method developed in previous studies 23 24 under drops of acidic solutions with different sulfuric acid concentrations the obtained contact angles of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater fig 3 show that with the increase of h2so4 concentration from 0 000 m to 0 510 m the contact angle of cus particles ranged from 74 20 to 90 30 which was larger than that of as2s3 particles ranged from 62 25 to 77 50 and cds particles ranged from 15 10 to 25 65 the results clearly showed that the cus and as2s3 particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater were of a certain degree of hydrophobicity where the degree of hydrophobicity of as2s3 particles was weaker than that of cus particles and cds particles were highly hydrophilic self binding into aggregates has been reported for hydrophobic particles whereas hydrophilic particles preferentially bind to h2o molecules to form stable dispersions in aqueous media 35 the above described aggregation performances of cus cds and as2s3 particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater indicated that cus particles were most likely to self aggregate followed by as2s3 particles whereas cds particles were very stably dispersed in the wastewater this is highly correlated with the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the particles the mechanism for which is analyzed below 3 3 computational chemistry analysis the degree of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfides is determined by the adsorption energy ead between one h2o molecule and a metal sulfide surface 19 20 ead depends on the atomic arrangement and the net atomic charge in crystal or amorphous structures of metal sulfides 36 37 the magnitude of electrostatic potential energies eel between one h2o molecule and an adsorption site a metal or sulfur atom on the metal sulfide particles determines the extent to which h2o could diffuse to a metal sulfide surface before binding there the eel values between h2o molecule and metal sulfide surfaces calculated by the dft method were 1 10 and 0 51 kcal mol 1 for cu and s atoms on covellite cus 001 surface 4 75 and 2 15 kcal mol 1 for cd and s atoms on hawleyite cds 111 surface and 1 33 and 0 92 kcal mol 1 for as and s atoms on orpiment as2s3 100 surface respectively table 2 implying that one h2o molecule would preferentially bind to metal atoms over s atoms considering that the hydrogen bonding energy between water molecules is 4 to 5 kcal mol 1 21 the eel between h2o and a cd atom adsorption site on the hawleyite cds 111 surface showed that the h2o h2o bond energy could be overcome and h2o would preferentially bind to the hawleyite cds 111 surface however the eel values for h2o on the covellite cus 001 and orpiment as2s3 100 surfaces were lower than the h2o h2o bond energy indicating that these metal sulfides cannot easily bind to water additionally the adsorption energies ead of one h2o molecule adsorbed onto surface cu and s atoms were 4 28 and 2 51 kcal mol 1 for the covellite cus 001 12 52 and 6 03 kcal mol 1 for hawleyite cds 111 and 4 38 and 2 91 kcal mol 1 for orpiment as2s3 100 table 2 the calculated ead values between h2o on the metal sulfide surfaces were all larger than that between h2o molecules ead 0 and decreased in the order of hawleyite cds orpiment as2s3 covellite cus implying that the adsorption of one h2o molecule onto hawleyite cds is thermodynamically favored over adsorption onto orpiment as2s3 and covellite cus fig 4 shows that the shortest bond distances for one h2o molecule adsorbed onto adsorption sites on hawleyite cds surface 2 48 å to a cd atom and 2 43 å to a s atom followed by orpiment as2s3 3 12 å to a as atom and 3 27 å to a s atom and the longest bond distances are obtained for covellite cus 3 52 å to a cu atom and 3 23 å to a s atom theoretically h2o molecules preferentially adsorb onto the hawleyite cds surface followed by the orpiment as2s3 surface whereas covellite cus surface is least likely to bond with h2o molecules therefore hawleyite cds particles are more likely to disperse in wastewater to form stable suspensions while hawleyite cds and orpiment as2s3 particles prefer to self aggregate instead of binding to h2o molecules in short the dft results verified that the difference in aggregation performances of metal sulfide particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater were shown to depend on hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the particles 3 4 effect of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on aggregation performance of metal sulfides formed under different conditions it was interesting to fund that the aggregation performance of cds particles formed in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 using h2s final ph of 2 35 was different from cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater although the zeta potential of cds particles generated in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 19 20 mv table 3 was more negative than that of cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 306 m h2so4 10 03 mv fig 1 the optical micrographs fig 5 clearly show that the former is more easily to self aggregate into large floc like precipitates than the latter it implies that the difference in aggregation performance of these two types of cds particles does not depend on their zeta potentials the measured contact angle of 68 40 for cds particles generated in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 table 3 was far larger than that of 23 60 for cds particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 306 m h2so4 fig 3 the cds particles formed in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 were identified as greenockite cds fig s5 which was different from the hawleyite cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater the dft results of eel ead and the bond distance between one h2o molecule and a cd atom on an optimized crystal surface of greenockite cds 001 were 2 71 kcal mol 7 18 kcal mol and 3 14 å respectively and the corresponding values for the adsorption of one h2o molecule on an s atom were 1 56 kcal mol 5 98 kcal mol and 3 41å fig 6 comparing the above results with corresponding dft results of hawleyite cds particles listed in table 2 the results theoretically prove that the hydrophilicity of greenockite cds particles is weaker than that of hawleyite cds particles the more hydrophilic the particles are easier to disperse in water 38 the observed different aggregation performance of the above mentioned two types of cds particles is consistent with the degree of hydrophilicity of these particles therefore metal sulfide particles formed under different conditions also have different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and which determines the different aggregation performances of the particles the aggregation behavior of metal sulfide particles will subsequently determine the selection of suitable solid liquid separation method it was found that the free settling and coagulation methods were both invalid for effective separation of the fine metal sulfide particles with poor aggregation performance under strongly acidic condition fig s9 and fig s10 hence more studies should be conducted and focus on how to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation in strongly acidic wastewater 3 5 effect of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on aggregation performance of metal sulfides formed in low ph wastewater different aggregation performance was also observed among copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles formed in wastewater with initial ph values of 5 19 5 70 and 5 55 corresponding to final ph values of 2 33 2 35 and 2 42 after these particles being produced and residual h2s and s2 being removed the measured zeta potentials of copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles were 8 34 mv 19 20 mv and 2 34 mv respectively table 3 however the measured particle sizes d50 53 90 μm for copper sulfide particles 7 37 μm for cadmium sulfide and 5 82 μm for zinc sulfide particles table 3 in conjunction with the optical micrographs fig 5 b and fig s11 showed that the copper sulfide precipitates and cadmium sulfide precipitates generated in low ph wastewater were aggregated to form floc like aggregates while the zinc sulfide precipitates were fine granular particles hence the zeta potential values of these particles could not account for their different aggregation performance the measured contact angles of copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles formed in low ph wastewater were 98 10 68 40 and 0 respectively table 3 which implied that the copper sulfide particles were of certain hydrophobicity while cadmium sulfide particles and zinc sulfide particles were hydrophilic particles nevertheless the hydrophilicity of cadmium sulfide particles is far weaker than that of zinc sulfide particles the observed difference in aggregation performance of these particles is well in agreement with the aggregation trends induced by their different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation in low ph wastewater also provides a more reasonable explanation of the different aggregation performances than the particle zeta potentials furthermore the observed settling performance of metal sulfide particles generated in low ph wastewater fig s12 indicated that the hydrophobic cus particles could be effectively separated by free settling while the hydrophilic cds and zns particles were of poor settling performance however the settling performance of cds and zns particles were largely improved by the addition of coagulant cpam fig s13 under low ph condition 4 conclusions an analysis of the zeta potentials particle sizes and microscopic images of metal sulfide particles cus cds and as2s3 particles produced by sulfide precipitation in strongly acidic wastewater showed that the differences in aggregation performance could not be explained in terms of the particle zeta potentials however the measured contact angles showed different levels of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity for the metal sulfide particles dft calculation revealed that self binding into aggregates was preferred by hydrophobic metal sulfide particles whereas the hydrophilic metal sulfide particles were more likely to bind h2o molecules and disperse in wastewater proving that the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles determined the difference in the aggregation performance of the particles in the wastewater hydrophilicity hydrophobicity rather than the zeta potential was also shown to determine the different aggregation performance among cus cds and zns particles generated in low ph wastewater the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation were of poor aggregation and settling performance thus additional methods should be adopted to improve their aggregation and separation performance in particular in strongly acidic wastewater the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles were difficult to be separated by settling and coagulation method this study reveals that the metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation are of different aggregation performances for their different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and it also shows that effective method should be developed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles in strongly acidic wastewater providing an instruction to further study for the separation process of metal sulfide particles formed by sulfide precipitation

aqueous media especially small hydrophilic particles is the electrical diffuse layer potential which is determined by the particle charge and the soluble salt level and usually expressed by the experimentally measured zeta potential 16 however the existence of hydrophobic interactions for amphiphilic and hydrophobic particles makes the particle zeta potential insufficient for predicting particle aggregation thus a modified dlvo theory has been proposed to model the aggregation of these particles in liquid media 17 18 density functional theory dft calculations have shown that there are different binding energies for h2o molecules adsorbed onto the surfaces of various metal sulfide particles such as fes2 zns pbs cu2s sb2s3 and mos2 verifying the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of these materials 19 20 hence variations in the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfides affect the interactions of these particles in wastewater which cannot be adequately described using the particle zeta potentials alone in addition to considering particle zeta potentials m gim krumm et al used optical microscopy computational chemistry analysis and settling test to evaluate the effect of operating conditions during sulfide precipitation on the aggregation of precipitates of copper sulfide and zinc sulfide in a cyanide solution 21 the aggregation of the hydrophilic zinc sulfide precipitates was found to be mainly influenced by the precipitate zeta potentials as determined by the solution ph and the sulfide reagent dosage whereas the aggregation performance of the hydrophobic copper sulfide precipitates largely depended on hydrophobic interactions that were significantly influenced by mechanical forces induced by agitation and pumping 21 in a previous study we found that although cus particles had a more negative zeta potential than cds particles in strongly acidic wastewater the cus particles were more unstable and spontaneously aggregated to form large floc like aggregates whereas the cds particles were stably dispersed in the wastewater 22 hence different metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation in wastewater generally exhibit different aggregation performances which cannot always be explained in terms of the particle zeta potentials however underlying mechanisms other than the particle zeta potentials have not been identified to explain the aforementioned difference in the aggregation performance the aggregation performance of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater was investigated in this study to determine the source of the difference in the aggregation performance the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the particles were characterized and the effect of these properties on the particle aggregation performance was analyzed a density functional theory dft calculation was performed to elucidate the mechanism by which the particles exhibited hydrophilicity hydrophobicity finally the effect of these properties on the aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles generated under different conditions and in low ph wastewater was determined a theoretical description of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles generated in wastewater by sulfide precipitation and the effect of these properties on the aggregation performance of the particles is provided in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of metal sulfide suspensions the materials and reagents used in this study are described in the supporting information si first the strongly acidic wastewater with different h2so4 concentrations which contained cu ii 200 mg l cd ii 200 mg l and as iii 200 mg l respectively were prepared additionally the wastewater without h2so4 and containing cu ii 200 mg l cd ii 200 mg l or zn ii 200 mg l respectively was also prepared the initial ph of the prepared cu ii cd ii and zn ii wastewater without h2so4 were 5 19 5 70 and 5 55 respectively then 1000 ml of the above mentioned prepared wastewater were poured into a sulfide precipitation device fig s1 and h2s was continuously introduced at 10 ml min for 60 min after completion of the reaction the final ph values of the wastewater containing cu ii cd ii and zn ii without h2so4 were 2 33 2 35 and 2 44 respectively the redox potentials were also measured during metal sulfide precipitation processes and the results shown in fig s2 indicated that the eh values were very negative after sulfide precipitation which implied that the reductive chemicals h2s hs or s existed in the suspensions the residual h2s hs or s in suspensions only affects the surface charge of the metal sulfide particles 22 in strongly wastewater or in wastewater with ph of 2 33 2 35 and 2 44 it was only h2s in the suspensions fig s3 the residual h2s easily escaped and could not keep in constant concentration to investigate the reason causing the difference in aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles the metal sulfide particle suspensions with different h2so4 concentrations were prepared in which the metal sulfide particles had different zeta potentials and the residual h2s was excluded the produced metal sulfide particles were collected by filtration and fully washed using deionized water to remove absorbed h2s finally the metal sulfide particles were redispersed under 15 min of ultrasonic mixing 25 100 w into 1000 ml solutions with the same h2so4 concentrations or the same ph values after sulfide precipitation and the metal sulfide particle suspensions were thus prepared 2 2 analyses of zeta potentials particle sizes and microscopic images after the suspensions were prepared the aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation using h2s in wastewater was investigated by determining the zeta potentials and particle sizes and obtaining microscopic images of the particles first 1 ml of each suspension was withdrawn and placed in an electrophoresis cell and a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern co u k was used to determine the zeta potentials of the metal sulfide particles at room temperature and each sample was analyzed three times to obtain an average value the sizes of the metal sulfide particles in the suspensions were measured by using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern co u k the prepared suspensions were continuously added to solutions with the same sulfuric acid concentrations or the same ph values under stirring at 2000 r min until the shading rate of the particle size analyzer was reached the average of three measurements was used for the particle size finally the morphologies of metal sulfide particles before and after aggregation were observed an open head dropper was used to withdraw approximately 1 ml of each metal sulfide suspension under agitation speeds of 200 r min and 50 r min which was then dropped onto a glass slide the metal sulfide particles in the suspensions were then observed under an optical microscope ub2031 coic co china 2 3 contact angles of metal sulfide particles the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles was determined by a contact angle method that has been described in previous studies 23 24 the samples were prepared for the contact angle measurements by filtration thorough washing and freeze drying followed by fabrication into 1 cm radius circular and sheet samples using a tablet press an oca20 video based contact angle meter dataphysics instruments ltd germany was used to measure the contact angles between the metal sulfide particles and solutions with different h2so4 concentrations or suspensions with the same ph values after sulfide precipitation 2 4 xrd characterization of metal sulfide particles the phase composition of the generated metal sulfide particles was characterized by x ray diffraction the generated metal sulfide particles were filtered fully washed and then freeze dried for 12 h the completely dried metal sulfide particles were characterized by xrd x pert pro mpd pan analytical holland and the xrd spectra were analyzed using mdi jade 6 0 software 2 5 computational method all the calculations were carried out by using the projector augmented wave method within the framework of density functional theory dft 25 as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp the generalized gradient approximation gga and the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe exchange functional were used the plane wave energy cutoff was set to 500 ev and the monkhorst pack method 26 was employed for brillouin zone sampling the convergence criteria of the energy and force calculations were set to 10 5 ev atom and 0 01 ev å 1 respectively because the adsorption energies of one water molecule on the metal sulfide surfaces are relatively small and it is difficult to break a certain oh bond in hoh the dft calculation only considered the adsorption of an entire water molecule on the metal sulfide surfaces previous studies about metal sulfides adsorption of water using dft calculation also only considered the adsorption of an entire water molecule 19 20 27 the interactions between one h2o molecule and metal sulfide surfaces were investigated by calculating the electrostatic potential energies eel the adsorption energies ead and the bond distances for h2o molecules adsorbed onto the surfaces of the metal sulfide particles the dft d2 method was used to account for vdw interactions between one h2o molecule and a metal sulfide surface 28 the adsorption energies ead were calculated as the energy difference of the system before and after the adsorption of one h2o molecule as shown in eq 1 29 1 ead e h2o metal sulfides e h2o e metal sulfides where e h2o metal sulfides e h2o and e metal sulfides represent the dft energies of one h2o molecule adsorbed on a metal sulfide surface an isolated h2o molecule and the clean metal sulfide surface respectively the atomic charges of the isolated h2o molecule the clean metal sulfide surface and the h2o molecule adsorbed onto the metal sulfide surface were evaluated using the atoms in molecules method bader charge analysis including the effect of dipoles 30 the electrostatic potential energies eel were a part of the dft energy which were extracted from the outcar output files of vasp software 2 6 computational models the xrd spectra fig s4 show that in the strongly acidic wastewater containing cu ii cd ii and as iii respectively the obtained copper precipitates cadmium precipitates and arsenic precipitates generated by h2s were covellite cus hawleyite cds and amorphous orpiment as2s3 which was consistent with previous research results 22 31 however in the case of cadmium precipitates produced by h2s in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 the precipitates were identified as greenockite cds fig s5 the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes of metal sulfides t 298 k are shown in table 1 covellite cus possesses a hexagonal crystal structure and has a space group of p63 mmc the common cleavage plane is 001 face along with bond cu s each cu atom on the surface coordinates with adjacent four s atoms while each s atom coordinates with adjacent three cu atoms fig s6 a hawleyite cds has a cubic structure with a space group of f 3m with a 111 surface each cd atom of the surface coordinates with three s atoms while each s atom coordinates with two cd atoms fig s6 b amorphous orpiment as2s3 has a layer structure with a space group of p121 n1 the macromolecular layers in orpiment as2s3 contain distinctive spiral chains of ass composition running parallel to 100 surface 32 the slab model of amorphous as2s3 is shown in fig s6 c greenockite cds is a hexagonal crystal with a space group of p63 mmc whose cleavage plane is 001 face the slab model is shown in fig s6 d all surfaces were obtained from the bulk metal sulfides with the optimum unit cell volume and were modeled using a supercell approach the k mesh for covellite cus hawleyite cds orpiment as2s3 and greenockite cds are 2 2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 and 2 2 1 respectively a vacuum region of 15 å was applied to prevent interactions between neighboring configurations 33 the atomic coordinates in the models under dft calculation for metal sulfides binding h2o molecule are shown in table s1 s2 s3 and s4 to reduce the calculation work appropriately the model of single molecule adsorption on sulfide supercell expanding to approximately 10 å was selected in this study although the water molecule coverage concentration in the calculated models is lower than the actual system the calculation model can also reflect the difference in the adsorption of water molecules on different metal sulfide surfaces 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation performance of metal sulfide particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater zeta potential is generally used in combination with particle size to evaluate the stability and aggregation performance of particles in the wastewater fig 1 shows the zeta potentials and particle sizes of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater with residual and adsorbed h2s and hs being removed the results indicated that increasing the h2so4 concentration from 0 102 m to 0 510 m resulted in an increase in the particle zeta potential from 11 70 mv to 8 20 mv for cus from 20 33 mv to 3 79 mv for cds and from 35 97 mv to 15 03 mv for as2s3 fig 1 a according to the double layer theory 34 the negative surface charges of metal sulfide particles will have marked charge neutralization upon an increase in the h concentration thereby decreasing the absolute value of the particle zeta potentials the particle size distribution and d50 of metal sulfide particles in strongly acidic wastewater are shown in fig s7 and fig 1 b respectively the results indicated that the particle size distribution of cus particles transferred to a range of large particle size and the average particle size increased from 13 43 μm to 24 2 μm when the h2so4 concentration increased from 0 102 m to 0 204 m while the particle size distribution and average particles size of cus particles almost kept unchanged when h2so4 concentration increased from 0 306 m to 0 510 m in the case of cds particles the particle size distribution gradually transferred to the range of large particle size and the average particle size increased from 1 33 μm to 8 72 μm as h2so4 concentration increased from 0 102 m to 0 510 m additionally no significant change was observed for the particle size distribution of as2s3 with the increase of h2so4 concentration and the average particle size of as2s3 was arranged from 7 50 μm to 8 98 μm moreover with the increase of h2so4 concentration the variation of d10 and d90 was consistent with the change trend of particle size distribution and average particle size described above fig s8 therefore for cds particles the aggregation performance depended on the particle zeta potentials while the aggregation performance of cus and as2s3 particles didn t depend on their zeta potentials moreover the optical micrographs of cus cds and as2s3 precipitates formed in strongly acidic wastewater containing 0 204 m h2so4 fig 2 a 2 b and 2 c show that the cus and as2s3 precipitates were floc like aggregates while the cds precipitates were fine particles as the agitation rate decreased from 200 r min to 50 r min the cus and as2s3 particles tended to aggregate into more large flocs whereas the cds particles remained stably as homogenous fine granular particles in wastewater fig 2 d 2 e and 2 f however fig 1 a shows that the measured zeta potentials of the cus cds and as2s3 particles in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 204 m h2so4 were 8 20 mv 17 20 mv and 27 47 mv respectively indicating that the cds particles should have had a higher tendency to aggregate than as2s3 particles and the as2s3 particles should be more difficult to aggregate than cus and cds particles hence the obtained optical microimages and zeta potentials for cus cds and as2s3 particles implied that the aggregation performances of these particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater were different and which could not be explained by their zeta potentials 3 2 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater hydrophilicity hydrophobicity are well known important characteristics of metal sulfide particles that determine the interactions between metal sulfide particles and solvent water 19 20 the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the metal sulfide particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater was assessed using the contact angle method developed in previous studies 23 24 under drops of acidic solutions with different sulfuric acid concentrations the obtained contact angles of cus cds and as2s3 particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater fig 3 show that with the increase of h2so4 concentration from 0 000 m to 0 510 m the contact angle of cus particles ranged from 74 20 to 90 30 which was larger than that of as2s3 particles ranged from 62 25 to 77 50 and cds particles ranged from 15 10 to 25 65 the results clearly showed that the cus and as2s3 particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater were of a certain degree of hydrophobicity where the degree of hydrophobicity of as2s3 particles was weaker than that of cus particles and cds particles were highly hydrophilic self binding into aggregates has been reported for hydrophobic particles whereas hydrophilic particles preferentially bind to h2o molecules to form stable dispersions in aqueous media 35 the above described aggregation performances of cus cds and as2s3 particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater indicated that cus particles were most likely to self aggregate followed by as2s3 particles whereas cds particles were very stably dispersed in the wastewater this is highly correlated with the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the particles the mechanism for which is analyzed below 3 3 computational chemistry analysis the degree of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfides is determined by the adsorption energy ead between one h2o molecule and a metal sulfide surface 19 20 ead depends on the atomic arrangement and the net atomic charge in crystal or amorphous structures of metal sulfides 36 37 the magnitude of electrostatic potential energies eel between one h2o molecule and an adsorption site a metal or sulfur atom on the metal sulfide particles determines the extent to which h2o could diffuse to a metal sulfide surface before binding there the eel values between h2o molecule and metal sulfide surfaces calculated by the dft method were 1 10 and 0 51 kcal mol 1 for cu and s atoms on covellite cus 001 surface 4 75 and 2 15 kcal mol 1 for cd and s atoms on hawleyite cds 111 surface and 1 33 and 0 92 kcal mol 1 for as and s atoms on orpiment as2s3 100 surface respectively table 2 implying that one h2o molecule would preferentially bind to metal atoms over s atoms considering that the hydrogen bonding energy between water molecules is 4 to 5 kcal mol 1 21 the eel between h2o and a cd atom adsorption site on the hawleyite cds 111 surface showed that the h2o h2o bond energy could be overcome and h2o would preferentially bind to the hawleyite cds 111 surface however the eel values for h2o on the covellite cus 001 and orpiment as2s3 100 surfaces were lower than the h2o h2o bond energy indicating that these metal sulfides cannot easily bind to water additionally the adsorption energies ead of one h2o molecule adsorbed onto surface cu and s atoms were 4 28 and 2 51 kcal mol 1 for the covellite cus 001 12 52 and 6 03 kcal mol 1 for hawleyite cds 111 and 4 38 and 2 91 kcal mol 1 for orpiment as2s3 100 table 2 the calculated ead values between h2o on the metal sulfide surfaces were all larger than that between h2o molecules ead 0 and decreased in the order of hawleyite cds orpiment as2s3 covellite cus implying that the adsorption of one h2o molecule onto hawleyite cds is thermodynamically favored over adsorption onto orpiment as2s3 and covellite cus fig 4 shows that the shortest bond distances for one h2o molecule adsorbed onto adsorption sites on hawleyite cds surface 2 48 å to a cd atom and 2 43 å to a s atom followed by orpiment as2s3 3 12 å to a as atom and 3 27 å to a s atom and the longest bond distances are obtained for covellite cus 3 52 å to a cu atom and 3 23 å to a s atom theoretically h2o molecules preferentially adsorb onto the hawleyite cds surface followed by the orpiment as2s3 surface whereas covellite cus surface is least likely to bond with h2o molecules therefore hawleyite cds particles are more likely to disperse in wastewater to form stable suspensions while hawleyite cds and orpiment as2s3 particles prefer to self aggregate instead of binding to h2o molecules in short the dft results verified that the difference in aggregation performances of metal sulfide particles formed in strongly acidic wastewater were shown to depend on hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the particles 3 4 effect of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on aggregation performance of metal sulfides formed under different conditions it was interesting to fund that the aggregation performance of cds particles formed in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 using h2s final ph of 2 35 was different from cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater although the zeta potential of cds particles generated in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 19 20 mv table 3 was more negative than that of cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 306 m h2so4 10 03 mv fig 1 the optical micrographs fig 5 clearly show that the former is more easily to self aggregate into large floc like precipitates than the latter it implies that the difference in aggregation performance of these two types of cds particles does not depend on their zeta potentials the measured contact angle of 68 40 for cds particles generated in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 final ph of 2 35 table 3 was far larger than that of 23 60 for cds particles produced in strongly acidic wastewater with 0 306 m h2so4 fig 3 the cds particles formed in wastewater with an initial ph of 5 70 were identified as greenockite cds fig s5 which was different from the hawleyite cds particles generated in strongly acidic wastewater the dft results of eel ead and the bond distance between one h2o molecule and a cd atom on an optimized crystal surface of greenockite cds 001 were 2 71 kcal mol 7 18 kcal mol and 3 14 å respectively and the corresponding values for the adsorption of one h2o molecule on an s atom were 1 56 kcal mol 5 98 kcal mol and 3 41å fig 6 comparing the above results with corresponding dft results of hawleyite cds particles listed in table 2 the results theoretically prove that the hydrophilicity of greenockite cds particles is weaker than that of hawleyite cds particles the more hydrophilic the particles are easier to disperse in water 38 the observed different aggregation performance of the above mentioned two types of cds particles is consistent with the degree of hydrophilicity of these particles therefore metal sulfide particles formed under different conditions also have different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and which determines the different aggregation performances of the particles the aggregation behavior of metal sulfide particles will subsequently determine the selection of suitable solid liquid separation method it was found that the free settling and coagulation methods were both invalid for effective separation of the fine metal sulfide particles with poor aggregation performance under strongly acidic condition fig s9 and fig s10 hence more studies should be conducted and focus on how to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation in strongly acidic wastewater 3 5 effect of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity on aggregation performance of metal sulfides formed in low ph wastewater different aggregation performance was also observed among copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles formed in wastewater with initial ph values of 5 19 5 70 and 5 55 corresponding to final ph values of 2 33 2 35 and 2 42 after these particles being produced and residual h2s and s2 being removed the measured zeta potentials of copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles were 8 34 mv 19 20 mv and 2 34 mv respectively table 3 however the measured particle sizes d50 53 90 μm for copper sulfide particles 7 37 μm for cadmium sulfide and 5 82 μm for zinc sulfide particles table 3 in conjunction with the optical micrographs fig 5 b and fig s11 showed that the copper sulfide precipitates and cadmium sulfide precipitates generated in low ph wastewater were aggregated to form floc like aggregates while the zinc sulfide precipitates were fine granular particles hence the zeta potential values of these particles could not account for their different aggregation performance the measured contact angles of copper sulfide cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide particles formed in low ph wastewater were 98 10 68 40 and 0 respectively table 3 which implied that the copper sulfide particles were of certain hydrophobicity while cadmium sulfide particles and zinc sulfide particles were hydrophilic particles nevertheless the hydrophilicity of cadmium sulfide particles is far weaker than that of zinc sulfide particles the observed difference in aggregation performance of these particles is well in agreement with the aggregation trends induced by their different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation in low ph wastewater also provides a more reasonable explanation of the different aggregation performances than the particle zeta potentials furthermore the observed settling performance of metal sulfide particles generated in low ph wastewater fig s12 indicated that the hydrophobic cus particles could be effectively separated by free settling while the hydrophilic cds and zns particles were of poor settling performance however the settling performance of cds and zns particles were largely improved by the addition of coagulant cpam fig s13 under low ph condition 4 conclusions an analysis of the zeta potentials particle sizes and microscopic images of metal sulfide particles cus cds and as2s3 particles produced by sulfide precipitation in strongly acidic wastewater showed that the differences in aggregation performance could not be explained in terms of the particle zeta potentials however the measured contact angles showed different levels of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity for the metal sulfide particles dft calculation revealed that self binding into aggregates was preferred by hydrophobic metal sulfide particles whereas the hydrophilic metal sulfide particles were more likely to bind h2o molecules and disperse in wastewater proving that the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of metal sulfide particles determined the difference in the aggregation performance of the particles in the wastewater hydrophilicity hydrophobicity rather than the zeta potential was also shown to determine the different aggregation performance among cus cds and zns particles generated in low ph wastewater the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles generated by sulfide precipitation were of poor aggregation and settling performance thus additional methods should be adopted to improve their aggregation and separation performance in particular in strongly acidic wastewater the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles were difficult to be separated by settling and coagulation method this study reveals that the metal sulfide particles produced by sulfide precipitation are of different aggregation performances for their different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and it also shows that effective method should be developed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the fine and hydrophilic metal sulfide particles in strongly acidic wastewater providing an instruction to further study for the separation process of metal sulfide particles formed by sulfide precipitation

13608,using conventional anaerobic digestion to treat refractory wastewater has several drawbacks such as long start up period temperature sensitivity volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation and so on the coupling of the bioelectrochemical systems with anaerobic digestion bes ad has been proposed to enhance the degradation of refractory pollutants in this review the mechanism of bes ad is firstly discussed then the performance of bes ad is evaluated with respect to different types of wastewater anaerobic reactors electrode materials and microbial communities associated with different systems the embedding of bes addresses the accumulation of vfa and accelerates the start up period thus allows for the growth of various microbial communities in the system novel electrodes with high biocompatibility and large specific surface area can be fabricated by the bioelectrodes based modification and used for synergistic reinforcement of the system by combining macroscopic effects with microscopic biological mechanisms however the modification of bes electrodes is deemed to be the key for further improving bes performance keywords bioelectrochemical system bes anaerobic digestion ad refractory wastewater electrode modification 1 introduction the treatment of refractory organic compounds in industrial wastewater such as chloronitrobenzene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals etc has always been a worldwide problem 1 research found that the increasing industrial wastewater discharge was the main source of severe water pollution in china 2 total industry wastewater emission of china reached 69 9 billion tons in 2017 with over 50 of this discharge classified as refractory industrial wastewater national bureau of statistics of china among the industrial water treatment technologies anaerobic digestion ad is one of the most cost effective and efficient techniques for the wastewater treatment 3 4 which could recover biogas from organic wastewater with the operation of high organic loading and low excess sludge yield the ad has become the basic process for the treatment of organic wastewater with high concentrations 5 nevertheless the conventional ad process still has lots of drawbacks especially in its application for the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater for the hydrolysis of refractory organics the ad systems required an extended time for domestication to establish an integrated microbial consortium because of the complexity of hydrolysis of refractory compounds 6 the biological anaerobic treatment of traditional wastewater involves three stages requiring an exceptionally long hydraulic retention time hrt usually between tens of hours and several days generally appropriate pretreatment process has been recognized as a cost effective means of improving biodegradability prior to biological treatment 7 it is reported that sequential anaerobic aerobic biological treatment is a feasible approach for the degradation of refractory wastewater containing azo dyes 8 10 in the anaerobic stage the reductive cleavage of azo bond is a key stage thus colorless and potentially hazardous aromatic amines could be generated 11 the aerobic stage usually promotes the mineralization of aromatic amines and the degradation of residual organics 12 in addition the anaerobic aerobic biological treatment has attracted tremendous attention due to its numerous advantages such as low energy consumption low sludge production low chemical consumption and vast potential for resource recovery however the promotion and application of conventional anaerobic aerobic systems have been curtailed owing to space requirement and long hrt 13 the high efficiency hydrolysis of refractory organic compounds is the major obstacle preventing the ad process from being generalized to the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater due to the scarcity of land space compact integrated bioreactors are considered superior to the sequential anaerobic aerobic process in a wide range of high organic strength industrial wastewater 13 14 the bioelectrochemical system bes had strikingly thrived on its potential as an emerging sustainable technology for contemporaneous wastewater treatment and electricity production in the last decades 15 electrochemically active bacteria are capable of producing an electrical current in the electrode of bioelectrochemical system bes when chemical energy is converted into electrical energy the bes is referred to as a microbial fuel cell mfc 16 on the contrary when some extra current is applied to degrade organic matter in wastewater the system is also called a microbial electrolysis cell mec 16 17 the reduction of the final electron acceptor can either be a chemically or a biologically catalysed reaction the phenomenon of electrochemically active bacteria induced electrode reduction was first discovered by potter in the 1910s 18 afterwards the first mfc was constructed by cohen et al 19 20 to enhance power output researchers turned their attention to the utilization of electron transport mediators 20 21 however research on electrogenic respiration in bes declined dramatically until the mid 1990s apart from energy production the effective utilization of specific electrodes to catalyze the metabolism of biological film is also considered to be the essential feature of bes ad in fact bes is a highly flexible technology that could be coupled with other technologies such as ad for new applications therefore the coupling of bes with improvable anaerobic technology bes ad could provide novel ideas for the treatment of refractory organic wastewater considerable research 22 25 has shown that the exploitations of the newly developed bes ad system could lead to electrochemical enrichment of methanogenic bacteria as well as increase the removal efficiency of organic compounds at a shorter hrt with higher biogas production however bes ad is an inchoate technology and most of the research have been conducted only at a laboratorial scale 26 another important factor that might curtail the industrial application of bes ad will likely be the usage of electrode materials which implies increased construction cost 27 28 however uptill now there has not been any comprehensive review on the bes ad such a review may serve as an invaluable guidiance to the large scale application of bes ad in the past few years various fileds have been proposed to explain the advantages of bes ad outstanding scholars have published several excellent review papers on bes ad dealing with biocatalysts biogas production enrichment etc 29 31 for example h2 mediated bioelectrochemical ch4 enrichment method of bes ad was discussed 29 nelabhotla et al evaluated the eet mechanism and the development of biocathodes for methane enrichment in microbial electrosynthesis system 32 in addition p chatterjee et al discussed mainly the advantages and disadvantages of the various bes start up strategies and proposed fast and efficient bes start up 31 however uptill now there has not been any comprehensive review in the bes ad combined systems for refractory wastewater treatment such a review may serve as an invaluable guidiance to the large scale application of bes ad to fill this knowledge gap this review summarizes bes ad related studies by 1 elucidating the mechanism of bes ad 2 retrospecting the performance of bes enhanced anaerobic digestion associated with different wastewater reactors electrodes microbial community structure and 3 summarizing the anode and cathode modifications for enhanced bes 2 the mechanism of bes ad the novel bes technology offers a promising alternative to mitigating the shortcomings of ad as shown in fig 1 the bes ad has been suggested to improve the transformation of various refractory contaminants such as azo dyes 33 sulfate 34 nitrobenzene 35 as well as halogenated compounds 36 37 compared with the ad process the following features of bes ad are pivotal bes combines with hydrolytic acidification process to degrade refractory organic contaminants and enhance the biodegradability of refractory wastewater the bes ad system is capable of transforming refractory pollutants under the applied voltage a complicated metabolic pathway assists the bes ad system which regulates the corporation of extracellular electron transfer eet and microbial structures 38 2 1 enhancement of hydrolysis and acidification in bes ad processes the efficiency of bes ad as a refractory wastewater pretreatment system to promote the process of hydrolytic acidification has been proved compared with ad the average bod5 cod effluent ratio in the bes ad increased by 16 3 which provided more biodegradable carbon source to the subsequent biological treatment units 39 furthermore the acidogenic process in bes ad facilitated the hydrolysis of polysaccharide acidophilic methanogenic archaea were selectively retained in bes ad which prevented ph from excessive decline 40 in bes ad appropriate electrical stimulation facilitated the biological activity and metabolism of functional microbes 41 in addition bes ad provided sufficient electron donors which guaranteed the preferable metabolic efficiency of microorganisms 42 as a result the hydrolyzed fermentation bacteria in the bes ad turned some non biochemical heterocyclic organic compounds into biodegradable organic molecules which reduced the load of subsequent operations 39 2 2 cathode biocatalysis on the transformation as a microbial catalysts electrochemically active bacteria could be used with inexpensive stainless steel electrodes and are capable of reproducing 43 when electrochemically active bacteria were arranged for the cathode as catalysts the reduction process in bes ad was separated from the oxidation of the organic donor 44 additional voltage could be applied to the electrode potential generated by electrochemically active bacteria allowing for specific products to be produced at the cathode 26 cathode biocatalysis is a reduction reaction process in which an electron is accepted by the cathode meanwhile any compound that can be reduced will be able to act as an electron acceptor to a bes ad cathode nevertheless activation energy which is provided by either abiotic or biotic catalyst is indispensable to the reduction which actuate an electron transfer between the cathode and the specific electron acceptor under the action of an electron shuttle the cathode biocatalysis uses electrons from the cathode either directly or indirectly as a driving force of oxidative contaminant reduction by using cathode biocatalysis 2 chlorophenol 45 and trichloroethene 46 achieved reductive dechlorination the reduction of cr vi also confirmed the availability of cathode biocatalysis 47 in terms of refractory organic compounds cathode biocatalysis required sufficient activation energy in the electromotive force applied voltage therefore it was essential to reduce the equivalent of electromotive force provided in cathodic biocatalysis 2 3 enhanced mechanism of extracellular electron transfer eet in the medium of electrochemically active bacteria electrons could be transmitted to extracellular electron acceptors e g electrode 27 48 eet strategies could generally be divided into two categories such as 1 c type cytochromes linked with extracellular membrane and bacterial flagellum dominated direct electron transfer det and 2 exogenous endogenous transmissive electron mediator mediated electron transfer met 49 factors such as electron donors ph oxygen and electrode materials influenced the efficiency of the eet 27 50 52 choosing the appropriate electron donor material is a practical strategy to regulate the eet process 53 54 for example the cchpf conductive catalytic and macroporous hollow fiber cathode which is based on a ceramic hollow fiber membrane uses cheap metal physical vapor deposition or carbon nanotubes to reduce the insulation of the ceramic hollow fiber membrane it further increases its biocompatibility and porosity 55 additionally heat treated stainless steel felt and granular carbon based cathode provide numerous microbial attachment sites due to their excellent 3d structure thereby improving biocompatibility and electrocatalytic property 56 57 the efficiency of det promoted by these special materials is mainly due to the synergy of c type cytochromes which reduces the electron transfer distance 58 therefore in order to maximize electricity transfer efficiency elaborative consideration should be given to the properties of the material being utilized such as effortless bacterial colonization and strong adhesion stable physicochemical property and the efficiency of electron transfer between the electrochemically active bacteria and the electron acceptor surface during the selection of the material modifications 59 at the nano scale level of design the eet allows for a better transfer of electrons between microorganism and the electron acceptor surface 60 62 certain types of oligomer and metals have been reported to be capable of promoting the transmembrane electron transfer by inserting it into the first barrier against the eet cell membrane for example metal or metal oxide carbon nanotube cnt graphene nanoribbon conductive polymer material metal organic framework mof have been utilized to improve the efficiency of eet on the micro interface between electricigen and the electron acceptor iron oxide carbon nanomaterials could be appropiately incorporated into the cytomembrane and promote long range electron transfer within the biofilm even after improving the eet process between bacteria and electrode nanomaterials could also facilitate the process of interspecies electron transfer iet by providing a transmission path between commensal bacteria the specific design of nanomaterials is essential to improve the particular eet process 53 for example in situ transmembrane nanomaterials were chosen for the transmembrane eet process so as to increase the permeability of the cytomembrane or the electron transfer capability of comparative proteins both the catalytic efficiency and bio affinity of nanomaterials must be taken into account in the process of the eet micro interface between electricigen and electrode alongside electroconductibility and efficient surface area also 2d or 3d nano carrier materials with strong biocompatibility and low resistivity are reported to promote either inner biofilm or interspecies eet process 63 3 the performance of bes ad the performance of treating refractory wastewater was determined by a variety of factors in bes ad table 1 for example the efficiency of reducing refractory contaminants was impaired owing to differences in the redox potential similarly hydrodynamic flow state and phase separation issues merits consideration with bes embedded in different anaerobic reactors furthermore the electrode a key component of the bes influenced the rate of electron transfer between the electrode and bacteria in the system 3 1 refractory wastewater the bes technology provided a promising alternative to improving the efficiency of refractory pollutants in anaerobic systems due to the fact that refractory pollutants act as electron acceptors for the cathode in bes ad 64 to achieve enhanced reduction of pollutant by enzymatic catalysis in electrochemically active bacteria with the cooperation of coupled systems 65 this unique advantage allowed bes ad to degrade various refractory wastewater including azo dye wastewater 66 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wastewater 67 nitro compound wastewater 68 and halogenated compound wastewater 69 etc the modular bes was integrated with an anaerobic sludge reactor bes asr for the acid orange 7 ao7 decolorization 70 the recorded kinetic rate of decolorization in the bes asr 0 54 h 1 was 54 0 times higher than that in asr 0 01 h 1 the maximum decolorization was 96 2 1 8 which was obtained with an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1ao7 and an applied voltage of 0 5 v the dechlorination of 2 4 dichloronitrobenzene was enhanced by the bes upflow anaerobic sludge bed bes uasb 69 it was found that the maximum dechlorination in the bes uasb reactor was higher than that in the uasb reactor alone i e 57 8 5 4 versus 45 8 4 7 the high removal efficiency of this coupled system was achieved by improving granular stability through increased dha and eps production however actual refractory wastewater using bes ad is a challenge because of the uncertainty of electrical conductivity and the shortage of readily available electronic donors which affects microbial metabolism mass transfer efficiency and the occurrence of cathodic reduction reactions recently min et al treated an actual pesticide wastewater to compare the performance of traditional hydrolysis acidification reactor har and bes hydrolysis acidification reactor bes har under pilot scale the assessment was done based on average effluent bod5 cod ratio and operating cost 71 the average effluent bod5 cod ratio of bes har was 16 3 higher than the one observed in har indicating that the integration of reactor provided more biodegradable substances similarly considering the investment of electrode module and the consumption of energy the stable operation of this integrated system can reduce the cost by 14 1 with a payback period of 10 years in summary although bes ad has different methods and conditions for the degradation of refractory pollutants the applied voltages could strongly enhance the reduction of pollutants undeniably the uncertainty of conductivity and the shortage of electron donors are considered in actual wastewater treatment meanwhile it is vital to maintain the balance between construction costs and treatment efficiency in practice 3 2 anaerobic biological reactors the bes ad system allow anode produced electrons to act as the driving force for removing pollutants at the cathode 30 which effectively mitigates the shortcomings of conventional anaerobic systems like accumulation of vfa and long start up period nevertheless the performance of various bes ad has been improved to varying degrees a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr incorporated with bes improved the decolorization of azo dye by 76 8 72 which solved the problem of vfa accumulation in anaerobic systems by electrical stimulation subsequently the superiority of bes uasb systems was achieved through the cooperation of anaerobic granular sludge and biofilm at electrodes for example jiang et al demonstrated the bes uasb system showed nearly 100 removal efficiency of 2 4 dclnb at optimal parameters but its stability was limited by the fact that acidogenesis and methanogenesis were not separated 67 to overcome the problem the anaerobic baffled reactor was modified to construct an mecs abr system for the treatment of petrochemical wastewater 73 it was demonstrated that the maximum cod removal efficiency of the mecs abr system 96 5 was approximately 45 higher than that of abr 66 7 this phase separation also enhanced the impact load resistance and methane production in mecs abr the utilization of anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was limited by the fouling of membrane 74 the mec anmbrs system with membrane filtration over carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms was constructed to relieve membrane fouling and treat wastewater 75 the stability and density of the sludge layer on the membrane surface was relieved by the electrostatic repulsion the result indicated that the removal efficiency of cod was still over 95 during a long term operation in addition a novel bes anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr was investigated for facilitating the degradation of pollutants which revealed that the bes afbr had a higher resistance to impact loading 76 and in a pilot test wang et al had designed a bes uasb combination system with a comprehensive effective volume of 12 8 l where fischer tropsch f t wastewater having 28175 8 32167 6 mg l 1 of cod was treated the optimum cod removal efficiency 93 5 1 6 and methane production 2 01 0 13 m3 m 3 d 1 were achieved under the assistance of uasb effluent recycling of 200 which effectively buffered the effects of ph on bes 77 in conclusion most of the drawbacks of ad are alleviated owing to the embedding of bes and the simultaneous enhancement of microbial activity and pollutant removal efficiency in the bes ad by combining macro effects and micro biological architecture simultaneously the large scale application of mec combined with the current conventional anaerobic architecture to treat refractory wastewater is still a huge challenge 3 3 electrode materials the electrode serves as a key part of the structure and function of bes ad and facilitates electron transfer by bacteria anode provides a place for electrochemically active microorganisms to metabolize and the reduction of cathode potential via the anode reaction which indirectly affected the degradation efficiency of pollutants 78 in addition the anaerobic electron acceptor was provided by the anode material to oxidize the organic pollutants in the wastewater which facilitates the metabolic rate of the anaerobic bacteria like the anode the eab on the cathode could also be used for reduction of refractory pollutants except that it catalyzes energy conversion generally the electrode reaction was greatly determined by the characteristics of electrode materials employed in the past decades common electrodes were mostly made from carbon based materials such as carbon brush carbon cloth carbon fiber felt graphite granules etc these materials had large surface area non corrosive biocompatibility characteristics and great stability the contribution of carbon fiber felt as electrode materials in the bes ad showed that the dechlorination efficiency of 2 4 dichloronitrobenzene was 78 5 6 1 79 nevertheless the conductivity of carbon based materials was just 3 104 1 105 s m 1 which is much lower than that of most metal based electrodes 80 in particular stainless steel mesh ssm and stainless steel fiber felt ssff have been widely employed to provide electrical conductivity and reduce the procurement cost unfortunately these metal based materials have lower biocompatibility compared to carbon based materials thus a novel corrugated stainless steel mesh electrode with 3d structure has been developed 81 compared to the traditional plate stainless steel mesh the novel electrode equipped bes showed a greater removal efficiency better hydrodynamic flow patterns and shorter startup duration recently a corrugated sandwich electrode module based on graphite coated stainless steel and carbon felt was embedded in a traditional abr effective volume 45m³ for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater around 35 2 12 8 of cod reduction and 67 2 21 4 of color removal efficiency was observed during about six months operation respectively which was 16 7 13 2 and 59 4 27 9 higher than that of the conventional abr 82 with proper electrode design and selection which provides numerous sites for the attachment of eab and promote the mass transfer efficiency between microbes and pollutants currently specific surface area and material cost are key influences in the selection of electrodes taking into account scalability biocompatibility electrochemical stability and corrosion resistance however the development of electrode materials that are suitable for large scale application is the most severe challenge the proposed composite electrode module could provide a viable option to deploy large scale bes 3 4 microbial community structure the operational efficiency of the bes ad was greatly influenced by the tems of cooperation and competition between anaerobe community and electrochemically active bacteria eab 83 complex organic substrates could be transformed into electron donors which are easier to be used by exoelectrogens with the assistance of hydrolytic acidification bacteria and fermentative bacteria additionally the synergetic relationship between exoelectrogens and methanogens mainly lies in the fact that exoelectrogens could effectively eliminate the accumulation of vfas in ad so as to alleviate the inhibition of methanogen 84 however there was also substrate competition between methanogen and anode exoelectrogen whichled to the decrease of coulombic efficiency ce 85 voltage intervention may be a promising approach to mitigate this phenomenon 86 for instance most of the glucose was oxidized by fermentative bacteria in the anodic substrate of bes and these fermentative products were used as substrates of the exoelectrogen to produce electricity 87 however the type of acidogenic fermentation of glucose was changed by a voltage applied bes and increased the acetate and hydrogen content of the fermentation products the result was demonstrated by a decrease in glucose fermentation microorganisms and an increase in exoelectrogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 38 firstly compared with ad shannon index of 4 17 16s rdna sequencing results demonstrated a more plentiful microbial diversity in bes ad shannon index of 5 69 which indicated that the microbial community grew comparatively richer in the bes ad 67 then for the degradation of ρ chloronitrobenzenes ρ clnb dechlorinating species chloroflexi anaerolineae and fermentative species kosmotoga were enriched in the bes ad which increased by 15 0 and 16 8 respectively 88 similarly in the decyanation and mineralization process of isophthalonitrile ipn compared with ad ipn reduction related species in bes ad hydrogenophaga falkowbacteria and mesotoga were enriched by 18 07 6 28 and 7 96 respectively 76 as a typical mesothermal methanogen mesotoga was difficult to grew in the ad system and played a indispensable role in the anaerobic ecological niche 53 89 moreover mesotoga was affiliated to the thermotogae class which was able to hydrolyze carbohydrate in ad and was beneficial to methane yield 90 91 although under external interference with the degradation of toxic aromatic compounds in anoxic state mesotoga also maintained the system stability and operation 92 a pilot scale bes abr supplemented by short chain fatty acid oxidation syntrophs sfas and exoelectrogens has been developed to enrich methane resulting in the promotion of organic degradation simultaneously the enrichment of syntrophomonas geobacter methanobacterium and methannosarcina demonstrates the feasibility of sfas and exoelectrogens as assistant 93 this strategy can also provide a reference for the enrichment of characteristic pollutant degrading bacteria and the synergetic effect between methanogens and exoelectrogens was promoted in response to the degradation of specific pollutants there were different mechanisms for bes ad among them a common feature was that they changed the diversity of microbial communities and the abundance of species under the action of the electric field the methanogenic activity has also enriched the specific degradation strains of sexual target pollutants efficiently but there is still little research on its specific mechanism 4 electrode modification for bes alternatives have been explored in the development of electrode modification to enhance bes ad performance and stability of long term operational stability fig 2 the following electrode modification methods could change their biocompatibility biofilm adhesion and conductivity to some extent it is worth discussing that the bes ad performance was improved by these complex modification methods but their relatively high cost limits their widespread application thus more research on the electrode materials of bes ad would be required before application in the industrial system 94 for example the mainstream comprehensive modification method was based on bioelectrode a cheap substrate material was simply modified to obtain an efficient electrode and ensure the operational stability of the system the performances of electrode modification are summarized in table 2 4 1 anode modification conventional carbon based and metal based anodes are limited by biocompatibility electrical conductivity specific surface area and other characteristics 95 therefore it is critical to modify the anode by adjusting the anode surface morphology and chemistry for accelerating the degradation of refractory pollutants and facilitating the efficiency of the electron transfer from the microorganism to the surface of the electrode in bes ad currently conventional anode electrode cae materials have undergone some modifications such as chemical modification metal nanoparticles conducting polymers carbon nanotube cnt graphene gr etc a novel mfc anode was constructed by synthesizing zero dimensional nitrogen doped carbon dots on the surface of carbon paper 96 the power output increased by 77 after the introduction of zero dimension nitrogen and the biofilm on the novel anode was almost twice as thick as that on the ordinary carbon cloth anode provided a promising strategy to the removal of contaminants by thickening the electrode biofilm with the perspective of reducing the resistance of systems improving electrical conductivity and expanding specific surface area metal nanoparticles could be employed to modify the anode mohamed et al deposited iron iron oxide fe fe2o3 nanoparticles on the surface of carbon cloth cc anode for degradation of organic pollutants and achieved the removal efficiency of more than 80 due to the modified electrodes with decreased electron transfer resistance 97 furthermore excellent anode performance was achieved when metal nanoparticles with conducting polymers in the form of composites were used a carbon felt cf electrode coated with polyaniline pani petaline nio was employed as an anode in a mfc 98 the novel electrode was synthesized by in situ growth and polymerization with enhanced wettability of the electrode and reduced charge transfer resistance the modified composite electrode could improve the decolorization efficiency by 49 in comparison with the unmodified cf anode cnts have been widely reported for their large surface area and mechanical stability cnt was coated on the surface of ssm to form a composite electrode for treatment of the filtrate generated by the fermentation of municipal sludge in bes 99 the maximum power density was 7 21 folds higher than the graphite felt as the anode the enhanced performance was mainly accredited to the provision of a suitable microenvironment to maintain bacterial attachment graphene can accelerate extracellular electron transfer between the electrode surface microbes and microbes owing to its remarkable physical and electrical properties according to the the research of tian et al the use of a novel graphene gr polypyrrole ppy to improve low temperature anaerobic digestion ad of low load wastewater resulted in 0 72 0 02 kw h m 3 d 1 energy recovery with 57 9 cod removal efficiency 100 a novel anode of dopamine modified cf was employed in a mfc for degrading indole and generating electricity and was found to facilitate the adhesion of electrode leading to an increase in the thickness of biofilm with enhanced removal of indole 101 4 2 cathode modification a cathode as an electron donor critically controls the performance of the reduction efficiency of refractory pollutants in the bes ad as with the anode the surface properties of the cathode have a substantial influence on the microbes electrode interaction to form a strong biofilm which is named the biocathode 102 nevertheless biocathode has relatively lower power density compared to the abiotic cathode resulting in a low pollutant reduction therefore it is important for the removal of refractory pollutants in bess via the development of modified methods to accelerate electron transfer between cathode biofilm and targeted pollutants apart from the anode those methods could also be applied to cathode modification in the bes ad the ultimate goal of the modification is to reduce the activation over potential of a particular redox reactions a novel approach has been utilized for the fabrication of hydrophilic groups nh nh2 modified cc electrodes for the biocathode transformation efficiency of nitrobenzene nb 103 the result of the electroactive nitroaromatic reducers with the maximum relative abundance confirmed that the hydrophilic modified group was 15 higher than the hydrophobic groups which powerfully indicated the hydrophobic electrode facilitated the adhesion of functional microorganisms in view of these conducting polymers were also adopted to modify biocathode to improve the cell adhesion of bacteria li et al developed the electrode using polyaniline pani with graphite for perchlorate reduction 104 it was reported that compared with the cathode without biofilm cathode the utilization of pani can improve the reduction efficiency by 12 additionally facilitating the electron transfer from the cathode to the electron acceptors was a major contribution of biofilms in another study a strategy for the design of dual graphene was demonstrated 105 which was employed as biocathode for reduction of oxytetracycline otc the power density 86 6 5 1 mw m 2 was achieved with the otc removal efficiency 95 0 this indicated that the presence of graphene could affect the biomass load on the electrode to a certain extent furthermore dual chamber bess with graphite felt electrodes of nitrogen doping graphene ng was fabricated and the reduction efficiency of 4 nitrophenol with modified cathode was as high as 73 3 8 2 which was approximately twice greater than the normal gf cathode 106 it was a promising strategy that the activation zone of electron transfer and reduction reactions were synergistically activated for the development of high performance cathode modification methods the use of complex modified electrodes for biocathode was rather limited in the bes ad and the modification of anaerobic biocathode was still mainly focused on the change of electrode material configuration 81 107 it has provided a theoretical basis for significantly improving the degradation of pollutants and power density in the modification of the abiotic cathode 108 109 simultaneously a carbon based gas diffusion electrode gde could improve the solubility of carbon dioxide boosting the production of alcohols however the extensive application of the system is limited to its ph sensitivity 110 recently the metal organic frameworks mofs have been developed as high efficiency cathode materials due to their diversity of topological structures and countless active sites for bes 111 112 5 future prospects and challenges the current studies indicate that the large scale bes ad has lower operational efficiency than that of laboratory scale 82 meanwhile the cost efficiency of the system must be analyzed to target the application of large scale for the economic aspects of electrode materials noori et al estimated that the cost of stainless steel wire cloth was 30 8 m 2 much less than carbon felt 145 8 m 2 carbon cloth 278 m 2 carbon paper 462 m 2 and titanium frit 7400 m 2 30 on the other hand beegle and borole focused on analyzing the comprehensive economic performance of ad mec ad and mfc ad 113 which are summarized in table 3 the result indicates that a bes ad could operate with relatively high energy efficiency led to additional economic and environmental responses however there were some few improvements such as the system component optimization and the economic feasibility should be properly addressed in the future 1 the lack of understanding of the electron transfer mechanism between electrodes and microorganisms was a major limitation for large scale application of bes ad which directly affected the selection of electrode materials 2 the layout and configuration of bes ad electrodes on a large scale is important to consider the fabrication cost and replacement cycle it would be designed an sandwich corrugated of electrodes or surrounding carbon fiber brush electrodes and simply modified to suit the amplification process 3 the amplified electrode should strengthen the connection between the electrode and circuit to prevent poor contact the lab scale reactors are always made of insulated plexiglass which have no short circuiting phenomenon in the operational process however the scaled up reactor was highly demanding in terms of material and spatial structure design 4 it was worth to minimize the energy consumption of the system the higher energy consumption was caused by low mass transfer efficiency and high electrochemical loss hence an optimal energy efficiency of the system could be achieved by optimizing voltage application and the utilization of biogas energy the recommended form of electrode construction and the problem of energy balance for the large scale bes ad are shown in fig 3 6 conclusion this review has demonstrated the potential of the bes ad for the treatment of refractory wastewater this review has evaluated the performance of bes ad for different types of wastewater anaerobic reactors electrode materials and microbial communities the embedding of bes addresses the accumulation of vfa and accelerates the start up period and thus results in the growth of various microbial communities in the system novel electrodes with high biocompatibility and large specific surface area can be fabricated by the bioelectrodes based modification and used for synergistic reinforcement of the system by combining macroscopic effects with microscopic biological mechanisms however some issues are yet to be addressed in the electron transfer mechanism and the large scale application of bes ad including 1 exploring the electron transfer mechanism between electrodes and microorganisms 2 the structural design and fabrication cost of electrode and 3 mass transfer efficiency and electrochemical losses of long circuits in large scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors

13608,using conventional anaerobic digestion to treat refractory wastewater has several drawbacks such as long start up period temperature sensitivity volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation and so on the coupling of the bioelectrochemical systems with anaerobic digestion bes ad has been proposed to enhance the degradation of refractory pollutants in this review the mechanism of bes ad is firstly discussed then the performance of bes ad is evaluated with respect to different types of wastewater anaerobic reactors electrode materials and microbial communities associated with different systems the embedding of bes addresses the accumulation of vfa and accelerates the start up period thus allows for the growth of various microbial communities in the system novel electrodes with high biocompatibility and large specific surface area can be fabricated by the bioelectrodes based modification and used for synergistic reinforcement of the system by combining macroscopic effects with microscopic biological mechanisms however the modification of bes electrodes is deemed to be the key for further improving bes performance keywords bioelectrochemical system bes anaerobic digestion ad refractory wastewater electrode modification 1 introduction the treatment of refractory organic compounds in industrial wastewater such as chloronitrobenzene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals etc has always been a worldwide problem 1 research found that the increasing industrial wastewater discharge was the main source of severe water pollution in china 2 total industry wastewater emission of china reached 69 9 billion tons in 2017 with over 50 of this discharge classified as refractory industrial wastewater national bureau of statistics of china among the industrial water treatment technologies anaerobic digestion ad is one of the most cost effective and efficient techniques for the wastewater treatment 3 4 which could recover biogas from organic wastewater with the operation of high organic loading and low excess sludge yield the ad has become the basic process for the treatment of organic wastewater with high concentrations 5 nevertheless the conventional ad process still has lots of drawbacks especially in its application for the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater for the hydrolysis of refractory organics the ad systems required an extended time for domestication to establish an integrated microbial consortium because of the complexity of hydrolysis of refractory compounds 6 the biological anaerobic treatment of traditional wastewater involves three stages requiring an exceptionally long hydraulic retention time hrt usually between tens of hours and several days generally appropriate pretreatment process has been recognized as a cost effective means of improving biodegradability prior to biological treatment 7 it is reported that sequential anaerobic aerobic biological treatment is a feasible approach for the degradation of refractory wastewater containing azo dyes 8 10 in the anaerobic stage the reductive cleavage of azo bond is a key stage thus colorless and potentially hazardous aromatic amines could be generated 11 the aerobic stage usually promotes the mineralization of aromatic amines and the degradation of residual organics 12 in addition the anaerobic aerobic biological treatment has attracted tremendous attention due to its numerous advantages such as low energy consumption low sludge production low chemical consumption and vast potential for resource recovery however the promotion and application of conventional anaerobic aerobic systems have been curtailed owing to space requirement and long hrt 13 the high efficiency hydrolysis of refractory organic compounds is the major obstacle preventing the ad process from being generalized to the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater due to the scarcity of land space compact integrated bioreactors are considered superior to the sequential anaerobic aerobic process in a wide range of high organic strength industrial wastewater 13 14 the bioelectrochemical system bes had strikingly thrived on its potential as an emerging sustainable technology for contemporaneous wastewater treatment and electricity production in the last decades 15 electrochemically active bacteria are capable of producing an electrical current in the electrode of bioelectrochemical system bes when chemical energy is converted into electrical energy the bes is referred to as a microbial fuel cell mfc 16 on the contrary when some extra current is applied to degrade organic matter in wastewater the system is also called a microbial electrolysis cell mec 16 17 the reduction of the final electron acceptor can either be a chemically or a biologically catalysed reaction the phenomenon of electrochemically active bacteria induced electrode reduction was first discovered by potter in the 1910s 18 afterwards the first mfc was constructed by cohen et al 19 20 to enhance power output researchers turned their attention to the utilization of electron transport mediators 20 21 however research on electrogenic respiration in bes declined dramatically until the mid 1990s apart from energy production the effective utilization of specific electrodes to catalyze the metabolism of biological film is also considered to be the essential feature of bes ad in fact bes is a highly flexible technology that could be coupled with other technologies such as ad for new applications therefore the coupling of bes with improvable anaerobic technology bes ad could provide novel ideas for the treatment of refractory organic wastewater considerable research 22 25 has shown that the exploitations of the newly developed bes ad system could lead to electrochemical enrichment of methanogenic bacteria as well as increase the removal efficiency of organic compounds at a shorter hrt with higher biogas production however bes ad is an inchoate technology and most of the research have been conducted only at a laboratorial scale 26 another important factor that might curtail the industrial application of bes ad will likely be the usage of electrode materials which implies increased construction cost 27 28 however uptill now there has not been any comprehensive review on the bes ad such a review may serve as an invaluable guidiance to the large scale application of bes ad in the past few years various fileds have been proposed to explain the advantages of bes ad outstanding scholars have published several excellent review papers on bes ad dealing with biocatalysts biogas production enrichment etc 29 31 for example h2 mediated bioelectrochemical ch4 enrichment method of bes ad was discussed 29 nelabhotla et al evaluated the eet mechanism and the development of biocathodes for methane enrichment in microbial electrosynthesis system 32 in addition p chatterjee et al discussed mainly the advantages and disadvantages of the various bes start up strategies and proposed fast and efficient bes start up 31 however uptill now there has not been any comprehensive review in the bes ad combined systems for refractory wastewater treatment such a review may serve as an invaluable guidiance to the large scale application of bes ad to fill this knowledge gap this review summarizes bes ad related studies by 1 elucidating the mechanism of bes ad 2 retrospecting the performance of bes enhanced anaerobic digestion associated with different wastewater reactors electrodes microbial community structure and 3 summarizing the anode and cathode modifications for enhanced bes 2 the mechanism of bes ad the novel bes technology offers a promising alternative to mitigating the shortcomings of ad as shown in fig 1 the bes ad has been suggested to improve the transformation of various refractory contaminants such as azo dyes 33 sulfate 34 nitrobenzene 35 as well as halogenated compounds 36 37 compared with the ad process the following features of bes ad are pivotal bes combines with hydrolytic acidification process to degrade refractory organic contaminants and enhance the biodegradability of refractory wastewater the bes ad system is capable of transforming refractory pollutants under the applied voltage a complicated metabolic pathway assists the bes ad system which regulates the corporation of extracellular electron transfer eet and microbial structures 38 2 1 enhancement of hydrolysis and acidification in bes ad processes the efficiency of bes ad as a refractory wastewater pretreatment system to promote the process of hydrolytic acidification has been proved compared with ad the average bod5 cod effluent ratio in the bes ad increased by 16 3 which provided more biodegradable carbon source to the subsequent biological treatment units 39 furthermore the acidogenic process in bes ad facilitated the hydrolysis of polysaccharide acidophilic methanogenic archaea were selectively retained in bes ad which prevented ph from excessive decline 40 in bes ad appropriate electrical stimulation facilitated the biological activity and metabolism of functional microbes 41 in addition bes ad provided sufficient electron donors which guaranteed the preferable metabolic efficiency of microorganisms 42 as a result the hydrolyzed fermentation bacteria in the bes ad turned some non biochemical heterocyclic organic compounds into biodegradable organic molecules which reduced the load of subsequent operations 39 2 2 cathode biocatalysis on the transformation as a microbial catalysts electrochemically active bacteria could be used with inexpensive stainless steel electrodes and are capable of reproducing 43 when electrochemically active bacteria were arranged for the cathode as catalysts the reduction process in bes ad was separated from the oxidation of the organic donor 44 additional voltage could be applied to the electrode potential generated by electrochemically active bacteria allowing for specific products to be produced at the cathode 26 cathode biocatalysis is a reduction reaction process in which an electron is accepted by the cathode meanwhile any compound that can be reduced will be able to act as an electron acceptor to a bes ad cathode nevertheless activation energy which is provided by either abiotic or biotic catalyst is indispensable to the reduction which actuate an electron transfer between the cathode and the specific electron acceptor under the action of an electron shuttle the cathode biocatalysis uses electrons from the cathode either directly or indirectly as a driving force of oxidative contaminant reduction by using cathode biocatalysis 2 chlorophenol 45 and trichloroethene 46 achieved reductive dechlorination the reduction of cr vi also confirmed the availability of cathode biocatalysis 47 in terms of refractory organic compounds cathode biocatalysis required sufficient activation energy in the electromotive force applied voltage therefore it was essential to reduce the equivalent of electromotive force provided in cathodic biocatalysis 2 3 enhanced mechanism of extracellular electron transfer eet in the medium of electrochemically active bacteria electrons could be transmitted to extracellular electron acceptors e g electrode 27 48 eet strategies could generally be divided into two categories such as 1 c type cytochromes linked with extracellular membrane and bacterial flagellum dominated direct electron transfer det and 2 exogenous endogenous transmissive electron mediator mediated electron transfer met 49 factors such as electron donors ph oxygen and electrode materials influenced the efficiency of the eet 27 50 52 choosing the appropriate electron donor material is a practical strategy to regulate the eet process 53 54 for example the cchpf conductive catalytic and macroporous hollow fiber cathode which is based on a ceramic hollow fiber membrane uses cheap metal physical vapor deposition or carbon nanotubes to reduce the insulation of the ceramic hollow fiber membrane it further increases its biocompatibility and porosity 55 additionally heat treated stainless steel felt and granular carbon based cathode provide numerous microbial attachment sites due to their excellent 3d structure thereby improving biocompatibility and electrocatalytic property 56 57 the efficiency of det promoted by these special materials is mainly due to the synergy of c type cytochromes which reduces the electron transfer distance 58 therefore in order to maximize electricity transfer efficiency elaborative consideration should be given to the properties of the material being utilized such as effortless bacterial colonization and strong adhesion stable physicochemical property and the efficiency of electron transfer between the electrochemically active bacteria and the electron acceptor surface during the selection of the material modifications 59 at the nano scale level of design the eet allows for a better transfer of electrons between microorganism and the electron acceptor surface 60 62 certain types of oligomer and metals have been reported to be capable of promoting the transmembrane electron transfer by inserting it into the first barrier against the eet cell membrane for example metal or metal oxide carbon nanotube cnt graphene nanoribbon conductive polymer material metal organic framework mof have been utilized to improve the efficiency of eet on the micro interface between electricigen and the electron acceptor iron oxide carbon nanomaterials could be appropiately incorporated into the cytomembrane and promote long range electron transfer within the biofilm even after improving the eet process between bacteria and electrode nanomaterials could also facilitate the process of interspecies electron transfer iet by providing a transmission path between commensal bacteria the specific design of nanomaterials is essential to improve the particular eet process 53 for example in situ transmembrane nanomaterials were chosen for the transmembrane eet process so as to increase the permeability of the cytomembrane or the electron transfer capability of comparative proteins both the catalytic efficiency and bio affinity of nanomaterials must be taken into account in the process of the eet micro interface between electricigen and electrode alongside electroconductibility and efficient surface area also 2d or 3d nano carrier materials with strong biocompatibility and low resistivity are reported to promote either inner biofilm or interspecies eet process 63 3 the performance of bes ad the performance of treating refractory wastewater was determined by a variety of factors in bes ad table 1 for example the efficiency of reducing refractory contaminants was impaired owing to differences in the redox potential similarly hydrodynamic flow state and phase separation issues merits consideration with bes embedded in different anaerobic reactors furthermore the electrode a key component of the bes influenced the rate of electron transfer between the electrode and bacteria in the system 3 1 refractory wastewater the bes technology provided a promising alternative to improving the efficiency of refractory pollutants in anaerobic systems due to the fact that refractory pollutants act as electron acceptors for the cathode in bes ad 64 to achieve enhanced reduction of pollutant by enzymatic catalysis in electrochemically active bacteria with the cooperation of coupled systems 65 this unique advantage allowed bes ad to degrade various refractory wastewater including azo dye wastewater 66 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wastewater 67 nitro compound wastewater 68 and halogenated compound wastewater 69 etc the modular bes was integrated with an anaerobic sludge reactor bes asr for the acid orange 7 ao7 decolorization 70 the recorded kinetic rate of decolorization in the bes asr 0 54 h 1 was 54 0 times higher than that in asr 0 01 h 1 the maximum decolorization was 96 2 1 8 which was obtained with an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1ao7 and an applied voltage of 0 5 v the dechlorination of 2 4 dichloronitrobenzene was enhanced by the bes upflow anaerobic sludge bed bes uasb 69 it was found that the maximum dechlorination in the bes uasb reactor was higher than that in the uasb reactor alone i e 57 8 5 4 versus 45 8 4 7 the high removal efficiency of this coupled system was achieved by improving granular stability through increased dha and eps production however actual refractory wastewater using bes ad is a challenge because of the uncertainty of electrical conductivity and the shortage of readily available electronic donors which affects microbial metabolism mass transfer efficiency and the occurrence of cathodic reduction reactions recently min et al treated an actual pesticide wastewater to compare the performance of traditional hydrolysis acidification reactor har and bes hydrolysis acidification reactor bes har under pilot scale the assessment was done based on average effluent bod5 cod ratio and operating cost 71 the average effluent bod5 cod ratio of bes har was 16 3 higher than the one observed in har indicating that the integration of reactor provided more biodegradable substances similarly considering the investment of electrode module and the consumption of energy the stable operation of this integrated system can reduce the cost by 14 1 with a payback period of 10 years in summary although bes ad has different methods and conditions for the degradation of refractory pollutants the applied voltages could strongly enhance the reduction of pollutants undeniably the uncertainty of conductivity and the shortage of electron donors are considered in actual wastewater treatment meanwhile it is vital to maintain the balance between construction costs and treatment efficiency in practice 3 2 anaerobic biological reactors the bes ad system allow anode produced electrons to act as the driving force for removing pollutants at the cathode 30 which effectively mitigates the shortcomings of conventional anaerobic systems like accumulation of vfa and long start up period nevertheless the performance of various bes ad has been improved to varying degrees a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr incorporated with bes improved the decolorization of azo dye by 76 8 72 which solved the problem of vfa accumulation in anaerobic systems by electrical stimulation subsequently the superiority of bes uasb systems was achieved through the cooperation of anaerobic granular sludge and biofilm at electrodes for example jiang et al demonstrated the bes uasb system showed nearly 100 removal efficiency of 2 4 dclnb at optimal parameters but its stability was limited by the fact that acidogenesis and methanogenesis were not separated 67 to overcome the problem the anaerobic baffled reactor was modified to construct an mecs abr system for the treatment of petrochemical wastewater 73 it was demonstrated that the maximum cod removal efficiency of the mecs abr system 96 5 was approximately 45 higher than that of abr 66 7 this phase separation also enhanced the impact load resistance and methane production in mecs abr the utilization of anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was limited by the fouling of membrane 74 the mec anmbrs system with membrane filtration over carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms was constructed to relieve membrane fouling and treat wastewater 75 the stability and density of the sludge layer on the membrane surface was relieved by the electrostatic repulsion the result indicated that the removal efficiency of cod was still over 95 during a long term operation in addition a novel bes anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr was investigated for facilitating the degradation of pollutants which revealed that the bes afbr had a higher resistance to impact loading 76 and in a pilot test wang et al had designed a bes uasb combination system with a comprehensive effective volume of 12 8 l where fischer tropsch f t wastewater having 28175 8 32167 6 mg l 1 of cod was treated the optimum cod removal efficiency 93 5 1 6 and methane production 2 01 0 13 m3 m 3 d 1 were achieved under the assistance of uasb effluent recycling of 200 which effectively buffered the effects of ph on bes 77 in conclusion most of the drawbacks of ad are alleviated owing to the embedding of bes and the simultaneous enhancement of microbial activity and pollutant removal efficiency in the bes ad by combining macro effects and micro biological architecture simultaneously the large scale application of mec combined with the current conventional anaerobic architecture to treat refractory wastewater is still a huge challenge 3 3 electrode materials the electrode serves as a key part of the structure and function of bes ad and facilitates electron transfer by bacteria anode provides a place for electrochemically active microorganisms to metabolize and the reduction of cathode potential via the anode reaction which indirectly affected the degradation efficiency of pollutants 78 in addition the anaerobic electron acceptor was provided by the anode material to oxidize the organic pollutants in the wastewater which facilitates the metabolic rate of the anaerobic bacteria like the anode the eab on the cathode could also be used for reduction of refractory pollutants except that it catalyzes energy conversion generally the electrode reaction was greatly determined by the characteristics of electrode materials employed in the past decades common electrodes were mostly made from carbon based materials such as carbon brush carbon cloth carbon fiber felt graphite granules etc these materials had large surface area non corrosive biocompatibility characteristics and great stability the contribution of carbon fiber felt as electrode materials in the bes ad showed that the dechlorination efficiency of 2 4 dichloronitrobenzene was 78 5 6 1 79 nevertheless the conductivity of carbon based materials was just 3 104 1 105 s m 1 which is much lower than that of most metal based electrodes 80 in particular stainless steel mesh ssm and stainless steel fiber felt ssff have been widely employed to provide electrical conductivity and reduce the procurement cost unfortunately these metal based materials have lower biocompatibility compared to carbon based materials thus a novel corrugated stainless steel mesh electrode with 3d structure has been developed 81 compared to the traditional plate stainless steel mesh the novel electrode equipped bes showed a greater removal efficiency better hydrodynamic flow patterns and shorter startup duration recently a corrugated sandwich electrode module based on graphite coated stainless steel and carbon felt was embedded in a traditional abr effective volume 45m³ for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater around 35 2 12 8 of cod reduction and 67 2 21 4 of color removal efficiency was observed during about six months operation respectively which was 16 7 13 2 and 59 4 27 9 higher than that of the conventional abr 82 with proper electrode design and selection which provides numerous sites for the attachment of eab and promote the mass transfer efficiency between microbes and pollutants currently specific surface area and material cost are key influences in the selection of electrodes taking into account scalability biocompatibility electrochemical stability and corrosion resistance however the development of electrode materials that are suitable for large scale application is the most severe challenge the proposed composite electrode module could provide a viable option to deploy large scale bes 3 4 microbial community structure the operational efficiency of the bes ad was greatly influenced by the tems of cooperation and competition between anaerobe community and electrochemically active bacteria eab 83 complex organic substrates could be transformed into electron donors which are easier to be used by exoelectrogens with the assistance of hydrolytic acidification bacteria and fermentative bacteria additionally the synergetic relationship between exoelectrogens and methanogens mainly lies in the fact that exoelectrogens could effectively eliminate the accumulation of vfas in ad so as to alleviate the inhibition of methanogen 84 however there was also substrate competition between methanogen and anode exoelectrogen whichled to the decrease of coulombic efficiency ce 85 voltage intervention may be a promising approach to mitigate this phenomenon 86 for instance most of the glucose was oxidized by fermentative bacteria in the anodic substrate of bes and these fermentative products were used as substrates of the exoelectrogen to produce electricity 87 however the type of acidogenic fermentation of glucose was changed by a voltage applied bes and increased the acetate and hydrogen content of the fermentation products the result was demonstrated by a decrease in glucose fermentation microorganisms and an increase in exoelectrogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 38 firstly compared with ad shannon index of 4 17 16s rdna sequencing results demonstrated a more plentiful microbial diversity in bes ad shannon index of 5 69 which indicated that the microbial community grew comparatively richer in the bes ad 67 then for the degradation of ρ chloronitrobenzenes ρ clnb dechlorinating species chloroflexi anaerolineae and fermentative species kosmotoga were enriched in the bes ad which increased by 15 0 and 16 8 respectively 88 similarly in the decyanation and mineralization process of isophthalonitrile ipn compared with ad ipn reduction related species in bes ad hydrogenophaga falkowbacteria and mesotoga were enriched by 18 07 6 28 and 7 96 respectively 76 as a typical mesothermal methanogen mesotoga was difficult to grew in the ad system and played a indispensable role in the anaerobic ecological niche 53 89 moreover mesotoga was affiliated to the thermotogae class which was able to hydrolyze carbohydrate in ad and was beneficial to methane yield 90 91 although under external interference with the degradation of toxic aromatic compounds in anoxic state mesotoga also maintained the system stability and operation 92 a pilot scale bes abr supplemented by short chain fatty acid oxidation syntrophs sfas and exoelectrogens has been developed to enrich methane resulting in the promotion of organic degradation simultaneously the enrichment of syntrophomonas geobacter methanobacterium and methannosarcina demonstrates the feasibility of sfas and exoelectrogens as assistant 93 this strategy can also provide a reference for the enrichment of characteristic pollutant degrading bacteria and the synergetic effect between methanogens and exoelectrogens was promoted in response to the degradation of specific pollutants there were different mechanisms for bes ad among them a common feature was that they changed the diversity of microbial communities and the abundance of species under the action of the electric field the methanogenic activity has also enriched the specific degradation strains of sexual target pollutants efficiently but there is still little research on its specific mechanism 4 electrode modification for bes alternatives have been explored in the development of electrode modification to enhance bes ad performance and stability of long term operational stability fig 2 the following electrode modification methods could change their biocompatibility biofilm adhesion and conductivity to some extent it is worth discussing that the bes ad performance was improved by these complex modification methods but their relatively high cost limits their widespread application thus more research on the electrode materials of bes ad would be required before application in the industrial system 94 for example the mainstream comprehensive modification method was based on bioelectrode a cheap substrate material was simply modified to obtain an efficient electrode and ensure the operational stability of the system the performances of electrode modification are summarized in table 2 4 1 anode modification conventional carbon based and metal based anodes are limited by biocompatibility electrical conductivity specific surface area and other characteristics 95 therefore it is critical to modify the anode by adjusting the anode surface morphology and chemistry for accelerating the degradation of refractory pollutants and facilitating the efficiency of the electron transfer from the microorganism to the surface of the electrode in bes ad currently conventional anode electrode cae materials have undergone some modifications such as chemical modification metal nanoparticles conducting polymers carbon nanotube cnt graphene gr etc a novel mfc anode was constructed by synthesizing zero dimensional nitrogen doped carbon dots on the surface of carbon paper 96 the power output increased by 77 after the introduction of zero dimension nitrogen and the biofilm on the novel anode was almost twice as thick as that on the ordinary carbon cloth anode provided a promising strategy to the removal of contaminants by thickening the electrode biofilm with the perspective of reducing the resistance of systems improving electrical conductivity and expanding specific surface area metal nanoparticles could be employed to modify the anode mohamed et al deposited iron iron oxide fe fe2o3 nanoparticles on the surface of carbon cloth cc anode for degradation of organic pollutants and achieved the removal efficiency of more than 80 due to the modified electrodes with decreased electron transfer resistance 97 furthermore excellent anode performance was achieved when metal nanoparticles with conducting polymers in the form of composites were used a carbon felt cf electrode coated with polyaniline pani petaline nio was employed as an anode in a mfc 98 the novel electrode was synthesized by in situ growth and polymerization with enhanced wettability of the electrode and reduced charge transfer resistance the modified composite electrode could improve the decolorization efficiency by 49 in comparison with the unmodified cf anode cnts have been widely reported for their large surface area and mechanical stability cnt was coated on the surface of ssm to form a composite electrode for treatment of the filtrate generated by the fermentation of municipal sludge in bes 99 the maximum power density was 7 21 folds higher than the graphite felt as the anode the enhanced performance was mainly accredited to the provision of a suitable microenvironment to maintain bacterial attachment graphene can accelerate extracellular electron transfer between the electrode surface microbes and microbes owing to its remarkable physical and electrical properties according to the the research of tian et al the use of a novel graphene gr polypyrrole ppy to improve low temperature anaerobic digestion ad of low load wastewater resulted in 0 72 0 02 kw h m 3 d 1 energy recovery with 57 9 cod removal efficiency 100 a novel anode of dopamine modified cf was employed in a mfc for degrading indole and generating electricity and was found to facilitate the adhesion of electrode leading to an increase in the thickness of biofilm with enhanced removal of indole 101 4 2 cathode modification a cathode as an electron donor critically controls the performance of the reduction efficiency of refractory pollutants in the bes ad as with the anode the surface properties of the cathode have a substantial influence on the microbes electrode interaction to form a strong biofilm which is named the biocathode 102 nevertheless biocathode has relatively lower power density compared to the abiotic cathode resulting in a low pollutant reduction therefore it is important for the removal of refractory pollutants in bess via the development of modified methods to accelerate electron transfer between cathode biofilm and targeted pollutants apart from the anode those methods could also be applied to cathode modification in the bes ad the ultimate goal of the modification is to reduce the activation over potential of a particular redox reactions a novel approach has been utilized for the fabrication of hydrophilic groups nh nh2 modified cc electrodes for the biocathode transformation efficiency of nitrobenzene nb 103 the result of the electroactive nitroaromatic reducers with the maximum relative abundance confirmed that the hydrophilic modified group was 15 higher than the hydrophobic groups which powerfully indicated the hydrophobic electrode facilitated the adhesion of functional microorganisms in view of these conducting polymers were also adopted to modify biocathode to improve the cell adhesion of bacteria li et al developed the electrode using polyaniline pani with graphite for perchlorate reduction 104 it was reported that compared with the cathode without biofilm cathode the utilization of pani can improve the reduction efficiency by 12 additionally facilitating the electron transfer from the cathode to the electron acceptors was a major contribution of biofilms in another study a strategy for the design of dual graphene was demonstrated 105 which was employed as biocathode for reduction of oxytetracycline otc the power density 86 6 5 1 mw m 2 was achieved with the otc removal efficiency 95 0 this indicated that the presence of graphene could affect the biomass load on the electrode to a certain extent furthermore dual chamber bess with graphite felt electrodes of nitrogen doping graphene ng was fabricated and the reduction efficiency of 4 nitrophenol with modified cathode was as high as 73 3 8 2 which was approximately twice greater than the normal gf cathode 106 it was a promising strategy that the activation zone of electron transfer and reduction reactions were synergistically activated for the development of high performance cathode modification methods the use of complex modified electrodes for biocathode was rather limited in the bes ad and the modification of anaerobic biocathode was still mainly focused on the change of electrode material configuration 81 107 it has provided a theoretical basis for significantly improving the degradation of pollutants and power density in the modification of the abiotic cathode 108 109 simultaneously a carbon based gas diffusion electrode gde could improve the solubility of carbon dioxide boosting the production of alcohols however the extensive application of the system is limited to its ph sensitivity 110 recently the metal organic frameworks mofs have been developed as high efficiency cathode materials due to their diversity of topological structures and countless active sites for bes 111 112 5 future prospects and challenges the current studies indicate that the large scale bes ad has lower operational efficiency than that of laboratory scale 82 meanwhile the cost efficiency of the system must be analyzed to target the application of large scale for the economic aspects of electrode materials noori et al estimated that the cost of stainless steel wire cloth was 30 8 m 2 much less than carbon felt 145 8 m 2 carbon cloth 278 m 2 carbon paper 462 m 2 and titanium frit 7400 m 2 30 on the other hand beegle and borole focused on analyzing the comprehensive economic performance of ad mec ad and mfc ad 113 which are summarized in table 3 the result indicates that a bes ad could operate with relatively high energy efficiency led to additional economic and environmental responses however there were some few improvements such as the system component optimization and the economic feasibility should be properly addressed in the future 1 the lack of understanding of the electron transfer mechanism between electrodes and microorganisms was a major limitation for large scale application of bes ad which directly affected the selection of electrode materials 2 the layout and configuration of bes ad electrodes on a large scale is important to consider the fabrication cost and replacement cycle it would be designed an sandwich corrugated of electrodes or surrounding carbon fiber brush electrodes and simply modified to suit the amplification process 3 the amplified electrode should strengthen the connection between the electrode and circuit to prevent poor contact the lab scale reactors are always made of insulated plexiglass which have no short circuiting phenomenon in the operational process however the scaled up reactor was highly demanding in terms of material and spatial structure design 4 it was worth to minimize the energy consumption of the system the higher energy consumption was caused by low mass transfer efficiency and high electrochemical loss hence an optimal energy efficiency of the system could be achieved by optimizing voltage application and the utilization of biogas energy the recommended form of electrode construction and the problem of energy balance for the large scale bes ad are shown in fig 3 6 conclusion this review has demonstrated the potential of the bes ad for the treatment of refractory wastewater this review has evaluated the performance of bes ad for different types of wastewater anaerobic reactors electrode materials and microbial communities the embedding of bes addresses the accumulation of vfa and accelerates the start up period and thus results in the growth of various microbial communities in the system novel electrodes with high biocompatibility and large specific surface area can be fabricated by the bioelectrodes based modification and used for synergistic reinforcement of the system by combining macroscopic effects with microscopic biological mechanisms however some issues are yet to be addressed in the electron transfer mechanism and the large scale application of bes ad including 1 exploring the electron transfer mechanism between electrodes and microorganisms 2 the structural design and fabrication cost of electrode and 3 mass transfer efficiency and electrochemical losses of long circuits in large scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors

13609,biofilm photobioreactors bpbrs employing algal bacterial symbiotic reactions were designed as an on site post treatment system to treat septic tank effluent containing high concentrations of organic and nutrient matters in this study three bpbrs equipped with blue peak wavelength 460 nm red peak wavelength 635 and mixed blue and red 50 50 lights for growing algal biomass chlorella sp were continuously operated at hydraulic retention times hrt light intensity and light dark period of 6 days 124 μmol m2 s and 12 12 h respectively the experimental results illustrated that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of 85 and the highest total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies of 87 and 84 respectively were found in the bpbr with mixed blue and red lights corresponding to the data of biomass productivity mass balance analyses of the bpbr performance indicated that tn 9 2 mg n l d or 74 and tp 0 73 mg p l d or 73 were mainly removed via biomass assimilation overall the results of this study suggested that the mixed blue and red lights could enhance the biomass productivity and increase the treatment efficiencies of the bpbr system resulting in the treated effluent meeting the discharge standards keywords biofilm photobioreactor specific wavelengths of light algal biomass septic tank effluent nutrient recovery 1 introduction septic tanks as an on site sanitation system are widely used for treating domestic wastewater especially blackwater or wastewater from toilet activities in many developing countries however due to the relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 days and without drainage fields the discharged effluent from the on site sanitation systems still contains high concentrations of organic and nutrient matters 1 2 in developing countries cod tn and tp concentrations in the septic tank effluent were reported to be in the ranges of 100 750 40 700 3 53 mg l respectively 3 4 therefore appropriate treatment technologies such as high rate algal pond hraps and photobioreactors pbrs employing algal bacterial symbiotic reactions which are economical and easy to operate and maintain 5 should be applied to improve quality of the septic tank effluent algae are microorganisms that produce oxygen o2 during photosynthetic reactions which can be utilized by aerobic bacteria in biodegrading organic matters 6 the biodegradation by products such as co2 are then utilized by the algal cells for biomass production 6 due to some algae species such as chlorella sp can be tolerant to the pollution and grown in wastewater 7 8 the symbiotic reactions which normally do not require external aeration could be applied for wastewater treatment in addition because the algal cells can take up the wastewater nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p in algae based wastewater treatment systems eutrophication in the receiving water could be avoided 5 9 there are various applications of the algal bacterial symbiotic reactions such as waste stabilization ponds wsps hraps and pbrs 1 5 9 the algal cells can be cultivated in either suspended or biofilm types the biofilm photobioreactors bpbrs equipped with attached growth media could support algal biofilm growing with high biomass density resulting in more biomass and o2 production and better treatment efficiency 10 11 because algal photosynthesis requires light fluctuation of climatic conditions could result in insufficient light for the algal photosynthesis and subsequently inadequate o2 for aerobic bacteria in biodegrading organic matters 12 thus operation of the bpbrs with natural sunlight alone may not be effective 12 13 the bpbrs applying artificial light source to control lighting conditions have been previously reported to have higher biomass productivity and treatment efficiency than the bpbrs relying sunlight 8 14 16 additionally although white light provided the wavelengths of light of 400 700 nm the pbrs with the specific wavelengths of light e g red blue and mixed red and blue lights also gave higher biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency than the pbrs with the white light 17 18 this would be due to the chlorophylls of algae effectively absorbing the red and blue lights 17 19 therefore artificial lighting with has specific wavelengths of 400 500 nm blue light and 600 700 nm red light corresponding to the absorption bands of algal chlorophylls 19 could be applied to maintain the algal growth and treatment efficiency in the bpbrs however there are several studies reporting inconclusive results on the optimum wavelength for algal photosynthesis 15 20 moreover there were not research studying the effects of the specific wavelengths of light on the performance of bpbr with long term operation therefore this study aimed to determine the effects of specific wavelengths of blue 400 500 nm and red 600 700 nm and mixed blue and red ratio 50 50 lights on treatment efficiency and biomass productivity in the bpbrs with long term operation the n and p mass balance analyses were conducted to provide an insight of information into nutrients recovery from the septic tank effluent via the bpbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater influent wastewater used in this study was collected from effluent of a septic tank system treating public toilets in the asian institute of technology ait campus the influent wastewater was weekly prepared by adding glucose c6h12o6 ammonium chloride nh4cl and monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 to have cod tn and tp concentrations of 350 30 85 6 and 7 1 mg l respectively see supplementary table s1 according to the typical characteristics of septic tank effluent 3 accordingly the average n p ratio of the influent wastewater was 24 2 which was slightly higher than the recommended n p ratio of 18 2 for algal bacterial treatment system 6 2 2 algal and bacterial inoculums the algal inoculum of chlorella sp obtained from the thailand institute of scientific and technological research tistr was cultured and acclimatized with the wastewater for 30 days prior to the cultivation of biofilms on attached growth media in the bpbrs moreover the activated sludge mlss of about 0 9 g l of a wastewater treatment plant treating domestic wastewater at the ait campus was used in order to inoculate bacterial groups of proteobacteria and nitrospirae responsible for organic degradation denitrification and nitrification respectively in the bpbrs 16 2 3 led lights the blue and red led lights bogdan led aluminium non waterproof led panel 5050 smd j y trading thailand were used as artificial light sources in this study the wavelengths of the blue and red led lights were in the ranges of 400 500 nm peak wavelength of 460 nm and 600 700 nm peak wavelength of 635 nm respectively analyzed by diode array spectroradiometer bunkoh keiki japan figure s1 additionally the combined blue and red lights with ratio of 50 50 were applied by using one blue panel per one red panel of the led lights and simultaneously illuminated to the blue red bpbr 2 4 experimental set up three bpbrs were used each with a dimension of 0 10 0 50 0 6 m width depth length corresponding to a working volume of 24 l similar to the previous study of 16 fig 1 attached growth media made of used water bottles which had specific surface area and specific density of 0 022 m2 pieces and 1 38 kg m3 respectively see supplementary table s2 were installed in each bpbr to make the specific surface area of 162 m2 m3 the nh3 n volatilized from each bpbr was measured by the attached nh3 n trap unit in order to collect the total amount of the tn volatilized as ammonia nvol in the bpbrs air was continuously pumped at a flow rate of 1 5 l min to the bpbr which eventually flowed into the ammonia trap unit which was a 250 ml flask containing 100 ml of 2 of boric acid solution fig 1 the three bpbrs i e blue red and blue red bpbrs were illuminated with the blue red and mixed blue and red ratio of 50 50 led lights respectively and operated in parallel to investigate their effects on treatment efficiencies the do mettler toledo s4 standard switzerland and ph mettler toledo ag 2009 switzerland probes connecting the data logger system were equipped to the bpbr units in order to continuously monitor the dissolved oxygen do concentrations and ph values fig 1 the temperatures of the bpbr units were also continuously measured by using thermometers mettler toledo ag 2009 switzerland 2 5 cultivation of biofilms on attached growth media the algal bacterial attached growth cultivation was undertaken according to the method modified from the previous studies 21 and 22 about 14 l of the cultured algal inoculums and 10 l of the bacterial inoculums were placed into each bpbr unit each bpbr was continuously operated under light intensity of 124 11 μmol m2 s during the cultivation period to accelerate the development of the biofilm 23 about 0 3 gdw m2 of the biofilm on the attached growth media was developed within 20 days of the cultivation period 2 6 operating conditions after the cultivation period the acclimatization process of the bpbrs was undertaken for about 25 days in which the bpbrs were continuously fed with the influent wastewater to achieve steady state conditions based on relatively constant effluent cod tn and tp concentrations all bpbrs were operated under the light intensity measured on the outer surface of the reactors of 124 11 μmol m2 s and light dark period of 12 12 h 24 accordingly during the operating period the average energy consumptions of the bpbr was about 2 14 kwh m3 day see supplementary table s3 moreover according to the results of the previous experiment of bpbrs see supplementary figure s2 the bpbrs were operated at the hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 days corresponding to the organic loading rate olr nitrogen loading rate nlr and phosphorus loading rate plr of 58 5 14 1 and 1 2 0 5 mg l d respectively table 1 2 7 analytical methods 2 7 1 analysis of wastewater wastewater samples of the bpbr influent and effluent were collected 3 times per week for analysis of cod total suspended solids tss total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nh3 n and tp concentrations according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 a potable analyzer hach dr 2700 germany was employed for analysis of no3 n and no2 n concentrations 2 7 2 analysis of biomass and chlorophyll a to analyse biomass yield and chlorophyll a chl a both the suspended and biofilm biomass samples were respectively harvested from the mixed liquor and collected from 12 pieces of the attached growth media at 6 sampling points of each bpbr figure s3 the collected biofilm biomass was re suspended in distilled water and filtrated with gf c filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm the filters were then dried at 105 c for 24 h in an oven to determine dry weight dw of the biomass 27 chlorophyll a of the suspended and biofilm biomass was analysed spectrophotometrically by a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer tokyo japan the total amount of the biofilm biomass in each bpbr was estimated based on tss concentrations on the attached growth media pieces the algal biomass content was calculated from chlorophyll a content 7 meanwhile the remaining content of the total biomass was accounted as the bacterial biomass content 2 7 3 analysis of carbon c n and p contents in biomass and sediments in this study a toc analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu coperation japan was used for analyzing c contents in the biomass the analysis of tkn and tp contents in the biomass and the accumulated sediment samples collected from 3 sampling points figure s3 in the bpbrs every 2 week were done according to the methods outlined in 25 2 8 n mass balance the calculation of n mass balance in the bpbr was adopted from the previous study of chaiwong et al 16 as revealed in eq 1 the n inf is equal to sum of neff nbio nsed nvol and nden 1 n i n f n e f f n b i o n s e d n v o l n d e n where n inf neff nbio nsed nvol and n den are tn in influent effluent biomass accumulated sediments tn volatilized as ammonia gas and tn loss due

water and wastewater 25 during the operating period the control nh3 n trap system the ambient air being directly flowed into the control nh3 n trap system was also conducted in order to check the system accuracy 16 additionally the biomass samples were collected at days 45 and 90 of the operating period for the tests of nden mg l d by the nitrate reduction method 29 as detailed in the previous study of chaiwong et al 16 2 9 p mass balance the calculation of p mass balance in the bpbrs adopted from the previous study of chaiwong et al 16 is expressed in eq 2 the pinf is equal to combined amounts of peff pbio and psed 2 p i n f p e f f p b i o p s e d where p inf peff pbio psed are tp in influent effluent biomass accumulated sediments respectively the unit of all parameters of the p

operating period the do concentrations in all bpbrs were between 6 10 mg l corresponding the ph values of up to 9 this could be due to the algal photosynthetic reactions taking up co2 and producing o2 in the bpbrs during the lighting period moreover because the do concentrations were taken up for organic degradation activities converting organics to be co2 by the aerobic heterotrophs and nitrifications processes converting nh3 to be no3 by the nitrifiers 16 22 31 they were found to be gradually decreased to be lower than 2 mg l in all bpbrs during the dark period fig 2 3 2 treatment

the blue red and blue red bpbrs were 86 6 81 11 and 85 7 respectively resulting the average effluent cod concentrations of 50 10 65 12 and 55 5 mg l respectively fig 3a meanwhile as shown in figs 3b and c the highest tn and tp removal efficiencies of 87 4 and 84 8 were found in the blue red bpbr which were higher than those of the other bpbrs p 0 05 however there were no statistical differences among the results of the cod removal efficiencies in the bpbrs p 0 05 the removal of cod concentrations in the bpbrs were achieved mainly via biological oxidation by aerobic bacteria 22 corresponding to the decreased do concentrations and ph values in the bpbrs during the dark periods fig 2 meanwhile the removal of tn and tp concentrations in the bpbrs were mainly through biomass assimilation 9 16 in addition the effluent cod concentrations of the blue red and blue red bpbrs as shown in table 2 were within the national and international discharge standards 32 33 while the effluent tn and tp concentrations and treatment efficiencies of blue red bpbrs were also within the above standards table 2 as the results the bpbrs of this study could be considered as a suitable on site post treatment technology for treating septic tank effluent 3 3 biomass productivity during the operating period the accumulated biomass in the blue red and blue red bpbrs increased from 0 4 0 5 6 8 1 2 at day 80 from 0 5 0 3 7 1 0 5 g l at day 80 and from 0 4 0 7 8 6 0 8 at day 60 gdw l respectively corresponding to the increased chlorophyll a concentrations from 1 8 0 7 86 2 11 4 mg l from 0 7 0 4 85 8 10 3 mg l and from 1 9 1 1 121 3 13 7 mg l respectively fig 4 indicating increases of algal growth in the bpbrs the suspended biomass was less than 1 70 mg l of tss of the total biomass suggesting the biofilms attached growth biomass were the major biomass responsible for con tn and tp removal in the bpbrs accordingly as shown in table 3 the pa of the blue red bpbr were higher than pa of the blue and red bpbrs p 0 05 moreover the specific growth rates of the bpbrs were calculated using the data of accumulated biomass during days 7 65 in which the biomass growth was assumed to be in the exponential phase fig 3 the specific growth rate of the biomass in the blue red bpbr 0 16 d 1 was found to be higher than the blue and red bpbrs 0 14 d 1 as illustrated in table 3 these observed results of the biomass productivity and specific growth rate were corresponding to data of tn and tp removals in the bpbrs fig 3b and c during algal photosynthesis the red light wavelengths 600 700 nm can enhance the algal photosystem ii while the blue light wavelengths 400 500 nm can increase the algal photosystem i 34 hence the mixed blue and red lights can apparently increase algal photosynthetic activities and consequently induce enzyme activities of carbonic anhydrase activation for hydrogen carbonate hco3 and activation of reductases for nitrite nitrate and phosphorus utilization resulting in the induced growth of algal cells 17 19 34 therefore the mixed red and blue lights could enhance the growth of biomass and accordingly nutrient uptake by the algal biomass in the bpbr system the bacterial biomass contents found in the blue red and blue red bpbrs are shown in table 3 corresponding respectively to the results of cod removals fig 3a nox n production and nden fig 5 a the c n and p contents in the biomass of this study were comparable to those of previous studies 16 35 additionally because of the varieties of reactor configurations and difficulties in measuring effective attached growth surface areas among various the algal biofilm systems pa was used instead of ps for comparing the biomass productivity among the algal biofilm systems because pa values of other algal biofilm systems reporting between 0 8 31 gdw m2 d 6 31 36 38 are lower than the pa value in table 3 the bpbr systems in this study demonstrate their applicability for treatment of septic tank effluent however to optimize energy consumption and cost effectiveness for operating the bpbr effects of other operating conditions such as light intensity and light dark period on the bpbrs should be further studied 3 4 mass balances of n and p in bpbrs as shown in fig 5a the nlr of 14 3 1 in the bpbrs contained organic nitrogen org n nh3 n and nox n of 2 9 0 2 20 of the nlr 11 3 0 8 79 of the nlr and 0 1 0 1 1 of the nlr mgn l d respectively results of the n mass balance analysis revealed that the nrr of 12 4 0 9 mg n l d in the blue red bpbr was higher than those of the blue

were mainly achieved via assimilation of the algal biomass 6 in which the nbio of the blue red and blue red bpbrs were 6 8 2 4 64 of the nrr 6 4 3 1 62 of the nrr and 9 2 2 8 74 of the nrr mgn l d respectively meanwhile the remaining tn concentrations were removed via the other mechanisms i e nden nsed and nvol in particular the observed nox n concentrations in the neff of the blue red and blue red bpbrs fig 5a were found to be 19 7 16 5 and 7 4 mg l respectively see supplementary table s4 indicating the occurrence of nitrification reactions by the nitrifying bacteria 9 16 these results were corresponding to the data of the reduced do concentrations and ph during the dark periods of the bpbrs fig 2 accordingly the nden of the blue red and blue red bpbrs were found to be 1 3 0 8 0 7 0 4 and 0 9 0 8 mg l respectively when the do concentrations were about 2 mg l fig 2 the denitrifiers could utilize the organic matters to remove the produced nox n 9 22 additionally the nsed could be caused by natural sloughing off of the biofilms in the bpbrs moreover the prr of the blue red bpbr was 1 0 0 2 mg p l d higher than the prrs of 0 8 0 1 and 0 9 0 1 mg p l d in the blue and red bpbrs respectively fig 5b because the major biomass in the bpbrs was algae table 3 the tp removal were hypothesized to be mainly via the algal biomass assimilation in the bpbrs in which the pbio were found to be 0 62 0 21 78 of the prr 0 65 0 37 72 of the prr and 0 73 0 25 73 of the prr mgp l d respectively fig 5b corresponding to the data of tp removals fig 3c and table 3 the n and p mass balance

13609,biofilm photobioreactors bpbrs employing algal bacterial symbiotic reactions were designed as an on site post treatment system to treat septic tank effluent containing high concentrations of organic and nutrient matters in this study three bpbrs equipped with blue peak wavelength 460 nm red peak wavelength 635 and mixed blue and red 50 50 lights for growing algal biomass chlorella sp were continuously operated at hydraulic retention times hrt light intensity and light dark period of 6 days 124 μmol m2 s and 12 12 h respectively the experimental results illustrated that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of 85 and the highest total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies of 87 and 84 respectively were found in the bpbr with mixed blue and red lights corresponding to the data of biomass productivity mass balance analyses of the bpbr performance indicated that tn 9 2 mg n l d or 74 and tp 0 73 mg p l d or 73 were mainly removed via biomass assimilation overall the results of this study suggested that the mixed blue and red lights could enhance the biomass productivity and increase the treatment efficiencies of the bpbr system resulting in the treated effluent meeting the discharge standards keywords biofilm photobioreactor specific wavelengths of light algal biomass septic tank effluent nutrient recovery 1 introduction septic tanks as an on site sanitation system are widely used for treating domestic wastewater especially blackwater or wastewater from toilet activities in many developing countries however due to the relatively short hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 days and without drainage fields the discharged effluent from the on site sanitation systems still contains high concentrations of organic and nutrient matters 1 2 in developing countries cod tn and tp concentrations in the septic tank effluent were reported to be in the ranges of 100 750 40 700 3 53 mg l respectively 3 4 therefore appropriate treatment technologies such as high rate algal pond hraps and photobioreactors pbrs employing algal bacterial symbiotic reactions which are economical and easy to operate and maintain 5 should be applied to improve quality of the septic tank effluent algae are microorganisms that produce oxygen o2 during photosynthetic reactions which can be utilized by aerobic bacteria in biodegrading organic matters 6 the biodegradation by products such as co2 are then utilized by the algal cells for biomass production 6 due to some algae species such as chlorella sp can be tolerant to the pollution and grown in wastewater 7 8 the symbiotic reactions which normally do not require external aeration could be applied for wastewater treatment in addition because the algal cells can take up the wastewater nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p in algae based wastewater treatment systems eutrophication in the receiving water could be avoided 5 9 there are various applications of the algal bacterial symbiotic reactions such as waste stabilization ponds wsps hraps and pbrs 1 5 9 the algal cells can be cultivated in either suspended or biofilm types the biofilm photobioreactors bpbrs equipped with attached growth media could support algal biofilm growing with high biomass density resulting in more biomass and o2 production and better treatment efficiency 10 11 because algal photosynthesis requires light fluctuation of climatic conditions could result in insufficient light for the algal photosynthesis and subsequently inadequate o2 for aerobic bacteria in biodegrading organic matters 12 thus operation of the bpbrs with natural sunlight alone may not be effective 12 13 the bpbrs applying artificial light source to control lighting conditions have been previously reported to have higher biomass productivity and treatment efficiency than the bpbrs relying sunlight 8 14 16 additionally although white light provided the wavelengths of light of 400 700 nm the pbrs with the specific wavelengths of light e g red blue and mixed red and blue lights also gave higher biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency than the pbrs with the white light 17 18 this would be due to the chlorophylls of algae effectively absorbing the red and blue lights 17 19 therefore artificial lighting with has specific wavelengths of 400 500 nm blue light and 600 700 nm red light corresponding to the absorption bands of algal chlorophylls 19 could be applied to maintain the algal growth and treatment efficiency in the bpbrs however there are several studies reporting inconclusive results on the optimum wavelength for algal photosynthesis 15 20 moreover there were not research studying the effects of the specific wavelengths of light on the performance of bpbr with long term operation therefore this study aimed to determine the effects of specific wavelengths of blue 400 500 nm and red 600 700 nm and mixed blue and red ratio 50 50 lights on treatment efficiency and biomass productivity in the bpbrs with long term operation the n and p mass balance analyses were conducted to provide an insight of information into nutrients recovery from the septic tank effluent via the bpbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater influent wastewater used in this study was collected from effluent of a septic tank system treating public toilets in the asian institute of technology ait campus the influent wastewater was weekly prepared by adding glucose c6h12o6 ammonium chloride nh4cl and monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 to have cod tn and tp concentrations of 350 30 85 6 and 7 1 mg l respectively see supplementary table s1 according to the typical characteristics of septic tank effluent 3 accordingly the average n p ratio of the influent wastewater was 24 2 which was slightly higher than the recommended n p ratio of 18 2 for algal bacterial treatment system 6 2 2 algal and bacterial inoculums the algal inoculum of chlorella sp obtained from the thailand institute of scientific and technological research tistr was cultured and acclimatized with the wastewater for 30 days prior to the cultivation of biofilms on attached growth media in the bpbrs moreover the activated sludge mlss of about 0 9 g l of a wastewater treatment plant treating domestic wastewater at the ait campus was used in order to inoculate bacterial groups of proteobacteria and nitrospirae responsible for organic degradation denitrification and nitrification respectively in the bpbrs 16 2 3 led lights the blue and red led lights bogdan led aluminium non waterproof led panel 5050 smd j y trading thailand were used as artificial light sources in this study the wavelengths of the blue and red led lights were in the ranges of 400 500 nm peak wavelength of 460 nm and 600 700 nm peak wavelength of 635 nm respectively analyzed by diode array spectroradiometer bunkoh keiki japan figure s1 additionally the combined blue and red lights with ratio of 50 50 were applied by using one blue panel per one red panel of the led lights and simultaneously illuminated to the blue red bpbr 2 4 experimental set up three bpbrs were used each with a dimension of 0 10 0 50 0 6 m width depth length corresponding to a working volume of 24 l similar to the previous study of 16 fig 1 attached growth media made of used water bottles which had specific surface area and specific density of 0 022 m2 pieces and 1 38 kg m3 respectively see supplementary table s2 were installed in each bpbr to make the specific surface area of 162 m2 m3 the nh3 n volatilized from each bpbr was measured by the attached nh3 n trap unit in order to collect the total amount of the tn volatilized as ammonia nvol in the bpbrs air was continuously pumped at a flow rate of 1 5 l min to the bpbr which eventually flowed into the ammonia trap unit which was a 250 ml flask containing 100 ml of 2 of boric acid solution fig 1 the three bpbrs i e blue red and blue red bpbrs were illuminated with the blue red and mixed blue and red ratio of 50 50 led lights respectively and operated in parallel to investigate their effects on treatment efficiencies the do mettler toledo s4 standard switzerland and ph mettler toledo ag 2009 switzerland probes connecting the data logger system were equipped to the bpbr units in order to continuously monitor the dissolved oxygen do concentrations and ph values fig 1 the temperatures of the bpbr units were also continuously measured by using thermometers mettler toledo ag 2009 switzerland 2 5 cultivation of biofilms on attached growth media the algal bacterial attached growth cultivation was undertaken according to the method modified from the previous studies 21 and 22 about 14 l of the cultured algal inoculums and 10 l of the bacterial inoculums were placed into each bpbr unit each bpbr was continuously operated under light intensity of 124 11 μmol m2 s during the cultivation period to accelerate the development of the biofilm 23 about 0 3 gdw m2 of the biofilm on the attached growth media was developed within 20 days of the cultivation period 2 6 operating conditions after the cultivation period the acclimatization process of the bpbrs was undertaken for about 25 days in which the bpbrs were continuously fed with the influent wastewater to achieve steady state conditions based on relatively constant effluent cod tn and tp concentrations all bpbrs were operated under the light intensity measured on the outer surface of the reactors of 124 11 μmol m2 s and light dark period of 12 12 h 24 accordingly during the operating period the average energy consumptions of the bpbr was about 2 14 kwh m3 day see supplementary table s3 moreover according to the results of the previous experiment of bpbrs see supplementary figure s2 the bpbrs were operated at the hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 days corresponding to the organic loading rate olr nitrogen loading rate nlr and phosphorus loading rate plr of 58 5 14 1 and 1 2 0 5 mg l d respectively table 1 2 7 analytical methods 2 7 1 analysis of wastewater wastewater samples of the bpbr influent and effluent were collected 3 times per week for analysis of cod total suspended solids

operating period the do concentrations in all bpbrs were between 6 10 mg l corresponding the ph values of up to 9 this could be due to the algal photosynthetic reactions taking up co2 and producing o2

increase the treatment efficiencies of the bpbr system the highest treatment performance and biomass productivity were found in the blue red bpbr system resulting the effluent cod tn and tp concentrations meeting the national and international discharge standards mass balance analysis of the bpbr performance indicated that tn and tp were mainly removed via biomass assimilation suggesting the possibility for recovering the nutrients for further reuses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
