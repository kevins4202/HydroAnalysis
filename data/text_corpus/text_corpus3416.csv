17080,phosphorus p loadings to the great lakes have been regulated for decades but re eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia have recently been increasingly reported it is of paramount importance to better understand the fate transformation and biogeochemical cycling processes of different p species across the river lake interface we report here results on chemical speciation of p in the seasonally hypoxic fox river green bay system and variations in sources and partitioning of p species along the aquatic continuum during midsummer when productivity is generally high phosphate and dissolved organic p dop were the major species in river water while particulate organic p predominated in open bay waters showing a dynamic change in the chemical speciation of p along the river bay transect with active transformations between inorganic and organic p and between colloidal and particulate phases colloidal organic p cop 1 kda comprised 33 65 of the bulk dop while colloidal inorganic p was generally insignificant and undetectable especially in open bay water sources of cop changed from mainly allochthonous in the fox river having mostly smaller sized colloids 1 3 kda and a lower organic carbon to phosphorus c p ratio to predominantly autochthonous in open bay waters with larger sized colloids 10 kda and a higher organic c p ratio the observed high apparent distribution coefficients k d of p between dissolved and particulate phases and high abundant autochthonous colloidal and particulate organic p in the hypereutrophic environment suggest that in addition to phosphate colloidal particulate organic p may play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of p and the development of seasonal hypoxia graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling nutrients colloidal organic phosphorus chemical speciation fox river green bay 1 introduction as an essential macronutrient for living organisms phosphorus p plays a critical role in regulating primary production water quality and biogeochemical processes in various aquatic environments lean et al 1983 karl 2000 orihel et al 2017 taylor and lean 2018 previous studies have shown that excess nutrients especially p can cause eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia not only in the great lakes region such as lake erie and green bay scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 klump et al 2018 but also in other river dominated coastal marine environments rabalais et al 2001 smith 2003 zhang et al 2010b some p loadings to the great lakes have been regulated through the great lakes water quality agreement glwqa for decades which had led to significant reductions of total p tp concentrations throughout the system in the great lakes chapra and dolan 2012 dolan and chapra 2012 finlay et al 2013 bringing oligotrophication to some great lakes regions such as lake michigan and lake ontario cuhel and aguilar 2013 dove and chapra 2015 lin and guo 2016a for instance offshore tp concentrations in lake ontario were in the range of 5 6 μg l dove and chapra 2015 well below the target concentration of 10 μg l from the glwqa on the other hand re eutrophication and increased hypoxia have been increasingly reported scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 klump et al 2018 reconciling these seemingly contradictory observations and the paradox in nutrient management requires new insights in the chemical speciation bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments over the past few decades a growing body of literature has examined nutrient sources and loadings to the great lakes as well as the fate and internal biogeochemical cycling of p in different lake systems hecky et al 2004 elsbury et al 2009 joosse and baker 2011 lin et al 2016 maccoux et al 2016 depew et al 2018 phosphorus occurs in different chemical forms and physical phases in natural waters lean 1973 b van der zee et al 2007 cai and guo 2009 lin and guo 2016a including dissolved inorganic p dip or soluble reactive p srp dissolved organic p dop colloidal inorganic p cip colloidal organic p cop particulate inorganic p pip and particulate organic p pop each form has different bioavailability chemical reactivity and environmental fate which can play different roles in regulating water quality and the biogeochemical cycling of other bioactive elements in aquatic environments minear and lean 1975 lin et al 2012 qin et al 2015 fang and wang 2020 therefore knowledge about the partitioning and transformation of p among different forms phases is needed to better understand the environmental fate and ecological role of p in aquatic environments wetzel and likens 1991 sylvan et al 2006 yoshimura et al 2014 a large portion of p carried through rivers to estuaries and coastal waters is associated with suspended particles föllmi 1996 jordan et al 2008 yuan et al 2013 indeed p is a highly particle reactive element with distribution coefficient k d values as high as 104 107 in aquatic ecosystems santschi 1995 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2016 lin and guo 2016a and can bind preferentially with colloidal and particulate surfaces in addition to biological uptake and assimilation lean 1973 hilger et al 1999 cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 therefore the dynamic partitioning of p among dissolved colloidal and particulate phases should play a critical role in controlling the abundance transformation bioavailability and the overall biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments nevertheless many monitoring programs and loading analyses usually reported total p and did not recognize the importance of chemical speciation arbuckle and downing 2001 dolan and chapra 2012 robertson et al 2018 there exists a knowledge gap in the understanding of chemical speciation bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling pathways of p in aquatic systems especially at the river lake interfaces colloids are important intermediaries in the biogeochemical cycling of natural organic matter and particle reactive elements due to their high specific surface areas high biological chemical reactivity and short turnover times in aquatic environments honeyman and santschi 1988 guo et al 1997 benner and amon 2015 previous studies have shown that dop especially the hydrophobic forms could be more bioavailable to algae lean and nalewajko 1976 qin et al 2015 and colloidal organic matter or high molecular weight dissolved organic matter hmw dom contains higher hydrophobic components lean 1973 hilger et al 1999 cai et al 2015 implying that a large fraction of the abundant colloidal dop carried by river waters can be bioavailable in receiving waters over the past decades colloidal p in natural waters has been described in more detail especially colloidal organic p mayer and jarrell 1995 haygarth et al 1997 cai and guo 2009 chen et al 2010 lin and guo 2016a gottselig et al 2017 nevertheless other than the abundance of bulk colloids sources of colloidal p and the transformation of p among dissolved colloidal and particulate phases in estuarine environments have rarely been evaluated systematic studies of their sources molecular weight distributions and transformation can provide new insights into a better understanding of the role of colloidal p in regulating dynamic cycling of different p species and its relation to water quality and the development of eutrophication and hypoxia in estuarine and coastal ecosystems the lower fox river green bay lake michigan was listed as one of the great lakes areas of concern during 1980s p inputs from wastewater treatment plants from the fox river basin have been regulated and their inputs have been reduced but non point p sources continue to contribute high p loads to the lower fox river robertson et al 2018 hypereutrophic and seasonal hypoxic conditions in green bay have been frequently observed klump et al 2018 recent studies have examined the dynamics of p species in green bay lin et al 2016 2018 nevertheless the abundance and distribution of colloidal organic and inorganic p forms and their transformation among p species during transport to green bay have not been quantified our hypothesis is that colloidal organic p has high biological chemical reactivity and or high degradation rates in aquatic environments which may increase the rate of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in estuarine and coastal environments thus studies on the details of chemical speciation of p and the estuarine mixing of different p species at the river lake interface is expected to provide a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of p and improve scientific bases for environmental ecological and water resource management in the fox river green bay ecosystem our major objectives were to 1 quantify the abundance of inorganic and organic p species in dissolved colloidal and particulate phases along a transect from the fox river to open green bay during midsummer when p typically limits productivity 2 identify the estuarine mixing and transport of different molecular sized colloidal organic p across the river lake interface and 3 examine sources of different p species and their transformation between different phases as well as the role of colloidal organic p in the biogeochemical cycling of p along the river bay continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area green bay is the largest freshwater estuary in the laurentian great lakes fig 1 and accounts for 9 of surface area of lake michigan however green bay receives 15 30 of the total p loading to lake michigan from its primary tributary the fox river klump et al 2009 robertson et al 2019 among all rivers and streams discharging into green bay the fox river has the largest input with an average discharge of 128 m3 s robertson and saad 2019 and contributes approximately 70 of the nutrient and suspended sediment load klump et al 1997 even though the point sources throughout the fox river system have been regulated and extensive clean up and restoration in southern green bay has occurred over past decades total p loads are at times higher than the total maximum daily load tmdl target wi dnr 2019 deteriorated water quality eutrophic conditions and formation of dead zones remain frequent in southern green bay largely due to excessive p loading from the fox river klump et al 2018 2 2 sampling samples were collected from a series of sampling stations along a transection from the lower fox river to the open green bay on july 10th 2018 fig 1 the average discharge from the fox river on this date was 126 m3 s http waterdata usgs gov usa nwis uv 040851385 basic water quality data including water temperature specific conductivity ph dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a fluorescence chl a were measured by in situ sensors ysi sonde and are given in table 1 along with the specific sampling locations surface water samples 1 m below surface were collected in pre cleaned hdpe bottles and stored in a cooler with ice samples were filtered in the laboratory within 6 h of sampling through pre combusted 450 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f whatman with a pore size of 0 7 µm thus dissolved p species here are operationally defined as those in the 0 7 µm filtrate which may contain living biomass and thus overestimate dop compared to those in the 0 45 µm or 0 2 µm filtrates both the filtrate and filter samples were kept frozen for the measurements of total dissolved p tdp dissolved inorganic p dip or soluble reactive p srp total particulate p tpp particulate inorganic p pip total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic carbon doc in addition aliquots of whole water samples were also filtered through pre weighed gf f filters whatman for the measurements of suspended particulate matter spm particulate organic carbon poc and particulate nitrogen pn and their stable isotope compositions δ13c and δ15n additional filtrate from each sample was collected for ultrafiltration to determine the abundance of colloidal inorganic p cip and colloidal organic p cop due to labor intensive nature in using ultrafiltration only six sampling stations were occupied which may miss possible small variations between sampling stations 2 3 ultrafiltration in addition to dissolved 0 7 µm and particulate 0 7 µm p different size fractions of colloidal p were further isolated using stirred cell ultrafiltration units equipped with membrane discs with different nominal molecular weight cutoffs mwcos including 1 kda ym1 millipore sigma 3 kda ym3 and 10 kda ym10 membranes the bulk dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were then size fractionated into the 1 kda low molecular weight lmw and the 1 3 kda 3 10 kda and 10 kda high molecular weight hmw or colloidal fractions before ultrafiltration all stirred cell units were acid cleaned and the membrane discs were pre cleaned with 0 05 m naoh solution and ultrapure water until the blank ultrafiltrate had an undistinguishable uv absorbance signature from the ultrapure water xu and guo 2017 to avoid lmw retention and thus overestimation of colloids colloidal abundance had to be determined from the ultrafiltration permeation model guo et al 2000 previous studies and our initial ultrafiltration results showed that when the concentration factor was 30 the difference in the colloidal p abundance was within 5 between those derived from the ultrafiltration permeation model and by concentration difference between the integrated permeate and initial solution cai and guo 2009 thus the same concentration factor 30 here was employed for all samples ultrafiltration to reduce the analytical workload and for easy comparisons between samples both the initial water and integrated permeate solution were sampled for the measurements of dip and tdp to calculate the abundances of cip and cop for each sample cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 2 4 measurements of inorganic and organic phosphorus species predetermined volumes of filtrate samples were transferred into a teflon vial with a teflon screw cap and were digested with k2s2o8 solution 50 g l ph 1 in an oven at 140 c for 4 h lin et al 2012 concentrations of tdp were then measured using the standard phosphomolybdenum blue method on an agilent 8453 uv visible spectrophotometer in 5 cm cuvettes at 882 nm hansen and koroleff 1999 concentrations of dip or phosphate were directly measured without digestion the concentration of dop was calculated from the difference between tdp and dip i e dop tdp dip the detection limit was 8 10 nm based on replicate blank sample measurements using 5 cm cuvettes with a precision of 2 for both dip and tdp at 0 1 μm level cai and guo 2009 the tpp concentration was determined after high temperature combustion and acid hydrolysis hcl of filter samples as described in solόrzano and sharp 1980 with some modifications zhang et al 2010a briefly the filter samples were wetted using 0 5 m mgcl2 solution and heated in an oven at 95 c until dry followed by ashing in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h the residue was extracted with 1 m hcl solution at room temperature in the dark for 24 h particulate inorganic p pip was extracted directly from filter samples with 1 m hcl solution for 24 h aspila et al 1976 both extractions of tpp and pip were quantified as dip after neutralization and dilution similar to dop the pop concentration was calculated from the difference between tpp and pip i e pop tpp pip 2 5 measurements of organic carbon dissolved nitrogen stable isotopes and spm the concentrations of doc and tdn were measured using the high temperature combustion method on a shimadzu toc l analyzer with a precision 2 for both doc and tdn guo and macdonald 2006 filtrate samples were acidified with concentrated hcl to a ph 2 before analysis concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including no3 no2 and nh4 were measured using colorimetry on a technicon autoanalyzer concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don were calculated from the difference between tdn and din concentrations i e don tdn din guo et al 2004 guo and macdonald 2006 gf f filter samples were treated with hcl acid fumes overnight for the measurements of poc and pn contents and stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen isotope δ15n compositions on an elemental analyzer interfaced with a thermo fisher scientific isotopic ratio mass spectrometer delta v the precision and accuracy of δ13c and δ15n were 0 1 and 0 2 respectively as determined by replicate analysis of standards yang et al 2015 the suspended particulate matter spm concentrations were determined using the weight difference between dried filter samples and blank filters filter samples were weighed after freeze drying until achieving a constant weight 2 6 determination of distribution coefficient of p between dissolved and particulate phases the partitioning of p species between dissolved and particulate phases and their particle reactivity could be quantitatively evaluated using the apparent distribution coefficient or partition coefficient k d approach this approach has been used in previous studies to examine the partitioning and adsorption behavior of p in aquatic environments e g santschi 1995 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2016 the apparent k d values were calculated based on the following equation k d c p c d s p m where cp is the concentration of particulate p in the inorganic organic or total p pool in μm cd is the concentration of inorganic organic or total p in μm in the dissolved phase spm is the concentration of suspended particulate matter kg l or g ml accordingly k d has a unit of ml g or l kg and its values are reported here in logk d 3 results 3 1 water quality data surface water temperatures varied from 23 4 c to 26 5 c with an average of 25 1 1 2 c table 1 specific conductivity decreased from 463 μs cm in the fox river to 322 μs cm in open green bay table 1 showing a typical feature of negative estuaries xu et al 2018a surface water ph ranged from 8 05 to 8 55 with an average of 8 34 0 18 table 1 exhibiting the effect of limestone in the basin and the characteristic of carbonate water chemistry lin and guo 2016b concentrations of do in terms of saturation were 100 at all stations table 1 spm concentrations decreased rapidly from the fox river 29 6 3 8 mg l to open green bay 7 3 4 3 mg l table 1 indicating that the fox river was the main source of suspended sediment and turbidity to the water column levels of chl a in surface waters were somewhat variable ranging from 8 5 μg l to 76 9 μg l with an average of 40 7 29 2 μg l table 1 elevated chl a was observed at the river bay interface and then decreased in general from estuary to open water showing a strong trophic gradient driven by the fox river with high nutrients 3 2 variations in dissolved inorganic and organic phosphorus concentrations of dip monotonically decreased with decreasing specific conductivity from 4 15 μm at the fox river end member station st 12 to 0 11 μm at the open station st 56 with an average of 1 47 1 57 μm and showing quasi conservative mixing between river water and bay water table 2 fig 2 a concentrations of dop ranged from 0 24 to 2 61 μm with an average of 1 18 1 00 μm and a little addition or production of dop at stations 16 and 22 compared to the theoretical mixing line between river water and bay water fig 2a both dip and dop decreased rapidly from the fox river to open green bay showing a dominant source from the river basin for both dissolved p species fig 2a within the total dissolved p pool dip contributed up to 48 10 varying from 61 in the fox river to 31 in open bay water while dop comprised 52 10 of the total dissolved p ranging from 39 in fox river water to 69 in open bay water while dip was the dominant dissolved p species in river waters dop became the major dissolved p species in the open green bay fig 2e with an active transformation between the dissolved p species along the river bay transect similar to dop concentrations of doc and don also decreased from the fox river 869 µm c and 100 µm n respectively to the open green bay 441 µm c and 19 µm n respectively table 2 showing again a strong trophic gradient along the river bay transect 3 3 variations in particulate inorganic and organic phosphorus the concentration of tpp pip pop decreased from 3 39 μm in the fox river to 2 75 μm in open bay waters with an average of 3 16 0 35 μm table 3 within the total particulate p pool pip average of 1 08 0 62 μm generally decreased from river waters stations 12 and 16 to open bay while pop average of 2 08 0 31 μm generally increased from river water to bay water or increased with decreasing specific conductivity fig 2b the decrease in pip and increase in pop concentrations from river water to bay water are consistent with the dynamic transformation between dip and dop in the water column and point to a rapid change in sources of particulate p species along the river bay transect while tpp concentrations in μm decreased from the river to bay waters both spm normalized pip and pop concentrations in mg p g particles in contrast increased especially pop table 3 fig 2c in other words the amount of p in the particles increased from river to bay waters 3 4 partitioning of p between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases the tdp tp ratio was 0 57 0 09 in river estuarine region indicating that p exported from the fox river during summer was on average slightly higher in the dissolved phase nevertheless the tdp tp ratio sharply decreased from the estuary to open bay 0 16 0 05 and particulate p became the predominant p species making up 80 of the total p pool in open bay waters fig 2f showing a considerable transformation between dissolved and particulate p along the river bay transect in terms of phase partitioning of inorganic p the lmw dip comprised 67 of the total inorganic p tip in river waters and decreased dramatically to as low as 23 in open bay waters while cip only made up 0 4 of the tip fig 3 pip comprised on average 55 18 of the tip increasing from 30 in river waters to 71 in open bay waters fig 3 in contrast to the phase partitioning of inorganic p the lmw dop and cop made up 17 14 and 15 11 of the top respectively while pop comprised 68 23 of top increasing from 38 in river waters to 91 in open bay waters showing elevated contribution from in situ biological algal production and incorporation of dip fig 3 as shown in fig 4 the percentage of dip and dop in the tp pool decreased from the fox river to open green bay resulting from physical dilution and biological uptake conversely the percentage of pop was higher in open green bay than that in the fox river on average pop had a significantly higher contribution 46 26 to the tp pool compared to pip 18 4 large variations in dissolved and particulate p concentrations were evident along the river bay transect fig 2 with concentrations decreasing from river water to bay water for all p species except for pop which in contrast increased there was a significant inverse correlation between pop and dip or dop p 0 001 supplementary fig s1 suggesting a dynamic transformation of p between dissolved and particulate phases during estuarine mixing and biological production overall dissolved p slightly dominated the total p pool in the river estuarine region while particulate p became predominant in the total p pool in open green bay fig 4 to quantify the apparent partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases values of logk d were compared between different p species as shown in supplementary table s1 values of logk d varied from 4 2 to 6 4 for inorganic organic or total p the differences in logk d values between p species at a specific station are quite small fig 5 however logk d values increased in general from river to bay waters showing the effects of biological productivity and spm concentration or particle concentration effect indeed there is a significant negative correlation between logk d values and logspm for inorganic organic and total p pools in the fox river plume fig 5 as has been observed in other estuarine systems e g caraco et al 1990 santschi 1995 turner and tyler 1997 lin et al 2012 lin and guo 2016a 3 5 abundances and molecular weight distributions of colloidal phosphorus the cop concentration in the 1 kda 0 7 µm colloidal fraction varied from 0 14 to 1 37 μm corresponding to 33 65 of the bulk dop therefore much of the p typically described as dissolved p is actually colloidal organic p cip concentrations however ranged from below the detection limit to 0 15 μm making up 0 7 5 of the bulk dip table 4 as shown in fig 6 the cip concentration remained somewhat similar 0 12 0 15 µm in the river estuarine region stations 12 16 and 22 and then decreased rapidly and became undetectable in open bay waters this indicated that cip is mainly derived from river input and dip is exclusively present in ionic forms in open green bay consistent with those reported for other aquatic environments such as the mississippi river plume and milwaukee river estuary cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 the percentage of cop in the bulk dop was relatively high in the fox river and decreased in the inner bay showing an evident river or terrigenous source fig 6 in addition the percentage of cop increased again from the inner bay to open bay and remained at similarly high levels in open bay waters fig 6 resulting from autochthonous sources in contrast to the abundant cop at all stations the amount of cip was small and was detectable only in fox river and its estuarine waters suggesting river input is the sole cip source the abundance of cop changed significantly p 0 05 across the river lake interface fig 7 shifting from fairly high bulk cop in river water 52 sum of cops to rather low cop 33 8 in the estuarine mixing zone to even higher cop again in open green bay 59 9 cop large variations in the bulk cop abundance with a bi mode distribution along the river bay transect indicated a dynamic transformation between lmw and hmw dop pools during estuarine mixing based on the detailed size distributions of dop among the 1 kda 1 3 kda 3 10 kda and 10 kda 0 7 µm size ranges the major colloidal component within the bulk cop pool was the 1 3 kda small cop 48 in river water the 3 10 kda medium cop 54 in the estuarine mixing zone and the 10 kda 0 7 μm large cop 48 79 in open bay water respectively showing a progressive increase towards the higher molecular weight or large sized colloids from the fox river to open green bay fig 7 dynamic changes in the molecular weight distribution of cop observed here clearly indicate the unique colloidal molecular size characteristics between terrestrial and autochthonous sources and a rapid turnover of cop across the river bay interface 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons in chemical speciation of phosphorus with other aquatic environments unlike rivers heavily affected by anthropogenic activities and having elevated dip tdp ratios up to 0 9 such as the maumee river baker et al 2014 and the mississippi river cai and guo 2009 that affected development of hypoxia in lake erie and the northern gulf of mexico respectively the fox river had an intermediate dip tdp ratio 0 55 0 05 and dop tdp ratio 0 45 0 05 during the summer sampling period which agrees well with previous observations table 5 these differences may be due to lake winnebago located upstream of the fox river that converts much of the dip to dop prior to reaching the fox river mouth or differences between sampling seasons relatively higher dop tdp ratios in the lower fox river may exert a critical role in the development of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in green bay enhanced by the consumption of dissolved oxygen and the release of dip during dop and pop degradation p in the water column and sediment lin et al 2016 direct utilization of dop by algae is also possible qin et all 2015 thompson and cotner 2018 the tdp tp ratio was slightly higher than the tpp tp in the fox river similar to those observed in the milwaukee river table 5 the partitioning of p between organic and inorganic phases dip vs dop or pip vs pop and between dissolved and particulate phases tdp vs tpp seems highly variable among rivers table 5 showing distinct features in the phase distribution of p the average concentrations of both tdp and tpp in the southern green bay were much higher than those in lake michigan table 5 indicating the effects of the fox river on green bay robertson et al 2018 compared to other laurentian great lakes both southern green bay and lake erie had elevated tdp and tpp concentrations and similar partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases table 5 consistent with their environmental settings both with intensive anthropogenic influence non point sources and seasonal hypoxia wynne et al 2010 kane et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 it is likely that high tpp abundance especially pop and oxides mineral associate p which may be converted into bioavailable or potentially bioavailable p species during their transport and sedimentary diagenesis paytan et al 2017 lin et al 2018 depew et al 2018 liu et al 2020 may help contribute to the development of eutrophication and hypoxia in green bay and lake erie 4 2 sources of p species and dissolved particulate organic matter in general high lmw dip and lmw dop concentrations were observed in river waters but decreased sharply in the estuarine area and remained low in open bay waters supplementary table s2 indicating a strong riverine source for both lmw dip and lmw dop although the concentrations of each p species changed differently environmental consistency exists in the size distributions of both inorganic and organic p pools along the river bay transect regulated by physicochemical and biological processes figs 2 and 3 the molar ratios of doc dop or organic c p ratio ranged from 333 in the river end member water to 1838 in open bay water table 2 which are considerably higher than the redfield ratio of 106 redfield et al 1963 suggesting either an overall p depleted dom pool or dom in the study area containing mostly highly degraded organic components due to the preferential degradation of p containing organic compounds highly degraded organic matter is expected to have a higher c p ratio in comparison with the freshly produced organic matter in aquatic systems sannigrahi et al 2006 cai and guo 2009 yates et al 2019 on the other hand highly degraded soil organic matter in a semi closed environment has a lower organic c p ratio due to the loss of oc in the form of co2 and the re assimilation of phosphate into soil organic matter pool dou et al 2017 gao et al 2018 therefore dom with lower c p ratio in river water suggests sources from eroded soil organic matter while autochthonous dom with higher c p ratio in open bay waters was indicative of rapid recycling and preferential regeneration of p relative to c phosphate has a molecular mass of 95 da and is expected to occur only in the 1 kda lmw phase nevertheless a detectable level of bulk cip has been reported for semiarid soils surface runoff and water extracts sinaj et al 1998 turner et al 2004 and small black water rivers such as the pearl river mississippi cai and guo 2009 and jourdan river mississippi lin et al 2012 but not detectable in mississippi river waters cai and guo 2009 the detectable cip in the lower fox river could also be the result of dip associated with fe oxyhydroxides and mineral colloids due to the particle reactive nature of p and its high k d values fig 5 turner et al 2004 lin et al 2018 river and richardson 2019 as river water mixes with bay water the abundance of cip decreased from detectable in river waters to undetectable in open bay waters fig 6 the variation in cip concentration along the fox river plume was similar to that of pip suggesting an active exchange between colloidal and particulate phases during estuarine mixing and biological uptake the concentration of cop was the highest in river water and decreased consistently out into the bay fig 6 showing a predominant cop source from the fox river similar to terrestrial dom devilbiss et al 2016 the decrease in cop abundance and its percentage in the bulk dop pool along the river bay transect indicates the occurrence of disaggregation or peptization of riverine colloidal organic matter com resulting in an increase in the percent of lmw dop but a decrease in percent of cop from river to inner bay fig 6 the dynamic change in the partitioning of p between lmw and colloidal phases is consistent with the decrease in specific conductivity from river water to estuarine water in this negative estuary xu et al 2018a in the open green bay however the percentage of cop increased again showing an even higher percent of cop compared to those in the river plume fig 6 this dynamic variation in cop abundance indicated new cop from autochthonous sources via in situ biological production or the release of algal exudates in open waters similar to those observed in coastal marine environments pakulski et al 2000 lin et al 2012 the cop abundance observed in open green bay 59 5 was considerably higher than those in lake michigan 23 5 lin and guo 2016a consistent with their different trophic conditions hypereutrophic in green bay vs oligotrophic in lake michigan cuhel and aguilar 2013 zhou et al 2016 klump et al 2018 particulate p has been shown to be the dominant p species in other rivers and estuaries van der zee et al 2007 cai et al 2008 duan et al 2008 guo et al 2012 therefore contributing potentially to the release of dip and dop into the water column terrestrially derived particulate p typically has higher abundances of pip compared with the autochthonous particulate p in natural waters yoshimura et al 2007 asahi et al 2014 thus higher pip tpp ranging from 44 to 53 with an average of 47 5 at the river estuarine stations stations 12 16 and 22 is consistent with a higher contribution from terrestrially derived pip to the particulate p budget from the fox river while lower pip tpp 18 5 but higher pop tpp 82 6 in open bay waters table 3 suggests a major particulate p source from algal derived or preexisting pop indeed the poc pn ratios of particulate organic matter pom at the river stations 8 1 9 3 table 3 closely resembled those of soil organic matter kendall et al 2001 attesting to a dominant terrestrial pom source on the other hand the average particulate c n ratio 6 5 0 1 or particulate organic c p ratio 105 2 in open bay waters is close to the redfield ratio c n 6 6 c p 106 indicating mostly autochthonous pom sources furthermore values of δ13c poc decreased from 27 47 in the fox river to 32 97 in open green bay while δ15n pn values increased from 2 58 in river water to 12 41 in open bay water table 3 showing a dynamic change in pom sources from dominantly terrigenous sources with higher δ13c poc and lower p contents in mg p g in the river estuary region to mostly autochthonous origin with lower δ13c poc and higher p contents in mg p g in open green bay kendall et al 2001 the increase in the particulate p content in mg p g from river to bay waters fig 2c likely reflect the net result between sinking of denser soil mineral particles with low p concentrations sorption of dip onto particles and biological update of p for example pop content in mg p g increased over three times from river to bay waters suggesting a distinct change in sources of particulate p from largely terrestrial particles soil mineral with low p content to more autochthonous particles algae with higher p content in open bay waters the dynamic changes in particle quantity and quality are also consistent with the increasing pop fraction in the total p pool along the trophic transect fig 4 the transformation partition between pip and pop supplementary fig s2a and the abundance of dop and cop were highly related to spm which was mostly derived from allochthonous at stations 12 16 and 22 or autochthonous at stations 41 51 and 56 sources in addition the higher the chl a concentration the higher the dop and cop concentrations in the water column as supported by the correlation between the cop and chl a concentrations supplementary fig s2b 4 3 the importance of colloidal phosphorus high abundances of colloidal p and its role in the biogeochemical cycling of p have been reported in soil solution and river estuarine waters hens and merckx 2002 shand et al 2000 turner et al 2004 cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 colloidal p especially the higher molecular weight cop have different environmental fate and play more active roles than other forms of p especially dissolved p in which it is typically considered in the biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments fig 3 haygarth et al 1997 lin et al 2012 in addition to the abundances of bulk colloids knowledge about detailed size distributions of colloidal p and their changes from river to estuarine coastal waters is needed the percent of cip in the dip pool ranged from 10 in the river inner bay waters to undetectable in open bay waters table 4 indicating that dip occurs mainly in the 1 kda lwm phase even in fox river waters low cip abundance in the fox river is consistent with those observed in the mississippi river cai and guo 2009 and the milwaukee river lin and guo 2016a but lower than those reported for small black water rivers in the gulf coast cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 or soil solutions hens and merckx 2002 turner et al 2004 the difference in cip abundance among rivers is probably due to differences in water chemistry soil type and the abundance of dom iron containing and other inorganic colloids stolpe et al 2010 baken et al 2016 gottselig et al 2017 in contrast to low or undetectable cip abundance a major fraction of dop was measured in the hmw dop or cop forms in the study area table 4 fig 6 on average cop comprised from 49 4 of the bulk dop pool in river waters to as high as 59 5 in open bay waters showing an initial decrease from 52 in river water to 33 in the mixing zone and then an increase from river plume to open green bay fig 6 these results suggest two different cop sources with terrestrial cop from river water and autochthonous cop algal exudates from open bay water in addition the terrestrially derived cop appeared to be rapidly removed at the river lake interface and or an active exchange between colloidal and dissolved phases during estuarine mixing similar to that observed in a marine estuarine environment lin et al 2012 in addition to bulk colloids previous studies also reported the molecular size dependent abundance and composition of colloidal organic matter in surface waters xu and guo 2017 as also evidenced by the doc dop ratio in the fox river plume table 2 within the bulk cop pool the large sized colloidal fractions both the 3 10 kda and 10 kda 0 7 µm increased gradually from the fox river to open green bay while the 1 3 kda small cop decreased along the same transection fig 7 these changes in cop abundance seemed to support a dynamic coagulation and peptization of colloids regulated by dom and ionic strength mosley et al 2003 xu et al 2018b on the other hand changes in the colloidal size distribution of dop along the river bay transect could be mostly the result of shifting in colloidal sources and freshness of colloids across the hydrologic trophic interface along the river bay transect for example freshly photosynthesized and or liberated dop or dom would be mainly hmw materials qu et al 2012 benner and amon 2015 therefore the assimilation and utilization of dip by phytoplankton in open water could generate fresh dop increasing the cop abundance and the larger sized colloids fig 7 these results indicated that the colloidal size distribution of dop is source specific and regulated by environmental settings e g ph and ionic strength as well as biological and physicochemical processes overall cop in the fox river is mainly allochthonous in nature and composed of mostly smaller sized colloids from highly degraded soil dop while cop in open bay waters is predominantly autochthonous and contains mostly larger sized colloids from algae and their exudates fig 7 there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between cop and pop in the fox river plume supplementary fig s3 indicating that surficial processes and colloid colloid or particle particle interactions such as flocculation coagulation of colloids and disaggregation of particles may play a significant role in controlling the partitioning and thus the biogeochemical cycling of p species in the water column indeed the hmw dom or colloidal organic matter has been shown to have higher biological reactivity or degradation rates relative to its lmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 and higher chemical reactivity such as short residence time and young 14c ages guo and santschi 1997 guo et al 2009 in aquatic environments if fractions of the bulk colloidal organic p are biologically and chemically more reactive qin et al 2015 the strong presence of cop observed here has implications for understanding p cycling and its relation to the development of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in coastal environments as shown in fig 5 values of logk d for all three p phases decreased with increasing spm concentrations with a significant inverse correlation with logspm consistently showing a particle concentration effect and similar to those observed for particle reactive elements in different aquatic environments honeyman and santschi 1988 santschi et al 1995 guo et al 1997 overall consistently high logk d values observed for different p species here again attest to its particle reactive nature and the important role of colloidal phases and colloid related physicochemical processes such as adsorption desorption and coagulation disaggregation in controlling the distribution transport and cycling pathways of p in aquatic environments during summer although biological processes are important in the production and consumption of colloids wang and guo 2001 future studies could focus on elucidating the composition and reactivity of colloidal p and its role in the cycling of p especially during other seasons and flow regimes that would enable the summer period that was described in detail here to be placed in an annual context and focus on the relative importance of different biological and physicochemical processes 5 conclusion chemical speciation phase partitioning and transformation of p between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases were examined in the lower fox river green bay ecosystem in northwest lake michigan during midsummer in general concentrations of dip dop pip cip and cop decreased but pop increased along the fox river green bay transect with dynamic variations in the chemical speciation and partitioning of p within the total dissolved and particulate p pools dip and pip were the dominant p species in river waters while dop and pop became predominant in the open green bay showing highly variable p speciation and intensive transformation between p species through biological and physicochemical processes across the river bay interface together with dynamic changes in δ13c poc signatures the observed distinct particulate properties indicate a significant change in pom sources from largely terrigenous with low p contents in mg p g and higher c n ratios and δ13c poc values in the fox river to more autochthonous particles or algae with higher p contents in mg p g and lower c n ratio and δ13c poc values in the open green bay the abundance of cip was in general low and became undetectable in open bay water showing dip or srp is exclusively present in the 1 kda lmw phase in contrast cop abundances were high in both river water and open bay water indicating source of terrigenous cop from the fox river and autochthonous cop from open bay water within the bulk cop pool highly degraded smaller sized colloids 1 10 kda dominated in river water while larger sized colloids 10 kda 0 7 μm dominated in open green bay and were mostly derived from algal exudates showing a variable and highly heterogeneous dop pool across the river bay interface high logk d values were observed for both inorganic and organic p in the study area demonstrating an evident particle concentration effect on the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases and suggesting colloids particles and thus surficial processes may play an important role in governing the abundance speciation and bioavailability of p in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

17080,phosphorus p loadings to the great lakes have been regulated for decades but re eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia have recently been increasingly reported it is of paramount importance to better understand the fate transformation and biogeochemical cycling processes of different p species across the river lake interface we report here results on chemical speciation of p in the seasonally hypoxic fox river green bay system and variations in sources and partitioning of p species along the aquatic continuum during midsummer when productivity is generally high phosphate and dissolved organic p dop were the major species in river water while particulate organic p predominated in open bay waters showing a dynamic change in the chemical speciation of p along the river bay transect with active transformations between inorganic and organic p and between colloidal and particulate phases colloidal organic p cop 1 kda comprised 33 65 of the bulk dop while colloidal inorganic p was generally insignificant and undetectable especially in open bay water sources of cop changed from mainly allochthonous in the fox river having mostly smaller sized colloids 1 3 kda and a lower organic carbon to phosphorus c p ratio to predominantly autochthonous in open bay waters with larger sized colloids 10 kda and a higher organic c p ratio the observed high apparent distribution coefficients k d of p between dissolved and particulate phases and high abundant autochthonous colloidal and particulate organic p in the hypereutrophic environment suggest that in addition to phosphate colloidal particulate organic p may play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of p and the development of seasonal hypoxia graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling nutrients colloidal organic phosphorus chemical speciation fox river green bay 1 introduction as an essential macronutrient for living organisms phosphorus p plays a critical role in regulating primary production water quality and biogeochemical processes in various aquatic environments lean et al 1983 karl 2000 orihel et al 2017 taylor and lean 2018 previous studies have shown that excess nutrients especially p can cause eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia not only in the great lakes region such as lake erie and green bay scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 klump et al 2018 but also in other river dominated coastal marine environments rabalais et al 2001 smith 2003 zhang et al 2010b some p loadings to the great lakes have been regulated through the great lakes water quality agreement glwqa for decades which had led to significant reductions of total p tp concentrations throughout the system in the great lakes chapra and dolan 2012 dolan and chapra 2012 finlay et al 2013 bringing oligotrophication to some great lakes regions such as lake michigan and lake ontario cuhel and aguilar 2013 dove and chapra 2015 lin and guo 2016a for instance offshore tp concentrations in lake ontario were in the range of 5 6 μg l dove and chapra 2015 well below the target concentration of 10 μg l from the glwqa on the other hand re eutrophication and increased hypoxia have been increasingly reported scavia et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 klump et al 2018 reconciling these seemingly contradictory observations and the paradox in nutrient management requires new insights in the chemical speciation bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments over the past few decades a growing body of literature has examined nutrient sources and loadings to the great lakes as well as the fate and internal biogeochemical cycling of p in different lake systems hecky et al 2004 elsbury et al 2009 joosse and baker 2011 lin et al 2016 maccoux et al 2016 depew et al 2018 phosphorus occurs in different chemical forms and physical phases in natural waters lean 1973 b van der zee et al 2007 cai and guo 2009 lin and guo 2016a including dissolved inorganic p dip or soluble reactive p srp dissolved organic p dop colloidal inorganic p cip colloidal organic p cop particulate inorganic p pip and particulate organic p pop each form has different bioavailability chemical reactivity and environmental fate which can play different roles in regulating water quality and the biogeochemical cycling of other bioactive elements in aquatic environments minear and lean 1975 lin et al 2012 qin et al 2015 fang and wang 2020 therefore knowledge about the partitioning and transformation of p among different forms phases is needed to better understand the environmental fate and ecological role of p in aquatic environments wetzel and likens 1991 sylvan et al 2006 yoshimura et al 2014 a large portion of p carried through rivers to estuaries and coastal waters is associated with suspended particles föllmi 1996 jordan et al 2008 yuan et al 2013 indeed p is a highly particle reactive element with distribution coefficient k d values as high as 104 107 in aquatic ecosystems santschi 1995 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2016 lin and guo 2016a and can bind preferentially with colloidal and particulate surfaces in addition to biological uptake and assimilation lean 1973 hilger et al 1999 cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 therefore the dynamic partitioning of p among dissolved colloidal and particulate phases should play a critical role in controlling the abundance transformation bioavailability and the overall biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments nevertheless many monitoring programs and loading analyses usually reported total p and did not recognize the importance of chemical speciation arbuckle and downing 2001 dolan and chapra 2012 robertson et al 2018 there exists a knowledge gap in the understanding of chemical speciation bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling pathways of p in aquatic systems especially at the river lake interfaces colloids are important intermediaries in the biogeochemical cycling of natural organic matter and particle reactive elements due to their high specific surface areas high biological chemical reactivity and short turnover times in aquatic environments honeyman and santschi 1988 guo et al 1997 benner and amon 2015 previous studies have shown that dop especially the hydrophobic forms could be more bioavailable to algae lean and nalewajko 1976 qin et al 2015 and colloidal organic matter or high molecular weight dissolved organic matter hmw dom contains higher hydrophobic components lean 1973 hilger et al 1999 cai et al 2015 implying that a large fraction of the abundant colloidal dop carried by river waters can be bioavailable in receiving waters over the past decades colloidal p in natural waters has been described in more detail especially colloidal organic p mayer and jarrell 1995 haygarth et al 1997 cai and guo 2009 chen et al 2010 lin and guo 2016a gottselig et al 2017 nevertheless other than the abundance of bulk colloids sources of colloidal p and the transformation of p among dissolved colloidal and particulate phases in estuarine environments have rarely been evaluated systematic studies of their sources molecular weight distributions and transformation can provide new insights into a better understanding of the role of colloidal p in regulating dynamic cycling of different p species and its relation to water quality and the development of eutrophication and hypoxia in estuarine and coastal ecosystems the lower fox river green bay lake michigan was listed as one of the great lakes areas of concern during 1980s p inputs from wastewater treatment plants from the fox river basin have been regulated and their inputs have been reduced but non point p sources continue to contribute high p loads to the lower fox river robertson et al 2018 hypereutrophic and seasonal hypoxic conditions in green bay have been frequently observed klump et al 2018 recent studies have examined the dynamics of p species in green bay lin et al 2016 2018 nevertheless the abundance and distribution of colloidal organic and inorganic p forms and their transformation among p species during transport to green bay have not been quantified our hypothesis is that colloidal organic p has high biological chemical reactivity and or high degradation rates in aquatic environments which may increase the rate of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in estuarine and coastal environments thus studies on the details of chemical speciation of p and the estuarine mixing of different p species at the river lake interface is expected to provide a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of p and improve scientific bases for environmental ecological and water resource management in the fox river green bay ecosystem our major objectives were to 1 quantify the abundance of inorganic and organic p species in dissolved colloidal and particulate phases along a transect from the fox river to open green bay during midsummer when p typically limits productivity 2 identify the estuarine mixing and transport of different molecular sized colloidal organic p across the river lake interface and 3 examine sources of different p species and their transformation between different phases as well as the role of colloidal organic p in the biogeochemical cycling of p along the river bay continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area green bay is the largest freshwater estuary in the laurentian great lakes fig 1 and accounts for 9 of surface area of lake michigan however green bay receives 15 30 of the total p loading to lake michigan from its primary tributary the fox river klump et al 2009 robertson et al 2019 among all rivers and streams discharging into green bay the fox river has the largest input with an average discharge of 128 m3 s robertson and saad 2019 and contributes approximately 70 of the nutrient and suspended sediment load klump et al 1997 even though the point sources throughout the fox river system have been regulated and extensive clean up and restoration in southern green bay has occurred over past decades total p loads are at times higher than the total maximum daily load tmdl target wi dnr 2019 deteriorated water quality eutrophic conditions and formation of dead zones remain frequent in southern green bay largely due to excessive p loading from the fox river klump et al 2018 2 2 sampling samples were collected from a series of sampling stations along a transection from the lower fox river to the open green bay on july 10th 2018 fig 1 the average discharge from the fox river on this date was 126 m3 s http waterdata usgs gov usa nwis uv 040851385 basic water quality data including water temperature specific conductivity ph dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a fluorescence chl a were measured by in situ sensors ysi sonde and are given in table 1 along with the specific sampling locations surface water samples 1 m below surface were collected in pre cleaned hdpe bottles and stored in a cooler with ice samples were filtered in the laboratory within 6 h of sampling through pre combusted 450 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f whatman with a pore size of 0 7 µm thus dissolved p species here are operationally defined as those in the 0 7 µm filtrate which may contain living biomass and thus overestimate dop compared to those in the 0 45 µm or 0 2 µm filtrates both the filtrate and filter samples were kept frozen for the measurements of total dissolved p tdp dissolved inorganic p dip or soluble reactive p srp total particulate p tpp particulate inorganic p pip total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic carbon doc in addition aliquots of whole water samples were also filtered through pre weighed gf f filters whatman for the measurements of suspended particulate matter spm particulate organic carbon poc and particulate nitrogen pn and their stable isotope compositions δ13c and δ15n additional filtrate from each sample was collected for ultrafiltration to determine the abundance of colloidal inorganic p cip and colloidal organic p cop due to labor intensive nature in using ultrafiltration only six sampling stations were occupied which may miss possible small variations between sampling stations 2 3 ultrafiltration in addition to dissolved 0 7 µm and particulate 0 7 µm p different size fractions of colloidal p were further isolated using stirred cell ultrafiltration units equipped with membrane discs with different nominal molecular weight cutoffs mwcos including 1 kda ym1 millipore sigma 3 kda ym3 and 10 kda ym10 membranes the bulk dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were then size fractionated into the 1 kda low molecular weight lmw and the 1 3 kda 3 10 kda and 10 kda high molecular weight hmw or colloidal fractions before ultrafiltration all stirred cell units were acid cleaned and the membrane discs were pre cleaned with 0 05 m naoh solution and ultrapure water until the blank ultrafiltrate had an undistinguishable uv absorbance signature from the ultrapure water xu and guo 2017 to avoid lmw retention and thus overestimation of colloids colloidal abundance had to be determined from the ultrafiltration permeation model guo et al 2000 previous studies and our initial ultrafiltration results showed that when the concentration factor was 30 the difference in the colloidal p abundance was within 5 between those derived from the ultrafiltration permeation model and by concentration difference between the integrated permeate and initial solution cai and guo 2009 thus the same concentration factor 30 here was employed for all samples ultrafiltration to reduce the analytical workload and for easy comparisons between samples both the initial water and integrated permeate solution were sampled for the measurements of dip and tdp to calculate the abundances of cip and cop for each sample cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 2 4 measurements of inorganic and organic phosphorus species predetermined volumes of filtrate samples were transferred into a teflon vial with a teflon screw cap and were digested with k2s2o8 solution 50 g l ph 1 in an oven at 140 c for 4 h lin et al 2012 concentrations of tdp were then measured using the standard phosphomolybdenum blue method on an agilent 8453 uv visible spectrophotometer in 5 cm cuvettes at 882 nm hansen and koroleff 1999 concentrations of dip or phosphate were directly measured without digestion the concentration of dop was calculated from the difference between tdp and dip i e dop tdp dip the detection limit was 8 10 nm based on replicate blank sample measurements using 5 cm cuvettes with a precision of 2 for both dip and tdp at 0 1 μm level cai and guo 2009 the tpp concentration was determined after high temperature combustion and acid hydrolysis hcl of filter samples as described in solόrzano and sharp 1980 with some modifications zhang et al 2010a briefly the filter samples were wetted using 0 5 m mgcl2 solution and heated in an oven at 95 c until dry followed by ashing in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h the residue was extracted with 1 m hcl solution at room temperature in the dark for 24 h particulate inorganic p pip was extracted directly from filter samples with 1 m hcl solution for 24 h aspila et al 1976 both extractions of tpp and pip were quantified as dip after neutralization and dilution similar to dop the pop concentration was calculated from the difference between tpp and pip i e pop tpp pip 2 5 measurements of organic carbon dissolved nitrogen stable isotopes and spm the concentrations of doc and tdn were measured using the high temperature combustion method on a shimadzu toc l analyzer with a precision 2 for both doc and tdn guo and macdonald 2006 filtrate samples were acidified with concentrated hcl to a ph 2 before analysis concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including no3 no2 and nh4 were measured using colorimetry on a technicon autoanalyzer concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don were calculated from the difference between tdn and din concentrations i e don tdn din guo et al 2004 guo and macdonald 2006 gf f filter samples were treated with hcl acid fumes overnight for the measurements of poc and pn contents and stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen isotope δ15n compositions on an elemental analyzer interfaced with a thermo fisher scientific isotopic ratio mass spectrometer delta v the precision and accuracy of δ13c and δ15n were 0 1 and 0 2 respectively as determined by replicate analysis of standards yang et al 2015 the suspended particulate matter spm concentrations were determined using the weight difference between dried filter samples and blank filters filter samples were weighed after freeze drying until achieving a constant weight 2 6 determination of distribution coefficient of p between dissolved and particulate phases the partitioning of p species between dissolved and particulate phases and their particle reactivity could be quantitatively evaluated using the apparent distribution coefficient or partition coefficient k d approach this approach has been used in previous studies to examine the partitioning and adsorption behavior of p in aquatic environments e g santschi 1995 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2016 the apparent k d values were calculated based on the following equation k d c p c d s p m where cp is the concentration of particulate p in the inorganic organic or total p pool in μm cd is the concentration of inorganic organic or total p in μm in the dissolved phase spm is the concentration of suspended particulate matter kg l or g ml accordingly k d has a unit of ml g or l kg and its values are reported here in logk d 3 results 3 1 water quality data surface water temperatures varied from 23 4 c to 26 5 c with an average of 25 1 1 2 c table 1 specific conductivity decreased from 463 μs cm in the fox river to 322 μs cm in open green bay table 1 showing a typical feature of negative estuaries xu et al 2018a surface water ph ranged from 8 05 to 8 55 with an average of 8 34 0 18 table 1 exhibiting the effect of limestone in the basin and the characteristic of carbonate water chemistry lin and guo 2016b concentrations of do in terms of saturation were 100 at all stations table 1 spm concentrations decreased rapidly from the fox river 29 6 3 8 mg l to open green bay 7 3 4 3 mg l table 1 indicating that the fox river was the main source of suspended sediment and turbidity to the water column levels of chl a in surface waters were somewhat variable ranging from 8 5 μg l to 76 9 μg l with an average of 40 7 29 2 μg l table 1 elevated chl a was observed at the river bay interface and then decreased in general from estuary to open water showing a strong trophic gradient driven by the fox river with high nutrients 3 2 variations in dissolved inorganic and organic phosphorus concentrations of dip monotonically decreased with decreasing specific conductivity from 4 15 μm at the fox river end member station st 12 to 0 11 μm at the open station st 56 with an average of 1 47 1 57 μm and showing quasi conservative mixing between river water and bay water table 2 fig 2 a concentrations of dop ranged from 0 24 to 2 61 μm with an average of 1 18 1 00 μm and a little addition or production of dop at stations 16 and 22 compared to the theoretical mixing line between river water and bay water fig 2a both dip and dop decreased rapidly from the fox river to open green bay showing a dominant source from the river basin for both dissolved p species fig 2a within the total dissolved p pool dip contributed up to 48 10 varying from 61 in the fox river to 31 in open bay water while dop comprised 52 10 of the total dissolved p ranging from 39 in fox river water to 69 in open bay water while dip was the dominant dissolved p species in river waters dop became the major dissolved p species in the open green bay fig 2e with an active transformation between the dissolved p species along the river bay transect similar to dop concentrations of doc and don also decreased from the fox river 869 µm c and 100 µm n respectively to the open green bay 441 µm c and 19 µm n respectively table 2 showing again a strong trophic gradient along the river bay transect 3 3 variations in particulate inorganic and organic phosphorus the concentration of tpp pip pop decreased from 3 39 μm in the fox river to 2 75 μm in open bay waters with an average of 3 16 0 35 μm table 3 within the total particulate p pool pip average of 1 08 0 62 μm generally decreased from river waters stations 12 and 16 to open bay while pop average of 2 08 0 31 μm generally increased from river water to bay water or increased with decreasing specific conductivity fig 2b the decrease in pip and increase in pop concentrations from river water to bay water are consistent with the dynamic transformation between dip and dop in the water column and point to a rapid change in sources of particulate p species along the river bay transect while tpp concentrations in μm decreased from the river to bay waters both spm normalized pip and pop concentrations in mg p g particles in contrast increased especially pop table 3 fig 2c in other words the amount of p in the particles increased from river to bay waters 3 4 partitioning of p between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases the tdp tp ratio was 0 57 0 09 in river estuarine region indicating that p exported from the fox river during summer was on average slightly higher in the dissolved phase nevertheless the tdp tp ratio sharply decreased from the estuary to open bay 0 16 0 05 and particulate p became the predominant p species making up 80 of the total p pool in open bay waters fig 2f showing a considerable transformation between dissolved and particulate p along the river bay transect in terms of phase partitioning of inorganic p the lmw dip comprised 67 of the total inorganic p tip in river waters and decreased dramatically to as low as 23 in open bay waters while cip only made up 0 4 of the tip fig 3 pip comprised on average 55 18 of the tip increasing from 30 in river waters to 71 in open bay waters fig 3 in contrast to the phase partitioning of inorganic p the lmw dop and cop made up 17 14 and 15 11 of the top respectively while pop comprised 68 23 of top increasing from 38 in river waters to 91 in open bay waters showing elevated contribution from in situ biological algal production and incorporation of dip fig 3 as shown in fig 4 the percentage of dip and dop in the tp pool decreased from the fox river to open green bay resulting from physical dilution and biological uptake conversely the percentage of pop was higher in open green bay than that in the fox river on average pop had a significantly higher contribution 46 26 to the tp pool compared to pip 18 4 large variations in dissolved and particulate p concentrations were evident along the river bay transect fig 2 with concentrations decreasing from river water to bay water for all p species except for pop which in contrast increased there was a significant inverse correlation between pop and dip or dop p 0 001 supplementary fig s1 suggesting a dynamic transformation of p between dissolved and particulate phases during estuarine mixing and biological production overall dissolved p slightly dominated the total p pool in the river estuarine region while particulate p became predominant in the total p pool in open green bay fig 4 to quantify the apparent partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases values of logk d were compared between different p species as shown in supplementary table s1 values of logk d varied from 4 2 to 6 4 for inorganic organic or total p the differences in logk d values between p species at a specific station are quite small fig 5 however logk d values increased in general from river to bay waters showing the effects of biological productivity and spm concentration or particle concentration effect indeed there is a significant negative correlation between logk d values and logspm for inorganic organic and total p pools in the fox river plume fig 5 as has been observed in other estuarine systems e g caraco et al 1990 santschi 1995 turner and tyler 1997 lin et al 2012 lin and guo 2016a 3 5 abundances and molecular weight distributions of colloidal phosphorus the cop concentration in the 1 kda 0 7 µm colloidal fraction varied from 0 14 to 1 37 μm corresponding to 33 65 of the bulk dop therefore much of the p typically described as dissolved p is actually colloidal organic p cip concentrations however ranged from below the detection limit to 0 15 μm making up 0 7 5 of the bulk dip table 4 as shown in fig 6 the cip concentration remained somewhat similar 0 12 0 15 µm in the river estuarine region stations 12 16 and 22 and then decreased rapidly and became undetectable in open bay waters this indicated that cip is mainly derived from river input and dip is exclusively present in ionic forms in open green bay consistent with those reported for other aquatic environments such as the mississippi river plume and milwaukee river estuary cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 the percentage of cop in the bulk dop was relatively high in the fox river and decreased in the inner bay showing an evident river or terrigenous source fig 6 in addition the percentage of cop increased again from the inner bay to open bay and remained at similarly high levels in open bay waters fig 6 resulting from autochthonous sources in contrast to the abundant cop at all stations the amount of cip was small and was detectable only in fox river and its estuarine waters suggesting river input is the sole cip source the abundance of cop changed significantly p 0 05 across the river lake interface fig 7 shifting from fairly high bulk cop in river water 52 sum of cops to rather low cop 33 8 in the estuarine mixing zone to even higher cop again in open green bay 59 9 cop large variations in the bulk cop abundance with a bi mode distribution along the river bay transect indicated a dynamic transformation between lmw and hmw dop pools during estuarine mixing based on the detailed size distributions of dop among the 1 kda 1 3 kda 3 10 kda and 10 kda 0 7 µm size ranges the major colloidal component within the bulk cop pool was the 1 3 kda small cop 48 in river water the 3 10 kda medium cop 54 in the estuarine mixing zone and the 10 kda 0 7 μm large cop 48 79 in open bay water respectively showing a progressive increase towards the higher molecular weight or large sized colloids from the fox river to open green bay fig 7 dynamic changes in the molecular weight distribution of cop observed here clearly indicate the unique colloidal molecular size characteristics between terrestrial and autochthonous sources and a rapid turnover of cop across the river bay interface 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons in chemical speciation of phosphorus with other aquatic environments unlike rivers heavily affected by anthropogenic activities and having elevated dip tdp ratios up to 0 9 such as the maumee river baker et al 2014 and the mississippi river cai and guo 2009 that affected development of hypoxia in lake erie and the northern gulf of mexico respectively the fox river had an intermediate dip tdp ratio 0 55 0 05 and dop tdp ratio 0 45 0 05 during the summer sampling period which agrees well with previous observations table 5 these differences may be due to lake winnebago located upstream of the fox river that converts much of the dip to dop prior to reaching the fox river mouth or differences between sampling seasons relatively higher dop tdp ratios in the lower fox river may exert a critical role in the development of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in green bay enhanced by the consumption of dissolved oxygen and the release of dip during dop and pop degradation p in the water column and sediment lin et al 2016 direct utilization of dop by algae is also possible qin et all 2015 thompson and cotner 2018 the tdp tp ratio was slightly higher than the tpp tp in the fox river similar to those observed in the milwaukee river table 5 the partitioning of p between organic and inorganic phases dip vs dop or pip vs pop and between dissolved and particulate phases tdp vs tpp seems highly variable among rivers table 5 showing distinct features in the phase distribution of p the average concentrations of both tdp and tpp in the southern green bay were much higher than those in lake michigan table 5 indicating the effects of the fox river on green bay robertson et al 2018 compared to other laurentian great lakes both southern green bay and lake erie had elevated tdp and tpp concentrations and similar partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases table 5 consistent with their environmental settings both with intensive anthropogenic influence non point sources and seasonal hypoxia wynne et al 2010 kane et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 it is likely that high tpp abundance especially pop and oxides mineral associate p which may be converted into bioavailable or potentially bioavailable p species during their transport and sedimentary diagenesis paytan et al 2017 lin et al 2018 depew et al 2018 liu et al 2020 may help contribute to the development of eutrophication and hypoxia in green bay and lake erie 4 2 sources of p species and dissolved particulate organic matter in general high lmw dip and lmw dop concentrations were observed in river waters but decreased sharply in the estuarine area and remained low in open bay waters supplementary table s2 indicating a strong riverine source for both lmw dip and lmw dop although the concentrations of each p species changed differently environmental consistency exists in the size distributions of both inorganic and organic p pools along the river bay transect regulated by physicochemical and biological processes figs 2 and 3 the molar ratios of doc dop or organic c p ratio ranged from 333 in the river end member water to 1838 in open bay water table 2 which are considerably higher than the redfield ratio of 106 redfield et al 1963 suggesting either an overall p depleted dom pool or dom in the study area containing mostly highly degraded organic components due to the preferential degradation of p containing organic compounds highly degraded organic matter is expected to have a higher c p ratio in comparison with the freshly produced organic matter in aquatic systems sannigrahi et al 2006 cai and guo 2009 yates et al 2019 on the other hand highly degraded soil organic matter in a semi closed environment has a lower organic c p ratio due to the loss of oc in the form of co2 and the re assimilation of phosphate into soil organic matter pool dou et al 2017 gao et al 2018 therefore dom with lower c p ratio in river water suggests sources from eroded soil organic matter while autochthonous dom with higher c p ratio in open bay waters was indicative of rapid recycling and preferential regeneration of p relative to c phosphate has a molecular mass of 95 da and is expected to occur only in the 1 kda lmw phase nevertheless a detectable level of bulk cip has been reported for semiarid soils surface runoff and water extracts sinaj et al 1998 turner et al 2004 and small black water rivers such as the pearl river mississippi cai and guo 2009 and jourdan river mississippi lin et al 2012 but not detectable in mississippi river waters cai and guo 2009 the detectable cip in the lower fox river could also be the result of dip associated with fe oxyhydroxides and mineral colloids due to the particle reactive nature of p and its high k d values fig 5 turner et al 2004 lin et al 2018 river and richardson 2019 as river water mixes with bay water the abundance of cip decreased from detectable in river waters to undetectable in open bay waters fig 6 the variation in cip concentration along the fox river plume was similar to that of pip suggesting an active exchange between colloidal and particulate phases during estuarine mixing and biological uptake the concentration of cop was the highest in river water and decreased consistently out into the bay fig 6 showing a predominant cop source from the fox river similar to terrestrial dom devilbiss et al 2016 the decrease in cop abundance and its percentage in the bulk dop pool along the river bay transect indicates the occurrence of disaggregation or peptization of riverine colloidal organic matter com resulting in an increase in the percent of lmw dop but a decrease in percent of cop from river to inner bay fig 6 the dynamic change in the partitioning of p between lmw and colloidal phases is consistent with the decrease in specific conductivity from river water to estuarine water in this negative estuary xu et al 2018a in the open green bay however the percentage of cop increased again showing an even higher percent of cop compared to those in the river plume fig 6 this dynamic variation in cop abundance indicated new cop from autochthonous sources via in situ biological production or the release of algal exudates in open waters similar to those observed in coastal marine environments pakulski et al 2000 lin et al 2012 the cop abundance observed in open green bay 59 5 was considerably higher than those in lake michigan 23 5 lin and guo 2016a consistent with their different trophic conditions hypereutrophic in green bay vs oligotrophic in lake michigan cuhel and aguilar 2013 zhou et al 2016 klump et al 2018 particulate p has been shown to be the dominant p species in other rivers and estuaries van der zee et al 2007 cai et al 2008 duan et al 2008 guo et al 2012 therefore contributing potentially to the release of dip and dop into the water column terrestrially derived particulate p typically has higher abundances of pip compared with the autochthonous particulate p in natural waters yoshimura et al 2007 asahi et al 2014 thus higher pip tpp ranging from 44 to 53 with an average of 47 5 at the river estuarine stations stations 12 16 and 22 is consistent with a higher contribution from terrestrially derived pip to the particulate p budget from the fox river while lower pip tpp 18 5 but higher pop tpp 82 6 in open bay waters table 3 suggests a major particulate p source from algal derived or preexisting pop indeed the poc pn ratios of particulate organic matter pom at the river stations 8 1 9 3 table 3 closely resembled those of soil organic matter kendall et al 2001 attesting to a dominant terrestrial pom source on the other hand the average particulate c n ratio 6 5 0 1 or particulate organic c p ratio 105 2 in open bay waters is close to the redfield ratio c n 6 6 c p 106 indicating mostly autochthonous pom sources furthermore values of δ13c poc decreased from 27 47 in the fox river to 32 97 in open green bay while δ15n pn values increased from 2 58 in river water to 12 41 in open bay water table 3 showing a dynamic change in pom sources from dominantly terrigenous sources with higher δ13c poc and lower p contents in mg p g in the river estuary region to mostly autochthonous origin with lower δ13c poc and higher p contents in mg p g in open green bay kendall et al 2001 the increase in the particulate p content in mg p g from river to bay waters fig 2c likely reflect the net result between sinking of denser soil mineral particles with low p concentrations sorption of dip onto particles and biological update of p for example pop content in mg p g increased over three times from river to bay waters suggesting a distinct change in sources of particulate p from largely terrestrial particles soil mineral with low p content to more autochthonous particles algae with higher p content in open bay waters the dynamic changes in particle quantity and quality are also consistent with the increasing pop fraction in the total p pool along the trophic transect fig 4 the transformation partition between pip and pop supplementary fig s2a and the abundance of dop and cop were highly related to spm which was mostly derived from allochthonous at stations 12 16 and 22 or autochthonous at stations 41 51 and 56 sources in addition the higher the chl a concentration the higher the dop and cop concentrations in the water column as supported by the correlation between the cop and chl a concentrations supplementary fig s2b 4 3 the importance of colloidal phosphorus high abundances of colloidal p and its role in the biogeochemical cycling of p have been reported in soil solution and river estuarine waters hens and merckx 2002 shand et al 2000 turner et al 2004 cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 colloidal p especially the higher molecular weight cop have different environmental fate and play more active roles than other forms of p especially dissolved p in which it is typically considered in the biogeochemical cycling of p in aquatic environments fig 3 haygarth et al 1997 lin et al 2012 in addition to the abundances of bulk colloids knowledge about detailed size distributions of colloidal p and their changes from river to estuarine coastal waters is needed the percent of cip in the dip pool ranged from 10 in the river inner bay waters to undetectable in open bay waters table 4 indicating that dip occurs mainly in the 1 kda lwm phase even in fox river waters low cip abundance in the fox river is consistent with those observed in the mississippi river cai and guo 2009 and the milwaukee river lin and guo 2016a but lower than those reported for small black water rivers in the gulf coast cai and guo 2009 lin et al 2012 or soil solutions hens and merckx 2002 turner et al 2004 the difference in cip abundance among rivers is probably due to differences in water chemistry soil type and the abundance of dom iron containing and other inorganic colloids stolpe et al 2010 baken et al 2016 gottselig et al 2017 in contrast to low or undetectable cip abundance a major fraction of dop was measured in the hmw dop or cop forms in the study area table 4 fig 6 on average cop comprised from 49 4 of the bulk dop pool in river waters to as high as 59 5 in open bay waters showing an initial decrease from 52 in river water to 33 in the mixing zone and then an increase from river plume to open green bay fig 6 these results suggest two different cop sources with terrestrial cop from river water and autochthonous cop algal exudates from open bay water in addition the terrestrially derived cop appeared to be rapidly removed at the river lake interface and or an active exchange between colloidal and dissolved phases during estuarine mixing similar to that observed in a marine estuarine environment lin et al 2012 in addition to bulk colloids previous studies also reported the molecular size dependent abundance and composition of colloidal organic matter in surface waters xu and guo 2017 as also evidenced by the doc dop ratio in the fox river plume table 2 within the bulk cop pool the large sized colloidal fractions both the 3 10 kda and 10 kda 0 7 µm increased gradually from the fox river to open green bay while the 1 3 kda small cop decreased along the same transection fig 7 these changes in cop abundance seemed to support a dynamic coagulation and peptization of colloids regulated by dom and ionic strength mosley et al 2003 xu et al 2018b on the other hand changes in the colloidal size distribution of dop along the river bay transect could be mostly the result of shifting in colloidal sources and freshness of colloids across the hydrologic trophic interface along the river bay transect for example freshly photosynthesized and or liberated dop or dom would be mainly hmw materials qu et al 2012 benner and amon 2015 therefore the assimilation and utilization of dip by phytoplankton in open water could generate fresh dop increasing the cop abundance and the larger sized colloids fig 7 these results indicated that the colloidal size distribution of dop is source specific and regulated by environmental settings e g ph and ionic strength as well as biological and physicochemical processes overall cop in the fox river is mainly allochthonous in nature and composed of mostly smaller sized colloids from highly degraded soil dop while cop in open bay waters is predominantly autochthonous and contains mostly larger sized colloids from algae and their exudates fig 7 there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between cop and pop in the fox river plume supplementary fig s3 indicating that surficial processes and colloid colloid or particle particle interactions such as flocculation coagulation of colloids and disaggregation of particles may play a significant role in controlling the partitioning and thus the biogeochemical cycling of p species in the water column indeed the hmw dom or colloidal organic matter has been shown to have higher biological reactivity or degradation rates relative to its lmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 and higher chemical reactivity such as short residence time and young 14c ages guo and santschi 1997 guo et al 2009 in aquatic environments if fractions of the bulk colloidal organic p are biologically and chemically more reactive qin et al 2015 the strong presence of cop observed here has implications for understanding p cycling and its relation to the development of eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia in coastal environments as shown in fig 5 values of logk d for all three p phases decreased with increasing spm concentrations with a significant inverse correlation with logspm consistently showing a particle concentration effect and similar to those observed for particle reactive elements in different aquatic environments honeyman and santschi 1988 santschi et al 1995 guo et al 1997 overall consistently high logk d values observed for different p species here again attest to its particle reactive nature and the important role of colloidal phases and colloid related physicochemical processes such as adsorption desorption and coagulation disaggregation in controlling the distribution transport and cycling pathways of p in aquatic environments during summer although biological processes are important in the production and consumption of colloids wang and guo 2001 future studies could focus on elucidating the composition and reactivity of colloidal p and its role in the cycling of p especially during other seasons and flow regimes that would enable the summer period that was described in detail here to be placed in an annual context and focus on the relative importance of different biological and physicochemical processes 5 conclusion chemical speciation phase partitioning and transformation of p between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases were examined in the lower fox river green bay ecosystem in northwest lake michigan during midsummer in general concentrations of dip dop pip cip and cop decreased but pop increased along the fox river green bay transect with dynamic variations in the chemical speciation and partitioning of p within the total dissolved and particulate p pools dip and pip were the dominant p species in river waters while dop and pop became predominant in the open green bay showing highly variable p speciation and intensive transformation between p species through biological and physicochemical processes across the river bay interface together with dynamic changes in δ13c poc signatures the observed distinct particulate properties indicate a significant change in pom sources from largely terrigenous with low p contents in mg p g and higher c n ratios and δ13c poc values in the fox river to more autochthonous particles or algae with higher p contents in mg p g and lower c n ratio and δ13c poc values in the open green bay the abundance of cip was in general low and became undetectable in open bay water showing dip or srp is exclusively present in the 1 kda lmw phase in contrast cop abundances were high in both river water and open bay water indicating source of terrigenous cop from the fox river and autochthonous cop from open bay water within the bulk cop pool highly degraded smaller sized colloids 1 10 kda dominated in river water while larger sized colloids 10 kda 0 7 μm dominated in open green bay and were mostly derived from algal exudates showing a variable and highly heterogeneous dop pool across the river bay interface high logk d values were observed for both inorganic and organic p in the study area demonstrating an evident particle concentration effect on the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases and suggesting colloids particles and thus surficial processes may play an important role in governing the abundance speciation and bioavailability of p in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

17081,the present study analyzes at the national level the presence of circulating legionella in the artificial aquatic systems of different facilities of all of them state owned centers throughout spain for 12 months 1754 water samples from various state owned centers were collected from january to december 2014 samples were collected from the cooling towers and evaporative condensers ctc and water distribution networks such as domestic hot water dhw cold water for human consumption cw sprinkler irrigation systems sis fire sprinkler systems fss and water from decorative fountains df all these facilities are considered according to current regulations as potential amplifying systems for bacteria and possible sources of infection by the generation of droplets and aerosols the isolation and counting of legionella in water samples was carried out using microbiological culture following the international normative une en iso 11 731 2007 iso 11 731 1998 and une en iso 8199 2008 iso 8199 2005 the quantification of legionella colonization the annual distribution and the geographical distribution of the legionella isolates recovered in the water were analyzed besides molecular techniques were used for the characterization of the legionella non pneumophila isolates legionella was recovered from 15 79 of the analyzed water samples high colonization was more frequently detected in water samples from ctc dhw cw and df regarding the geographic distribution positive samples of legionella were obtained in 14 of the 18 spanish locations analyzed legionella non pneumophila was the most prevalent and was isolated from water samples from 13 different geographical locations 72 legionella anisa and legionella jordanis were the most frequently non pneumophila species isolated legionella donaldsonii was isolated for the first time in the water distribution networks in spain legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 was detected in 13 locations and legionella pneumophila sg 1 in 11 locations therefore our study concludes that the presence of legionella pneumophila and legionella non pneumophila species in these systems can be a potential threat to public

centre for disease prevention and control ecdc noted in their latest incidence report that in 2018 both the number and notification rate of legionnaires disease in the eu eea was the highest ever observed continuing an increase observed since 2014 annual epidemiological report for 2018 ecdc legionnaires disease surveillance report 2020 the annual notification rate increased from 2014 to 2018 spain reported 1492 confirmed cases in 2018 one of the four countries with france germany and italy that accounted for 71 of all notified cases in 2018 there was a 23 increase in the number of cases in 2018 compared with 2017 the high incidence of cases declared in spain may be due to a greater transmission of microorganisms in a country where many of the months are warm or to the meticulous epidemiological surveillance carried out in the different autonomous communities the incidence in spain of legionnaires disease may be greater than that reported since the diagnostic techniques performed in most hospitals such as the detection of legionella antigen in urine only detect infections caused by l pneumophila sg 1 the isolation and counting of legionella in water samples should be done following the international standard une en iso 11731 a negative result does not exclude the presence of the bacteria and a positive result must be accompanied by a corrective action that decreases or eliminates the pathogen following the protocols established in spanish regulations une 100030 and rd 865 2003 the ecdc suggests that regular checks for legionella bacteria and appropriate control measures in engineered water systems may significantly prevent legionnaires disease cases 2 purpose objective isolation and quantification of legionella species and molecular characterization of legionella non pneumophila isolates from water samples from distribution networks and evaporative systems throughout spain this study has addressed the distribution of the circulating species and sg of legionella and has given information about the effectiveness of the treatments applied in the facilities for their disinfection and maintenance also the differences between autonomous communities in spain and their seasonal variation have been determined 3 materials and methods 3 1 samples collection a total of 1754 water samples were collected from the water system from official public centers distributed throughout spain for a year january to december of 2014 water facilities sampled were cooling towers and evaporative condensers ctc n 60 domestic hot water dhw n 993 cold water cw n 639 fire sprinkler systems fss n 24 sprinkler irrigation systems sis n 34 and decorative fountains df n 4 the only hot water sample was dhw with an average temperature of 46 1 ºc the rest of the samples were cold water with an average temperature of 16 36ºc finally the data of chlorine and ph was carried out at the beginning not with all the samples since the results were not available for all of them 3 2 isolation identification and quantification of legionella 3 2 1 sample concentration the samples were collected in a sterile 1 liter plastic bottle with sodium thiosulfate to neutralize any residual disinfectant and were kept at 4 8 c in darkness until their filtration 48 72 h post collection une en iso 11731 2007 iso 11731 1998 the water samples 150 ml each sample were concentrated by filtration with a vacuum system under sterile conditions through a polycarbonate membrane filter 0 2 µm pore and 47 mm diameter millipore 3 2 2 legionella culture the concentrated

and dna sequence analysis for legionellanon pneumophila species a semi nested pcr described by miyamoto et al 1997 was used for partial amplification of the 16s rdna gene of legionella with some modifications performed by magnet et al 2015 dna extraction was performed using the fastdna kit for soil mp biomedicals illkrich france the primers used in the first step of the semi nested pcr were leg225 5 aagattagcctgcgtccgat 3 and leg858 5 gtcaacttatcgcgtttgct 3 the positive samples in this first step of pcr the amplified products were purified using nucleospin1 gel and pcr clean up macherey nagel germany these pcr products were then sequenced in both directions by the macrogen laboratory sequencing service seoul korea the sequences were analyzed using bioedit sequence alignment editor 7 0 5 3 the second real time pcr was performed with samples that resulted in negative this second step was carried out with internal specific primers leg448 5 gagggttgataggttaagagc 3 and leg858 to detect legionella spp total genomic dna from l pneumophila sg 1 nctc 12821 was used as a positive control and elution buffer from the dna extraction kit as a negative control 3 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using pearson s chi square test p 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance 4 results 4 1 isolation of legionella from the different water samples 1754 water samples were cultured following the procedure explained legionella was isolated from 277 samples 15 8 whereas in 1477 84 2 the presence of the microorganism was not detected dhw was the most frequently colonized water sample with 18 4 of legionella recovery p 0 001 cw had a significant lower colonization percentage 12 1 p 0 001 the recovery of legionella in sis was even lower 8 8 but the number of samples analyzed did not allow for statistical significance the high percentage of legionella isolated from the decorative fountains 50 could be skewed because of the small number of samples analyzed table 1 4 2 legionella serogroups present in the different water samples pure cultures were obtained in 271 of the 277 positive samples 97 8 while 6 samples 2 2 revealed a mixed culture with two or three different legionella strains table 2 it was observed that l pneumophila was isolated from 208 water samples 76 l pneumophila sg 1 was the most frequently isolated in positive samples 39 3 much more than legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 which was recovered from 6 8 of total positive samples legionella non pneumophila was recovered from 26 3 of positive water samples mainly in pure culture 4 3 quantitative detection of legionella the concentrationof legionella in the water samples was analyzed by culture on gvpc plates samples where legionella was isolated with other bacteria that prevented the count were recorded as positive without counting pwc 9 4 of the positive samples had 10000 cfu l 33 of samples had an intermediate count between 1000 and 10000 cfu l and the counts were less than 1000 cfu l in 53 1 of samples the pwc samples were 4 7 table 3 l pneumophila was the most frequently recovered species in samples with high and intermediate counts conversely in samples with a low concentration of legionella the isolates of legionella non pneumophila constituted 35 4 of the total isolates a single strain of legionella was detected in all high count samples while the isolation of two or three different legionella strains in the same sample was only possible in samples with medium and low colonization the quantitative detection of legionella in the water samples from the different facilities are shown in fig 1 high colonization was detected in most facilities 12 5 of the positive ctc samples 10 3 dhw 6 4 cw and df 50 only one legionella strain was isolated in these samples 4 4 molecular identification of legionella non pneumophila molecular identification techniques were applied to 40 pure cultured isolates of legionella non pneumophila comparison of the sequences obtained with those present in the gene bank database allowed the identification of legionella jordanis 67 5 legionella anisa 22 5 legionella taurinensis 5 and legionella donalsonii 5 all of them were recovered from dhw and cw 4 5 seasonal distribution of legionella the distribution of the sampling points and the determination of the number of samples to be collected throughout 2014 were carried out following previous inspections and the determination of critical points during the spring and summer periods march to july the regular control and sampling of the facilities are complemented with additional official inspections since this is when a higher risk of aerosol production and emission of microorganisms into the air has been detected on the other hand the months after summer september to november are usually the months intended for the follow up of the non conformities shown during the official inspections carried out some of them providing an associated sampling the months in which the greatest number of positive samples were detected were april 21 august 19 1 and november 21 6 concerning the analyzed samples each month fig 2 to determine if there were differences between the species and sg of legionella isolated throughout the year the legionella isolates were analyzed according to the month in which the samples were collected fig 2 l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were present in a similar quantity most months increasing in april and september legionella non pneumophila was a minority most of the year except in march which accounted for 80 of the isolates coinciding with a decrease of l pneumophila sg 1 the coexistence of several species sg of legionella was detected from a small percentage of the samples taken in june october november and december l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were more frequently detected than legionella non pneumophila throughout the year except in march when 80 of the isolates were non pneumophila species the rest of the year l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were the more frequently isolated in similar quantities the coexistence of several species sg of legionella was detected in a small percentage of the samples taken in june october november and december 4 6 geographic distribution of legionella in spain the 1754 water samples analyzed were collected from 18 locations of spain 16 of the 17 spanish autonomous communities and from ceuta and melilla which are two spanish autonomous cities located in the north of africa positive samples were recovered from 14 of the 18 locations with a higher recovery in the eastern part of spain conversely the negative samples were obtained from communities in northern spain galicia asturias navarra and país vasco fig 3 l pneumophila sg 1 was detected in 61 of spanish locations l pneumophila sg 2 14 was present in 66 and legionella non pneumophila in 72 different species sg of legionella were recovered from the water samples from all the geographical locations but in two of them only one was recovered l pneumophila sg 1 in melilla and legionella non pneumophila in cantabria a uniform distribution of the isolates of legionella non pnemophila was observed throughout spain with a higher density in the province of madrid where the 4 species l jordanis l anisa l taurinensis and l donaldsonii were detected l anisa and l jordanis were distributed throughout spain fig 3 5 discussion legionella is a bacterium widely distributed in aquatic environments that reaches the lungs of individuals by inhaling water droplets from facilities where it proliferates the search for legionella in water has different objectives including the detection of the sources of infection involved in outbreaks or individual cases further determination of the effectiveness of treatments applied in facilities associated with cases or included in maintenance plans in compliance with current prevention legislation and the assessment of the situation of risk facilities based on legionellosis prevention programs regardless of their relationship with cases the present study was carried out throughout spain for 12 months to detect legionella in different facilities of the state owned centers legionella was isolated by culture in the 15 8 of 1754 water samples examined similar results were published in another survey carried out in spain from 2005 to 2006 rivera et al 2007 the diversity of legionella species and sg recovered in our study depended on the facilities analyzed but in all of them there was a predominance of l pneumophila concerning legionella positive rates of ctc were 13 3 identical data were reported in china and was much lower than other rates reported in spain and other countries table 4 despite the low recovery rate the presence of legionella non pneumophila in high concentration 12 5 and legionella pneumophila sg1 37 5 and legionella non pneumophila in intermediate concentrations 12 5 shows deficiencies in the cleaning and disinfection procedures of the facilities it is important to control these facilities as they have been identified as directly related to the occurrence of cases of legionellosis due to the generation of aerosols wüthrich et al 2019 shivaji et al 2014 sabriá et al 2006 nguyen et al 2006 the isolation of only one type of legionella in every sample may suggest a succession of strains that outcompete with other species serotypes as has been suggested wéry et al 2008 legionella pneumophila sg1 was found in 50 of the isolated strains similar to the 44 reported in turkey in similar facilities türetgen et al 2005 dhw was the most frequently colonized water sample with 18 4 of legionella recovery p 0 001 table 4 shows that this finding is higher than those obtained in previous studies and is lower than those found in italy in the same type of facilities nevertheless high concentrations of legionella in these facilities were frequently found in the studies as we found in 10 of positive samples most of them colonized by unique legionella isolates although cw had significantly lower colonization p 0 001 high and medium colonization rates were obtained in 6 4 and 33 7 respectively of positive samples with unique isolates of species legionella pneumophila sg1 legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 and legionella non pneumophila in similar percentages 32 4 29 8 and 33 7 respectively although the high recuperation rate of legionella from the decorative fountains 50 might be due to the small number of samples analyzed high legionella recovery from these facilities has been published elsewhere such as italy table 4 fountains have been related to community and nosocomial legionnaire s disease with legionella pneumophila sg1 having been isolated in high concentrations despite standard maintenance and sanitizing methods haupt et al 2012 palmore et al 2009 smith et al 2015 consejería de sanidad 2016 this fact highlights the need to evaluate the safety of df and their routine cleaning since their current maintenance does not eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination cunha and cunha 2017 some studies have proposed that the increase in bacterial concentration in various facilities could be related to the increasing resistance to current treatments established for their disinfection marchesi et al 2016 bédard et al 2016 and with the state of conservation alary and joly 1992 which could facilitate their recolonization patterson et al 1994 although there is still no consensus on the concentration of legionella that could produce cases or outbreaks the high percentage of colonization suggests that the corrective measures currently established in spanish legislation are not enough to guarantee risk reduction making it necessary to search for other alternatives colville et al 1993 liu et al 1995 bédard et al 2016 de lorenzi et al 2016 on the other hand significant variations in legionella concentrations were found after repeated sampling of the same facility for 5 consecutive days napoli et al 2010 that suggests that the application of legionella protocols concerning the frequency the sampling locations and the number of samples per facilities cannot capture natural variability and could be causing errors in the estimation of the level of contamination of the facilities the progressive implementation of une 100030 2017 in spain the regulation which specifies the frequency of sampling for each type of facility and the number of representative points to be sampled according to the total number of terminal points which complements rd 865 2003 is still pending an update the identification of legionella non pneumophila as a cause of pneumonia highlights the importance of these species and the need to search and identify them in the environment by appropriate and complementary methods based on culture and identification by agglutination with latex particles sedgwick and tilton 1983 which have proved insufficient for the identification of numerous species of the genus legionella catalán et al 1997 homologies greater than 97 were found in the gene bank from 16s rrna of 40 legionella non pneumophila isolates wilson et al 2007 sun et al 2015 67 5 corresponded to l jordanis 22 5 to l anisa and 5 to both l taurinensis and l donaldsonii it was possible to detect these last two species by agglutination in an unexpected way since according to the specifications of the agglutination kit they should not have agglutinated thus variations in the specificity of the test our results are pioneering in the analysis of the species of legionella non pneumophila circulating in the water of distribution networks and ctc in spain by semi nested pcr l jordanis and l anisa did not present a clear predominance among facilities they were mostly found at the endpoints of the supply systems taps and showers which suggests that although the amount of chlorine at the entrance of the connection is adequate due to the size of the network and the presence of unburied sections of pipe on the way to the point of consumption it is not possible to maintain an adequate level of chlorine to inhibit colonization by the bacteria at these points recent studies indicate that aerators installed in most faucets and showers have a fundamental role in the amount of legionella cristina et al 2014 after even complying with the periodicity and cleaning and maintenance protocol established in the current spanish legislation rd 865 2003 according to the data of the annual climatological summary of aemet spanish meteorological agency the year 2014 was extremely warm throughout the spanish plateau being the second warmest since 1961 a winter warmer than habitual could favor the replication of legionella in the water samples as was detected at a similar frequency in some normally lower temperature months 18 21 6 february march april november and december and in warmer months 18 9 19 1 august and september the more frequent recovery of l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 was expected as they have been isolated in a significantly higher number in all the facilities but the high recovery of legionella non pneumophila in march was unexpected with 80 of the monthly isolates rivera et al 2007 published an increase in the recovery of legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 in november as in our study but there are no further similarities in the monthly distribution of the rest of the species similar results were obtained by felice et al 2019 with a seasonal peak at the end of summer between the months of august november regarding the geographical distribution the increased presence of legionella in water samples was confirmed from the eastern half of spain data not shown and most samples with high counts came from this geographic localization according to previous results gómez barroso et al 2011 l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were the most frequently isolated in all the analyzed spanish localizations but in the cantabrian region located in the north of spain non pneumophila species were only isolated with low counts and melilla located in north africa with only the recovery of l pneumophila sg 1 with intermediate counts regarding the geographical distribution of legionella non pneumophila a uniform distribution of isolates was observed throughout spain l jordanis and l anisa were isolated as the major circulating species in water distribution networks and ctc l anisa has been previously described as the predominant legionella non pneumophila and the second most prevalent legionella species described in several countries for example in distribution networks and ctc in new york and the different us regions gorman et al 1985 llewellyn et al 2017 in different environmental water supplies in france doleans et al 2004 and watering and ctc of greek hotels chochlakis et al 2013 l donaldsonii has been isolated in this study for the first time at the level of distribution networks and ctc the detection in spain of this species suggests the possibility that it may be causing atypical pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients whose etiology is unknown as an adequate methodology that allows its detection is not in use previous studies reported isolation in water treatment plants in taiwan huang et al 2009 this species which has traditionally been considered non pathogenic has recently been linked to human infection after a study in 33 cancer patients in the us han et al 2015 the identification of l taurinensis and l donaldsonii was unexpected since according to the instructions of the agglutination kit previously used to identify the cultured bacteria these species should not have agglutinated with the antibodies to legionella non pneumophila the presence of legionella non pneumophila in environmental water should be taken into account as although the pathogenicity of non pneumophila species is lower than l pneumophila some of these species have been associated with human disease moreover there is evidence of infection in patients by more than one legionella strain that produced the co infection from the same environmental source or the independent infections in a very short period coscollá et al 2014 the results revealed the high presence of legionella in the spanish water supplies legionella pneumophila being the most isolated species nevertheless the recovery of non pneumophila species whose presence has not usually been studied in the environment cannot be underestimated and as we have demonstrated can colonize drinking water systems therefore after the high presence observed for legionella non pneumophila our study suggests that the implementation of molecular techniques in routinary detection of legionella either in water and clinical samples would improve the diagnosis of these increasingly important pathogenic legionella as they might be underestimated with the current techniques 6 conclusion the isolation of legionella pneumophila and legionella non pneumophila in water facilities indicates the need for permanent monitoring of the water supplies and improvement in the control and eradication procedures in these facilities the isolation of legionella anisa legionella jordanis and legionella donaldsonii which have been demonstrated for the first time in water supply systems in spain suggests that rather research on legionella non pneumophila is needed due to the potential risk of infection of legionnaires

17081,the present study analyzes at the national level the presence of circulating legionella in the artificial aquatic systems of different facilities of all of them state owned centers throughout spain for 12 months 1754 water samples from various state owned centers were collected from january to december 2014 samples were collected from the cooling towers and evaporative condensers ctc and water distribution networks such as domestic hot water dhw cold water for human consumption cw sprinkler irrigation systems sis fire sprinkler systems fss and water from decorative fountains df all these facilities are considered according to current regulations as potential amplifying systems for bacteria and possible sources of infection by the generation of droplets and aerosols the isolation and counting of legionella in water samples was carried out using microbiological culture following the international normative une en iso 11 731 2007 iso 11 731 1998 and une en iso 8199 2008 iso 8199 2005 the quantification of legionella colonization the annual distribution and the geographical distribution of the legionella isolates recovered in the water were analyzed besides molecular techniques were used for the characterization of the legionella non pneumophila isolates legionella was recovered from 15 79 of the analyzed water samples high colonization was more frequently detected in water samples from ctc dhw cw and df regarding the geographic distribution positive samples of legionella were obtained in 14 of the 18 spanish locations analyzed legionella non pneumophila was the most prevalent and was isolated from water samples from 13 different geographical locations 72 legionella anisa and legionella jordanis were the most frequently non pneumophila species isolated legionella donaldsonii was isolated for the first time in the water distribution networks in spain legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 was detected in 13 locations and legionella pneumophila sg 1 in 11 locations therefore our study concludes that the presence of legionella pneumophila and legionella non pneumophila species in these systems can be a potential threat to public health and should be examined thoroughly with complementary techniques such as molecular techniques as a screen for routine diagnosis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords south of

centre for disease prevention and control ecdc noted in their latest incidence report that in 2018 both the number and notification rate of legionnaires disease in the eu eea was the highest ever observed continuing an increase observed since 2014 annual epidemiological report for 2018 ecdc legionnaires disease surveillance report 2020 the annual notification rate increased from 2014 to 2018 spain reported 1492 confirmed cases in 2018 one of the four countries with france germany and italy that accounted for 71 of all notified cases in 2018 there was a 23 increase in the number of cases in 2018 compared with 2017 the high incidence of cases declared in spain may be due to a greater transmission of microorganisms in a country where many of the months are warm or to the meticulous epidemiological surveillance carried out in the different autonomous communities the incidence in spain of legionnaires disease may be greater than that reported since the diagnostic techniques performed in most hospitals such as the detection of legionella antigen in urine only detect infections caused by l pneumophila sg 1 the isolation and counting of legionella in water samples should be done following the international standard une en iso 11731 a negative result does not exclude the presence of the bacteria and a positive result must be accompanied by a corrective action that decreases or eliminates the pathogen following the protocols established in spanish regulations une 100030 and rd 865 2003 the ecdc suggests that regular checks for legionella bacteria and appropriate control measures in engineered water systems may significantly prevent legionnaires disease cases 2 purpose objective isolation and quantification of legionella species and molecular characterization of legionella non pneumophila isolates from water samples from distribution networks and evaporative systems throughout spain this study has addressed the distribution of the circulating species and sg of legionella and has given information about the effectiveness of the treatments applied in the facilities for their disinfection and maintenance also the differences between autonomous communities in spain and their seasonal variation have been determined 3 materials and methods 3 1 samples collection a total of 1754 water samples were collected from the water system from official public centers distributed throughout spain for a year january to december of 2014 water facilities sampled were cooling towers and evaporative condensers ctc n 60 domestic hot water dhw n 993 cold water cw n 639 fire sprinkler systems fss n 24 sprinkler irrigation systems sis n 34 and decorative fountains df n 4 the only hot water sample was dhw with an average temperature of 46 1 ºc the rest of the samples were cold water with an average temperature of 16 36ºc finally the data of chlorine and ph was carried out at the beginning not with all the samples since the results were not available for all of them 3 2 isolation identification and quantification of legionella 3 2 1 sample concentration the samples were collected in a sterile 1 liter plastic bottle with sodium thiosulfate to neutralize any residual disinfectant and were kept at 4 8 c in darkness until their filtration 48 72 h post collection une en iso 11731 2007 iso 11731 1998 the water samples 150 ml each sample were concentrated by filtration with a vacuum system under sterile conditions through a polycarbonate membrane filter 0 2 µm pore and 47 mm diameter millipore 3 2 2 legionella culture the concentrated sample was divided into three treatments i acid shock hcl 0 2 m kcl 0 2 m 5 min ii heat shock 50 c 30 min and iii untreated water five hundred microliters of treated water samples were inoculated in

extract agar bcye oxoid with and without l cysteine and incubated in the same conditions colonies that required l cysteine to grow were considered legionella sp 3 2 3 identification of species serogroups and quantification of legionella spp speciation or serogrouping of isolates was performed using latex agglutination legionella latex test kit oxoid the legionella latex test allows the identification of legionella pneumophila legionella pneumophila sg 1 and 2 14 or non pneumophila species l longbeachae sg 1 and 2 l bozemanii sg 1 and 2 l dumoffii l gormanii l jordanis l micdadei and l anisa the quantification of legionella spp was carried out according to the following range 100 1000 cfu l 1000 10000cfu l and 10000 cfu l une en iso 11731 2007 iso 11731 1998 3 3 detection by pcr and dna sequence analysis for legionellanon pneumophila species a semi nested pcr described by miyamoto et al 1997 was used for partial amplification of the 16s rdna gene of legionella with some modifications performed by magnet et al 2015 dna extraction was performed using the fastdna kit for soil mp biomedicals illkrich france the primers used in the first step of the semi nested pcr were leg225 5 aagattagcctgcgtccgat 3 and leg858 5 gtcaacttatcgcgtttgct 3 the positive samples in this first step of pcr the amplified products were purified using nucleospin1 gel and pcr clean up macherey nagel germany these pcr products were then sequenced in both directions by the macrogen laboratory sequencing service seoul korea the sequences were analyzed using bioedit sequence alignment editor 7 0 5 3 the second real time pcr was performed with samples that resulted in negative this second step was carried out with internal specific primers leg448 5 gagggttgataggttaagagc 3 and leg858 to detect legionella spp total genomic dna from l pneumophila sg 1 nctc 12821 was used as a positive control and elution buffer from the dna extraction kit as a negative control 3 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using pearson s chi square test p 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance 4 results 4 1 isolation of legionella from the different water samples 1754 water samples were cultured following the procedure explained legionella was isolated from 277 samples 15 8 whereas in 1477 84 2 the presence of the microorganism was not detected dhw was the most frequently colonized water sample with 18 4 of legionella recovery p 0 001 cw had a significant lower colonization percentage 12 1 p 0 001 the recovery of legionella in sis was even lower 8 8 but the number of samples analyzed did not allow for statistical significance the high percentage of legionella isolated from the decorative fountains 50 could be skewed because of the small number of samples analyzed table 1 4 2 legionella serogroups present in the different water samples pure cultures were obtained in 271 of the 277 positive samples 97 8 while 6 samples 2 2 revealed a mixed culture with two or three different legionella strains table 2 it was observed that l pneumophila was isolated from 208 water samples 76 l pneumophila sg 1 was the most frequently isolated in positive samples 39 3 much more than legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 which was recovered from 6 8 of total positive samples legionella non pneumophila was recovered from 26 3 of positive water samples mainly in pure culture 4 3 quantitative detection of legionella the concentrationof legionella in the water samples was analyzed by culture on gvpc plates samples where legionella was isolated with other bacteria that prevented the count were recorded as positive without counting pwc 9 4 of the positive samples had 10000 cfu l 33 of samples had an intermediate count between 1000 and 10000 cfu l and the counts were less than 1000 cfu l in 53 1 of samples the pwc samples were 4 7 table 3 l pneumophila was the most frequently recovered species in samples with high and intermediate counts conversely in samples with a low concentration of legionella the isolates of legionella non pneumophila constituted 35 4 of the total isolates a single strain of legionella was detected in all high count samples while the isolation of two or three different legionella strains in the same sample was only possible in samples with medium and low colonization the quantitative detection of legionella in the water samples from the different facilities are shown in fig 1 high colonization was detected in most facilities 12 5 of the positive ctc samples 10 3 dhw 6 4 cw and df 50 only one legionella strain was isolated in these samples 4 4 molecular identification of legionella non pneumophila molecular identification techniques were applied to 40 pure cultured isolates of legionella non pneumophila comparison of the sequences obtained with those present in the gene bank database allowed the identification of legionella jordanis 67 5 legionella anisa 22 5 legionella taurinensis 5 and legionella donalsonii 5 all of them were recovered from dhw and cw 4 5 seasonal distribution of legionella the distribution of the sampling points and the determination of the number of samples to be collected throughout 2014 were carried out following previous inspections and the determination of critical points during the spring and summer periods march to july the regular control and sampling of the facilities are complemented with additional official inspections since this is when a higher risk of aerosol production and emission of microorganisms into the air has been detected on the other hand the months after summer september to november are usually the months intended for the follow up of the non conformities shown during the official inspections carried out some of them providing an associated sampling the months in which the greatest number of positive samples were detected were april 21 august 19 1 and november 21 6 concerning the analyzed samples each month fig 2 to determine if there were differences between the species and sg of legionella isolated throughout the year the legionella isolates were analyzed according to the month in which the samples were collected fig 2 l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were present in a similar quantity most months increasing in april and september legionella non pneumophila was a minority most of the year except in march which accounted for 80 of the isolates coinciding with a decrease of l pneumophila sg 1 the coexistence of several species sg of legionella was detected from a small percentage of the samples taken in june october november and december l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were more frequently detected than legionella non pneumophila throughout the year except in march when 80 of the isolates were non pneumophila species the rest of the year l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were the more frequently isolated in similar quantities the coexistence of several species sg of legionella was detected in a small percentage of the samples taken in june october november and december 4 6 geographic distribution of legionella in spain the 1754 water samples analyzed were collected from 18 locations of spain 16 of the 17 spanish autonomous communities and from ceuta and melilla which are two spanish autonomous cities located in the north of africa positive samples were recovered from 14 of the 18 locations with a higher recovery in the eastern part of spain conversely the negative samples were obtained from communities in northern spain galicia asturias navarra and país vasco fig 3 l pneumophila sg 1 was detected in 61 of spanish locations l pneumophila sg 2 14 was present in 66 and legionella non pneumophila in 72 different species sg of legionella were recovered from the water samples from all the geographical locations but in two of them only one was recovered l pneumophila sg 1 in melilla and legionella non pneumophila in cantabria a uniform distribution of the isolates of legionella non pnemophila was observed throughout spain with a higher density in the province of madrid where the 4 species l jordanis l anisa l taurinensis and l donaldsonii were detected l anisa and l jordanis were distributed throughout spain fig 3 5 discussion legionella is a bacterium widely distributed in aquatic environments that reaches the lungs of individuals by inhaling water droplets from facilities where it proliferates the search for legionella in water has different objectives including the detection of the sources of infection involved in outbreaks or individual cases further determination of the effectiveness of treatments applied in facilities associated with cases or included in maintenance plans in compliance with current prevention legislation and the assessment of the situation of risk facilities based on legionellosis prevention programs regardless of their relationship with cases the present study was carried out throughout spain for 12 months to detect legionella in different facilities of the state owned centers legionella was isolated by culture in the 15 8 of 1754 water samples examined similar results were published in another survey carried out in spain from 2005 to 2006 rivera et al 2007 the diversity of legionella species and sg recovered in our study depended on the facilities analyzed but in all of them there was a predominance of l pneumophila concerning legionella positive rates of ctc were 13 3 identical data were reported in china and was much lower than other rates reported in spain and other countries table 4 despite the low recovery rate the presence of legionella non pneumophila in high concentration 12 5 and legionella pneumophila sg1 37 5 and legionella non pneumophila in intermediate concentrations 12 5 shows deficiencies in the cleaning and disinfection procedures of the facilities it is important to control these facilities as they have been identified as directly related to the occurrence of cases of legionellosis due to the generation of aerosols wüthrich et al 2019 shivaji et al 2014 sabriá et al 2006 nguyen et al 2006 the isolation of only one type of legionella in every sample may suggest a succession of strains that outcompete with other species serotypes as has been suggested wéry et al 2008 legionella pneumophila sg1 was found in 50 of the isolated strains similar to the 44 reported in turkey in similar facilities türetgen et al 2005 dhw was the most frequently colonized water sample with 18 4 of legionella recovery p 0 001 table 4 shows that this finding is higher than those obtained in previous studies and is lower than those found in italy in the same type of facilities nevertheless high concentrations of legionella in these facilities were frequently found in the studies as we found in 10 of positive samples most of them colonized by unique legionella isolates although cw had significantly lower colonization p 0 001 high and medium colonization rates were obtained in 6 4 and 33 7 respectively of positive samples with unique isolates of species legionella pneumophila sg1 legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 and legionella non pneumophila in similar percentages 32 4 29 8 and 33 7 respectively although the high recuperation rate of legionella from the decorative fountains 50 might be due to the small number of samples analyzed high legionella recovery from these facilities has been published elsewhere such as italy table 4 fountains have been related to community and nosocomial legionnaire s disease with legionella pneumophila sg1 having been isolated in high concentrations despite standard maintenance and sanitizing methods haupt et al 2012 palmore et al 2009 smith et al 2015 consejería de sanidad 2016 this fact highlights the need to evaluate the safety of df and their routine cleaning since their current maintenance does not eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination cunha and cunha 2017 some studies have proposed that the increase in bacterial concentration in various facilities could be related to the increasing resistance to current treatments established for their disinfection marchesi et al 2016 bédard et al 2016 and with the state of conservation alary and joly 1992 which could facilitate their recolonization patterson et al 1994 although there is still no consensus on the concentration of legionella that could produce cases or outbreaks the high percentage of colonization suggests that the corrective measures currently established in spanish legislation are not enough to guarantee risk reduction making it necessary to search for other alternatives colville et al 1993 liu et al 1995 bédard et al 2016 de lorenzi et al 2016 on the other hand significant variations in legionella concentrations were found after repeated sampling of the same facility for 5 consecutive days napoli et al 2010 that suggests that the application of legionella protocols concerning the frequency the sampling locations and the number of samples per facilities cannot capture natural variability and could be causing errors in the estimation of the level of contamination of the facilities the progressive implementation of une 100030 2017 in spain the regulation which specifies the frequency of sampling for each type of facility and the number of representative points to be sampled according to the total number of terminal points which complements rd 865 2003 is still pending an update the identification of legionella non pneumophila as a cause of pneumonia highlights the importance of these species and the need to search and identify them in the environment by appropriate and complementary methods based on culture and identification by agglutination with latex particles sedgwick and tilton 1983 which have proved insufficient for the identification of numerous species of the genus legionella catalán et al 1997 homologies greater than 97 were found in the gene bank from 16s rrna of 40 legionella non pneumophila isolates wilson et al 2007 sun et al 2015 67 5 corresponded to l jordanis 22 5 to l anisa and 5 to both l taurinensis and l donaldsonii it was possible to detect these last two species by agglutination in an unexpected way since according to the specifications of the agglutination kit they should not have agglutinated thus variations in the specificity of the test our results are pioneering in the analysis of the species of legionella non pneumophila circulating in the water of distribution networks and ctc in spain by semi nested pcr l jordanis and l anisa did not present a clear predominance among facilities they were mostly found at the endpoints of the supply systems taps and showers which suggests that although the amount of chlorine at the entrance of the connection is adequate due to the size of the network and the presence of unburied sections of pipe on the way to the point of consumption it is not possible to maintain an adequate level of chlorine to inhibit colonization by the bacteria at these points recent studies indicate that aerators installed in most faucets and showers have a fundamental role in the amount of legionella cristina et al 2014 after even complying with the periodicity and cleaning and maintenance protocol established in the current spanish legislation rd 865 2003 according to the data of the annual climatological summary of aemet spanish meteorological agency the year 2014 was extremely warm throughout the spanish plateau being the second warmest since 1961 a winter warmer than habitual could favor the replication of legionella in the water samples as was detected at a similar frequency in some normally lower temperature months 18 21 6 february march april november and december and in warmer months 18 9 19 1 august and september the more frequent recovery of l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 was expected as they have been isolated in a significantly higher number in all the facilities but the high recovery of legionella non pneumophila in march was unexpected with 80 of the monthly isolates rivera et al 2007 published an increase in the recovery of legionella pneumophila sg 2 14 in november as in our study but there are no further similarities in the monthly distribution of the rest of the species similar results were obtained by felice et al 2019 with a seasonal peak at the end of summer between the months of august november regarding the geographical distribution the increased presence of legionella in water samples was confirmed from the eastern half of spain data not shown and most samples with high counts came from this geographic localization according to previous results gómez barroso et al 2011 l pneumophila sg 1 and l pneumophila sg 2 14 were the most frequently isolated in all the analyzed spanish localizations but in the cantabrian region located in the north of spain non pneumophila species were only isolated with low counts and melilla located in north africa with only the recovery of l pneumophila sg 1 with intermediate counts regarding the geographical distribution of legionella non pneumophila a uniform distribution of isolates was observed throughout spain l jordanis and l anisa were isolated as the major circulating species in water distribution networks and ctc l anisa has been previously described as the predominant legionella non pneumophila and the second most prevalent legionella species described in several countries for example in distribution networks and ctc in new york and the different us regions gorman et al 1985 llewellyn et al 2017 in different environmental water supplies in france doleans et al 2004 and watering and ctc of greek hotels chochlakis et al 2013 l donaldsonii has been isolated in this study for the first time at the level of distribution networks and ctc the detection in spain of this species suggests the possibility that it may be causing atypical pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients whose etiology is unknown as an adequate methodology that allows its detection is not in use previous studies reported isolation in water treatment plants in taiwan huang et al 2009 this species which has traditionally been considered non pathogenic has recently been linked to human infection after a study in 33 cancer patients in the us han et al 2015 the identification of l taurinensis and l donaldsonii was unexpected since according to the instructions of the agglutination kit previously used to identify the cultured bacteria these species should not have agglutinated with the antibodies to legionella non pneumophila the presence of legionella non pneumophila in environmental water should be taken into account as although the pathogenicity of non pneumophila species is lower than l pneumophila some of these species have been associated with human disease moreover there is evidence of infection in patients by more than one legionella strain that produced the co infection from the same environmental source or the independent infections in a very short period coscollá et al 2014 the results revealed the high presence of legionella in the spanish water supplies legionella pneumophila being the most isolated species nevertheless the recovery of non pneumophila species whose presence has not usually been studied in the environment cannot be underestimated and as we have demonstrated can colonize drinking water systems therefore after the high presence observed for legionella non pneumophila our study suggests that the implementation of molecular techniques in routinary detection of legionella either in water and clinical samples would improve the diagnosis of these increasingly important pathogenic legionella as they might be underestimated with the current techniques 6 conclusion the isolation of legionella pneumophila and legionella non pneumophila in water facilities indicates the need for permanent monitoring of the water supplies and improvement in the control and eradication procedures in these facilities the isolation of legionella anisa legionella jordanis and legionella donaldsonii which have been demonstrated for the first time in water supply systems in spain suggests that rather research on legionella non pneumophila is needed due to the potential risk of infection of legionnaires

17082,biological ion exchange biex offers removal of dissolved organic carbon doc with greatly reduced regeneration frequency in the present work a strong base anionic exchange resin was operated without regeneration and using inlet water with either low 12 mg l 1 or high 60 mg l 1 sulphate and doc of 2 75 or 5 0 mg l 1 filters operated continuously for 226 days 16 500 bed volumes and achieved doc removal varying from 32 to 50 initially sulphate and doc were retained by the resin with chloride being released during this period doc removal occurred due to traditional mechanisms referred to as primary ion exchange following this initial period doc removal continued even though the conventionally defined resin capacity was exhausted based on chloride loading during the later period no chloride release was observed but instead sulphate was released although suggested by others the present study is the first to confirm the direct exchange in charge equivalence of anions removed doc and nitrate to released sulphate during the secondary ion exchange mechanism further increasing inlet sulphate from 12 to 60 mg l 1 resulted in a 19 decrease in doc removal finally percent doc removal was affected only by an increase of inlet doc but not changes to the counter ion or after doc loading on the resin increased to 1 3 of total capacity this work promotes biex as a viable alternative to biological activated carbon and a leading solution for low maintenance doc removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological ion exchange secondary ion exchange dissolved organic

the bacterial oxidation of organic matter creates carboxylic and phenolic groups within the doc structure chen et al 2002 the carboxylic groups are deprotonated at environmental ph the pka of carboxylic acid is 4 2 giving doc an overall negative charge thurman 1985 doc decreases the aesthetic quality of water through the addition of colour taste and odour and can provide substrate for biofilm growth in water distribution systems sillanpää 2014 as well doc can decrease the effectiveness of treatments such as causing membrane fouling yamamura et al 2007 and interfering with uv disinfection alkan et al 2007 perhaps most importantly doc reacts with chlorine during disinfection and leads to the formation of disinfection by products dbps which have been linked to potential detrimental health outcomes such as bladder cancer and decreased birth weight bove et al 1995 kramer et al 1992 morris et al 1992 and so pre treatment is normally needed to remove doc before subsequent filtration and disinfection processes coagulation and sedimentation can remove large organic molecules but are less successful at removing smaller dbp precursors especially if overall turbidity is low randtke 1988 smaller doc is better removed by adsorbents through a combination of pre oxidation and biological treatment or by ion exchange amy et al 1992 rest et al 1983 purolite a860 is a strong base anionic resin with quaternary ammonium functional groups and a high affinity for negatively charged doc bazri et al 2016 anionic ion exchange iex involves the convective transfer of negatively charged co ions from the bulk solution to a stagnant film surrounding the resin anions diffuse through this thin film of thickness δ or through the resin macropores to the resin surface

associated with the ordering of water molecules during anion removal from solution as well as an enthalpy proportional to the strength of electrostatic interaction between the surface and charged doc moieties for large doc van der waals forces may also be involved in non electrostatic removal harland 1994 during ion exchange a charge equivalence of counter ions are released for each equivalence of co ion removed fu and symons 1990 most often iex kinetics are limited by the diffusion of anions within the resin and its surrounding liquid film dixit et al 2018 due to a dependence on electrical charge gradients ion exchange is subject to competition between anions for electrostatic attraction to the resin ates and incetan 2013 boyer and singer 2008 this competitive effect is correlated to the charge density where sulphate shows greater affinity than monovalent nitrate dixit et al 2019 rahmani and mohseni 2017 while the removal of sulphate and nitrate readily occur before doc some doc can be removed in the presence of sulphate drikas et al 2011 tan and kilduff 2007 reported that high bulk sulphate concentration shifted resin affinity towards doc with fewer charged groups and higher mw relying more on physical adsorption and entropy sorption following a return to low sulphate doc with high charge density and low mw were again preferred iex resins typically become exhausted of chloride counter ions within days or weeks of operation and biofilm growth can lead to hydraulic head loss both contributing to declining performance regenerations using 10 nacl brine are recommended to restore iex capacity and decrease biofouling sillanpää 2014 however disposal of waste brine creates a challenge especially in small communities without developed wastewater infrastructure biological ion exchange biex is a new operational strategy for iex enabling high doc removal while minimizing the production of brine waste by reducing regeneration frequency iex runs beyond the regular chloride release cycle termed primary iex to gain advantage of a second cycle termed secondary iex which has previously been hypothesized to be controlled by sulphate release amini et al 2018

lab scale biex filters while abiotic iex without regeneration showed only 40 schulz et al 2017 a follow up one year pilot study with a 7 mg c l 1 influent reported doc removal around 60 using biex while standard iex regenerated every 336 bed volumes bv achieved 80 and bac only 7 amini et al 2018 a carbon mass balance estimated that biodegradation might account for up to 31 of doc removal amini et al 2018 a recent study reported somewhat lower doc removal of 29 36 for biex yet much greater than that by bac liu et al 2020 probably due to the high sulfate doc ratio found in the influent which was pretreated with alum while another recent study reported 50 doc removal over nine months and also the release of sulphate edgar and boyer 2021 these studies highlight the importance of sulphate as a competing counter ion questions remain regarding the mechanisms for long term doc removal during biex it is clear that sulphate plays an important role but sulphate competition during biex has yet to be described in the literature the present study sought to address the following knowledge gaps i if doc removal would remain constant following a step increase in inlet doc ii the detrimental impact of sulphate on doc removal and iii the role of counter ions during primary and secondary iex a better understanding of the doc removal is essential to understanding the capabilities of biex as a key treatment stage within a drinking water treatment train 2 experimental methods 2 1 source water water obtained from spanish banks creek vancouver canada was filtered with a 1 μm coarse cloth

or spiked with sodium sulphate emd chemicals sx0761 3 to 60 mg l 1 1 25 meq l 1 referred to as high sulphate inlet filtered and diluted water was stored in the dark at 4 c for up to one month prior to use inlet water was warmed to room temperature in opaque tanks inlet water characteristics are presented in table 1 based on changes to inlet doc the experiment can be divided into three phases shown on fig 1 phase 1 lasted the initial 45 days 3 300 bv with an inlet doc concentration of 2 75 mg c l 1 0 028 meq l 1 during phase 2 from day 45 to 160 3 300 to 11 500 bv the inlet doc remained at 2 75 mg l 1 but due to decreased doc in spanish banks creek from june to october a stock solution made from humic acid ha flakes alfa aesar 41 747 was used to increase inlet doc from 1 4 to 2 75 mg l 1 during period 3 from day 160 to 226 11 500 to 16 500 bv the inlet doc was 5 0 mg c l 1 0 051 meq l 1 and was achieved without humic acid additions 2 2 experimental set up purolite a860 is a

the pvc columns height 60 cm id 2 1 cm which contained 70 ml approx 20 cm depth of resin one column received low sulphate inlet water and the other received high sulphate water the columns were

thrice weekly 150 ml was collected from the outlet tubing over approx 45 min the exact collection duration and volume were recorded to determine the actual flow rate during each period inlet water tanks were sampled at every period the filters operated continuously for 226 days 16 500 bv from may to december 2019 the total feed of anions to the systems was nearly 1970 meq high sulphate feed or 690 meq low sulphate feed including approximately 42 meq of doc 66 meq of nitrate 315 meq of bicarbonate as hco3 and either 1540 or 275 meq of sulphate far exceeding the 56 meq filter capacity hydraulic backwashes were performed approximately every month as required when the head loss exceeded the hydraulic head more frequently as the experiment progressed backwashes were performed manually using a squeeze bottle to force de ionized water backwards through the outlet hose the backflow velocity of de ionized water was sustained for about 3 bv approximately two minutes such that the resin bed maintained 100 expansion and debris from within the filter media flowed upwards out of the columns 2 3 analytical methods all samples were filtered using 0 45 μm pvdf filters merck millipore ltd

triplicate with the mean reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term doc removal the measured inlet and treated doc concentrations are given in fig 1a while figs 1b and 1c present corresponding uva and suva the use of humic acid for spiking doc created an increase in uva fig 1b from day 45 to 160 while the increase in inlet doc from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 on day 160 resulted in a similar increase to doc fig 1a the average percent doc removals for period 1 and 2 day 0 to 160 were 32 10 and 39 15 respectively for high 60 mg l 1 sulphate and low 12 mg l 1 sulphate filters during period 3 day 160 to 226 the percent doc removal increased to 48 5 and 50 4 with the higher inlet doc a paired t test found a statistical difference n 100 p 0 001 in percent doc removal between filters operated with high and low inlet waters data in table s4 3 2 step change in inlet doc following the step increase in inlet doc from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 on day 160 doc affinity increased significantly from 0 32

explain the greater doc flux towards the resin eq 1 an increase in the fraction of readily removable doc may have also contributed humic material can be characterized as humic or fulvic acids where humic acids have higher suva due to increased aromaticity while fulvic acids represent the smaller and less aromatic molecules rodríguez and núñez 2011 the inlet water suva decreased from 6 2 to 3 4 l mg 1 m 1 following the increase in inlet doc fig 1c considering 60 days before and after the step change since the doc removability increases at lower suva wang et al 2010 the lower suva after the step change could explain the greater doc removal in period 3 the change in inlet suva may be a result of spiking inlet doc with ha to 2 75 mg l 1 during the summer months when spanish banks creek doc decreased to 1 4 mg l 1 the impact of humic acid addition on doc characteristics is of note namely increasing the suva from 3 3 to 5 5 l mg 1m 1 fig 1c 3 3 anion loading and primary iex exhaustion fig 2 illustrates the sulphate concentration for inlet and treated waters while fig 3 presents anion loading a cumulative charge balance on resin bound anions in equivalence per litre of resin eq l 1 during period 2 inlet doc was spiked with humic acid the doc charge density was calculated using a concentration weighted average between 10 2 and 8 9 meq g 1 for spanish banks creek nom and ha flakes respectively as reported by bazri and mohseni 2016 for suwanee river nom and suwanee river ha table s1 elsewhere ha charge density has been reported at 6 5 meq g 1 at ph 7 ritchie and michael perdue 2003 through a sensitivity analysis this range of ha charge densities varied the total meq of doc removed by less than 5 and so the value of 8 9 meq g 1 was used for doc originating from ha spiking sulphate contributes the majority of resin loading during primary iex while the transition from net sulphate uptake to release coincided with chloride exhaustion fig s2 and can be called primary iex exhaustion primary iex exhaustion occurred on day 10 for the high filter 750 bv or 1 37 eq fed eq resin when considering doc sulphate nitrate and bicarbonate and day 45 3400 bv or 2 81 eq eq for the low filter at primary iex exhaustion doc contributed 2 resin loading in the high filter and 8 in the low filter nitrate was not seen to be significantly involved in iex by other works liu et al 2020 yet a small uptake of nitrate by the resins was seen in the latter half of this experiment the cause of nitrate uptake is unclear but it has been included in the anions removed calculations for secondary iex alkalinity tests on each sample did not show a statistically significant change between inlet and treated waters hence alkalinity has been omitted and nitrate is included in the secondary iex anions removed and from the total anion loading in fig 3 in the first seven days of the experiment there was uncertainty in the chloride measurements due to challenges in achieving steady state filter operation it is well established that at the conclusion of primary iex chloride loading on the resin should decrease to nearly zero boyer and singer 2008 fu and symons 1990 so chloride release during the first three samples one week was adjusted according to the amount determined in excess of the expected results after day seven 3 4 sulphate loading a linear relationship between sulphate removal and chloride release was observed during primary iex fig 4 a the high filter saw slightly greater sulphate release than chloride removal which is likely from an operational challenge during the initial seven days as discussed in section 3 3 rahmani and mohseni 2017 also noted fewer counter ions i e chloride released during primary iex when inlet waters contained high sulphate 1 mmol l 1 sodium sulphate as compared to inlet waters without sulphate for the present study non iex mechanisms and or biological degradation were also likely to contribute to doc removal during primary iex resin affinity for sulphate was 0 99 eq eq nearly complete removal for high and only 0 85 eq eq for the low filter table s2 eventually treated water sulphate matches and in fact exceeds the inlet concentration n 60 p 0 05 fig 2 during secondary iex there was a linear relationship between sulphate release and the combined removal of doc and nitrate for both filters fig 4b there was a near direct relationship between the anions removed and released i e the exchange ratio where the low filter had a cumulative exchange ratio of 0 93 but in the high filter sulphate release exceeded anion uptake and the exchange ratio was 0 57 edgar and boyer 2021 similarly reported an exchange ratio between 0 2 and 0 6 for non regenerated iex filters with inlet sulphate between 45 and 60 mg l while the cause of greater sulphate release remains unknown the present findings suggest the phenomenon is limited to waters with high inlet sulphate 3 5 doc loading doc loading increases steadily affected only by the step change in inlet doc concentration the slope of fig 5 a denotes resin affinity for doc as meq doc removed meq fed doc affinity is significantly greater for both filters during period 3 when inlet doc was increased from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 slopes in table s2 statistical analysis in table s3 α 0 005 doc affinity was expected to decrease with the availability of ion exchange sites as well as the nature of the counter ions i e chloride counter ions during primary iex were expected to have been more readily exchanged than sulphate counter ions during secondary iex this was not observed and doc removal was unaffected by these changes it is possible that a fraction of inlet water doc is simply removed irrespective of resin loading when capacity remains or the counter ion doc3 as defined in section 3 8 as doc loading increased the flux of doc towards the resin jdoc was expected to decrease due to a decreasing concentration gradient δcdoc this was also not observed as resin bound doc increased to appreciable amounts representing 1 4 to 1 3 of total resin loading fig 3 the rate of doc removal was unaffected this may be due to the long ebct allowing for near equilibrium conditions and minimizing the impact of available capacity section 3 9 postulates an explanation involving biodegradation to maintain a constant apparent resin loading 3 6 sulphate to doc ratio the importance of inlet water sulphate concentration is evident more significant it appears that the ratio of inlet water sulphate to doc may be a predictor of filter performance and doc affinity fig 6 illustrates that doc affinity decreases as a function of the inlet water sulphate to doc ratio the doc affinities from this study were plotted along with values reported by liu et al 2020 amini et al 2018 and edgar and boyer 2021 during secondary iex the maximum doc removal predicted in the absence of sulfate in the influent is approximately 50 for each increase of ten to the inlet sulphate to doc ratio affinity decreases approximately 0 1 eq eq 3 7 ion exchange mechanism insights chloride release and sulphate uptake exhibit a linear relationship during primary iex and maximal sulphate loading correlates with the end of chloride release this supports the hypothesis whereby sulphate is exchanged for chloride as the dominant primary iex mechanism which is consistent with previous studies boyer and singer 2008 fu and symons 1990 during secondary iex sulphate release had a linear correlation to doc and nitrate uptake low sulphate inlet waters exhibited a direct relationship between sulphate release and the uptake of doc and nitrate this closes the anion balance and strongly suggests that doc displacing resin bound sulphate is the dominant doc removal mechanism during secondary iex this sulphate based secondary iex mechanism has indeed been proposed by others amini et al 2018 edgar and boyer 2021 liu et al 2020 but this is the first instance where a direct relationship has been reported when inlet doc increased after 11 500 bv the additional doc uptake is matched by increased sulphate release further confirming the secondary iex mechanism when inlet water sulphate concentration was increased the relationship remained linear r2 0 99 but sulphate release exceeded doc uptake fig 4b high one explanation is that total anion loading on the resin exceeded the manufacturer reported capacity of 0 8 eq l 1 for the high filter this was not observed in the low filter but has been observed in other research with high inlet sulphate unpublished data it is possible that the large sulphate affinity 0 99 eq eq in the high filter created a sulphate over loading during primary iex subsequently excess sulphate was released throughout secondary iex as total loading returned towards resin capacity fig 3b it is unclear how an over loading is possible with one explanation being greater diffusion of sulphate within the resin pores and solid structure due to the higher concentration gradient from the bulk in the high sulphate inlet water as described in eq 1 the switch from primary to secondary iex coincided with primary iex exhaustion it was hypothesized that the transition would be gradual as the primary iex counter ion availability approached zero rather the counter ion switch was abrupt once capacity was exhausted fig 3 this was likely due to the long ebct 20 min resulting in the entire filter sorption capacity near equilibrium it is therefore postulated that the driving force for the dominant ion exchange mechanism is electrostatic affinity and not a concentration based phenomenon with a long ebct such as 20 min all chloride ions will be released before sulphate becomes a counter ion 3 8 inlet water sulphate decreases doc removal increasing inlet sulphate concentration from 12 to 60 mg l 1 resulted in a 19 reduction in cumulative doc removal fig 5b but initially after 3 000 bv the filter was quite detrimentally affected showing up to 50 less doc removal with high inlet water although this subsided to 19 after 10 000 bv this is likely a result of the changing role of sulphate as either a co or counter ion the high filter exhibited greater sulphate affinity and reached primary iex exhaustion after only 750 bv while the low filter remained in primary iex beyond 3 500 bv from 750 to 3 500 bv sulphate was a co ion in the low filter and a counter ion in the high filter consider the secondary iex mechanism when the counter ion bulk concentration cso4 bulk is high then δcso4 is lessened resulting in reduced flux from eq 1 this would impact secondary iex high filter but not primary iex low filter due to the involvement of sulphate as a counter ion in the latter but not the former beyond 3 500 bv both filters underwent secondary iex ultimately relinquishing a 19 decrease in doc removal due to a five fold increase in inlet sulphate doc is a surrogate for a multitude of organic molecules with varying resin affinities depending on both the anion and the resin charged moiety harland 1994 tan and kilduff 2007 others have categorized it as doc1 with no resin affinity and doc2 or doc3 for fractions having less or more resin affinity than sulphate respectively where only doc3 is removable via iex fu and symons 1990 liu et al 2020 it is important to consider that these categories are fluid and that factors such as water matrix composition may shift resin preference this study did not explicitly characterize doc fractions but they can be useful to describe that a five fold increase in inlet sulphate concentration shifted the doc fractions by 19 in favour of doc2 and correspondingly decreased doc3 at low inlet sulphate there was a direct relationship between doc uptake and sulphate release fig 4b however at high inlet sulphate less doc was removed for each equivalence of sulphate released it is possible that the average charge density of the doc fractions contained within doc3 under the influence of high sulphate was greater than 10 2 meq g 1c resulting in an inaccurate charge balance on doc removed in the high filter future research could determine the charge density of doc fractions with more or less affinity than sulphate 3 9 minimal biological contribution to doc removal the majority of doc was removed through ion exchange while biodegradation provided only a minor contribution during secondary iex the release of sulphate accounts for the majority of doc removal especially for the low sulphate inlet waters fig 3b using doc measurements from the spent brine after regenerating a biex filter amini et al 2018 suggested biodegradation was responsible for up to 31 of doc removal an optimistic figure given that not all doc was extracted by the regeneration procedure other studies reported that biodegradation in bac filters was capable of 10 doc removal terry and summers 2018 while the present experiment did not directly monitor biodegradation it appears that the biological contribution to doc removal was less than that reported by others despite the minor contribution to overall doc removal biodegradation may have impacted doc concentration on the resin surface where biofilms would be situated it is hypothesized that biological degradation maintained the actual doc loading lower than was apparent from the anion balance qdoc resin act qdoc resin app in this case δcdoc would be maintained such that the flux of doc towards the resin were constant which may explain the linearity in doc removal fig 5a future works may distinguish the biological and abiotic contributions of doc removal as well as to better understand the mechanisms responsible for biological removal of doc 4 conclusions the present experiment investigated the long term

17082,biological ion exchange biex offers removal of dissolved organic carbon doc with greatly reduced regeneration frequency in the present work a strong base anionic exchange resin was operated without regeneration and using inlet water with either low 12 mg l 1 or high 60 mg l 1 sulphate and doc of 2 75 or 5 0 mg l 1 filters operated continuously for 226 days 16 500 bed volumes and achieved doc removal varying from 32 to 50 initially sulphate and doc were retained by the resin with chloride being released during this period doc removal occurred due to traditional mechanisms referred to as primary ion exchange following this initial period doc removal continued even though the conventionally defined resin capacity was exhausted based on chloride loading during the later period no chloride release was observed but instead sulphate was released although suggested by others the present study is the first to confirm the direct exchange in charge equivalence of anions removed doc and nitrate to released sulphate during the secondary ion exchange mechanism further increasing inlet sulphate from 12 to 60 mg l 1 resulted in a 19 decrease in doc removal finally percent doc removal was affected only by an increase of inlet doc but not changes to the counter ion or after doc loading on the resin increased to 1 3 of total capacity this work promotes biex as a viable alternative to

the bacterial oxidation of organic matter creates carboxylic and phenolic groups within the doc structure chen et al 2002 the carboxylic groups are deprotonated at environmental ph the pka of carboxylic acid is 4 2 giving doc an overall negative charge thurman 1985 doc decreases the aesthetic quality of water through the addition of colour taste and odour and can provide substrate for biofilm growth in water distribution systems sillanpää 2014 as well doc can decrease the effectiveness of treatments such as causing membrane fouling yamamura et al 2007 and interfering with uv disinfection alkan et al 2007 perhaps most importantly doc reacts with chlorine during disinfection and leads to the formation of disinfection by products dbps which have been linked to potential detrimental health outcomes such as bladder cancer and decreased birth weight bove et al 1995 kramer et al 1992 morris et al 1992 and so pre treatment is normally needed to remove doc before subsequent filtration and disinfection processes coagulation and sedimentation can remove large organic molecules but are less successful at removing smaller dbp precursors especially if overall turbidity is low randtke 1988 smaller doc is better removed by adsorbents through a combination of pre oxidation and biological treatment or by ion exchange amy et al 1992 rest et al 1983 purolite a860 is a strong base anionic resin with quaternary ammonium functional groups and a high affinity for negatively charged doc bazri et al 2016 anionic ion exchange iex involves the convective transfer

associated with the ordering of water molecules during anion removal from solution as well as an enthalpy proportional to the strength of electrostatic interaction between the surface and charged doc moieties for large doc van der waals forces may also be involved in non electrostatic removal harland 1994 during ion exchange a charge equivalence of counter ions are released for each equivalence of co ion removed fu and symons 1990 most often iex kinetics are limited by the diffusion of anions within the resin and its surrounding liquid film dixit et al 2018 due to a dependence on electrical charge gradients ion exchange is subject to competition between anions for electrostatic attraction to the resin ates and incetan 2013 boyer and singer 2008 this competitive effect is correlated to the charge density where sulphate shows greater affinity than monovalent nitrate dixit et al 2019 rahmani and mohseni 2017 while the removal of sulphate and nitrate readily occur before doc some doc can be removed in the presence of sulphate drikas et al 2011 tan and kilduff 2007 reported that high bulk sulphate concentration shifted resin affinity towards doc with fewer charged groups and higher mw relying more on physical adsorption and entropy sorption following a return to low sulphate doc with high charge density and low mw were again preferred iex resins typically become exhausted of chloride counter ions within days or weeks of operation and biofilm growth can lead to hydraulic head loss both contributing to declining performance regenerations using 10 nacl brine are recommended to restore iex capacity and decrease biofouling sillanpää 2014 however disposal of waste brine creates a challenge especially in small communities without developed wastewater infrastructure biological ion exchange biex is a new operational strategy for iex enabling high doc removal while minimizing the production of brine waste by reducing regeneration frequency iex runs beyond the regular chloride release cycle termed primary iex to gain advantage of a second cycle termed secondary iex which has previously been hypothesized to be controlled by sulphate release amini et al 2018

while standard iex regenerated every 336 bed volumes bv achieved 80 and bac only 7 amini et al 2018 a carbon mass balance estimated that biodegradation might account for up to 31 of doc removal amini et al 2018 a recent study reported somewhat lower doc removal of 29 36 for biex yet much greater than that by bac liu et al 2020 probably due to the high sulfate doc ratio found in the influent which was pretreated with alum while another recent study reported 50 doc removal over nine months and also the release of sulphate edgar and boyer 2021 these studies highlight the importance of sulphate as a competing counter ion questions remain regarding the mechanisms for long term doc removal during biex it is clear that sulphate plays an important role but sulphate competition during biex has yet to be described in the literature the present study sought to address the following knowledge gaps i if doc removal would remain constant following a step increase in inlet doc ii the detrimental impact of sulphate on doc removal and iii the role of counter ions during primary and secondary iex a better understanding of the doc removal is essential to understanding the capabilities of biex as a key treatment stage within a drinking water treatment train 2 experimental methods 2 1 source water water obtained from spanish banks creek vancouver canada was filtered with a 1 μm coarse cloth

thrice weekly 150 ml was collected from the outlet tubing over approx 45 min the exact collection duration and volume were recorded to determine the actual flow rate during each period inlet water tanks were sampled at every period the filters operated continuously for 226 days 16 500 bv from may to december 2019 the total feed of anions to the systems was nearly 1970 meq high sulphate feed or

hydraulic backwashes were performed approximately every month as required when the head loss exceeded the hydraulic head more frequently as the experiment progressed backwashes were performed manually using a squeeze bottle to force de ionized water backwards through the outlet hose the backflow velocity of de ionized water was sustained for about 3 bv approximately two minutes such that the resin

triplicate with the mean reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term doc removal the measured inlet and treated doc concentrations are given in fig 1a while figs 1b and 1c present corresponding uva and suva the use of humic acid for spiking doc created an increase in uva fig 1b from day 45 to 160 while the increase in inlet doc from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 on day 160 resulted in a similar increase to doc fig 1a the average percent doc removals for period 1 and 2 day 0 to 160 were 32 10 and 39 15 respectively for high 60 mg l 1 sulphate and low 12 mg l 1 sulphate filters during period 3 day 160 to 226 the percent doc removal increased to 48 5 and 50 4 with the higher inlet doc a paired t test found a statistical difference n 100 p 0 001 in percent doc removal between filters operated with high and low inlet waters data in table s4 3 2 step change in inlet doc following the step increase in inlet doc from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 on day 160 doc affinity increased significantly from 0 32

explain the greater doc flux towards the resin eq 1 an increase in the fraction of readily removable doc may have also contributed humic material can be characterized as humic or fulvic acids where humic acids have higher suva due to increased aromaticity while fulvic acids represent the smaller and less aromatic molecules rodríguez and núñez 2011 the inlet water suva decreased from 6 2 to 3 4 l mg 1 m 1 following the increase in inlet doc fig 1c considering 60 days before and after the step change since the doc removability increases at lower suva wang et al 2010 the lower suva after the step change could explain the greater doc removal in period 3 the change in inlet suva may be a result of spiking inlet doc with ha to 2 75 mg l 1 during the summer months when spanish banks creek doc decreased to 1 4 mg l 1 the impact of humic acid addition on doc characteristics is of note namely increasing the suva from 3 3 to 5 5 l mg 1m 1 fig 1c 3 3 anion loading and primary iex exhaustion fig 2 illustrates the sulphate concentration for inlet and treated waters while fig 3 presents anion loading a cumulative charge balance on resin bound anions in equivalence per litre of resin eq l 1 during period 2 inlet doc was spiked with humic acid the doc charge density was calculated using a concentration weighted average between 10 2 and 8 9 meq g 1 for spanish banks creek nom and ha flakes respectively as reported by bazri and mohseni 2016 for suwanee river nom and suwanee river ha table s1 elsewhere ha charge density has been reported at 6 5 meq g 1 at ph 7 ritchie and michael perdue 2003 through a sensitivity analysis this range of ha charge densities varied the total meq of doc removed by less than 5 and so the value of 8 9 meq g 1 was used for doc originating from ha spiking sulphate contributes the majority of resin loading during primary iex while the transition from net sulphate uptake to release coincided with chloride exhaustion fig s2 and can be called primary iex exhaustion primary iex exhaustion occurred on day 10 for the high filter 750 bv or 1 37 eq fed eq resin when considering doc sulphate nitrate and bicarbonate and day 45 3400 bv or 2 81 eq eq for the low filter at primary iex exhaustion doc contributed 2 resin loading in the high filter and 8 in the low filter nitrate was not seen to be significantly involved in iex by other works liu et al 2020 yet a small uptake of nitrate by the resins was seen in the latter half of this experiment the cause of nitrate uptake is unclear but it has been included in the anions removed calculations for secondary iex alkalinity tests on each sample did not show a statistically significant change between inlet and treated waters hence alkalinity has been omitted and nitrate is included in the secondary iex anions removed and from the total anion loading in fig 3 in the first seven days of the experiment there was uncertainty in the chloride measurements due to challenges in achieving steady state filter operation it is well established that at the conclusion of primary iex chloride loading on the resin should decrease to nearly zero boyer and singer 2008 fu and symons 1990 so chloride release during the first three samples one week was adjusted according to the amount determined in excess of the expected results after day seven 3 4 sulphate loading a linear relationship between sulphate removal and chloride release was observed during primary iex fig 4 a the high filter saw slightly greater sulphate release than chloride removal which is likely from an operational challenge during the initial seven days as discussed in section 3 3 rahmani and mohseni 2017 also noted fewer counter ions i e chloride released during primary iex when inlet waters contained high sulphate 1 mmol l 1 sodium sulphate as compared to inlet waters without sulphate for the present study non iex mechanisms and or biological degradation were also likely to contribute to doc removal during primary iex resin affinity for sulphate was 0 99 eq eq nearly complete removal for high and only 0 85 eq eq for the low filter table s2 eventually treated water sulphate matches and in fact exceeds the inlet concentration n 60 p 0 05 fig 2 during secondary iex there was a linear relationship between sulphate release and the combined removal of doc and nitrate for both filters fig 4b there was a near direct relationship between the anions removed and released i e the exchange ratio where the low filter had a cumulative exchange ratio of 0 93 but in the high filter sulphate release exceeded anion uptake and the exchange ratio was 0 57 edgar and boyer 2021 similarly reported an exchange ratio between 0 2 and 0 6 for non regenerated iex filters with inlet sulphate between 45 and 60 mg l while the cause of greater sulphate release remains unknown the present findings suggest the phenomenon is limited to waters with high inlet sulphate 3 5 doc loading doc loading increases steadily affected only by the step change in inlet doc concentration the slope of fig 5 a denotes resin affinity for doc as meq doc removed meq fed doc affinity is significantly greater for both filters during period 3 when inlet doc was increased from 2 75 to 5 0 mg l 1 slopes in table s2 statistical analysis in table s3 α 0 005 doc affinity was expected to decrease with the availability of ion exchange sites as well as the nature of the counter ions i e chloride counter ions during primary iex were expected to have been more readily exchanged than sulphate counter ions during secondary iex this was not observed and doc removal was unaffected by these changes it is possible that a fraction of inlet water doc is simply removed irrespective of resin loading when capacity remains or the counter ion doc3 as defined in section 3 8 as doc loading increased the flux of doc towards the resin jdoc was expected to decrease due to a decreasing concentration gradient δcdoc this was also not observed as resin bound doc increased to appreciable amounts representing 1 4 to 1 3 of total resin loading fig 3 the rate of doc removal was unaffected this may be due to the long ebct allowing for near equilibrium conditions and minimizing the impact of available capacity section 3 9 postulates an explanation involving biodegradation to maintain a constant apparent resin loading 3 6 sulphate to doc ratio the importance of inlet water sulphate concentration is evident more significant it appears that the ratio of inlet water sulphate to doc may be a predictor of filter performance and doc affinity fig 6 illustrates that doc affinity decreases as a function of the inlet water sulphate to doc ratio the doc affinities from this study were plotted along with values reported by liu et al 2020 amini et al 2018 and edgar and boyer 2021 during secondary iex the maximum doc removal predicted in the absence of sulfate in the influent is approximately 50 for each increase of ten to the inlet sulphate to doc ratio affinity decreases approximately 0 1 eq eq 3 7 ion exchange mechanism insights chloride release and sulphate uptake exhibit a linear relationship during primary iex and maximal sulphate loading correlates with the end of chloride release this supports the hypothesis whereby sulphate is exchanged for chloride as the dominant primary iex mechanism which is consistent with previous studies boyer and singer 2008 fu and symons 1990 during secondary iex sulphate release had a linear correlation to doc and nitrate uptake low sulphate inlet waters exhibited a direct relationship between sulphate release and the uptake of doc and nitrate this closes the anion balance and strongly suggests that doc displacing resin bound sulphate is the dominant doc removal mechanism during secondary iex this sulphate based secondary iex mechanism has indeed been proposed by others amini et al 2018 edgar and boyer 2021 liu et al 2020 but this is the first instance where a direct relationship has been reported when inlet doc increased after 11 500 bv the additional doc uptake is matched by increased sulphate release further confirming the secondary iex mechanism when inlet water sulphate concentration was increased the relationship remained linear r2 0 99 but sulphate release exceeded doc uptake fig 4b high one explanation is that total anion loading on the resin exceeded the manufacturer reported capacity of 0 8 eq l 1 for the high filter this was not observed in the low filter but has been observed in other research with high inlet sulphate unpublished data it is possible that the large sulphate affinity 0 99 eq eq in the high filter created a sulphate over loading during primary iex subsequently excess sulphate was released throughout secondary iex as total loading returned towards resin capacity fig 3b it is unclear how an over loading is possible with one explanation being greater diffusion of sulphate within the resin pores and solid structure due to the higher concentration gradient from the bulk in the high sulphate inlet water as described in eq 1 the switch from primary to secondary iex coincided with primary iex exhaustion it was hypothesized that the transition would be gradual as the primary iex counter ion availability approached zero rather the counter ion switch was abrupt once capacity was exhausted fig 3 this was likely due to the long ebct 20 min resulting in the entire filter sorption capacity near equilibrium it is therefore postulated that the driving force for the dominant ion exchange mechanism is electrostatic affinity and not a concentration based phenomenon with a long ebct such as 20 min all chloride ions will be released before sulphate becomes a counter ion 3 8 inlet water sulphate decreases doc removal increasing inlet sulphate concentration from 12 to 60 mg l 1 resulted in a 19 reduction in cumulative doc removal fig 5b but initially after 3 000 bv the filter was quite detrimentally affected showing up to 50 less doc removal with high inlet water although this subsided to 19 after 10 000 bv this is likely a result of the changing role of sulphate as either a co or counter ion the high filter exhibited greater sulphate affinity and reached primary iex exhaustion after only 750 bv while the low filter remained in primary iex beyond 3 500 bv from 750 to 3 500 bv sulphate was a co ion in the low filter and a counter ion in the high filter consider the secondary iex mechanism when the counter ion bulk concentration cso4 bulk is high then δcso4 is lessened resulting in reduced flux from eq 1 this would impact secondary iex high filter but not primary iex low filter due to the involvement of sulphate as a counter ion in the latter but not the former beyond 3 500 bv both filters underwent secondary iex ultimately relinquishing a 19 decrease in doc removal due to a five fold increase in inlet sulphate doc is a surrogate for a multitude of organic molecules with varying resin affinities depending on both the anion and the resin charged moiety harland 1994 tan and kilduff 2007 others have categorized it as doc1 with no resin affinity and doc2 or doc3 for fractions having less or more resin affinity than sulphate respectively where only doc3 is removable via iex fu and symons 1990 liu et al 2020 it is important to consider that these categories are fluid and that factors such as water matrix composition may shift resin preference this study did not explicitly characterize doc fractions but they can be useful to describe that a five fold increase in inlet sulphate concentration shifted the doc fractions by 19 in favour of doc2 and correspondingly decreased doc3 at low inlet sulphate there was a direct relationship between doc uptake and sulphate release fig 4b however at high inlet sulphate less doc was removed for each equivalence of sulphate released it is possible that the average charge density of the doc fractions contained within doc3 under the influence of high sulphate was greater than 10 2 meq g 1c resulting in an inaccurate charge balance on doc removed in the high filter future research could determine the charge density of doc fractions with more or less affinity than sulphate 3 9 minimal biological contribution to doc removal the majority of doc was removed through ion exchange while biodegradation provided only a minor contribution during secondary iex the release of sulphate accounts for the majority of doc removal especially for the low sulphate inlet waters fig 3b using doc measurements from the spent brine after regenerating a biex filter amini et al 2018 suggested biodegradation was responsible for up to 31 of doc removal an optimistic figure given that not all doc was extracted by the regeneration procedure other studies reported that biodegradation in bac filters was capable of 10 doc removal terry and summers 2018 while the present experiment did not directly monitor biodegradation it appears that the biological contribution to doc removal was less than that reported by others despite the minor contribution to overall doc removal biodegradation may have impacted doc concentration on the resin surface where biofilms would be situated it is hypothesized that biological degradation maintained the actual doc loading lower than was apparent from the anion balance qdoc resin act qdoc resin app in this case δcdoc would be maintained such that the flux of doc towards the resin were constant which may explain the linearity in doc removal fig 5a future works may distinguish the biological and abiotic contributions of doc removal as well as to better understand the mechanisms responsible for biological removal of doc 4 conclusions the present experiment investigated the long term

gradually improve and then reaching stability in long term continuous mode operation the removal rate of dissolved organic carbon doc of the ozone baf o3 baf and the ferrate vi baf fe vi baf systems was 83 2 and 82 8 respectively higher than that of baf alone 80 9 this increase was attributed to higher activity and content of microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems two uncultured bacterial species with high abundance of 7 2 21 0 and 2 24 22 31 in genus rehaibacterium and genus methyloversatilis were significantly correlated with doc removal and fluorescent organics removal respectively more research is needed to understand whether the species were new and their specific function this study provides valuable suggestions for extracting safe water from sgw with an efficient treatment train graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shale gas wastewater biologically active filtration ozone ferrate vi microbial community 1 introduction with the fast development of the shale gas industry associated shale gas wastewater sgw streams caused by hydraulic fracturing increasingly threaten water ecosystem and human health in 2016 6 million tons and 131 million tons of sgw were produced in the sichuan basin of china and in the united states kondash et al 2018 zou et al 2018 respectively sgw contains high concentrations of salt heavy metals microorganisms and refractory organics released from the shale formation or as chemical residue of compounds added to enhance hydraulic fracturing acharya et al 2020 chang et al 2019a effectively managing sgw produced from shale gas extraction has become an urgent environmental and engineering issue membrane technologies are usually considered as the most effective tertiary treatment for sgw but they require significant energy and face serious fouling challenges chang et al 2019a tong et al 2019 a limited number of studies has investigated hybrid systems that apply biological treatment to reduce membrane fouling and found that biological treatment processes can efficiently control fouling in ultrafiltration and nanofiltration riley et al 2016 furthermore cost effective biological treatment technology is regarded as a high potential treatment technology for sgw because the large amount of organics present in sgw is mostly biodegradable butkovskyi et al 2017 camarillo et al 2016 in the past few years aerobic granular sludge liang et al 2020 nicholas and cath 2021 sitterley et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a anaerobic granular sludge liang et al 2021 2019 membrane bioreactor abass and zhang 2020 frank et al 2017

et al 2017 riley et al 2018a 2018b 2016 and bioelectrochemical system feng et al 2020 forrestal et al 2016 2015 shrestha et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 2018b have been evaluated for sgw treatment baf exploits the biofilm attached to filter media to degrade and adsorb organics from the wastewater acharya et al 2020 limited research has shown that baf can remove organics 72 90 cod and 72 92 doc from six different sgw generated in basins of usa with varying salinity 10 5 31 2 g l tds and organics content 85 6360 mg l cod and 36 2170 mg l doc freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2016 the baf efficiency under different operating conditions aeration rate temperature empty bed contact time and type of activated carbon was systematically studied freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2018a 2018b however analysis of the microbial community composition and function in baf is still scarce concurrently the feasibility of baf in treating sgw needs further evaluation and the mechanism of pollutant migration and transformation in baf needs more detailed study at present the combination of ozonation and baf o3 baf has been widely used in water treatment because ozone can degrade refractory pollutants and improve the performance of the subsequent biological process gomes et al 2017 wang et al 2019b also biological processes can effectively remove ozonation by products this system has never been tested for the treatment of shale gas wastewater and its feasibility is still unclear for this application ferrate vi or fe vi has been also successfully used in water and wastewater treatment as a new type of green oxidant sharma et al 2015 the redox potential of fe vi is 0 7 2 2 v sharma et al 2015 the redox potential of ozone is slightly higher than that of fe vi in solutions of basic ph sharma et al 2015 similar to ozone fe vi can degrade refractory pollutants and improve their biodegradability nevertheless there are only a few studies on the combination of fe vi and biological processes li et al 2019 ma et al 2008 zhu et al 2006 ma et al 2008 found that fe vi 1 mg l pretreatment significantly increased the removal rate of codmn uv254 nh4 by baf in treating river water besides a simple comparison of fe vi baf and o3 baf showed that the codmn removal rate of fe vi baf was slightly lower than that of o3 baf and the nh4 removal rate of fe vi baf was much higher than that of o3 baf in general fe vi baf has shown interesting potential but a more systematic and comprehensive assessment of fe vi baf is needed especially in the treatment of sgw therefore the objectives of this study are to i evaluate the effect of fe vi and o3 pre oxidation on organics removal ii assess the effect of fe vi and o3 pre oxidation on the performance of baf systems iii analyze the composition and evolution of microbial community in such hybrid systems and explore the dominant and functional microorganisms iv comprehensively analyze the feasibility of fe vi baf in treating sgw compared with that of o3 baf 2 experimental section 2 1 water samples and water quality analysis sgw samples were collected from the changning shale gas play sichuan basin china due to the high turbidity 1000 ntu of sgw sgw was pre treated with coagulation sedimentation before the subsequent processing therefore the raw water in the article referred to the sgw after coagulation sedimentation aluminum sulfate was chosen as flocculant and the dose was 600 mg l according to our previous work shang et al 2019 the coagulation step was divided into three stages rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 1 minute then slow mixing at 40 rpm for 20 min and settling for 30 min shang et al 2019 the water quality parameters of sgw were summarized in table s2 of the supporting information si the methods for the quantification of dissolved organic carbon doc turbidity ph chemical oxygen demands cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total dissolved solid tds total nitrogen tn and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem can be found in our previous articles tang et al 2020a 2020b and in text s1 of the si 2 2 experimental setups and procedures of pre oxidation ferrate vi treatment was one of pre oxidation method the dosage of fe vi was 40 mg l the recrystallization method was used in this study to increase the purity of potassium ferrate k2feo4 to 90 li et al 2005 schreyer et al 1950 thompson et al 1951 fe vi solutions were prepared by adding solid k2feo4 to ph buffer 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm na2b4o7 10h2o ph 9 and used within 1 min fe vi solutions were most stable at this ph sharma et al 2013 the fe vi pre oxidation experiment was carried out at room temperature 20 c and ph 7 36 and consisted of three stages rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 2 min then slow mixing at 40 rpm for 20 min and settling for 30 min the supernatant was used as feed water for the subsequent baf process ozonation was another pre oxidation method the dosage of ozone was 80 mg l according to our previous work tang et al 2020b treatment of raw water by pre ozonation was carried out in batch experiment in each batch experiment 1 l raw water was added into a reactor and oxidized by ozone produced form ozone generator beijing tonglin co ltd china at desired flow rate before the subsequent baf treatment the residual ozone in water was quenched by water bath heating with 30 min at 50 c 2 3 experimental setup and protocol of baf tests the inner diameter and height of the baf reactor were 1 4 cm and 80 cm respectively the filling height of activated carbon cpg lh 12 40 calgon carbon co ltd usa was 45 cm and the filling mass was about 30 g the bed volume of the baf reactor was 0 07 l from the provided information of the company s website and vendors it was obtained that the particle size and iodine value of gac were 12 40 å 0 425 1 70 mm and greater than 950 mg g respectively in the baf column acclimation process microorganisms in shale gas wastewater were gradually enriched in activated carbon carrier through sequential batch influent and gradient dilution of raw water thus forming biofilm on activated carbon the acclimatization period was 42 days operation parameters and steps of baf column acclimation can be found in table s1 si a carbon source sodium acetate anhydrous was added to adjust the bod5 tn ratio to 3 5 1 of the raw water which might be beneficial to the growth of microorganisms zhang 2015 baf systems were operated in batch mode at influent flow rate of 0 14 l h and aerated at a rate of 50 ml min the volume of circulation feed tank was 0 55 l and 0 5 l raw water was changed every two days the corresponding data during the acclimation stage are summarized in fig s2 and fig s3 si it revealed that a stable biofilm was gradually formed and steady effluent quality was achieved during acclimation in the continuous mode baf systems the raw water pre oxidized by ozone or fe vi was used as baf influent to investigate the treatment effect of combined processes of ozone baf o3 baf and fe vi baf the raw water was also used as baf influent for comparison three baf systems were thus operated in continuous mode at influent flow rate of 0 014 l h and aerated at a rate of 10 ml min the backwashing frequency backwashing flow rate and backwashing time were 20 days 0 14 l h and 10 min respectively 2 4 analysis of biofilm on gac at the end of baf operation a certain amount of granular activated carbon gac samples were collected from each baf column to evaluate the activity relative concentration and growth of the biofilm on gac through measurement of the oxygen uptake rate our extracellular polymeric substances eps gac static adsorption and using scanning electron microscopy sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis gac samples were collected from 15 cm bed depth from the top a mass equivalent to 0 3 g gac was placed into a 150 ml conical flask on a magnetic stirrer the conical flask was then filled with raw water about 8 mg l dissolved oxygen a rubber plug with a dissolved oxygen probe was installed on the conical flask to ensure that there were no bubbles then the dissolved oxygen was measured as a function of time under stirring 400 rpm at 20 c the final result was expressed in mg of dissolved oxygen consumed per g of activated carbon per hour mgo 2 ggac h extraction and detection of eps which was defined as the sum of polysaccharides and proteins were conducted using the standard methods tang et al 2019 while the specific detection of polysaccharides and proteins was undertaken using the anthrone h2so4 and bradford methods frolund et al 1996 respectively static adsorption experiments were performed on new gac used gac and used gac after sterilization to distinguish the adsorption and microbial degradation in each baf systems a high pressure steam sterilizer was used to sterilize the used gac the operating temperature was 125 c and the sterilization time was 20 min in the static adsorption experiment at 20 c the dosage of gac was 2 g l the stirring speed was 400 rpm and the running time was 72 h reaction mixtures were withdrawn at specific time intervals to measure the variation of doc and uv254 gac samples were analyzed using sem fe sem regulug 8230 hitachi japan and eds x max extreme oxford instruments uk to detect physical and chemical changes on the gac surface and observe the morphology of biofilm gac was prepared for sem imaging by fixation with 2 glutaraldehyde dehydration in 20 100 ethanol and drying in a freeze vacuum dryer weber et al 1978 eds was applied in tandem with sem to map and evaluate the deposition of elemental content on the gac surface throughout baf treatment 2 5 microbial diversity analysis through the microbial diversity sequencing of the raw water the gac at the end of baf column acclimation and the gac at different times of continuous mode baf systems the temporal and spatial variation of the microbial community and the dominant functional microorganisms were analyzed details about microbial diversity sequencing and analysis are presented in text s2 of the si and in our previous study chang et al 2019b tang et al 2020a note that the same amount of gac was filled into the reactor after sampling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pre oxidation on water quality pre oxidation had a negligible effect on the doc parameter shown in fig 1 a the doc change upon fe vi treatment was 2 1 while that upon o3 treatment was 4 1 caused by the competing effect of organic matter mineralization and solubilization more explicitly pre oxidation only partly mineralizes the organic content which would translate into a decrease of doc values however this reaction simultaneously increases the solubility of suspended organic matter and promotes the release of intracellular organic substances from sterilized bacteria with the effect of increasing the doc tang et al 2020b besides we thought that the existence of a large amount of radical scavenging species e g halogen elements carbonate species and refractory contaminants in sgw was an important reason for the limited mineralization of organic matters achieved by o3 or fe vi coha et al 2021 tang et al 2020b in our previous study tang et al 2020b we found that high concentrations of br in sgw was scavenger in the ozonation process resulting in the low removal of organic matters and the concentration of bromate bro3 increased from below the detection limit 0 01 mg l to 11 7 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of bro3 in effluent of o3 uf ro combined process were 0 05 0 16 mg l and still posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecological environment because its concentration exceeded the limit value of drinking water standards 0 01 mg l in many countries and environmental quality standards 0 05 mg l in switzerland soltermann et al 2017 similarly fe vi also can slowly oxidize bromide forming bro3 reported in some researches huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 besides it would form more toxic brominated by products which also posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecological environment in oxidizing sgw by o3 and fe vi huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 therefore when considering the reuse of sgw by a combined process based on oxidation process attention should also be paid to whether the concentration of bro3 and brominated by products in the effluent exceeds the standard fig 1b presents that the uv254 removal rates by o3 and fe vi are 13 and 23 respectively as shown in fig 1c o3 and fe vi removed part of the cod 9 2 11 8 and most importantly increased the concentration of bod5 33 2 22 7 as well as the value of bod5 cod 47 2 39 6 suggesting that pre oxidation significantly improved the biodegradability of sgw the composition and relative content of fluorescent organic matters in sgw were obtained through fluorescence eem spectra and fri analysis method fig s4 and fig 1d chen et al 2003 the soluble microbial by product like matters region ⅳ and humic acid like matters region ⅴ were the dominant fluorescent organic components in sgw o3 had excellent removal effect on all kids of fluorescent organic matters 74 5 while fe vi only slightly removed fluorescent organic matters 9 4 mainly acting on soluble microbial by product like matters and humic acid like matters in summary the mineralization of organic matters by o3 or fe vi was limited while pre oxidation mainly changed the properties of organic matters combination with other oxidants such as h2o2 or with electrooxidation may further improve the oxidation efficiency and this was worth studying some interesting phenomena were found in gac static adsorption experiments of pre oxidized sgw in the first 24 h of adsorption the adsorption rate of doc in pre oxidized sgw was slightly lower than that measured in raw sgw as shown in fig 1f the same trend was observed for uv254 before and after ozonation fig 1g on the contrary the adsorption rate and equilibrium adsorption capacity of gac for uv254 in sgw treated by fe vi was significantly lower than that assessed in raw sgw the value of uv254 mainly represents the content of low molecular weight aromatic compounds acero et al 2016 wang et al 2020b this result might indicate that as this fraction of organic matter was removed more efficiently by fe vi than o3 fig 1b the affinity or the kinetics of adsorption for other fractions was higher upon oxidation with ferrate in general these tests suggested a complex effect of pre oxidation on organic content and composition also the data evidently indicate that pre oxidation would not translate into better water quality if followed by simple gac adsorption in the absence of microorganisms however the analysis of organic matter biodegradability upon oxidation suggests that the performance of baf systems may be improved compared to a raw water not subjected to this pre treatment step and this effect is discussed below 3 2 performance of baf o3 baf and fe vi baf the variation of doc and uv254 in three baf systems effluent measured during 60 days of continuous operation is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2b in the first 18 days of continuous operation the doc removal rate of the three baf systems was somewhat erratic with the water pre treated by fe vi oxidation showing the highest value with the operation and related strengthening of microbial activity the removal rate of doc in all three systems increased and reached stability at values around 80 specifically with rates that decreased in the order o3 baf fe vi baf baf similarly the removal rate of uv254 by three baf systems was more inconsistent during the initial stage of baf experiments and reached stability toward the end generally the uv254 removal rate of baf was the highest while that of fe vi baf was the lowest consistent with what reported in fig 1g for static adsorption tests however the efficiency of uv254 removal by fe vi baf was gradually improved during operation which may be attributed to the continuous enrichment of microorganisms overall the baf systems had high cod removal rates 90 7 91 4 fig 2c in particular the cod content in effluent from baf o3 baf and fe vi baf was 48 8 42 0 and 39 5 mg l respectively the turbidity 0 42 0 49 ntu of the effluents was also low fig 2d the composition and relative content of fluorescent organic compounds were measured in the effluents of the three baf systems on the 20th day 40th day and 60th day of operation and the results are shown in fig 2e and fig s4 baf systems efficiently removed fluorescent organic compounds and the removal rate increased gradually with the operation the soluble microbial by product like matters region ⅳ and humic acid like matters region ⅴ were the dominant fluorescent organic components in the effluents 3 3 biofilm morphology and microbial activity the results in fig 3 a and fig s6 indicate the presence of a large amount of microorganisms and of some microbial micelleons on the gac surface from the three baf systems the microorganisms were mainly bacilli cocci and filamentous bacteria clearly the microorganisms observed in samples from o3 baf and fe vi baf reactors were far more than those observed in the baf reactor as shown in fig 3b and c the our of microorganisms and the concentration of eps decreased in the order fe vi baf o3 baf baf corroborating that the activity of the microorganism in baf systems was higher upon pre oxidation guwy et al 1998 shi et al 2017 the adsorption performance of gac after long term operation in baf systems was always lower than that of the new gac as presented in fig 3d this result is rationalized with the larger density of available sites for adsorption on pristine gac in real operation the lower adsorption of biologically enhanced gac would be compensated by the concurrent degradation of organic matter which is the main target of this treatment interestingly sterilization of the gac used in the baf system without pre oxidation did not change its doc removal performance compared to the material analyzed after use and without sterilization on the contrary both the adsorption rate and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of sterilized used gac for doc were significantly lower than that of used gac from o3 baf and fe vi baf systems this analysis combined with the observations from fig 3a d suggests that microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems were highly functional and played an important role in the removal of organic matter this result is attributed to the better biodegradability of pre oxidized sgw which helped sustaining a healthier and more active microbial community in the baf systems 3 4 microbial community analysis the number of effective sequences operational taxonomic units otus alpha diversity indexes and rarefaction curves for microbial communities in raw water and three baf systems at different operation times are presented in table s4 and fig s8 the richness and diversity of microbial communities in raw water were higher than those in the three baf reactors the coverage values and rarefaction curves suggested the sequencing depth were sufficient fang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a through principal component analysis pca at otus level fig s9 the affinity relationships of microbial community between raw water and three baf reactors as well as among the three baf reactors are revealed the microbial community in the raw water was vastly different from that in the baf reactor at 0 day after acclimation process indicating new dominant microorganisms had been formed in baf reactors also the microbial communities in the same reactor at different times were similar and o3 seemed to have an effect in affecting more pronounced changes of the microbial community compared to ferrate pre treatment fig 4 a and b show in details the microbial community composition at the phylum and genus level respectively proteobacteria 30 4 actinobacteriota 18 1 bacteroidota 14 7 firmicutes 12 3 desulfobacterota 9 5 and synergistota 7 0 were the major phyla and constituted 92 of bacteria in raw water through acclimation proteobacteria 98 1 became the absolute dominant microbial phylum in baf reactors similarly the major genera in raw water which also were widely detected in sgw from shale gas wells cluff et al 2014 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 were norank f coriobacteriaceae 18 0 marinobacterium 8 7 lentimicrobium 6 0 roseovarius 5 0 and desulfovibrio 4 6 family coriobacteriaceae is an anaerobic fermentative bacteria within phylum actinobacteriota zhang et al 2018b marinobacterium is a strict aerobe microorganism capable of utilizing a wide range of carbon sources gonzález et al 1997 murali mohan et al 2013 lentimicrobium is a strictly anaerobic bacterium with the function of hydrolyzing organics sun et al 2016 wang et al 2020a almaraz et al 2020 reported roseovarius as an iodine oxidation bacterium which can promote the formation of large amounts of iodinated organic compounds that would cause serious negative implications to the water environment desulfovibrio as a sulfate reducing bacterium is widely detected in shale gas wastewater and is associated with the risk of corrosion to shale gas production facilities struchtemeyer et al 2011 suri et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 a large amount of relatively low abundance microorganisms were enriched upon acclimation with the major genus components being methyloversatilis 39 1 rhizobium 20 0 rehaibacterium 10 4 acinetobacter 6 3 pseudomonas 4 5 and acidovorax 2 9 during the baf tests the communities adapted differently based on the presence and type of oxidation pre treatment consistent with pca analysis the microbial communities in the same baf reactor at different operation times were similar although there were some differences in the microbial community structure of the three baf systems the core microorganisms were similar these were rehaibacterium methyloversatilis pseudomonas rhizobium porphyrobacter acinetobacter bosea roseovarius acidovorax and xanthobacter methyloversatilis is a salinity tolerant bacterium with the ability of denitrification and organics degradation lu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 rhizobium are typical denitrifying bacteria which widely exists in activated sludge soil and wastewater kinh et al 2017 nikolova and gutierrez 2020 tang et al 2020a genus acinetobacter is related to rich functions such as degradation of organics denitrification phosphorus removal and oxidation of heavy metals momba and cloete 1996 oberoi et al 2019 ren et al 2019 tang et al 2020c members of pseudomonas can degrade organics like toluene and chloroform liden et al 2018 some research shows that members of acidovorax could conduct heterotrophic denitrification willems et al 1990 yang et al 2018 in general sgw contains a large number of microorganisms with ability of degrading organic matter removing nitrogen and oxidizing heavy metals efficiently taking advantage of these microorganisms for biological treatment has great prospects in sgw management furthermore a large number of anaerobes were eliminated during baf acclimation process and new dominant microorganisms were formed with the variation of environmental factors aeration variation of tds and the addition of sodium acetate in order to determine the microorganisms with significant abundance differences between the three baf systems we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse method as shown in fig s10 9 bacterial clades presented statistically significant differences with an lda threshold of 3 4 each reactor had its own characteristic microorganisms whose abundance was higher than that of other reactors specifically norank o bacteroideres vc2 1 bac22 and norank f vermiphilaceae were enriched in the baf reactor without pre oxidation norank f rhodospirillaceae gemmobacter and rhizobium were enriched in o3 baf reactor instead dietzia roseovarius norank o gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and norank f rhodobacteraceae were enriched in the fe vi baf reactor the correlation analysis between microbial community at genus level top 50 and environmental variables organic matter removal rate is shown in fig 4c it was found that rehaibacterium with the high abundance of 3 0 21 1 was significantly correlated with doc removal rate p 0 01 in a previous study rehaibacterium terrae a thermotolerant and strictly aerobic bacterium was found in geothermally heated soil of rehai national park china yu et al 2013 rehaibacterium terrae can survive under the conditions of 0 30 g l nacl solution and 30 55 c and degrade some organics yu et al 2013 one species in the genus rehaibacterium was detected in our study but could not be defined the base pair fragments were different from those of rehaibacterium terrae this result might indicate that a new species of genus rehaibacterium was present with the strong ability of degrading doc of course more research is needed to study this hypothesis and to understand the new functions of this putative species mesorhizobium 0 01 0 20 were correlated with uv254 removal rate p 0 05 research studies reported that mesorhizobium members are halotolerant potential denitrifying bacteria and organics degrading bacteria luján facundo et al 2018 xu et al 2021 in addition labrenzia 0 01 1 29 magnetospira 0 01 3 04 and sm1a02 0 01 2 42 were correlated with cod removal rate p 0 05 bosea 0 75 3 58 and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae 0 02 1 25 were correlated with eem removal rate p 0 05 methyloversatilis 2 24 22 31 was significantly correlated with eem removal rate p 0 01 4 conclusions o3 and fe vi pre oxidation can effectively improve the removal efficiency of organics in baf which is attributed to higher activity and content of microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems compared with baf in our experiments the removal rate of organic matters by baf systems gradually increased and stabilized owing to the enhancement of the microbial degradation function with the enrichment of a large number of microorganisms with specific functions such as organic matter degradation nitrogen removal heavy metals oxidation for example rehaibacterium is significantly correlated with doc removal rate p 0 01 besides methyloversatilis is significantly correlated with fluorescent organics removal p 0 01 the oxidation behavior of o3 is different from that of fe vi but both processes can effectively improve the biodegradability of wastewater ozonation has feasibility and application value in the treatment of sgw already at this stage of its technological development compared with pre ozonation fe vi pre oxidation has the potential advantages of easy operation and maintenance but its application is still under development and should be optimized ma et al 2008 the in situ fe vi synthesis by wet chemical or electrochemical method in wastewater treatment facility is expected to further reduce the chemical cost ni et al 2020 it should be noted that the results presented here were obtained at the laboratory scale while further studies are needed to analyze the wide applicability and evaluate the feasibility of the relevant systems at the pilot and full scales in long term operation

17083,biological treatment technology is increasingly explored in shale gas wastewater sgw treatment owing to its cost effectiveness and requires efforts to improve its efficacy in this work ozone and ferrate vi oxidation pre treatment were evaluated to enhance the performance of the subsequent biologically active filtration baf in the removal of organic contaminants the oxidation improved the sgw biodegradability and organic composition under relative high salinity 20 g l due to the degradation activity of microorganisms the organics removal efficiency in the baf system was observed to gradually improve and then reaching stability in long term continuous mode operation the removal rate of dissolved organic carbon doc of the ozone baf o3 baf and the ferrate vi baf fe vi baf systems was 83 2 and 82 8 respectively higher than that of baf alone 80 9 this increase was attributed to higher activity and content of microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems two uncultured bacterial species with high abundance of 7 2 21 0 and 2 24 22 31 in genus rehaibacterium and genus methyloversatilis were significantly correlated with doc removal and fluorescent organics removal respectively more research is needed to understand whether the species were new and their specific function this study provides valuable suggestions for extracting safe water from sgw with an efficient treatment

shale gas industry associated shale gas wastewater sgw streams caused by hydraulic fracturing increasingly threaten water ecosystem and human health in 2016 6 million tons and 131 million tons of sgw were produced in the sichuan basin of china and in the united states kondash et al 2018 zou et al 2018 respectively sgw contains high concentrations of salt heavy metals microorganisms and refractory

found that biological treatment processes can efficiently control fouling in ultrafiltration and nanofiltration riley et al 2016 furthermore cost effective biological treatment technology is regarded

six different sgw generated in basins of usa with varying salinity 10 5 31 2 g l tds and organics content 85 6360 mg l cod and 36 2170 mg l doc freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2016 the baf efficiency under different operating conditions aeration rate temperature empty bed contact time and type of activated carbon was systematically studied freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2018a 2018b however analysis of the microbial community composition and function in baf is still scarce concurrently the feasibility of baf in treating sgw needs further evaluation and the mechanism of pollutant migration and transformation in baf needs more detailed study at present the combination of ozonation and baf o3 baf has been widely used in water treatment because ozone can degrade refractory pollutants and improve the performance of the subsequent biological process gomes et al 2017 wang et al 2019b also biological processes can effectively remove ozonation by products this system has never been tested for the treatment of shale gas wastewater and its feasibility is still unclear for this application ferrate vi or fe vi has been also successfully used in water and wastewater treatment as a new type of green oxidant sharma et al 2015 the redox potential of fe vi is 0 7 2 2 v sharma et al 2015 the redox potential of ozone is slightly higher than that of fe vi in solutions of basic ph sharma et al 2015 similar to ozone fe vi can degrade refractory pollutants and improve their biodegradability nevertheless there are only a few studies on the combination of fe vi and biological processes li et al 2019 ma et al 2008 zhu et al 2006 ma et al 2008 found that fe vi 1 mg l pretreatment significantly increased the removal rate of codmn uv254 nh4 by baf in treating river water besides a simple comparison of fe vi baf and o3 baf showed that the codmn removal rate of fe vi baf was slightly lower than that of o3 baf and the nh4 removal rate of fe vi baf was much higher than that of o3 baf in general fe vi baf has shown interesting potential but a more systematic and comprehensive assessment of fe vi baf is needed especially in the treatment of sgw therefore the objectives of this study are to i evaluate the effect of fe vi and o3 pre oxidation on organics removal ii assess the effect of fe vi and o3 pre oxidation on the performance of baf systems iii analyze the composition and evolution of microbial community in such hybrid systems and explore the dominant and functional microorganisms iv comprehensively analyze the feasibility of fe vi baf in treating sgw compared with that of o3 baf 2 experimental section 2 1 water samples and water quality analysis sgw samples were collected from the changning shale gas play sichuan basin china due to the high turbidity 1000 ntu of sgw sgw was pre treated with coagulation sedimentation before the subsequent processing therefore the raw water in the article referred to the sgw after coagulation sedimentation aluminum sulfate was chosen as flocculant and the dose was 600 mg l according to our previous work shang et al 2019 the coagulation step was divided into three stages rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 1 minute then slow mixing at 40 rpm for 20 min and settling for 30 min shang et al 2019 the water quality parameters of sgw were summarized in table s2 of the supporting information si the methods for the quantification of dissolved organic carbon doc turbidity ph chemical oxygen demands cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total dissolved solid tds total nitrogen tn and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem can be found in our previous articles tang et al 2020a 2020b and in text s1 of the si 2 2 experimental setups and procedures of pre oxidation ferrate vi treatment was one of pre oxidation method the dosage of fe vi was 40 mg l the recrystallization method was used in this study to increase the purity of potassium ferrate k2feo4 to 90 li et al 2005 schreyer et al 1950 thompson et al 1951 fe vi solutions were prepared by adding solid k2feo4 to ph buffer 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm na2b4o7 10h2o ph 9 and used within 1 min fe vi solutions were most stable at this ph sharma et al 2013 the fe vi pre oxidation experiment was carried out at room temperature 20 c and ph 7 36 and consisted of three stages rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 2 min then slow mixing at 40 rpm for 20 min and settling for 30 min the supernatant was used as feed water for the subsequent baf process ozonation was another pre oxidation method the dosage of ozone was 80 mg l according to our previous work tang et al 2020b treatment of raw water by pre ozonation was carried out in batch experiment in each batch experiment 1 l raw water was added into a reactor and oxidized by ozone produced form ozone generator beijing tonglin co ltd china at desired flow rate before the subsequent baf treatment the residual ozone in water was quenched by water bath heating with 30 min at 50 c 2 3 experimental setup and protocol of baf tests the inner diameter and height of the baf reactor were 1 4 cm and 80 cm respectively the filling height of activated carbon cpg lh 12 40 calgon carbon co ltd usa was 45 cm and the filling mass was about 30 g the bed volume of the baf reactor was 0 07 l from the provided information of the company s website and vendors it was obtained that the particle size and iodine value of gac were 12 40 å 0 425 1 70 mm and greater than 950 mg g respectively in the baf column acclimation process microorganisms in shale gas wastewater were gradually enriched in activated carbon carrier through sequential batch influent and gradient dilution of raw water thus forming biofilm on activated carbon the acclimatization period was 42 days operation parameters and steps of baf column acclimation can be found in table s1 si a carbon source sodium acetate anhydrous was added to adjust the bod5 tn ratio to 3 5 1 of the raw water which might be beneficial to the growth of microorganisms zhang 2015 baf systems were operated in batch mode at influent flow rate of 0 14 l h and aerated at a rate of 50 ml min the volume of circulation feed tank was 0 55 l and 0 5 l raw water was changed every two days the corresponding data during the acclimation stage are summarized in fig s2 and fig s3 si it revealed that a stable biofilm was gradually formed and steady effluent quality was achieved during acclimation in the continuous mode baf systems the raw water pre oxidized by ozone or fe vi was used as baf influent to investigate the treatment effect of combined processes of ozone baf o3 baf and fe vi baf the raw water was also used as baf influent for comparison three baf systems were thus operated in continuous mode at influent flow rate of 0 014 l h and aerated at a rate of 10 ml min the backwashing frequency backwashing flow rate and backwashing time were 20 days 0 14 l h and 10 min respectively 2 4 analysis of biofilm on gac at the end of baf operation a certain amount of granular activated carbon gac samples were collected from each baf column to evaluate the activity relative concentration and growth of the biofilm on gac through measurement of the oxygen uptake rate our extracellular polymeric substances eps gac static adsorption and using scanning electron microscopy sem combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis gac samples were collected from 15 cm bed depth from the top a mass equivalent to 0 3 g gac was placed into a 150 ml conical flask on a magnetic stirrer the conical flask was then filled with raw water about 8 mg l dissolved oxygen a rubber plug with a dissolved oxygen probe was installed on the conical flask to ensure that there were no bubbles then the dissolved oxygen was measured as a function of time under stirring 400 rpm at 20 c the final result was expressed in mg of dissolved oxygen consumed per g of activated carbon per hour mgo 2 ggac h extraction and detection of eps which was defined as the sum of polysaccharides and proteins were conducted using the standard methods tang et al 2019 while the specific detection of polysaccharides and proteins was undertaken using the anthrone h2so4 and bradford methods frolund et al 1996 respectively static adsorption experiments were performed on new gac used gac and used gac after sterilization to distinguish the adsorption and microbial degradation in each baf systems a high pressure steam sterilizer was used to sterilize the used gac the operating temperature was 125 c and the sterilization time was 20 min in the static adsorption experiment at 20 c the dosage of gac was 2 g l the stirring speed was 400 rpm and the running time was 72 h reaction mixtures were withdrawn at specific time intervals to measure the variation of doc and uv254 gac samples were analyzed using sem fe sem regulug 8230 hitachi japan and eds x max extreme oxford instruments uk to detect physical and chemical changes on the gac surface and observe the morphology of biofilm gac was prepared for sem imaging by fixation with 2 glutaraldehyde dehydration in 20 100 ethanol and drying in a freeze vacuum dryer weber et al 1978 eds was applied in tandem with sem to map and evaluate the deposition of elemental content on the gac surface throughout baf treatment 2 5 microbial diversity analysis through the microbial diversity sequencing of the raw water the gac at the end of baf column acclimation and the gac at different times of continuous mode baf systems the temporal and spatial variation of the microbial community and the dominant functional microorganisms were analyzed details about microbial diversity sequencing and analysis are presented in text s2 of the si and in our previous study chang et al 2019b tang et al 2020a note that the same amount of gac was filled into the reactor after sampling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pre oxidation on water quality pre oxidation had a negligible effect on the doc parameter shown in fig 1 a the doc change upon fe vi treatment was 2 1 while that upon o3 treatment was 4 1 caused by the competing effect of organic matter mineralization and solubilization more explicitly pre oxidation only partly mineralizes the organic content which would translate into a decrease of doc values however this reaction simultaneously increases the solubility of suspended organic matter and promotes the release of intracellular organic substances from sterilized bacteria with the effect of increasing the doc tang et al 2020b besides we thought that the existence of a large amount of radical scavenging species e g halogen elements carbonate species and refractory contaminants in sgw was an important reason for the limited mineralization of organic matters achieved by o3 or fe vi coha et al 2021 tang et al 2020b in our previous study tang et al 2020b we found that high concentrations of br in sgw was scavenger in the ozonation process resulting in the low removal of organic matters and the concentration of bromate bro3 increased from below the detection limit 0 01 mg l to 11 7 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of bro3 in effluent of o3 uf ro combined process were 0 05 0 16 mg l and still posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecological environment because its concentration exceeded the limit value of drinking water standards 0 01 mg l in many countries and environmental quality standards 0 05 mg l in switzerland soltermann et al 2017 similarly fe vi also can slowly oxidize bromide forming bro3 reported in some researches huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 besides it would form more toxic brominated by products which also posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecological environment in oxidizing sgw by o3 and fe vi huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 therefore when considering the reuse of sgw by a combined process based on oxidation process attention should also be paid to whether the concentration of bro3 and brominated by products in the effluent exceeds the standard fig 1b presents that the uv254 removal rates by o3 and fe vi are 13 and 23 respectively as shown in fig 1c o3 and fe vi removed part of the cod 9 2 11 8 and most importantly increased the concentration of bod5 33 2 22 7 as well as the value of bod5 cod 47 2 39 6 suggesting that pre oxidation significantly improved the biodegradability of sgw the composition and relative content of fluorescent organic matters in sgw were obtained through fluorescence eem spectra and fri analysis method fig s4 and fig 1d chen et al 2003 the soluble microbial by product like matters region ⅳ and humic acid like matters region ⅴ were the dominant fluorescent organic components in sgw o3 had excellent removal effect on all kids of fluorescent organic matters 74 5 while fe vi only slightly removed fluorescent organic matters 9 4 mainly acting on soluble microbial by product like matters and humic acid like matters in summary the mineralization of organic matters by o3 or fe vi was limited while pre oxidation mainly changed the properties of organic matters combination with other oxidants such as h2o2 or with electrooxidation may further improve the oxidation efficiency and this was worth studying some interesting phenomena were found in gac static adsorption experiments of pre oxidized sgw in the first 24 h of adsorption the adsorption rate of doc in pre oxidized sgw was slightly lower than that measured in raw sgw as shown in fig 1f the same trend was observed for uv254 before and after ozonation fig 1g on the contrary the adsorption rate and equilibrium adsorption capacity of gac for uv254 in sgw treated by fe vi was significantly lower than that assessed in raw sgw the value of uv254 mainly represents the content of low molecular weight aromatic compounds acero et al 2016 wang et al 2020b this result might indicate that as this fraction of organic matter was removed more efficiently by fe vi than o3 fig 1b the affinity or the kinetics of adsorption for other fractions was higher upon oxidation with ferrate in general these tests suggested a complex effect of pre oxidation on organic content and composition also the data evidently indicate that pre oxidation would not translate into better water quality if followed by simple gac adsorption in the absence of microorganisms however the analysis of organic matter biodegradability upon oxidation suggests that the performance of baf systems may be improved compared to a raw water not subjected to this pre treatment step and this effect is discussed below 3 2 performance of baf o3 baf and fe vi baf the variation of doc and uv254 in three baf systems effluent measured during 60 days of continuous operation is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2b in the first 18 days of continuous operation the doc removal rate of the three baf systems was somewhat erratic with the water pre treated by fe vi oxidation showing the highest value with the operation and related strengthening of microbial activity the removal rate of doc in all three systems increased and reached stability at values around 80 specifically with rates that decreased in the order o3 baf fe vi baf baf similarly the removal rate of uv254 by three baf systems was more inconsistent during the initial stage of baf experiments and reached stability toward the end generally the uv254 removal rate of baf was the highest while that of fe vi baf was the lowest consistent with what reported in fig 1g for static adsorption tests however the efficiency of uv254 removal by fe vi baf was gradually improved during operation which may be attributed to the continuous enrichment of microorganisms overall the baf systems had high cod removal rates 90 7 91 4 fig 2c in particular the cod content in effluent from baf o3 baf and fe vi baf was 48 8 42 0 and 39 5 mg l respectively the turbidity 0 42 0 49 ntu of the effluents was also low fig 2d the composition and relative content of fluorescent organic compounds were measured in the effluents of the three baf systems on the 20th day 40th day and 60th day of operation and the results are shown in fig 2e and fig s4 baf systems efficiently removed fluorescent organic compounds and the removal rate increased gradually with the operation the soluble microbial by product like matters region ⅳ and humic acid like matters region ⅴ were the dominant fluorescent organic components in the effluents 3 3 biofilm morphology and microbial activity the results in fig 3 a and fig s6 indicate the presence of a large amount of microorganisms and of some microbial micelleons on the gac surface from the three baf systems the microorganisms were mainly bacilli cocci and filamentous bacteria clearly the microorganisms observed in samples from o3 baf and fe vi baf reactors were far more than those observed in the baf reactor as shown in fig 3b and c the our of microorganisms and the concentration of eps decreased in the order fe vi baf o3 baf baf corroborating that the activity of the microorganism in baf systems was higher upon pre oxidation guwy et al 1998 shi et al 2017 the adsorption performance of gac after long term operation in baf systems was always lower than that of the new gac as presented in fig 3d this result is rationalized with the larger density of available sites for adsorption on pristine gac in real operation the lower adsorption of biologically enhanced gac would be compensated by the concurrent degradation of organic matter which is the main target of this treatment interestingly sterilization of the gac used in the baf system without pre oxidation did not change its doc removal performance compared to the material analyzed after use and without sterilization on the contrary both the adsorption rate and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of sterilized used gac for doc were significantly lower than that of used gac from o3 baf and fe vi baf systems this analysis combined with the observations from fig 3a d suggests that microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems were highly functional and played an important role in the removal of organic matter this result is attributed to the better biodegradability of pre oxidized sgw which helped sustaining a healthier and more active microbial community in the baf systems 3 4 microbial community analysis the number of effective sequences operational taxonomic units otus alpha diversity indexes and rarefaction curves for microbial communities in raw water and three baf systems at different operation times are presented in table s4 and fig s8 the richness and diversity of microbial communities in raw water were higher than those in the three baf reactors the coverage values and rarefaction curves suggested the sequencing depth were sufficient fang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a through principal component analysis pca at otus level fig s9 the affinity relationships of microbial community between raw water and three baf reactors as well as among the three baf reactors are revealed the microbial community in the raw water was vastly different from that in the baf reactor at 0 day after acclimation process indicating new dominant microorganisms had been formed in baf reactors also the microbial communities in the same reactor at different times were similar and o3 seemed to have an effect in affecting more pronounced changes of the microbial community compared to ferrate pre treatment fig 4 a and b show in details the microbial community composition at the phylum and genus level respectively proteobacteria 30 4 actinobacteriota 18 1 bacteroidota 14 7 firmicutes 12 3 desulfobacterota 9 5 and synergistota 7 0 were the major phyla and constituted 92 of bacteria in raw water through acclimation proteobacteria 98 1 became the absolute dominant microbial phylum in baf reactors similarly the major genera in raw water which also were widely detected in sgw from shale gas wells cluff et al 2014 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 were norank f coriobacteriaceae 18 0 marinobacterium 8 7 lentimicrobium 6 0 roseovarius 5 0 and desulfovibrio 4 6 family coriobacteriaceae is an anaerobic fermentative bacteria within phylum actinobacteriota zhang et al 2018b marinobacterium is a strict aerobe microorganism capable of utilizing a wide range of carbon sources gonzález et al 1997 murali mohan et al 2013 lentimicrobium is a strictly anaerobic bacterium with the function of hydrolyzing organics sun et al 2016 wang et al 2020a almaraz et al 2020 reported roseovarius as an iodine oxidation bacterium which can promote the formation of large amounts of iodinated organic compounds that would cause serious negative implications to the water environment desulfovibrio as a sulfate reducing bacterium is widely detected in shale gas wastewater and is associated with the risk of corrosion to shale gas production facilities struchtemeyer et al 2011 suri et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 a large amount of relatively low abundance microorganisms were enriched upon acclimation with the major genus components being methyloversatilis 39 1 rhizobium 20 0 rehaibacterium 10 4 acinetobacter 6 3 pseudomonas 4 5 and acidovorax 2 9 during the baf tests the communities adapted differently based on the presence and type of oxidation pre treatment consistent with pca analysis the microbial communities in the same baf reactor at different operation times were similar although there were some differences in the microbial community structure of the three baf systems the core microorganisms were similar these were rehaibacterium methyloversatilis pseudomonas rhizobium porphyrobacter acinetobacter bosea roseovarius acidovorax and xanthobacter methyloversatilis is a salinity tolerant bacterium with the ability of denitrification and organics degradation lu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 rhizobium are typical denitrifying bacteria which widely exists in activated sludge soil and wastewater kinh et al 2017 nikolova and gutierrez 2020 tang et al 2020a genus acinetobacter is related to rich functions such as degradation of organics denitrification phosphorus removal and oxidation of heavy metals momba and cloete 1996 oberoi et al 2019 ren et al 2019 tang et al 2020c members of pseudomonas can degrade organics like toluene and chloroform liden et al 2018 some research shows that members of acidovorax could conduct heterotrophic denitrification willems et al 1990 yang et al 2018 in general sgw contains a large number of microorganisms with ability of degrading organic matter removing nitrogen and oxidizing heavy metals efficiently taking advantage of these microorganisms for biological treatment has great prospects in sgw management furthermore a large number of anaerobes were eliminated during baf acclimation process and new dominant microorganisms were formed with the variation of environmental factors aeration variation of tds and the addition of sodium acetate in order to determine the microorganisms with significant abundance differences between the three baf systems we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse method as shown in fig s10 9 bacterial clades presented statistically significant differences with an lda threshold of 3 4 each reactor had its own characteristic microorganisms whose abundance was higher than that of other reactors specifically norank o bacteroideres vc2 1 bac22 and norank f vermiphilaceae were enriched in the baf reactor without pre oxidation norank f rhodospirillaceae gemmobacter and rhizobium were enriched in o3 baf reactor instead dietzia roseovarius norank o gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and norank f rhodobacteraceae were enriched in the fe vi baf reactor the correlation analysis between microbial community at genus level top 50 and environmental variables organic matter removal rate is shown in fig 4c it was found that rehaibacterium with the high abundance of 3 0 21 1 was significantly correlated with doc removal rate p 0 01 in a previous study rehaibacterium terrae a thermotolerant and strictly aerobic bacterium was found in geothermally heated soil of rehai national park china yu et al 2013 rehaibacterium terrae can survive under the conditions of 0 30 g l nacl solution and 30 55 c and degrade some organics yu et al 2013 one species in the genus rehaibacterium was detected in our study but could not be defined the base pair fragments were different from those of rehaibacterium terrae this result might indicate that a new species of genus rehaibacterium was present with the strong ability of degrading doc of course more research is needed to study this hypothesis and to understand the new functions of this putative species mesorhizobium 0 01 0 20 were correlated with uv254 removal rate p 0 05 research studies reported that mesorhizobium members are halotolerant potential denitrifying bacteria and organics degrading bacteria luján facundo et al 2018 xu et al 2021 in addition labrenzia 0 01 1 29 magnetospira 0 01 3 04 and sm1a02 0 01 2 42 were correlated with cod removal rate p 0 05 bosea 0 75 3 58 and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae 0 02 1 25 were correlated with eem removal rate p 0 05 methyloversatilis 2 24 22 31 was significantly correlated with eem removal rate p 0 01 4 conclusions o3 and fe vi pre oxidation can effectively improve the removal efficiency of organics in baf which is attributed to higher activity and content of microorganisms in o3 baf and fe vi baf systems compared with baf in our experiments the removal rate of organic matters by baf systems gradually increased and stabilized owing to the enhancement of the microbial degradation function with the enrichment of a large number of microorganisms with specific functions such as organic matter degradation nitrogen removal heavy metals oxidation for example rehaibacterium is significantly correlated with doc removal rate p 0 01 besides methyloversatilis is significantly correlated with fluorescent organics removal p 0 01 the oxidation behavior of o3 is different from that of fe vi but both processes can effectively improve the biodegradability of wastewater ozonation has feasibility and application value in the treatment of sgw already at this stage of its technological development compared with pre ozonation fe vi pre oxidation has the potential advantages of easy operation and maintenance but its application is still under development and should be optimized ma et al 2008 the in situ fe vi synthesis by wet chemical or electrochemical method in wastewater treatment facility is expected to further reduce the chemical cost ni et al 2020 it should be noted that the results presented here were obtained at the laboratory scale while further studies are needed to analyze the wide applicability and evaluate the feasibility of the relevant systems at the pilot and full scales in long term operation

17084,acetylacetone aa has proven to be a potent photo activator for the decolorization of dyes however there is very limited information on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar and the mechanisms of dye degradation by uv aa herein the photolysis of 65 aromatic compounds dyes and dye precursors was investigated at three ph values 4 0 6 0 9 0 by uv aa and uv h2o2 the obtained pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants k 1 were processed using statistical analysis the correlation between the k 1 values and the number of photons absorbed by aa together with the observed ph effect suggested that the protonated enol structure of aa plays a crucial role in the photodecolorization of dyes according to quantum chemical computation photo induced direct electron transfer between the excited state of aa and the dye was the main mechanism in the uv aa process qsar models demonstrated that the molecular size and stability were the key factors that determined the efficiency of uv h2o2 for dye degradation statistically the uv aa process was target selective and suffered less from the inner filter effect which made it more effective than the uv h2o2 process for dye degradation the selectivity of the uv aa process was mainly embodied in the substituent effects dyes with hydroxyl groups in conjugated systems decomposed faster than those with nitro substitution or ortho substituted sulfonate groups the results can be used for the selection of appropriate photochemical approaches for the treatment of dye contaminated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dyes photodegradation acetylacetone structure activity relationship 1 introduction large amounts of dyes are produced annually and are applied in the textile cosmetic paper leather pharmaceutical and nutrition industries hunger 2007 there are more than 10 000 commercially available dyes with an estimated global annual production of over 70 000 tons 15 of which is lost during the dyeing process zhou et al 2019 the treatment of dyeing wastewater is an environmental challenge because of the bio refractory and antioxidant properties of synthetic dyes oller et al 2011 over the past two decades advanced oxidation processes aops based on the generation of reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh have been proposed to remediate a broad range of organic pollutants garrido cardenas et al 2020 pignatello et al 2006 von gunten 2018 uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv ozone uv chlorine uv fenton and uv tio2 have attracted extensive research interest owing to the utilization of solar energy brillas 2020 wang et al 2020 2018 however the large conjugated structures strongly compete with photo activators for photons leading to severe inner filter effects wu et al 2017 in addition dyeing effluents usually contain a large amount of organic matter and inorganic salts which are effective scavengers of reactive species generated from the photolysis of activators rincon and pulgarin 2004 sarathy and mohseni 2007 wang et al 2020 therefore the practical application of most uv based aops in the treatment of dyeing wastewater is still limited because of the low light utilization efficiency and poor selectivity chong et al 2010 lang et al 2014 in our previous work uv acetylacetone aa was found to be capable of rapidly decolorizing dyes through a non free radical pathway liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 under otherwise identical conditions the uv aa process exhibited an unexpectedly higher efficiency than uv h2o2 liu et al 2014 a hypothesis regarding the higher uv aa process efficiency was that both dyes and aa absorbed photons to form exciplexes and direct electron energy transfer occurred in the exciplexes without the need for bulk diffusion zhang et al 2014 as a result decolorization was highly efficient and insensitive to free radical scavengers however it is still unclear how these complexes are formed and whether these processes are efficient in remediating other organic pollutants another study showed that the uv aa process had an obvious difference in the decolorization of acid orange 7 and rhodamine b liu et al 2014 compared with h2o2 aa was effective for the photodecomposition of carbamazepine oxytetracycline and tetracycline but ineffective for the photoconversion of chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2017 these results indicate that the uv aa process exhibits substrate selectivity however the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar in the uv aa process remains unclear the main objective of this study was to determine the structure activity relationship in the uv aa process for dye degradation to this end a set of aromatic compounds including phenol naphthol arylamine and their sulfonic acid derivatives which are common decomposition intermediates of dyes in the oxidation process tantak and chaudhari 2006 rauf et al 2011 and important precursors in the synthesis of dyes sabnis 2010 were investigated a dataset consisting of 50 water soluble dyes and 15 dye precursors was collected simultaneously at three ph values 4 0 6 0 9 0 with the uv h2o2 process as a reference system statistical analysis was conducted to understand the role of functional groups in the photodegradation of dyes by uv h2o2 and uv aa quantum chemical calculations were performed using density functional theory dft to elucidate the mechanism of the uv aa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sixty five aromatic compounds acs were divided into two major categories text s1 based on their conjugated carbon

precursors were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system dionex u3000 united states equipped with an agilent c18 reversed phase column 150 mm 4 6 mm 4 5 µm at 25 c and a

around the lamp the light intensity was measured using a radiometer equipped with a sensor with peak sensitivity at 365 nm photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china prior to irradiation the ph solutions were adjusted to the required value 4 0 6 0 or 9 0 with diluted hclo4 and naoh solutions the sample solutions were purged with highly purified n2 or n2o for 25 min prior to irradiation and then continuously bubbled during photo irradiation n2 purging was conducted to expel dissolved o2 from the solution whereas n2o was purged to scavenge the photogenerated e aq and h buxton et al 1988 the photodegradation of these acs in the three processes uv uv h2o2 and uv aa followed pseudo first order kinetics with r 2 values greater than 0 96 in most cases 1 dc dt k 1 c where c is the concentration of the target compound and k 1 is the pseudo first order photodegradation constant the integration of eq 1 led to a linear dependency of ln c 0 c on t with a slope of k 1 photolysis experiments for each ac were carried out at three ph values 4 0 6 0 and 9 0 all k 1 values are listed in table s2 the k 1 values of the azo dyes in the uv process were cited from our previous work zhang and zhang 2020 2 4 molecular descriptors the pk a values of the acs are shown in fig s1 s4 most of the hydroxyl groups in hydroxyazo could not dissociate pka 5 0 oakes et al 1998 pérez urquiza and beltrán 2001 to reduce computing costs the dominant species of the acs at ph 4 0 were used the initial structures of all the acs were built using the gaussian 09 software package frisch et al 2009 a total of 38 representative macro constitutional and micromolecular descriptors were selected based on previous studies table s3 cheng et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2020 some descriptors can be extracted directly from gaussian output files or calculated from a previous study ye et al 2017 the descriptors related to the molecular surface electrostatic potential were obtained from multiwfn lu and chen 2012 the details of the quantum chemical calculation method are presented in text s2 and the values of all the descriptors are listed in table s4 the optimal geometries of congo red crystal violet brilliant blue r erythrosin bluish and chlorophosphonazo iii were not found because of the complexity of their structures and difficulties in computation 2 5 data processing to be mechanistic reliable and predictive qsar models were developed using a sequential approach correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and multilinear regression mlr a correlation analysis was conducted to test for statistical relationships between descriptors and rate constants the variance inflation factor vif values were calculated to check for multicollinearity among the selected descriptors pca was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the descriptors into a low number of principal components which were a set of vectors representing the variance a stepwise mlr method was employed to investigate the relationship between k 1 values and the descriptors that were previously selected the resulting model was then validated by statistical diagnostics using the squared regression coefficient r 2 t test and fisher s exact test r 2 is a goodness of fit measure where a high r 2 value indicates a model with robust performance in addition we considered other performance criteria for the model 1 the significance level p 0 05 2 vif 10 and 3 f 16 in the fisher test luo et al 2017 statistically significant differences between independent groups were tested using one way analysis of variance anova all statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison between the uv aa and uv h2o2 processes the photodegradation rate constant k 1 values of 15 dye precursors and 50 dyes in the uv uv aa and uv h2o2 processes are summarized in fig 1 in the uv process the k 1 values of 75 dyes the upper quartile are lower than 0 01 min 1 while the k 1 values of most precursors are higher than 0 02 min 1 indicating that dye precursors phenyl and naphthalene compounds are easier to photolyze than dyes the addition of both aa and h2o2 significantly enhanced the photodegradation of acs p 0 05 compared with that in the control uv only however the enhancement effect of the dye precursors in the uv aa system was limited which was significantly weaker than that of the uv h2o2 system the median k 1 0 271 min 1 value for these precursors in the uv h2o2 system was approximately three times higher than that of the uv aa system 0 067 min 1 while for the 50 dyes the uv aa process showed excellent performance p 0 05 as shown in fig 1b the median k 1 value 0 080 min 1 is about two times that of the uv h2o2 0 037 min 1 the upper and lower quartile k 1 values were 1 7 and 3 3 times those of the corresponding k 1 values in the uv h2o2 system respectively these results show that compared with the uv h2o2 process the uv aa process was more efficient and target selective for the dyes the remarkable performance of the uv aa process for the treatment of real dyeing or tanning wastewater with high levels of auxiliaries salinity and chemical oxygen demand cod has been demonstrated in previous studies wu et al 2016a yang et al 2021 compared to the rapid decolorization the mineralization of dyes in the uv aa process was rather slow aa and its degradation products were highly bioavailable to the microbes and could be used as carbon sources by activated sludge wu et al 2016b yang et al 2018 the toxicity of the uv aa treated solutions was lower or comparable to that of the uv h2o2 counterparts yang et al 2018 therefore the uv aa process may be a promising approach in sequential chemical biological water treatment the effect of ph on the degradation of dyes by uv aa was examined at ph 4 0 6 0 and 9 0 as shown in fig 1c the uv aa process has similar effects at a ph of 4 0 and 6 0 while the degradation effect rapidly weakens at a ph of 9 0 p 0 01 aa has a pk a of 9 0 mofaddel et al 2004 and can undergo base catalyzed ionization in alkaline solutions leading to the formation of enolate mofaddel et al 2004 the observed ph effect in the uv aa process suggested that the photodecolorization of dyes can be attributed to the protonated species of aa which is consistent with previously reported results zhang et al 2014 fig 1d shows the ph stability of each dye in uv photolysis 88 of the dyes are acid or base labile k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 or k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 1 only 12 of the dyes are photo unstable under near neutral conditions k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 and k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 1 these results suggest that most dyes are more prone to photolysis under acidic ph 4 0 or alkaline conditions ph 9 0 than in near neutral conditions ph 6 0 generally acidic conditions are conducive to the oxidative degradation of pollutants in uv h2o2 systems xiao et al 2016 the reduction potential of oh gradually decreases with an increase in solution ph nosaka and nosaka 2017 on the other hand under alkaline conditions dyes are more likely to be deprotonated and negatively charged resulting in a dark color effect which leads to strong photon competition griffiths and mama 1999 van der schueren and de clerck 2012 however in the uv h2o2 system most of the k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 and k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 were concentrated around 1 adjusting the solution ph between 4 0 and 9 0 may have little effect on the degradation of dyes in the uv h2o2 system 3 2 selectivity of substrates the selectivities of the substrates are shown in fig 2 the uv aa process provides a remarkable degradation performance for the dyes especially for azo and aqn fig 2a the k 1 aa k 1 uv values of the 23 azo dyes were significantly different from those of the other compounds p 0 05 and the median k 1 aa k 1 uv value reached 23 although the sample size of aqn dyes was small the uv aa method increased the decolorization rate by more than 26 times uv aa was not as effective for the small precursors ben or nap as for dyes the k 1 aa k 1 uv values of eight ben compounds were less than 5 uv h2o2 treatment had similar effects on these acs with no significant difference fig 2b based on the substituents in the conjugated aromatic ring skeleton these dyes could be divided into electron donating substituents oh electron withdrawing substituents no2 halogens x and steric effect groups adjacent to the azo bond ortho so3 as shown in fig 2c the uv aa process is more likely to degrade the oh substituted dyes p 0 05 compared with the or ortho so3 substituted dyes the box line distribution of k 1 values of five no2 substituted acs in the uv aa process is discrete with no clustering information different from the uv aa process the uv h2o2 process has no functional group selectivity as expected fig 2d to further analyze the substituent selectivity of the uv aa process several azo dyes with similar structures were selected and are shown in fig 3 when a so3 group is adjacent to the azo bond ortho so3 acid orange 10 ao10 ponceau 4r the degradation performance of uv aa is relatively poor both of k 1 aa values are lower than 0 1 min 1 in the absence of ortho so3 acid orange 7 ao7 amaranthe bordeaux red the k 1 aa values increase by 3 5 times fig 3 indicating that the ortho so3 substitution is not favorable for the photodegradation of azo dyes in the uv aa process the range of k 1 h 2 o 2 values of these five azo dyes in the uv h2o2 process is 0 04 0 06 min 1 which is not sensitive to the steric hindrance of ortho so3 fig 3 besides ortho so3 no2 substitution mordant black 11 vs mordant black 17 mordant yellow 3r vs acid orange 20 on the conjugate aromatic ring also significantly inhibits the uv aa process fig 3 notably the substitution of no2 seems to be an unfavorable factor for various photochemical processes uv uv h2o2 uv aa fig 3 many studies have reported that the photo fading rates of azo dyes with different substituents are linearly related to the hammett constants giles and de bernat 1976 giles et al 1972 tripathi et al 2008 azo dyes with electron withdrawing substituents have high photo stability therefore the electron withdrawing no2 group strongly inhibits the photolysis of dyes oh is the main active species in the uv h2o2 system and has an electrophilic nature the presence of no2 weakens the electron density of the aromatic ring resulting in a low oxidation rate of the uv h2o2 process garcia einschlag et al 2003 luo et al 2017 in the uv aa system the presence of no2 might have interfered with the charge transfer process in the dye aa complex however the specific mechanism still needs to be explored dft calculations show that the presence of ortho so3 group destroyed the planar structure of the azo molecule leading to steric hindrance fig s5 this distortion may hinder the binding of the excited state of aa and azo chromophores resulting in the poor performance of the uv aa process 3 3 inner filter effect in uv based aops the photodegradation kinetics of the substrate depended on the number of absorbed photons and the quantum yield of the photo activator however the light absorbing ability of acs made them act as inner filters text s3 in the uv h2o2 system as the number of photons absorbed by the acs q acs increased the k 1 h 2 o 2 values exponentially declined k 1 h 2 o 2 0 38 exp 2 5 10 7 q acs r2 0 6 fig s6a in the uv aa system the internal filter effect is not obvious fig s6b in fact aa has a strong absorption in the uv region and the molar extinction coefficient at 274 nm is 1800 m 1 cm 1 which is approximately 300 times that of h2o2 wu et al 2017 the total photon absorption of h2o2 q h 2 o 2 accounts for approximately 0 5 of the absorption by dyes in the uv region while the total number of photons absorbed by aa q aa accounts for 10 50 fig s7 therefore under equimolar conditions aa can use more photons and is more resistant to the inner filter effect than h2o2 3 4 mechanism analysis 3 4 1 identification of critical structure of aa aa is a β diketone with two interesting structural isomers diketone and enol urbaniak et al 2011 in an aqueous solution owing to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water molecules aa exists mainly in the ketone form approximately 84 depending on the concentration and temperature spencer et al 1982 the photon absorption of aa q aa in the solution is mainly due to the π π transition of the enol structure because of the π electronic delocalization over the o c c c o pseudocycle squibb et al 2018 the correlation analysis indicates that the k 1 aa values of the dyes tam sna xan and azo have a positive correlation with q aa fig s8 the pearson correlation coefficients of hydroxyazo and sna were 0 70 p 0 05 and 0 86 p 0 03 respectively this strong correlation indicates that the key active species in the uv aa process is the excited state of the enol aa the photochemical and photophysical processes of enol aa in the gas phase have been studied extensively dolati et al 2016 poisson et al 2008 squibb et al 2018 verma et al 2014 upon excitation multiple pathways tautomerization isomerization and fragmentation that are highly sensitive to the environment are possible antonov et al 2019 dolati et al 2016 the intersystem crossing isc from the first singlet excited state 1 aa to the first triplet excited state 3 aa occurred with a much higher probability than the internal conversion ic from 1 aa to the ground state of aa chen et al 2006 therefore upon photoexcitation 3 aa is involved in photochemical reactions wu et al 2016b found that the photolysis quantum yield of aa at 254 nm фaa was 0 116 and the c2 c3 split reaction of the ketone form was the dominant step in aqueous solution the production of oh was negligible in the uv irradiated aa solution as indicated by electron spin resonance esr and scavenging experiments zhang et al 2014 therefore the excited state of aa might interact with the substrates through two pathways 1 direct electron transfer in the complexes formed by the excited state of aa and the substrate and 2 attack of free radicals generated by the cleavage of the excited state of aa it is difficult to directly explore the mechanism owing to the transient nature of the reaction thermodynamic calculations may be helpful in investigating the spontaneity of electron transfer reactions and the reactivity of free radicals 3 4 2 redox potential of radicals produced by aa the redox potential is an important basis for the theoretical analysis of electron transfer the single electron reduction potentials e 0 vs nhe of all the possible organic radicals generated by aa were calculated using the g4 smd method text s2 curtiss et al 2007 marenich et al 2009 as shown in fig 4 a compared with other radicals the methyl and acetyl radicals had negative e 0 values 1 16 and 1 10 v respectively which were close to those 0 98 and 1 07 v respectively previously reported in the literature fu et al 2005 when the radicals were captured by o2 the e 0 values of the formed peroxide radicals increased the highest e 0 value of these peroxy radicals was approximately 1 0 v indicating that the redox activity of radicals generated in the uv aa system was relatively weak the concentration of o2 in the aqueous solution was approximately 0 25 mm and the organic free radicals almost irreversibly reacted with o2 to generate organic peroxyl radicals at diffusion controlled rates von sonntag 2006 to evaluate the role of these radicals in the uv aa process the solutions of four azo dyes were saturated with n2 or n2o the reasons for the selection of the dyes were as follows first azo dyes constitute the largest and most important group of commercial dyes 70 and are widely used in textile dyeing leathering food processing cosmetics and paper printing tantak and chaudhari 2006 second because of the long term thermal and photo stabilities and water solubilities azo dyes are difficult to remove from effluents wojnárovits and takács 2008 finally the decomposed products of azo dyes are aromatic amines which are even more toxic and hazardous brüschweiler et al 2014 therefore considering their environmental significance azo dyes were the most representative as shown in fig 4b except for the weak inhibition of the photodegradation of ao7 n2 purging has little effect on the decolorization of dyes in the uv aa process the effect of n2 or n2o purging in the uv aa process is similar to that in the uv h2o2 process fig s9 these results indicate that o2 and peroxy radicals generated by o2 are not the main active species for the decolorization of azo dyes in the uv aa process 3 4 3 photo induced electron transfer photo induced electron transfer has been observed in self assembled donor acceptor systems with aa as a chelating ligand in dyad kercher et al 2002 under uv irradiation the electronically excited state of aa may form charge transfer complexes with dyes leading to subsequent reactions the possibility of electron transfer between aa and dyes was evaluated by the change in the gibbs free energy δg of the individual reaction as a sum of vertical electron affinity and vertical ionization energy text s2 considering that the excited enol form of aa might undergo various isomerization processes all three relatively stable forms open enol chelated enol and ketone of aa were considered in the quantum chemical computation the singlet and triplet vertical excitation energies of the three forms of aa were calculated using time dependent dft table s5 the first singlet excitation energy of enol aa was 4 25 ev 292 nm which was redshifted by 18 nm compared with the maximum absorption peak of aa solution at 274 nm the dipole allowed π π transitions s0 s2 the first singlet excitation energy of the other two structures was relatively lower 3 99 and 4 22 ev for chelated enol and ketone respectively the first triplet excitation energy of the three forms ranged from 3 13 to 3 66 ev o2 h2o ao7 ao10 and cyd were selected to evaluate the likelihood of a direct electron transfer as shown in table 1 the excited state of aa in the three forms would not transfer electrons to h2o reactions 1 2 11 12 the excited state of aa could generate o2 through an electron transfer to o2 reactions 4 and 14 although electron transfers between dyes and 1 aa were spontaneous reactions 5 10 the short life of 1 aa made it difficult to access dyes because of the isc process the spontaneous electron transfer between 3 aa and substrates seems to be related to the structures of substrates and the forms of aa the enol form of 3 aa could spontaneously transfer electrons to ao7 and ao10 as an electron donor reactions 18 and 20 or from cyd as electron acceptor reaction 15 the electron transfer between the ketone form of 3 aa and hydroxyazo dyes ao7 ao10 was spontaneous regardless of whether the ketone form of 3 aa was as an electron donor or acceptor reactions 17 20 these results indicated that photo induced direct electron transfer was possible in the uv aa system after the electron transfer anion and cation radicals of dyes were produced and underwent further degradation 3 5 model development pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the k 1 values in the three photochemical processes uv uv h2o2 uv aa and is shown in fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficient between k 1 aa and k 1 uv or k 1 h 2 o 2 is less than 0 5 with no significant correlation this result indicates that the degradation mechanism in the uv aa system is significantly different from that in the uv h2o2 system the correlation between all the descriptors and the k 1 values suggested that there were no descriptors with a significant correlation r 0 5 with the k 1 aa values while 15 of 38 descriptors had r 0 5 for the k 1 h 2 o 2 datasets table s6 in total 8 descriptors including the number of carbon atoms c double bond equivalence dbe number of carbon double bonds cc number of ring atoms ringatom number of non hydrogen atoms nonhatm molecular weight mw molecular surface surface and molecular volume volume which characterized the molecular size had strong negative correlations with the k 1 h 2 o 2 values the ionization potential ip energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and average polarizability α also had strong negative correlations with the k 1 h 2 o 2 values while the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo energy difference between the lumo and homo e gap and softness s had strong positive correlations after the correlation analysis pca was conducted to further reduce the dimensionality of the selected descriptors and to determine the most important variables for k 1 h 2 o 2 two principal components accounted for 91 4 of the total variance fig s10 component 1 was dominated by e gap and the descriptors related to molecular size the molecular size descriptors clustered together which may have caused redundancy in variability because of their statistical collinearity therefore e gap volume and dbe were selected to represent component 1 as they had a higher loading score component 2 was mostly dominated by e lumo and ip with the five descriptors i e e gap volume dbe e lumo and ip selected in the pca two qsar equations were obtained using the stepwise mlr method at ph 4 0 and 9 0 due to poor statistical performance dbe and e lumo were excluded from the mlr analysis the statistical criteria for a good model including r 2 f p and vif were met in the first equation table 2 indicating that the descriptors were not strongly correlated with each other the model at ph 4 0 had a relatively high goodness of fit r ph 4 0 2 0 52 unfortunately a robust and predictable qsar model could not be established for the uv aa system using the same method 4 conclusions low light utilization efficiency and poor target selectivity are two main bottlenecks in the practical application of the traditional uv based aops aa due to the π π transition of the enol structure was more effective for photon absorption than h2o2 the results in this work demonstrated that enolic aa with hydroxyl hydrogen played a key role in the photodegradation of dyes moreover a strong correlation was observed between the quantity of photons absorbed by aa and the degradation rate constant of dyes rather than decomposed through oh mediated reactions the degradation of dyes in the uv aa process was fulfilled by direct electron transfer within the exciplexes of aa with dyes therefore as compared with the classical uv h2o2 process the uv aa process suffered less from inner filter effect than uv h2o2 as a result the uv aa process was more target selective and consequently more stoichiometrically efficient for the degradation of organic dyes the complexity of composition is a typical characteristic of dyeing wastewater the structure activity relationship disclosed here is of great significance for the rationale selection and design of suitable processes for the treatment of complicated dyeing wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17084,acetylacetone aa has proven to be a potent photo activator for the decolorization of dyes however there is very limited information on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar and the mechanisms of dye degradation by uv aa herein the photolysis of 65 aromatic compounds dyes and dye precursors was investigated at three ph values 4 0 6 0 9 0 by uv aa and uv h2o2 the obtained pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants k 1 were processed using statistical analysis the correlation between the k 1 values and the number of photons absorbed by aa together with the observed ph effect suggested that the protonated enol structure of aa plays a crucial role in the photodecolorization of dyes according to quantum chemical computation photo induced direct electron transfer between the excited state of aa and the dye was the main mechanism in the uv aa process qsar models demonstrated that the molecular size and stability were the key factors that determined the efficiency of uv h2o2 for dye degradation statistically the uv aa process was target selective and suffered less from the inner filter effect which made it more effective than the uv h2o2 process for dye degradation the selectivity of the uv aa process was mainly embodied in the substituent effects dyes with hydroxyl groups in conjugated systems decomposed faster than those with nitro substitution or ortho substituted sulfonate groups the results can be used for the selection of appropriate photochemical approaches for the treatment of dye contaminated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dyes photodegradation acetylacetone structure activity relationship 1 introduction large amounts of dyes are produced annually and are applied in the textile cosmetic paper leather pharmaceutical and nutrition industries hunger 2007 there are more than 10 000 commercially available dyes with an estimated global annual production of over 70 000 tons 15 of which is lost during the dyeing process zhou et al 2019 the treatment of dyeing wastewater is an environmental challenge because of the bio refractory and antioxidant properties of synthetic dyes oller et al 2011 over the past two decades advanced oxidation processes aops based on the generation of reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh have been proposed to remediate a broad range of organic pollutants garrido cardenas et al 2020 pignatello et al 2006 von gunten 2018 uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv ozone uv chlorine uv fenton and uv tio2 have attracted extensive research interest owing to the utilization of solar energy brillas 2020 wang et al 2020 2018 however the large conjugated structures strongly compete with photo activators for photons leading to severe inner filter effects wu et al 2017 in addition dyeing effluents usually contain a large amount of organic matter and inorganic salts which are effective scavengers of reactive species generated from the photolysis of activators rincon and pulgarin 2004 sarathy and mohseni 2007 wang et al 2020 therefore the practical application of most uv based aops in the treatment of dyeing wastewater is still limited because of the low light utilization efficiency and poor selectivity chong et al 2010 lang et al 2014 in our previous work uv acetylacetone aa was found to be capable of rapidly decolorizing dyes through a non free radical pathway liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 under otherwise identical conditions the uv aa process exhibited an unexpectedly higher efficiency than uv h2o2 liu et al 2014 a hypothesis regarding the higher uv aa process efficiency was that both dyes and aa absorbed photons to form exciplexes and direct electron energy transfer occurred in the exciplexes without the need for bulk diffusion zhang et al 2014 as a result decolorization was highly efficient and insensitive to free radical scavengers however it is still unclear how these complexes are formed and whether these processes are efficient in remediating other organic pollutants another study showed that the uv aa process had an obvious difference in the decolorization of acid orange 7 and rhodamine b liu et al 2014 compared with h2o2 aa was effective for the photodecomposition of carbamazepine oxytetracycline and tetracycline but ineffective for the photoconversion of chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2017 these results indicate that the uv aa process exhibits substrate selectivity however the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar in the uv aa process remains unclear the main objective of this study was to determine the structure activity relationship in the uv aa process for dye degradation to this end a set of aromatic compounds including phenol naphthol arylamine and their sulfonic acid derivatives which are common decomposition intermediates of dyes in the oxidation process tantak and chaudhari 2006 rauf et al 2011 and important precursors in the synthesis of dyes sabnis 2010 were investigated a dataset consisting of 50 water soluble dyes and 15 dye precursors was collected simultaneously at three ph values 4 0 6 0 9 0 with the uv h2o2 process as a reference system statistical analysis was conducted to understand the role of functional groups in the photodegradation of dyes by uv h2o2 and uv aa quantum chemical calculations were performed using density functional theory dft to elucidate the mechanism of the uv aa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sixty five aromatic compounds acs were divided into two major categories text s1 based on their conjugated carbon

μω cm was prepared using a water purification system shanghai ulupure industrial co ltd china and used in the preparation of sample solutions 2 2 analytical methods the concentrations of dye precursors were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system dionex u3000 united states equipped with an agilent c18 reversed phase column 150 mm 4 6 mm 4 5 µm at 25 c and a uv detector with an injection volume of 10 μl additional details of the hplc analysis are listed in table s1 uv vis spectra of the raw and irradiated dye solutions were recorded using a double beam spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan the dye concentrations at ph 4 0 were detected using a uv spectrophotometer at the maximum absorption wavelengths dissolved o2 was determined using an hq30d apparatus hach usa 2 3 irradiation experiments irradiation experiments were conducted in 25 ml quartz tubes at 25 c the tubes were placed in a rotating disk photoreactor nanjing stonetech electric equipment china equipped with a 300 w medium pressure mercury lamp mp hg shanghai hongguang tungsten molybdenum technology co ltd a diagrammatic sketch of the photoreactor was reported in our previous work zhang et al 2018 the mp hg lamp produced a maximum light emission at 365 nm sample solutions containing 0 1 mm target compound and 0 5 mm aa or h2o2 were arranged in parallel in a quartz tube around the lamp the light intensity was measured using a radiometer equipped with a sensor with peak sensitivity at 365 nm photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china prior to irradiation the ph solutions were adjusted to the required value 4 0 6 0 or 9 0 with diluted hclo4 and naoh solutions the sample solutions were purged with highly purified n2 or n2o for 25 min prior to irradiation and then continuously bubbled during photo irradiation n2 purging was conducted to expel dissolved o2 from the solution whereas n2o was purged to scavenge the photogenerated e aq and h buxton et al 1988 the photodegradation of these acs in the three processes uv uv h2o2 and uv aa followed pseudo first order kinetics with r 2 values greater than 0 96 in most cases 1 dc dt k 1 c where c is the concentration of the target compound and k 1 is the pseudo first order photodegradation constant the integration of eq 1 led to a linear dependency of ln c 0 c on t with a slope of k 1 photolysis experiments for each ac were carried out at three ph values 4 0 6 0 and 9 0 all k 1 values are listed in table s2 the k 1 values of the azo dyes in the uv process were cited from our

pérez urquiza and beltrán 2001 to reduce computing costs the dominant species of the acs at ph 4 0 were used the initial structures of all the acs were built using the gaussian 09 software package frisch et al 2009 a total of 38 representative macro constitutional and micromolecular descriptors were selected based on previous studies table s3 cheng et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2020 some descriptors can be extracted directly from gaussian output files or calculated from a previous study ye et al 2017 the descriptors related to the molecular surface electrostatic potential were obtained from multiwfn lu and chen 2012 the details of the quantum chemical calculation method are presented in text s2 and the values of all the descriptors are listed in table s4 the optimal geometries of congo red crystal violet brilliant blue r erythrosin bluish and chlorophosphonazo iii were not found because of the complexity of their structures and difficulties in computation 2 5

correlation analysis was conducted to test for statistical relationships between descriptors and rate constants the variance inflation factor vif values were calculated to check for multicollinearity among the selected descriptors pca was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the descriptors into a low number of principal components which were a set of vectors representing the variance a stepwise mlr method was employed to investigate the relationship between k 1 values and the descriptors that were previously selected the resulting model was then validated by statistical diagnostics using the squared regression coefficient r 2 t test and fisher s exact test r 2 is a goodness of fit measure where a high r 2 value indicates a model with robust performance in addition we considered other performance criteria for the model 1 the significance level p 0 05 2 vif 10 and 3 f 16 in the fisher test luo et al 2017 statistically significant differences between independent groups were tested using one way analysis of variance anova all statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison between the uv aa and uv h2o2 processes the photodegradation rate constant k 1 values of 15 dye precursors and 50 dyes in the uv uv aa and uv h2o2 processes are summarized in fig 1 in the uv process the k 1 values of 75 dyes the upper quartile are lower than 0 01 min 1 while the k 1 values of most precursors are higher than 0 02 min 1 indicating that dye precursors phenyl and naphthalene compounds are easier to photolyze than dyes the addition of both aa and h2o2 significantly enhanced the photodegradation of acs p 0 05 compared with that in the control uv only however the enhancement effect of the dye precursors in the uv aa system was limited which was significantly weaker than that of the uv h2o2 system the median k 1 0 271 min 1 value for these precursors in the uv h2o2 system was approximately three times higher than that of the uv aa system 0 067 min 1 while for the 50 dyes the uv aa process showed excellent performance p 0 05 as shown in fig 1b the median k 1 value 0 080 min 1 is about two times that of the uv h2o2 0 037 min 1 the upper and lower quartile k 1 values were 1 7 and 3 3 times those of the corresponding k 1 values in the uv h2o2 system respectively these results show that compared with the uv h2o2 process the uv aa process was more efficient and target selective for the dyes the remarkable performance of the uv aa process for the treatment of real dyeing or tanning wastewater with high levels of auxiliaries salinity and chemical oxygen demand cod has been demonstrated in previous studies wu et al 2016a yang et al 2021 compared to the rapid decolorization the mineralization of dyes in the uv aa process was rather slow aa and its degradation products were highly bioavailable to the microbes and could be used as carbon sources by activated sludge wu et al 2016b yang et al 2018 the toxicity of the uv aa treated solutions was lower or comparable to that of the uv h2o2 counterparts yang et al 2018 therefore the uv aa process may be a promising approach in sequential chemical biological water treatment the effect of ph on the degradation of dyes by uv aa was examined at ph 4 0 6 0 and 9 0 as shown in fig 1c the uv aa process has similar effects at a ph of 4 0 and 6 0 while the degradation effect rapidly weakens at a ph of 9 0 p 0 01 aa has a pk a of 9 0 mofaddel et al 2004 and can undergo base catalyzed ionization in alkaline solutions leading to the formation of enolate mofaddel et al 2004 the observed ph effect in the uv aa process suggested that the photodecolorization of dyes can be attributed to the protonated species of aa which is consistent with previously reported results zhang et al 2014 fig 1d shows the ph stability of each dye in uv photolysis 88 of the dyes are acid or base labile k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 or k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 1 only 12 of the dyes are photo unstable under near neutral conditions k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 and k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 1 these results suggest that most dyes are more prone to photolysis under acidic ph 4 0 or alkaline conditions ph 9 0 than in near neutral conditions ph 6 0 generally acidic conditions are conducive to the oxidative degradation of pollutants in uv h2o2 systems xiao et al 2016 the reduction potential of oh gradually decreases with an increase in solution ph nosaka and nosaka 2017 on the other hand under alkaline conditions dyes are more likely to be deprotonated and negatively charged resulting in a dark color effect which leads to strong photon competition griffiths and mama 1999 van der schueren and de clerck 2012 however in the uv h2o2 system most of the k 1 ph 4 0 k 1 ph 6 0 and k 1 ph 9 0 k 1 ph 6 0 were concentrated around 1 adjusting the solution ph between 4 0 and 9 0 may have little effect on the degradation of dyes in the uv h2o2 system 3 2 selectivity of substrates the selectivities of the substrates are shown in fig 2 the uv aa process provides a remarkable degradation performance for the dyes especially for azo and aqn fig 2a the k 1 aa k 1 uv values of the 23 azo dyes were significantly different from those of the other compounds p 0 05 and the median k 1 aa k 1 uv value reached 23 although the sample size of aqn dyes was small the uv aa method increased the decolorization rate by more than 26 times uv aa was not as effective for the small precursors ben or nap as for dyes the k 1 aa k 1 uv values of eight ben compounds were less than 5 uv h2o2 treatment had similar effects on these acs with no significant difference fig 2b based on the substituents in the conjugated aromatic ring skeleton these dyes could be divided into electron donating substituents oh electron withdrawing substituents no2 halogens x and steric effect groups adjacent to the azo bond ortho so3 as shown in fig 2c the uv aa process is more likely to degrade the oh substituted dyes p 0 05 compared with the or ortho so3 substituted dyes the box line distribution of k 1 values of five no2 substituted acs in the uv aa process is discrete with no clustering information different from the uv aa process the uv h2o2 process has no functional group selectivity as expected fig 2d to further analyze the substituent selectivity of the uv aa process several azo dyes with similar structures were selected and are shown in fig 3 when a so3 group is adjacent to the azo bond ortho so3 acid orange 10 ao10 ponceau 4r the degradation performance of uv aa is relatively poor both of k 1 aa values are lower than 0 1 min 1 in the absence of ortho so3 acid orange 7 ao7 amaranthe bordeaux red the k 1 aa values increase by 3 5 times fig 3 indicating that the ortho so3 substitution is not favorable for the photodegradation of azo dyes in the uv aa process the range of k 1 h 2 o 2 values of these five azo dyes in the uv h2o2 process is 0 04 0 06 min 1 which is not sensitive to the steric hindrance of ortho so3 fig 3 besides ortho so3 no2 substitution mordant black 11 vs mordant black 17 mordant yellow 3r vs acid orange 20 on the conjugate aromatic ring also significantly inhibits the uv aa process fig 3 notably the substitution of no2 seems to be an unfavorable factor for various photochemical processes uv uv h2o2 uv aa fig 3 many studies have reported that the photo fading rates of azo dyes with different substituents are linearly related to the hammett constants giles and de bernat 1976 giles et al 1972 tripathi et al 2008 azo dyes with electron withdrawing substituents have high photo stability therefore the electron withdrawing no2 group strongly inhibits the photolysis of dyes oh is the main active species in the uv h2o2 system and has an electrophilic nature the presence of no2 weakens the electron density of the aromatic ring resulting in a low oxidation rate of the uv h2o2 process garcia einschlag et al 2003 luo et al 2017 in the uv aa system the presence of no2 might have interfered with the charge transfer process in the dye aa complex however the specific mechanism still needs to be explored dft calculations show that the presence of ortho so3 group destroyed the planar structure of the azo molecule leading to steric hindrance fig s5 this distortion may hinder the binding of the excited state of aa and azo chromophores resulting in the poor performance of the uv aa process 3 3 inner filter effect in uv based aops the photodegradation kinetics of the substrate depended on the number of absorbed photons and the quantum yield of the photo activator however the light absorbing ability of acs made them act as inner filters text s3 in the uv h2o2 system as the number of photons absorbed by the acs q acs increased the k 1 h 2 o 2 values exponentially declined k 1 h 2 o 2 0 38 exp 2 5 10 7 q acs r2 0 6 fig s6a in the uv aa system the internal filter effect is not obvious fig s6b in fact aa has a strong absorption in the uv region and the molar extinction coefficient at 274 nm is 1800 m 1 cm 1 which is approximately 300 times that of h2o2 wu et al 2017 the total photon absorption of h2o2 q h 2 o 2 accounts for approximately 0 5 of the absorption by dyes in the uv region while the total number of photons absorbed by aa q aa accounts for 10 50 fig s7 therefore under equimolar conditions aa can use more photons and is more resistant to the inner filter effect than h2o2 3 4 mechanism analysis 3 4 1 identification of critical structure of aa aa is a β diketone with two interesting structural isomers diketone and enol urbaniak et al 2011 in an aqueous solution owing to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water molecules aa exists mainly in the ketone form approximately 84 depending on the concentration and temperature spencer et al 1982 the photon absorption of aa q aa in the solution is mainly due to the π π transition of the enol structure because of the π electronic delocalization over the o c c c o pseudocycle squibb et al 2018 the correlation analysis indicates that the k 1 aa values of the dyes tam sna xan and azo have a positive correlation with q aa fig s8 the pearson correlation coefficients of hydroxyazo and sna were 0 70 p 0 05 and 0 86 p 0 03 respectively this strong correlation indicates that the key active species in the uv aa process is the excited state of the enol aa the photochemical and photophysical processes of enol aa in the gas phase have been studied extensively dolati et al 2016 poisson et al 2008 squibb et al 2018 verma et al 2014 upon excitation multiple pathways tautomerization isomerization and fragmentation that are highly sensitive to the environment are possible antonov et al 2019 dolati et al 2016 the intersystem crossing isc from the first singlet excited state 1 aa to the first triplet excited state 3 aa occurred with a much higher probability than the internal conversion ic from 1 aa to the ground state of aa chen et al 2006 therefore upon photoexcitation 3 aa is involved in photochemical reactions wu et al 2016b found that the photolysis quantum yield of aa at 254 nm фaa was 0 116 and the c2 c3 split reaction of the ketone form was the dominant step in aqueous solution the production of oh was negligible in the uv irradiated aa solution as indicated by electron spin resonance esr and scavenging experiments zhang et al 2014 therefore the excited state of aa might interact with the substrates through two pathways 1 direct electron transfer in the complexes formed by the excited state of aa and the substrate and 2 attack of free radicals generated by the cleavage of the excited state of aa it is difficult to directly explore the mechanism owing to the transient nature of the reaction thermodynamic calculations may be helpful in investigating the spontaneity of electron transfer reactions and the reactivity of free radicals 3 4 2 redox potential of radicals produced by aa the redox potential is an important basis for the theoretical analysis of electron transfer the single electron reduction potentials e 0 vs nhe of all the possible organic radicals generated by aa were calculated using the g4 smd method text s2 curtiss et al 2007 marenich et al 2009 as shown in fig 4 a compared with other radicals the methyl and acetyl radicals had negative e 0 values 1 16 and 1 10 v respectively which were close to those 0 98 and 1 07 v respectively previously reported in the literature fu et al 2005 when the radicals were captured by o2 the e 0 values of the formed peroxide radicals increased the highest e 0 value of these peroxy radicals was approximately 1 0 v indicating that the redox activity of radicals generated in the uv aa system was relatively weak the concentration of o2 in the aqueous solution was approximately 0 25 mm and the organic free radicals almost irreversibly reacted with o2 to generate organic peroxyl radicals at diffusion controlled rates von sonntag 2006 to evaluate the role of these radicals in the uv aa process the solutions of four azo dyes were saturated with n2 or n2o the reasons for the selection of the dyes were as follows first azo dyes constitute the largest and most important group of commercial dyes 70 and are widely used in textile dyeing leathering food processing cosmetics and paper printing tantak and chaudhari 2006 second because of the long term thermal and photo stabilities and water solubilities azo dyes are difficult to remove from effluents wojnárovits and takács 2008 finally the decomposed products of azo dyes are aromatic amines which are even more toxic and hazardous brüschweiler et al 2014 therefore considering their environmental significance azo dyes were the most representative as shown in fig 4b except for the weak inhibition of the photodegradation of ao7 n2 purging has little effect on the decolorization of dyes in the uv aa process the effect of n2 or n2o purging in the uv aa process is similar to that in the uv h2o2 process fig s9 these results indicate that o2 and peroxy radicals generated by o2 are not the main active species for the decolorization of azo dyes in the uv aa process 3 4 3 photo induced electron transfer photo induced electron transfer has been observed in self assembled donor acceptor systems with aa as a chelating ligand in dyad kercher et al 2002 under uv irradiation the electronically excited state of aa may form charge transfer complexes with dyes leading to subsequent reactions the possibility of electron transfer between aa and dyes was evaluated by the change in the gibbs free energy δg of the individual reaction as a sum of vertical electron affinity and vertical ionization energy text s2 considering that the excited enol form of aa might undergo various isomerization processes all three relatively stable forms open enol chelated enol and ketone of aa were considered in the quantum chemical computation the singlet and triplet vertical excitation energies of the three forms of aa were calculated using time dependent dft table s5 the first singlet excitation energy of enol aa was 4 25 ev 292 nm which was redshifted by 18 nm compared with the maximum absorption peak of aa solution at 274 nm the dipole allowed π π transitions s0 s2 the first singlet excitation energy of the other two structures was relatively lower 3 99 and 4 22 ev for chelated enol and ketone respectively the first triplet excitation energy of the three forms ranged from 3 13 to 3 66 ev o2 h2o ao7 ao10 and cyd were selected to evaluate the likelihood of a direct electron transfer as shown in table 1 the excited state of aa in the three forms would not transfer electrons to h2o reactions 1 2 11 12 the excited state of aa could generate o2 through an electron transfer to o2 reactions 4 and 14 although electron transfers between dyes and 1 aa were spontaneous reactions 5 10 the short life of 1 aa made it difficult to access dyes because of the isc process the spontaneous electron transfer between 3 aa and substrates seems to be related to the structures of substrates and the forms of aa the enol form of 3 aa could spontaneously transfer electrons to ao7 and ao10 as an electron donor reactions 18 and 20 or from cyd as electron acceptor reaction 15 the electron transfer between the ketone form of 3 aa and hydroxyazo dyes ao7 ao10 was spontaneous regardless of whether the ketone form of 3 aa was as an electron donor or acceptor reactions 17 20 these results indicated that photo induced direct electron transfer was possible in the uv aa system after the electron transfer anion and cation radicals of dyes were produced and underwent further degradation 3 5 model development pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the k 1 values in the three photochemical processes uv uv h2o2 uv aa and is shown in fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficient between k 1 aa and k 1 uv or k 1 h 2 o 2 is less than 0 5 with no significant correlation this result indicates that the degradation mechanism in the uv aa system is significantly different from that in the uv h2o2 system the correlation between all the descriptors and the k 1 values suggested that there were no descriptors with a significant correlation r 0 5 with the k 1 aa values while 15 of 38 descriptors had r 0 5 for the k 1 h 2 o 2 datasets table s6 in total 8 descriptors including the number of carbon atoms c double bond equivalence dbe number of carbon double bonds cc number of ring atoms ringatom number of non hydrogen atoms nonhatm molecular weight mw molecular surface surface and molecular volume volume which characterized the molecular size had strong negative correlations with the k 1 h 2 o 2 values the ionization potential ip energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and average polarizability α also had strong negative correlations with the k 1 h 2 o 2 values while the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo energy difference between the lumo and homo e gap and softness s had strong positive correlations after the correlation analysis pca was conducted to further reduce the dimensionality of the selected descriptors and to determine the most important variables for k 1 h 2 o 2 two principal components accounted for 91 4 of the total variance fig s10 component 1 was dominated by e gap and the descriptors related to molecular size the molecular size descriptors clustered together which may have caused redundancy in variability because of their statistical collinearity therefore e gap volume and dbe were selected to represent component 1 as they had a higher loading score component 2 was mostly dominated by e lumo and ip with the five descriptors i e e gap volume dbe e lumo and ip selected in the pca two qsar equations were obtained using the stepwise mlr method at ph 4 0 and 9 0 due to poor statistical performance dbe and e lumo were excluded from the mlr analysis the statistical criteria for a good model including r 2 f p and vif were met in the first equation table 2 indicating that the descriptors were not strongly correlated with each other the model at ph 4 0 had a relatively high goodness of fit r ph 4 0 2 0 52 unfortunately a robust and predictable qsar model could not be established for the uv aa system using the same method 4 conclusions low light utilization efficiency and poor target selectivity are two main bottlenecks in the practical application of the traditional uv based aops aa due to the π π transition of the enol structure was more effective for photon absorption than h2o2 the results in this work demonstrated that enolic aa with hydroxyl hydrogen played a key role in the photodegradation of dyes moreover a strong correlation was observed between the quantity of photons absorbed by aa and the degradation rate constant of dyes rather than decomposed through oh mediated reactions the degradation of dyes in the uv aa process was fulfilled by direct electron transfer within the exciplexes of aa with dyes therefore as compared with the classical uv h2o2 process the uv aa process suffered less from inner filter effect than uv h2o2 as a result the uv aa process was more target selective and consequently more stoichiometrically efficient for the degradation of organic dyes the complexity of composition is a typical characteristic of dyeing wastewater the structure activity relationship disclosed here is of great significance for the rationale selection and design of suitable processes for the
