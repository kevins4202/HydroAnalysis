10545,δ 18o δd 3h chlorofluorocarbon cfc and hydrogeochemical parameters were investigated to evaluate factors controlling nitrate levels in groundwater in an agricultural basin with steep topographic gradients groundwater is predominantly recharged from mountainous terrain toward the bottom of the basin cultivation of chinese cabbage and radish as highland summer crops is widespread in the vegetable fields supported by heavy application of chemical fertilizers the nitrate concentration was low 0 02 6 8 mg l as no3 n in rice paddies of the northern region and high 2 0 15 2 mg l as no3 n in vegetable fields of the southeastern region the δd and δ 18o values of water samples ranged from 79 9 to 60 5 and from 10 6 to 7 7 respectively in the study area water stable isotopes showed that recharge occurs mainly from local precipitation and evaporation signatures were observed in the rice paddies the apparent groundwater ages determined from cfcs ranged from 20 to 54 years older and more mineralized groundwater was observed in the discharge zone of the downgradient area while young groundwater was found in the recharge zone of the northern region indicating greater vulnerability to contamination elevated nitrate concentrations 6 8 8 5 mg l as no3 n in some old groundwater in the vegetable fields of the southeastern region may be due to binary mixing of old stagnant water and newly recharged water as identified by comparing 3h and cfc 113 with cfc 12 levels groundwater in the rice paddies had lower nitrate concentration and higher concentrations of hco3 fe and mn indicating denitrification under reducing conditions principal component analysis revealed four major processes controlling groundwater flow and chemistry agricultural contamination under reducing conditions in the vegetable fields occurrence of old groundwater under reducing conditions and denitrification in the rice paddies these results suggest that management of nitrate sources is needed to alleviate nitrate contamination particularly in the vegetable fields of both upgradient and downgradient areas with fast infiltration high fertilizer usage and low natural attenuation of nitrate

most widely used multivariate statistical methods transforms a set of observed variables into a smaller group of principal components pcs that can explain the total variance of the observed data pca has been applied in many studies to evaluate the hydrological and chemical processes controlling variation in measured variables and the relationships of these processes with samples schot and van der wal 1992 voutsis et al 2015 geochemical processes such as chemical weathering salinization and nitrate contamination in agricultural areas have been identified using pca to analyze the major element chemistry of groundwater koh et al 2007b the impacts of groundwater quality on crop yields and groundwater suitability for irrigation have also been studied using pca srivastava 2019 however few studies have combined environmental tracer data with a statistical approach to unravel groundwater recharge patterns and geochemical processes related to nitrate contamination of groundwater the area considered in the present study yanggu korea has been intensively studied due to the heavy use of irrigation water and fertilizers to support increased agricultural production in mountainous areas 400 m asl shin 2006 bartsch et al 2013 shope 2016 jang et al 2017 excessive fertilizer has been applied in this area to compensate for soil loss due to the high erosion rate of the sandy soil by monsoon driven extreme rain events and thus high nitrate concentrations in groundwater have been observed bartsch et al 2013 kettering et al 2013 reza et al 2016 the study area is a sub catchment of the lake soyang watershed which is a major drinking water reservoir for the 20 million residents of seoul kim et al 2015 suarez et al 2019 for this reason it is essential to evaluate the recharge pattern of groundwater and identify factors affecting the fate of nitrate so that the water quality of the soyang reservoir can be monitored we investigated the recharge processes of groundwater and the factors affecting the spatial distribution of nitrate in the mountainous highland area with a focus on two types of cultivated land vegetable fields and rice paddies both of which have excessive use of fertilizers and irrigation water a multivariate statistical approach was employed to evaluate the combined effects of groundwater recharge and hydrogeochemical conditions on the spatial distribution and transformation processes of nitrate in the basin by integrating measured hydrochemical and isotopic parameters with groundwater age 2 methods 2 1 study area haean basin is located in yanggu gangwon province fig 1 the study area is approximately 64 km2 and is surrounded by high mountains with an altitude range from 339 m at the center to 1320 m asl at the mountainous edge fig 1 precambrian metamorphic rock is located around the outside of the basin and jurassic biotite granite is found at the center of the basin hydraulic conductivity ranges from 4 94 10 5 to 1 0 10 3 cm s 1 kim et al 2015 average precipitation is 1577 mm 70 of which occurs during the wet season from june to august the mean annual air temperature maat measured at the haean meteorological station from 2000 to 2013 was 8 6 c which is significantly lower than the typical maat range of 10 15 c in mainland south korea korea meteorological agency groundwater is recharged predominantly in the mountain area and then flows toward the center of the basin recharged groundwater is drained through three streams the dosol seonghwan and mandae which converge into mandae stream in the eastern part of the study area kim et al 2015 most wells in the downgradient area are located on 414 442 m in the southeastern part and wells in the upgradient area located on 444 589 m in the northern part most groundwater wells are screened over a depth of 10 15 m and have diameters ranging from 5 to 20 cm depth to the water table was from 1 1 8 0 m average 3 3 m in the dry season and 0 8 5 5 m average 2 7 m in the wet season table 1 land uses in the study area are forest vegetable fields rice paddy fields and fruit fields with areal proportions of 58 0 27 6 11 4 and 0 5 respectively chinese cabbage radish potato and soybean are the main crops cultivated in the vegetable fields from spring to fall kim et al 2015 thus chemical fertilizers are multiple applications and a lot of water is needed for irrigation at the vegetable fields nitrogen fertilization level for each crop in the study area is shown in table 2 gwares 2004 2006 kettering et al 2013 chinese cabbages and radishes need irrigation water with 100 m3 ha day in the highland area at the heading stage national institute of crop science 2015 2 2 chemical and isotopic analyses water samples were collected in 20 wells and stream in june and september

well volumes of water were purged to allow field parameters to stabilize water samples for cations and anions were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the δ 18o and δd of water were analyzed at the korea basic science institute using a vg prism ii stable isotope mass spectrometer results are expressed as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water the precision is 0 1 for δ 18o and

analyzed to determine the tritium concentration with a detection limit of 0 6 tu yoon et al 2007 groundwater samples for cfc analyses were collected in triplicate using 125 ml glass bottles sealed with aluminum lined caps cfcs were analyzed at kigam using purge and trap gas chromatography with an electron capture detector with the analytical uncertainty less than 5 koh et al 2007a 2 3 principal component analysis pca is generally used to reduce the dimension of data with correlated variables by categorizing the variables into new groups that show linear relations with the original data jolliffe 2002 in this study the variables used for pca were groundwater mean residence time no3 n fe mn hco3 δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 do ec ca mg na so4 cl k si and orp most variables except δ 18o h2o δd h2o δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 groundwater age orp and ph were logarithmically transformed and standardized as z scores to reduce interpretation errors caused by differences in data dimension some elements with concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to have values of half the detection limit pca was performed using spss eigenvalues greater than 1 were selected as pcs to explain the variance varimax rotation was applied to simplify the relationship between the variables and some pcs among the samples y 20 was excluded from statistical analyses due to exceptionally high concentrations of fe mn and hco3 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical and stable isotopic indicators in groundwater the nitrate concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 2 15 2 mg l 1 as no3 n in the study area kim et al 2015 groundwater at the center of the basin was characterized by relatively high nitrate concentrations whereas that in the northern region had lower nitrate concentrations kim et al 2015 the northern region showed lower nitrate concentrations as many rice paddy fields with poor drainage are located in this area fig 1 nitrogen sources related to agriculture are a major factor driving the level of nitrate in groundwater nitrogen loadings differ considerably for vegetable fields and rice paddies the major crops in the study area in gangwon province vegetables are grown as highland summer crops which are more heavily fertilized in terms of both the recommended and actual applied levels compared to rice which is mostly grown in paddy fields gwares 2004 2006 kettering et al 2013 considerable excess fertilization of vegetables such as chinese cabbage and potato table 2 causes this difference groundwater in vegetable fields was oxic as do was greater than 2 mg l 1 and showed weak correlations with the concentrations of hco3 fe and mn by contrast do in groundwater was less than 2 mg l 1 in paddy fields and the no3 n concentration showed a strong correlation with the concentrations of hco3 fe and mn suggesting that nitrate was denitrified under anaerobic conditions fig 2 to more objectively evaluate the redox conditions of groundwater major redox processes were estimated using the criteria established by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 relatively high levels of do were observed in wells showing signatures of reducing conditions in the study area which can be attributed to groundwater mixing in domestic wells due to the well conditions the original do threshold of 0 5 mg l 1 was increased to 2 mg l 1 application of this procedure with the measured concentrations of redox sensitive species revealed that the predominant redox conditions are oxic and favorable for no3 reduction in similar proportions while two wells y 20 and y 23 were favorable for fe iii reduction overall half of the wells had reducing conditions indicating that the extent of anoxic groundwater is considerable and denitrification is highly plausible in half of the wells in the study area on the other hand strongly reducing conditions are limited because concentrations of dissolved fe are fairly low 0 3 mg l 1 except at y 20 and y 13 and measurable do 1 mg l 1 was observed in most wells stable isotopes of water were used to determine the origin and recharge pathways of groundwater in the study area fig 3 depleted δ 18o and δd values of groundwater align along two seasonal local meteoric water lines lmwl as defined by lee and lee 1999 with significant scattering suggesting that groundwater recharge is mainly derived from variable contributions in the dry and wet seasons park et al 2006 δ 18o and δd values of groundwater were also affected by topographic elevation depleted δ 18o and δd values were associated with wells at higher elevation including y 10 y 15 and y 16 enriched δ 18o and δd were observed in some samples such as y 13 and y 33 at lower elevations and in paddy fields indicating the effects of evaporation a local evaporation line for groundwater in paddy fields had a considerably lower slope of 5 2 compared to 7 9 for the lmwl during the wet season suggesting that groundwater recharge in the paddy fields was significantly influenced by water impounded during the rice growing season from late spring to summer koh et al 2010 the stable isotopic composition of stream water was similar to that of groundwater at high elevations indicating that the stream is fed by groundwater recharged in the mountainous area 3 2 apparent ages and mixing of groundwater apparent cfc ages were determined following the procedures of plummer and bunsenberg 2000 and koh et al 2006 using north american air curves for cfcs as local excess of atmospheric cfcs is unlikely in the study area the measured groundwater temperature and elevation of the wells were used for the recharge temperature and recharge elevation to determine the apparent cfc groundwater ages while considering the uncertainty in recharge temperature of 2 c table 3 we assumed that microbial degradation did not significantly affect the cfc groundwater age because strongly reducing conditions indicated by fe iii and sulfate reduction are limited in the study area to minimize possible bias in groundwater age we used cfc 12 age as the representative apparent age and only used cfc 113 age when cfc 12 age estimates were not available koh et al 2010 the apparent groundwater ages determined from cfc 12 and cfc 113 ranged from 11 to 54 years in the study area table 3 the apparent groundwater age in paddy fields increased along the flow path in the downgradient area in the eastern part of the study area while the apparent groundwater age in the vegetable fields showed a weak correlation with the flow path fig 4 this difference can be explained by the apparent groundwater age in the vegetable fields being more strongly affected by the groundwater mixing than that in the paddy fields lumped parameter mixing models were applied to evaluate the effects of groundwater mixing and determine the mean residence time of groundwater maloszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 the 3h input history during recharge was obtained from kaown et al 2009 because their study area is located near the chuncheon area the dispersion model dm was used to represent flow path distributions with different ages in wells in the study area the binary mixing model bmm was relevant to wells containing mixtures of recently recharged water with 3h and cfc free groundwater older than 60 years koh et al 2006 lapworth et al 2015 measured concentrations of 3h cfc 12 and cfc 113 were fitted to dm models with dispersion parameters of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 resulting in mean residence time mrt values of 20 60 years fig 5 the wells in paddy fields were older than those in vegetable fields relatively low concentrations of 3h in two wells y 20 and y 21 can be explained with the bmm model groundwater from well y 21 in vegetable fields in the downgradient area was composed of 20 old groundwater and 80 young groundwater 20 years old while groundwater from well y 20 in the paddy fields in the downgradient area contained 60 old groundwater and 40 young groundwater 30 years old wells y 18 and y 30 in the vegetable fields in the downgradient area can also be explained by mixing models with 20 and 40 old groundwater mixed with 80 and 60 young water 35 years old respectively fig 5a the fractions of young and old groundwater in wells with similar 3h levels was highly variable and depended on cfc concentrations indicating greater sensitivity of cfcs to mixing between recent recharge and old groundwater which has also been observed in other studies qin et al 2011 koh et al 2012 åkesson et al 2015 comparison of cfc 113 and cfc 12 showed mixing properties similar to those from the comparison of 3h and cfc 12 with applicable mixing models of dm for y 25 and y 37 and bmm for y 18 y 23 and y 30 some wells such as y 20 seem to be affected by microbial degradation of cfcs under strongly reducing conditions fig 5b 3 3 nitrate and groundwater age recharge ages based on the apparent cfc groundwater age and nitrate concentration in groundwater were compared to assess the impacts of hydrological processes on nitrate distribution in the study area fig 6 the upper range of nitrate concentration increased with younger recharge age in most wells in the vegetable fields of the downgradient area the higher nitrate concentration of young groundwater over the age range of 30 40 years can be attributed to a dramatic increase in nitrogenous chemical fertilizer application to more than 200 kg ha 1 yr 1 from the 1960s to 1990s in the study area gangwondo 2001 fig 6 a trend of increasing nitrate concentration in younger groundwater has been identified in numerous other studies in korea koh et al 2010 and other countries puckett et al 2011 hansen et al 2011 where chemical fertilizer usage increased considerably during the same period meanwhile the wells in paddy fields had much lower concentrations of nitrate compared to those in vegetable fields and the groundwater age ranges were similar for the two types of areas some wells including y 18 and y 30 in the downgradient area had elevated nitrate concentrations despite old age which is likely caused by binary mixing between old stagnant water and recently recharged water with high nitrate loading during the wet season fig 5 this result clearly indicates that fertilizers have been applied excessively and inefficiently in the agricultural area near these two wells compared to other areas despite lacking reliable records of fertilizer use in the study area over time in this regard groundwater age dating can be useful for identifying areas with high potential for nitrate leaching contributing to protection of groundwater quality the wells sampled in this study are domestic wells with multiple long screened intervals and binary mixing has been frequently reported in previous studies using such wells manning et al 2005 koh et al 2006 hence mixing of waters with different ages must be considered for contamination vulnerability assessments of wells eberts et al 2012 visser et al 2013 in paddy fields old groundwater had lower concentrations of do usually less than 2 mg l 1 and higher concentrations of hco3 fe and mn compared to vegetable fields the increases in the concentrations of redox sensitive species with increasing groundwater age indicate that denitrification is favorable in old groundwater rivett et al 2008 thayalakumaran et al 2008 for example y 20 and y 23 had the lowest no3 n concentrations of 0 01 1 4 mg l 1 and also had old ages 40 years the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of the groundwater samples in the vegetable fields ranged from 5 2 to 16 9 mean 7 8 and 0 8 to 5 1 mean 3 0 respectively while the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of groundwater samples in the paddy fields ranged from 5 9 to 15 6 mean 9 5 and 2 4 to 11 0 mean 6 3 respectively wells in paddy fields showed enriched δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 levels while wells located in the vegetable fields such as y 21 had depleted δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 kim et al 2015 this indicates that groundwater in paddy fields has undergone a greater extent of denitrification than that in vegetable fields 3 4 principal component analysis pca was employed to identify the major hydrological and geochemical processes controlling variances of measured variables in the study area five pcs explained 77 1 of the total variance table 4 and fig 7 pc1 explained 18 7 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for hco3 ca mg ec k and mn indicating agricultural contamination of vegetable fields and rice paddies under weakly reduced conditions higher loadings for ca and mg appeared to result from high use of lime fertilizers which are applied at up to 1750 kg ha 1 yr 1 in highland summer cultivation of south korea lee et al 2006 the negligible association between no3 and pc1 may be due to denitrification under reducing conditions and lower nitrogen loading for the wells pc2 explained 18 0 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for na so4 cl ec no3 and δ 15n no3 representing agricultural contamination from nitrogen sources in manure and organic fertilizers used in vegetable fields pc3 explained 15 2 of the total variance and had positive loadings for fe groundwater age δ 18o h2o and si showing an evaporation signature in old reduced groundwater this result indicates older and more heavily mineralized groundwater in rice paddies pc4 explained 14 2 of the total variance and had positive loadings with δ 18o no3 δ 15n no3 and k and negative loadings with si and no3 indicating that denitrification occurs in the shallow groundwater of paddy fields pc5 explained 11 0 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for do and orp representing aerobic conditions in the vegetable fields the spatial distributions of pca scores for each well are shown in fig 8 moderately positive scores for pc1 were generally found in paddy fields of the northern region this finding is consistent with the association between pc1 and hco3 and mn indicating reduced conditions in paddy fields elevated scores for pc2 were observed in vegetable fields in the southern part of the basin showing evidence of nitrate contamination from animal waste sources in that area elevated and moderately positive scores for pc3 were observed in the eastern part of the study area where the streams converge and thicker alluvial deposits develop compared to the northern region elevated and moderately positive scores for pc4 in paddy fields in the northern region indicated that denitrification in shallow groundwater is likely in that area 4 discussion stable isotope and groundwater age data indicated that groundwater is recharged in the highland mountainous area and discharged in the eastern part of the study area where streams merged in the study area monsoon driven extreme rain events mostly affected groundwater recharge during the summer bartsch et al 2013 suárez et al 2019 in the highland vegetable area groundwater recharge is fast due to monsoon driven extreme rain events in the sandy soil and thus groundwater age is younger than that of downgradient area fig 9 comparison of δ 18o values and apparent groundwater age revealed that young water had depleted δ 18o values representing recharge at high elevations which indicates fast infiltration in the recharge zone of the northern region presumably due to the steep topographic gradient and thin soil or alluvial deposits this finding suggests greater vulnerability of the northern region to contamination which may support mandatory management of chemical fertilizers in that area where highland summer cultivation depends on higher fertilization levels table 2 by contrast most of paddy fields are located in the down gradient region of the study area where groundwater discharged with horizontal flow path with old age with enriched δ 18o values indicating longer flow in the discharge zone even though the infiltration rate of impounded water was high in the paddy fields in korea yoon et al 2006 kwon et al 2020 the spatial distributions of pca scores support the presence of older and more mineralized groundwater with enriched δ 18o h2o in the eastern area which can be attributed to longer flow paths in the discharge zone of the downgradient area fig 8 excessive use of fertilizer 304 365 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and irrigation water 100 m3 ha day in highland radish and cabbage fields accelerated the infiltration rate of fertilizer and increased the groundwater contamination in the highland vegetable fields fig 9 in addition to chemical fertilizer application a lot of organic fertilizer was applied in the study area since 2010 kim et al 2015 the results of pca indicated that higher loading of enriched δ 15n no3 on pc2 also conformed to considerable usage of manure which reached 12 680 kg ha 1 yr 1 as of 2004 lee et al 2006 on the other hand nitrate leaching from agricultural lands to the aquifer may be limited in the rice paddy fields due to their low hydraulic conductivities furthermore the lower nitrate concentrations in the paddies of northern region can be explained as nitrate being diluted with nitrate free recharge water tang et al 2004 or removal through denitrification under the low do conditions of the paddy fields koh et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 relatively lower use of fertilizer 161 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and less recharge in the paddy fields than those in the vegetable fields showed low concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater with denitrification under reducing conditions fig 9 this is consistent with the result of pca that pc4 representing positive loadings with δ 18o no3 δ 15n no3 and k and negative loadings with si and no3 indicated denitrification in the shallow groundwater under the paddy fields groundwater recharge plays an important role in driving nitrate contamination and redox conditions of groundwater in agricultural areas böhlke 2002 landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 a lot of irrigation water at the heading stage in the radish and cabbage farmland as well as extreme heavy rain during the summer affected groundwater recharge and leaching rate of fertilizer in the highland farm excessive use of irrigation water and fertilizer for high production in the highland area affected the infiltration rate of fertilizer and increased the groundwater contamination in the highland radish and cabbage fields fast recharge in the vegetable fields induced oxic conditions in groundwater and thus facilitated transport of nitrate from the surface environment to the water table while old groundwater in the paddy fields resulted in lower do and increased potential denitrification in groundwater in that area the results of pca also indicated that older and more heavily mineralized groundwater was observed in rice paddies with denitrification and relatively fast recharge in the vegetable fields associated with greater usage of fertilizers the strong association between elevated nitrate and vegetable fields is in line with the greater usage of fertilizers and relatively fast recharge associated with that area combined use of stable isotope and groundwater age data for pca can be usefully applied to identify groundwater recharge pattern and transport of contaminants 5 conclusions apparent cfc groundwater age and stable isotopic composition indicate fast infiltration in the recharge zone and longer flow paths in the discharge zone of the agricultural basin stable isotopes of groundwater indicated that recharge is significantly affected by paddy impounded water which shows an evaporation signature comparison of 3h cfc 12 and cfc 113 resulted in agreeable mixing properties that could be explained with the dispersion and binary mixing models groundwater in rice paddies in the discharge zone had lower nitrate concentrations in reducing conditions favorable for denitrification by contrast excessive use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water in vegetable fields growing highland summer crops also contributed to elevated nitrate levels in groundwater old groundwater with elevated nitrate concentrations in the vegetable fields of the central basin indicated binary mixing of old groundwater from regional flow and recently recharged young water with higher nitrate loading from local flow pca revealed four major factors driving groundwater flow and chemistry two agricultural contamination processes were represented by elevated ca mg and k under weakly reducing conditions and by so4 cl and no3 from animal waste nitrogen sources in the vegetable fields the other two factors were old groundwater which is associated with reducing conditions and evaporation signatures and denitrification in the shallow groundwater of rice paddies spatially older and more mineralized groundwater was observed in the discharge zone containing well developed alluvial deposits this indicates that nitrate in the groundwater of rice paddies may be naturally attenuated by denitrification while the vegetable fields are more susceptible to nitrate contamination due to lack of denitrification potential use of environmental tracers related to recharge and groundwater age combined with multivariate statistical analyses effectively revealed the factors affecting hydrological and geochemical processes of contaminants in groundwater and provided insights that may aid the management of groundwater quality in agricultural areas lower applicationt rate of fertilizer and irrigation water in the vegetabe fields is suggested to control groundwater quality

to contamination elevated nitrate concentrations 6 8 8 5 mg l as no3 n in some old groundwater in the vegetable fields of the southeastern region may be due to binary mixing of old stagnant water and newly recharged water as identified by comparing 3h and cfc 113 with cfc 12 levels groundwater in the rice paddies had lower nitrate concentration and higher concentrations of hco3 fe and mn indicating denitrification under reducing conditions principal component analysis revealed four major processes controlling groundwater flow and chemistry agricultural contamination under reducing conditions in the vegetable fields occurrence of old groundwater under reducing conditions and denitrification in the rice paddies these results suggest that management of nitrate sources is needed to

driven extreme rain events and thus high nitrate concentrations in groundwater have been observed bartsch et al 2013 kettering et al 2013 reza et al 2016 the study area is a sub catchment of the lake soyang watershed which is a major drinking water reservoir for the 20 million residents of seoul kim et al 2015 suarez et al 2019 for this reason it is essential to evaluate the recharge pattern of groundwater and identify factors affecting the fate of nitrate so that the water quality of the soyang reservoir can be monitored we investigated the recharge processes of groundwater and the factors affecting the spatial distribution of nitrate in the mountainous highland area with a focus on two types of cultivated land vegetable fields and rice paddies both of which have excessive use of fertilizers and irrigation water a multivariate statistical approach was employed to evaluate the combined effects of groundwater recharge and hydrogeochemical conditions on the spatial distribution and transformation processes of nitrate in the basin by integrating measured hydrochemical and isotopic parameters with groundwater age 2 methods 2 1 study area haean basin is located in yanggu gangwon province fig 1 the study area is approximately 64 km2 and is surrounded by high mountains with an altitude range from 339 m at the center to 1320 m asl at the mountainous edge fig 1 precambrian metamorphic rock is located around the outside of the basin and jurassic biotite granite is found at the center of the basin hydraulic conductivity ranges from 4 94 10 5 to 1 0 10 3 cm s 1 kim et al 2015 average precipitation is 1577 mm 70 of which occurs during the wet season from june to august the mean annual air temperature maat measured at the haean meteorological station from 2000 to 2013 was 8 6 c which is significantly lower than the typical maat range of 10 15 c in mainland south korea korea meteorological agency groundwater is recharged predominantly in the mountain area and then flows toward the center of the basin recharged groundwater is drained through three streams the dosol seonghwan and mandae which converge into mandae stream in the eastern part of the study area kim et al 2015 most wells in the downgradient area are located on 414 442 m in the southeastern part and wells in the upgradient area located on 444 589 m in the northern part most groundwater wells are screened over a depth of 10 15 m and have diameters ranging from 5 to 20 cm depth to the water table was from 1 1 8 0 m average 3 3 m in the dry season and 0 8 5 5 m average 2 7 m in the wet season table 1 land uses in the study area are forest vegetable fields rice paddy fields and fruit fields with areal proportions of 58 0 27 6 11 4 and 0 5 respectively chinese cabbage radish potato and soybean are the main crops cultivated in the vegetable fields from spring to fall kim et al 2015 thus chemical fertilizers are multiple applications and a lot of water is needed for irrigation at the vegetable fields nitrogen fertilization level for each crop in the study area is shown in table 2 gwares 2004 2006 kettering et al 2013 chinese cabbages and radishes need irrigation water with 100 m3 ha day in the highland area at the heading stage national institute of crop science 2015 2 2 chemical and isotopic analyses water samples were collected in 20 wells and stream in june and september 2012 and november 2013 temperature ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured using a ysi portable meter in the field cations were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap 6500 duo thermo scientific and anions were analyzed using ion chromatography 761 compact ic metrohm ag switzerland three well volumes of water were purged to allow field parameters to stabilize water samples for cations and anions were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the δ 18o and δd of water were analyzed at the korea basic science institute using a vg prism ii stable isotope mass spectrometer results are expressed as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water the precision is 0 1 for δ 18o and 1 for δd lee and lee 1999 concentrations of tritium were measured using the liquid scintillation counting method at the korea institute of geosciences and mineral resources kigam groundwater 1 l was analyzed to determine the tritium concentration with a detection limit of 0 6 tu yoon et al 2007 groundwater samples for cfc analyses were collected in triplicate using 125 ml glass bottles sealed with aluminum lined caps cfcs were analyzed at kigam using purge and trap gas chromatography with an electron capture detector with the analytical uncertainty less than 5 koh et al 2007a 2 3 principal component analysis pca is generally used to reduce the dimension of data with correlated variables by categorizing the variables into new groups that show linear relations with the original data jolliffe 2002 in this study the variables used for pca were groundwater mean residence time no3 n fe mn hco3 δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 do ec ca mg na so4 cl k si and orp most variables except δ 18o h2o δd h2o δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 groundwater age orp and ph were logarithmically transformed and standardized as z scores to reduce interpretation errors caused by differences in data dimension some elements with concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to have values of half the detection limit pca was performed using spss eigenvalues greater than 1 were selected as pcs to explain the variance varimax rotation was applied to simplify the relationship between the variables and some pcs among the samples y 20 was excluded from statistical analyses due to exceptionally high concentrations of fe mn and hco3 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical and stable isotopic indicators in groundwater the nitrate concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 2 15 2 mg l 1 as no3 n in the study area kim et al 2015 groundwater at the center of the basin was characterized by relatively high nitrate concentrations whereas that in the northern region had lower nitrate concentrations kim et al 2015 the northern region showed lower nitrate concentrations as many rice paddy fields with poor drainage are located in this area fig 1 nitrogen sources related to agriculture are a major factor driving the level of nitrate in groundwater nitrogen loadings differ considerably for vegetable fields and rice paddies the major crops in the study area in gangwon province vegetables are grown as highland summer crops which are more heavily fertilized in terms of both the recommended and actual applied levels compared to rice which is mostly grown in paddy fields gwares 2004 2006 kettering et al 2013 considerable excess fertilization of vegetables such as chinese cabbage and potato table 2 causes this difference groundwater in vegetable fields was oxic as do was greater than 2 mg l 1 and showed weak correlations with the concentrations of hco3 fe and mn by contrast do in groundwater was less than 2 mg l 1 in paddy fields and the no3 n concentration showed a strong correlation with the concentrations of hco3 fe and mn suggesting that nitrate was denitrified under anaerobic conditions fig 2 to more objectively evaluate the redox conditions of groundwater major redox processes were estimated using the criteria established by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 relatively high levels of do were observed in wells showing signatures of reducing conditions in the study area which can be attributed to groundwater mixing in domestic wells due to the well conditions the original do threshold of 0 5 mg l 1 was increased to 2 mg l 1 application of this procedure with the measured concentrations of redox sensitive species revealed that the predominant redox conditions are oxic and favorable for no3 reduction in similar proportions while two wells y 20 and y 23 were favorable for fe iii reduction overall half of the wells had reducing conditions indicating that the extent of anoxic groundwater is considerable and denitrification is highly plausible in half of the wells in the study area on the other hand strongly reducing conditions are limited because concentrations of dissolved fe are fairly low 0 3 mg l 1 except at y 20 and y 13 and measurable do 1 mg l 1 was observed in most wells stable isotopes of water were used to determine the origin and recharge pathways of groundwater in the study area fig 3 depleted δ 18o and δd values of groundwater align along two seasonal local meteoric water lines lmwl as defined by lee and lee 1999 with significant scattering suggesting that groundwater recharge is mainly derived from variable contributions in the dry and wet seasons park et al 2006 δ 18o and δd values of groundwater were also affected by topographic elevation depleted δ 18o and δd values were associated with wells at higher elevation including y 10 y 15 and y 16 enriched δ 18o and δd were observed in some samples such as y 13 and y 33 at lower elevations and in paddy fields indicating the effects of evaporation a local evaporation line for groundwater in paddy fields had a considerably lower slope of 5 2 compared to 7 9 for the lmwl during the wet season suggesting that groundwater recharge in the paddy fields was significantly influenced by water impounded during the rice growing season from late spring to summer koh et al 2010 the stable isotopic composition of stream water was similar to that of groundwater at high elevations indicating that the stream is fed by groundwater recharged in the mountainous area 3 2 apparent ages and mixing of groundwater apparent cfc ages were determined following the procedures of plummer and bunsenberg 2000 and koh et al 2006 using north american air curves for cfcs as local excess of atmospheric cfcs is unlikely in the study area the measured groundwater temperature and elevation of the wells were used for the recharge temperature and recharge elevation to determine the apparent cfc groundwater ages while considering the uncertainty in recharge temperature of 2 c table 3 we assumed that microbial degradation did not significantly affect the cfc groundwater age because strongly reducing conditions indicated by fe iii and sulfate reduction are limited in the study area to minimize possible bias in groundwater age we used cfc 12 age as the representative apparent age and only used cfc 113 age when cfc 12 age estimates were not available koh et al 2010 the apparent groundwater ages determined from cfc 12 and cfc 113 ranged from 11 to 54 years in the study area table 3 the apparent groundwater age in paddy fields increased along the flow path in the downgradient area in the eastern part of the study area while the apparent groundwater age in the vegetable fields showed a weak correlation with the flow path fig 4 this difference can be explained by the apparent groundwater age in the vegetable fields being more strongly affected by the groundwater mixing than that in the paddy fields lumped parameter mixing models were applied to evaluate the effects of groundwater mixing and determine the mean residence time of groundwater maloszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 the 3h input history during recharge was obtained from kaown et al 2009 because their study area is located near the chuncheon area the dispersion model dm was used to represent flow path distributions with different ages in wells in the study area the binary mixing model bmm was relevant to wells containing mixtures of recently recharged water with 3h and cfc free groundwater older than 60 years koh et al 2006 lapworth et al 2015 measured concentrations of 3h cfc 12 and cfc 113 were fitted to dm models with dispersion parameters of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 resulting in mean residence time mrt values of 20 60 years fig 5 the wells in paddy fields were older than those in vegetable fields relatively low concentrations of 3h in two wells y 20 and y 21 can be explained with the bmm model groundwater from well y 21 in vegetable fields in the downgradient area was composed of 20 old groundwater and 80 young groundwater 20 years old while groundwater from well y 20 in the paddy fields in the downgradient area contained 60 old groundwater and 40 young groundwater 30 years old wells y 18 and y 30 in the vegetable fields in the downgradient area can also be explained by mixing models with 20 and 40 old groundwater mixed with 80 and 60 young water 35 years old respectively fig 5a the fractions of young and old groundwater in wells with similar 3h levels was highly variable and depended on cfc concentrations indicating greater sensitivity of cfcs to mixing between recent recharge and old groundwater which has also been observed in other studies qin et al 2011 koh et al 2012 åkesson et al 2015 comparison of cfc 113 and cfc 12 showed mixing properties similar to those from the comparison of 3h and cfc 12 with applicable mixing models of dm for y 25 and y 37 and bmm for y 18 y 23 and y 30 some wells such as y 20 seem to be affected by microbial degradation of cfcs under strongly reducing conditions fig 5b 3 3 nitrate and groundwater age recharge ages based on the apparent cfc groundwater age and nitrate concentration in groundwater were compared to assess the impacts of hydrological processes on nitrate distribution in the study area fig 6 the upper range of nitrate concentration increased with younger recharge age in most wells in the vegetable fields of the downgradient area the higher nitrate concentration of young groundwater over the age range of 30 40 years can be attributed to a dramatic increase in nitrogenous chemical fertilizer application to more than 200 kg ha 1 yr 1 from the 1960s to 1990s in the study area gangwondo 2001 fig 6 a trend of increasing nitrate concentration in younger groundwater has been identified in numerous other studies in korea koh et al 2010 and other countries puckett et al 2011 hansen et al 2011 where chemical fertilizer usage increased considerably during the same period meanwhile the wells in paddy fields had much lower concentrations of nitrate compared to those in vegetable fields and the groundwater age ranges were similar for the two types of areas some wells including y 18 and y 30 in the downgradient area had elevated nitrate concentrations despite old age which is likely caused by binary mixing between old stagnant water and recently recharged water with high nitrate loading during the wet season fig 5 this result clearly indicates that fertilizers have been applied excessively and inefficiently in the agricultural area near these two wells compared to other areas despite lacking reliable records of fertilizer use in the study area over time in this regard groundwater age dating can be useful for identifying areas with high potential for nitrate leaching contributing to protection of groundwater quality the wells sampled in this study are domestic wells with multiple long screened intervals and binary mixing has been frequently reported in previous studies using such wells manning et al 2005 koh et al 2006 hence mixing of waters with different ages must be considered for contamination vulnerability assessments of wells eberts et al 2012 visser et al 2013 in paddy fields old groundwater had lower concentrations of do usually less than 2 mg l 1 and higher concentrations of hco3 fe and mn compared to vegetable fields the increases in the concentrations of redox sensitive species with increasing groundwater age indicate that denitrification is favorable in old groundwater rivett et al 2008 thayalakumaran et al 2008 for example y 20 and y 23 had the lowest no3 n concentrations of 0 01 1 4 mg l 1 and also had old ages 40 years the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of the groundwater samples in the vegetable fields ranged from 5 2 to 16 9 mean 7 8 and 0 8 to 5 1 mean 3 0 respectively while the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of groundwater samples in the paddy fields ranged from 5 9 to 15 6 mean 9 5 and 2 4 to 11 0 mean 6 3 respectively wells in paddy fields showed enriched δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 levels while wells located in the vegetable fields such as y 21 had depleted δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 kim et al 2015 this indicates that groundwater in paddy fields has undergone a greater extent of denitrification than that in vegetable fields 3 4 principal component analysis pca was employed to identify the major hydrological and geochemical processes controlling variances of measured variables in the study area five pcs explained 77 1 of the total variance table 4 and fig 7 pc1 explained 18 7 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for hco3 ca mg ec k and mn indicating agricultural contamination of vegetable fields and rice paddies under weakly reduced conditions higher loadings for ca and mg appeared to result from high use of lime fertilizers which are applied at up to 1750 kg ha 1 yr 1 in highland summer cultivation of south korea lee et al 2006 the negligible association between no3 and pc1 may be due to denitrification under reducing conditions and lower nitrogen loading for the wells pc2 explained 18 0 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for na so4 cl ec no3 and δ 15n no3 representing agricultural contamination from nitrogen sources in manure and organic fertilizers used in vegetable fields pc3 explained 15 2 of the total variance and had positive loadings for fe groundwater age δ 18o h2o and si showing an evaporation signature in old reduced groundwater this result indicates older and more heavily mineralized groundwater in rice paddies pc4 explained 14 2 of the total variance and had positive loadings with δ 18o no3 δ 15n no3 and k and negative loadings with si and no3 indicating that denitrification occurs in the shallow groundwater of paddy fields pc5 explained 11 0 of the total variance and showed positive loadings for do and orp representing aerobic conditions in the vegetable fields the spatial distributions of pca scores for each well are shown in fig 8 moderately positive scores for pc1 were generally found in paddy fields of the northern region this finding is consistent with the association between pc1 and hco3 and mn indicating reduced conditions in paddy fields elevated scores for pc2 were observed in vegetable fields in the southern part of the basin showing evidence of nitrate contamination from animal waste sources in that area elevated and moderately positive scores for pc3 were observed in the eastern part of the study area where the streams converge and thicker alluvial deposits develop compared to the northern region elevated and moderately positive scores for pc4 in paddy fields in the northern region indicated that denitrification in shallow groundwater is likely in that area 4 discussion stable isotope and groundwater age data indicated that groundwater is recharged in the highland mountainous area and discharged in the eastern part of the study area where streams merged in the study area monsoon driven extreme rain events mostly affected groundwater recharge during the summer bartsch et al 2013 suárez et al 2019 in the highland vegetable area groundwater recharge is fast due to monsoon driven extreme rain events in the sandy soil and thus groundwater age is younger than that of downgradient area fig 9 comparison of δ 18o values and apparent groundwater age revealed that young water had depleted δ 18o values representing recharge at high elevations which indicates fast infiltration in the recharge zone of the northern region presumably due to the steep topographic gradient and thin soil or alluvial deposits this finding suggests greater vulnerability of the northern region to contamination which may support mandatory management of chemical fertilizers in that area where highland summer cultivation depends on higher fertilization levels table 2 by contrast most of paddy fields are located in the down gradient region of the study area where groundwater discharged with horizontal flow path with old age with enriched δ 18o values indicating longer flow in the discharge zone even though the infiltration rate of impounded water was high in the paddy fields in korea yoon et al 2006 kwon et al 2020 the spatial distributions of pca scores support the presence of older and more mineralized groundwater with enriched δ 18o h2o in the eastern area which can be attributed to longer flow paths in the discharge zone of the downgradient area fig 8 excessive use of fertilizer 304 365 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and irrigation water 100 m3 ha day in highland radish and cabbage fields accelerated the infiltration rate of fertilizer and increased the groundwater contamination in the highland vegetable fields fig 9 in addition to chemical fertilizer application a lot of organic fertilizer was applied in the study area since 2010 kim et al 2015 the results of pca indicated that higher loading of enriched δ 15n no3 on pc2 also conformed to considerable usage of manure which reached 12 680 kg ha 1 yr 1 as of 2004 lee et al 2006 on the other hand nitrate leaching from agricultural lands to the aquifer may be limited in the rice paddy fields due to their low hydraulic conductivities furthermore the lower nitrate concentrations in the paddies of northern region can be explained as nitrate being diluted with nitrate free recharge water tang et al 2004 or removal through denitrification under the low do conditions of the paddy fields koh et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 relatively lower use of fertilizer 161 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and less recharge in the paddy fields than those in the vegetable fields showed low concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater with denitrification under reducing conditions fig 9 this is consistent with the result of pca that pc4 representing positive loadings with δ 18o no3 δ 15n no3 and k and negative loadings with si and no3 indicated denitrification in the shallow groundwater under the paddy fields groundwater recharge plays an important role in driving nitrate contamination and redox conditions of groundwater in agricultural areas böhlke 2002 landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 a lot of irrigation water at the heading stage in the radish and cabbage farmland as well as extreme heavy rain during the summer affected groundwater recharge and leaching rate of fertilizer in the highland farm excessive use of irrigation water and fertilizer for high production in the highland area affected the infiltration rate of fertilizer and increased the groundwater contamination in the highland radish and cabbage fields fast recharge in the vegetable fields induced oxic conditions in groundwater and thus facilitated transport of nitrate from the surface environment to the water table while old groundwater in the paddy fields resulted in lower do and increased potential denitrification in groundwater in that area the results of pca also indicated that older and more heavily mineralized groundwater was observed in rice paddies with denitrification and relatively fast recharge in the vegetable fields associated with greater usage of fertilizers the strong association between elevated nitrate and vegetable fields is in line with the greater usage of fertilizers and relatively fast recharge associated with that area combined use of stable isotope and groundwater age data for pca can be usefully applied to identify groundwater recharge pattern and transport of contaminants 5 conclusions apparent cfc groundwater age and stable isotopic composition indicate fast infiltration in the recharge zone and longer flow paths in the discharge zone of the agricultural basin stable isotopes of groundwater indicated that recharge is significantly affected by paddy impounded water which shows an evaporation signature comparison of 3h cfc 12 and cfc 113 resulted in agreeable mixing properties that could be explained with the dispersion and binary mixing models groundwater in rice paddies in the discharge zone had lower nitrate concentrations in reducing conditions favorable for denitrification by contrast excessive use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water in vegetable fields growing highland summer crops also contributed to elevated nitrate levels in groundwater old groundwater with elevated nitrate concentrations in the vegetable fields of the central basin indicated binary mixing of old groundwater from regional flow and recently recharged young water with higher nitrate loading from local flow pca revealed four major factors driving groundwater flow and chemistry two agricultural contamination processes were represented by elevated ca mg and k under weakly reducing conditions and by so4 cl and no3 from animal waste nitrogen sources in the vegetable fields the other two factors were old groundwater which is associated with reducing conditions and evaporation signatures and denitrification in the shallow groundwater of rice paddies spatially older and more mineralized groundwater was observed in the discharge zone containing well developed alluvial deposits this indicates that nitrate in the groundwater of rice paddies may be naturally attenuated by denitrification while the vegetable fields are more susceptible to nitrate contamination due to lack of denitrification potential use of environmental tracers related to recharge and groundwater age combined with multivariate statistical analyses effectively revealed the factors affecting hydrological and geochemical processes of contaminants in groundwater and provided insights that may aid the management of groundwater quality in agricultural areas lower applicationt rate of fertilizer and irrigation water in the vegetabe fields is suggested to control groundwater quality

10546,water scarcity has become a salient problem in southern new mexico a combination of drought and a decrease in surface water for irrigation encouraged to search for other sources of water desalination of brackish groundwater bgw using reverse osmosis ro results in a highly salty water or ro concentrate in this study impacts of using bgw and ro concentrate for irrigating pecan trees inside a greenhouse were evaluated the objective was to determine if pecan trees are suitable for irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate and evaluate the possible effects on pecan growth and physiological parameters for each of two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 three irrigation treatments of 0 8 4 0 bgw and 8 0 ds m ro were applied every 14 days for 8 months four year old pecan trees were planted in pots filled with sandy loam soil response variables included plant height and diameter as well as physiological data including photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content transpiration rate stomatal conductance stem water potential and leaf ions concentrations net pecan growth was 2 75 cm less in ro concentrate irrigated pots than control by the end of the second season plants irrigated with ro had the lowest chlorophyll content 30 75 and the lowest stem water potential 17 22 bar na and cl concentrations reached 0 056 and 0 027 meq l in the leaf samples in ro irrigated pecans all trees survived the first season but only 75 of the pecan trees irrigated with bgw and 50 of those irrigated with ro survived the two seasons of the experiment this suggested that continuous long term irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate is not suitable in arid areas and new irrigation scheduling protocols are needed for safe reuse of bgw and ro concentrate keywords ro concentrate chlorophyll pecan photosynthetic rate 1 introduction water is the most crucial factor for every form of life on our planet water demand has increased because of the increase in population around the globe consequently this important factor of life has been stressed especially in arid and semi arid areas that are characterized by low rainfall extreme temperature high evaporation rates saline groundwater bath et al 2017 flores et al 2017 ozturk et al 2018 and low water quality and availability acosta rangel et al 2019 these environmental factors along with persistent drought and diminishing freshwater

located in arid and semi arid areas of the united states deb et al 2013 pecan is reported to be a salt sensitive crop from experiments conducted using sodium chloride nacl solutions deb et al 2013 miyamoto et al 1986 increasing irrigation salinity levels reduced nitrogen accumulation in the seedling leaves suggesting that saline irrigation water disturbs the mechanism that controls the translocation of nitrogen to the leaves deb et al 2013 a soil salinity level of 3 5 ds m can reduce growth by approximately 25 while branch die back occurred at soil salinity levels of 5 ds m and trees may die when soil salinity reaches or exceeds 6 ds m miyamoto et al 1986 sodium affected trees show leaf tip burn whereas chloride affected trees exhibit extensive foliage burn miyamoto et al 1986 symptoms of salt accumulation damage include decreases in growth marginal leaf necrosis and eventual necrosis of entire leaves and defoliation walworth 2014 physiologically in pecans increases in salt concentration in the soil and irrigation water lead to decrease in the photosynthesis decreases in photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and plant height and growth has been reported with increases in salinity alvarez et al 2018 several studies have investigated the effects of soil salinity on pecan trees using nacl solutions however there is lack in information on pecan responses to irrigation water salinity to the best of our knowledge there are no studies using calcium dominant natural bgw and ro concentrate for irrigation for extended periods the brackish groundwater national desalination research facility bgndrf in alamogordo new mexico uses the reverse osmosis method to treat bgw from four wells on the facility in this study bgw and ro concentrate from bgndrf that needs to be disposed of were used to irrigate the pecan trees the hypothesis is that calcium dominant ro concentrate as a valuable source of water and bgw can be considered for irrigating pecan trees year round if growth and physiological parameters are effectively monitored the objective of this study is to determine if pecans are suitable for irrigation by calcium dominant ro concentrate and how ro concentrate irrigation affects the growth and the physiological parameters over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and plant material the study was conducted at the fabian garcia science center of new mexico state university las cruces nm 32 16 704 n 106 46 376 w inside a greenhouse for two seasons from may to december 2017 and 2018 the reason for conducting the experiment inside the greenhouse is that the new mexico department of agriculture does not allow land application of any water with salinity level higher than 4 ds m and the treatments exceeded the allowed salinity threshold the greenhouse structure comprised of one plastic layer with an evaporative cooler system a heating system and temperature controller unit in may 2017 4 year old pecan trees carya

teaspoons of tracite foliar npk helena chemical collierville tn as a fertilizer the trees were irrigated 15 times each season all pecan trees were sprayed with insecticides four times each season due to the common infection with white and green aphids in southern new mexico admire pro imidacloprid was sprayed once in july august and september sivanto propylene carbonate was sprayed once in october the plants were moved out of the greenhouse at the end of the first season to expose trees to the natural frost during the winter season 2 3 plant growth and gas exchange parameters the height and stem diameter of the pecan trees were measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment using a meter scale and vernier caliper respectively stem diameters were measured at the breast level

the soil surface of the pecan trees leaves for flow rate and co2 the li cor 6400 portable system was adjusted at 400 μmol s 1 and 400 μmol mol 1 respectively the source of light was 6400 02b and the photosynthetic active radiation par was between 998 to 1000 the measurements were made using leaves that cover the chamber at both 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface on sunny days between 10 30 am and 2 30 pm in august september and november 2017 and 2018 2 4 leaf ion content for leaf ion content random leaf samples were collected three times from the pecan trees in august september and

part of the branch out of the bag the bag was placed into the pressure chamber and locked tightly nitrogen gas was slowly released from the gas tank until the water bubbles came out from the branch and the reading was recorded measurements were made on sunny days between noon to 2 30 pm the measurements were made in august september and november 2017 and 2018 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental design was a completely randomized design with four replications all statistical analyses were performed using sas software v 9 4 data on plant gas exchange parameters and ions content were subjected to analysis of variance using proc mixed procedure tested the effects of treatments across all times differences due to treatments on plant growth height and diameter chlorophyll content and stem water potential were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and means were separated using least significant difference lsd chlorophyll content and stem water potential were then subjected to linear regression analysis to examine the salinity levels effects over the entire period of the experiment an alpha level of 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 greenhouse meteorology during the first season of the experiment in 2017 the temperature inside the greenhouse ranged between 19 5 and 36 4 c and relative humidity between 7 9 and 90 5 during the second season in 2018 temperature inside the greenhouse ranged between 11 18 and 42 39 c and the relative humidity between 6 7 and 93 fig 1 a b the mean variations in air temperature and relative humidity were similar 3 2 plant growth the means of pecans heights and diameters are shown in table 2 no statistically significant differences in the height or diameter of pecan trees were observed at α 0 05 during every growing season from may to december 2017 and 2018 this suggested that saline water did not significantly affect the plant growth during the experiment period during the first season 2017 the net change in plant height and diameter in control treatment were 6 cm and 0 68 mm respectively with bgw irrigation the net change in height and diameter were 3 62 cm and 0 6 mm respectively and with ro irrigation the net change in height and diameter were 6 cm and 1 13 mm respectively table 3 during the second season in control treatment the net change in height and diameter were 3 75 cm and 0 12 mm respectively in bgw the net changes in height and diameter were 3 25 cm and 0 65 mm respectively however in ro irrigated pots a net decrease of 2 75 cm in height but a net increase of 0 09 mm in diameter was observed table 3 3 3 plant gas exchange parameters differences among the three treatments at α 0 05 on the gas exchange parameters at 50 cm and 110 cm of the pecan trees leaves were observed during the three measurement times on august september and november the control treatment had the highest photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate on all measurement times on the two seasons 2017 and 2018 while the ro treatment had the lowest rate table 4 photosynthetic rates at 50 cm above the soil surface of the pecan trees leaves during the first season showed the highest rate with control irrigation 7 98 0 45 μmol m2 s on november 2017 whereas the lowest rate was with bgw irrigation 1 23 0 45 μmol m2 s on august 2017 table 4 on the contrary the highest photosynthetic rate at 110 cm above the soil surface was with control concentrate irrigation 8 01 0 89 μmol m2 s followed by bgw irrigation 6 04 0 89 μmol m2 s on november 2017 table 4 during the second season control treatment continued higher at 50 cm above the soil surface the highest rate was with control irrigation 4 43 0 41 μmol m2 s on november 2018 table 4 also at 110 cm above the soil surface the highest photosynthetic rate was with control irigation 4 43 0 41 μmol m2 s on august 2018 whereas the lowest rate was with bgw irrigation 0 43 0 65 μmol m2 s on september 2018 table 4 the transpiration rate at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the pecan trees generally showed increases over time during the first season table 4 the highest transpiration rate was with control irrigation 2 62 0 37 mol m2 s followed by bgw irrigation 1 87 0 37 mol m2 s at 50 cm above the soil surface whereas the highest rate was with bgw irrigation 2 41 0 34 mol m2 s followed by control irrigation 1 58 0 34 mol m2 s at 110 cm above the soil surface table 4 during the second season fluctuations in the transpiration rate over time can be observed however the rate decreased slightly at both 50 cm and 110 cm of the trees height table 4 the stomatal conductance rate during the first season showed differences at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the plants leaves table 4 the rate generally increased over time for the three treatments the rate for control irrigation was the highest followed by bgw irrigation at 0 090 0 01 and 0 060 0 01 mmol m2 s respectively at 110 cm of the plants the rates had the same trend however the rate increase was lower at 50 cm of the plants during the second season at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the plants no differences were observed among the three treatments by time table 4 3 4 chlorophyll content irrigation treatments influenced pecan leaf chlorophyll content during both the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 2 a b for each growing season leaf chlorophyll content was highest for pecan trees irrigated with control solution and lowest for pecan trees irrigated with ro concentrate this suggested that increases in irrigation water salinity level decreases the leaf chlorophyll content during the first season strong linear relationships between day of the year and spad reading chlorophyll content were observed for each treatment however ro concentrate showed the strongest with r2 0 84 compared with control treatment r2 0 79 during the second season however the linear relationship was stronger for the control treatment with r2 0 72 compared to r2 0 45 for the ro concentrate 3 5 stem water potential stem leaf water potential was smaller with ro concentrate irrigation followed by bgw for the two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 fig 3 a b increases in stem water potential over time were observed for all the three treatments during the two seasons however ro concentrate showed the strongest linear relationship with r2 0 49 followed by bgw with r2 0 36 compared with control r2 0 22 in the first season this relationship was stronger in the second season for bgw with r2 0 92 and ro with r2 0 88 compared with r2 0 04 for the control 3 6 leaf ions concentrations tables 5 and 6 show the differences of the leaf ions content and sar for the first season 2017 no differences in magnesium content among the treatments were observed table 5 the highest concentration of calcium ion was with ro concentrate 0 15 0 01 meq l followed by bgw 0 14 0 01 meq l in september 2017 table 5 sodium ion concentration was higher with ro concentrate 0 056 0 00 meq l followed by bgw 0 027 0 00 meq l in november at the end of the first season table 5 the results showed increasing sodium ions concentration with increasing irrigation duration sar values were different among treatments and showed a slight increase with ro concentrate irrigation table 5 no differences in phosphorus and potassium ions were observed table 6 the greatest sulfur concentration of 0 018 0 00 meq l was with the control irrigation followed by ro concentrate 0 017 0 00 meq l in september 2017 table 6 the zinc ion concentration was highest 11 54 1 98 meq l with control irrigation in august followed by ro concentrate irrigation 10 38 3 68 meq l in november 2017 table 6 in the second season 2018 in general no differences were observed among the three treatments in all the ions concentrations except the chloride ions tables 7 and 8 the greatest chloride concentration was with bgw irrigation 0 035 0 00 meq l followed by ro concentration 0 027 0 00 meq l in november 2018 table 7 as the sar was lower than 13 the solutions were considered neither saline nor sodic for the second season 2018 4 discussion one bgw and one ro concentrate irrigated trees went to dormancy stage after three irrigations during the first season however at the beginning of the second season they had normal bud break the average height and diameter of the pecans did not significantly differ among the three treatments in this study for 2017 and 2018 seasons differences in net growth of pecan trees were observed and net growth during 2018 was less than that in 2017 for all irrigation treatments ro irrigated trees showed a net decrease in growth during 2018 season similar height decreases with increasing irrigation salinity levels are reported for barley hordeum vulgare l hussain et al 1997 and chili pepper capsicum annuum l baath et al 2017 alvarez et al 2018 reported decreases in height and growth with mastic tree pistacia lentiscus with nacl dominant irrigation water 4 ds m decreases in olive trees growth with increasing soil salinity were also reported by mousavi et al 2019 other studies showed decreased shoot lengths for salt grass species distichlis spicata l in desert region pessarakli 2011 prairie cordgrass and switchgrass kim et al 2012 miyamoto et al 1986 reported that soil salinity level of 3 5 ds m can reduce pecans growth by 25 while branch die back occur at soil salinity levels of 5 ds m and pecan trees may die when soil salinity exceeds 6 ds m in contrast in this study overall plant growth was not significantly affected by increasing water salinity levels for the two growing seasons the reason could be the age of the pecan trees 4 years old which gave them the ability to develop mechanism to acclimate to increasing irrigation water salinity dormancy was an option for the pecan trees to avoid the unfavorable conditions in this study pecan photosynthetic rate was significantly affected by increasing salinity levels of irrigation water in general as the salinity level increased by increasing the irrigation duration the photosynthetic rates decreased during both seasons 2017 and 2018 this might be due to salt accumulation in the pecan trees leaves that cause inhibition in photosynthetic rate reduction in net carbon fixation due to increase in salinity immediately affected photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll al taee 2018 a similar trend was found with marsh grass spartina alterniflora where the photosynthetic rate was decreased by the increase of water salinity ge et al 2014 reduction in photosynthetic and transpiration rates was the result of applying saline water on tomato yang et al 2019 this was similar with our findings with pecan trees our results agreed with the results reported by mousavi et al 2019 where photosynthetic rate decreased by increasing soil salinity on olive trees exposed to nacl irrigation water and with turfgrass eremochloa ophiuroides li et al 2018 some perennials citrus and grapevines accumulated cl ions in the shoots and inhibited photosynthesis while na ions stored in the root and stem flowers and yeo 1988 decreases in photosynthetic rate with increasing salinity levels on sarcocornia fruticose halophytes plant was reported by redondo gomez et al 2006 whereas increases in another halophyte panicum turgidum photosynthetic rate with increasing salinity levels to 14 ds m was reported koyro et al 2013 another study indicated that irrigation with 3 ds m saline water decreased photosynthetic and stomatal conductance rate for chili pepper capsicum annuum l baath et al 2017 to control the spread of aphids admire pro was applied on july august and september this as a result caused the reduction in photosynthetic transpiration and stomatal conductance rates on august and september for all the three treatments in both seasons this chemical coated the leaf area for long time causing that reduction in photosynthetic transpiration and stomatal conductance rates on the contrary sivanto insecticide sprayed on october did not cause any reduction on november 2017 and 2018 reduction on plant gas exchange parameters due to admire pro application has been reported gonzalez delgado et al 2017 pecan trees treated with organo silicon surfactant showed reduction in photosynthetic rate after 14 days of the treatments wood et al 1997 because stomatal opening affects transpiration rates transpiration and stomatal conductance trends among these variables were similar among treatments the decrease in stomatal conductance rate because of the salt accumulation caused the decrease in transpiration rate for the 2017 and 2018 seasons to reduce the salinity effects plants tend to reduce stomatal conductance to maintain low salts levels on the leaves alvarez et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 and yang et al 2019 reported similar decrease in stomatal and transpiration rate with tomato irrigated saline water our results agreed with the results reported by khataar et al 2018 with bean and wheat irrigated with cacl and nacl on the contrary other study showed increases in transpiration rates with increasing salinity level to 13 5 ds m koyro et al 2013 in this study chlorophyll content was highly affected by increasing salinity decreases in chlorophyll content was observed with increasing water salinity level increases in magnesium with ro concentrate irrigation decreased the leaf chlorophyll content positive correlation has been reported between plant chlorophyll content and calcium magnesium and chloride concentrations al taee 2018 taffouo et al 2010 shimul et al 2014 and zhang et al 2016 reported that decreases in tomato leaves chlorophyll content was observed with increasing water salinity level and that agreed with our study in agreement with our results avocado persea americana showed decreases in leaf chlorophyll content when irrigated with nacl solution for 5 months alvarez acosta et al 2018 irrigation with nacl solution was the reason of the decrease in centipedegrass eremochloa ophiuroides leaf chlorophyll content li et al 2018 changes in water potential can be an indicator of changes in ion concentration hussain et al 2014 plants perform best when irrigated with fresh water that does not cause increases in soil salinity in our observations stem water potential was always lower and caused higher water stress on the pecan trees compared with bgw and control treatments this could be because of the decrease in root water uptake due the increase in irrigation water salinity alvarez et al 2018 reported decreases in leaf water potential on pistacia lentiscus and hussain et al 2014 reported decreases in stem water potential on marsh grass with increasing salinity yang et al 2019 mentioned that adaptation of the plant to salinity leads to alterations in the absorption ejection and isolation of ions as well as the synthesis of compatible solutions to maintain cellular balance specific amounts of ions are needed for plants to grow and function perfectly and increases in these ions amounts can affect the plant negatively because of the need for water for plants life more ions concentrations are gained with water uptake as the irrigation water ions content increased this study showed increases in sodium concentration in the leaf with increasing salinity level with ro concentrate and were consistent with other studies on spartina alterniflora redondo gomez et al 2010 and phlomis purpurea plants alvarez et al 2012 pecan trees are susceptible to salt damage especially to sodium na and chloride cl leaf tip burn was the symptom of pecan trees affected by sodium whereas chloride affected trees exhibit extensive foliage burn miyamoto et al 1986 acosta rangel et al 2019 mentioned that avocado persea americana leaves showed partial burns upon irrigation with saline water ec 1 5 ds m due to cl accumulation from the visual observations in our study the edges of the leaves began to show signs of burning brown color after the fourth irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate in the first season however plants also grew new leaves fig 4 during the second season more burnt leaves and leaf loss were observed from trees irrigated with saline water especially the ro concentrate branches die back began to occur during late august after the eighth irrigation with ro concentrate in the first season and that continued to increase during the second season epstein and bloom 2005 reported that enzymes activation depends on magnesium and scholberg and locascio 1999 mentioned that increases in salinity increased magnesium concentration of tomato and snap bean phaseolus vulgaris l this can cause decrease in chlorophyll content that reflect on the photosynthetic rate in contrast increases in salinity decreased pistacia vera l mg 2 concentration rahneshan et al 2018 calcium can reduce sodium absorption managing the selection of sodium over potassium and the decrease in calcium can increase the percentage of sodium in the soil epstein and bloom 2005 rahneshan et al 2018 stated that the role of ca 2 in mitigating salt toxicity is associated with the selective effect of k na by controlling the flow of na through non selective ion channels the decrease in ca 2 can cause risk to plants growth in this study calcium significantly increased with increasing water salinity with ro concentrate because it was calcium dominant our result agreed with a previous study where the ca 2 increased in the shoot of pistacia vera l rahneshan et al 2018 non significant differences were observed with phosphorus and the concentration remained steady with the three treatments hussain et al 2014 reported decreases in phosphorus concentration with increasing salinity any decrease in phosphorus can cause salient problem for the plant protein and cell signaling epstein and bloom 2005 and affect pistachio seedlings rahneshan et al 2018 potassium is an important element for the photosynthetic process because it activates enzymes involved with adenosine triphosphate atp production thereby contributing to the regulation of photosynthesis epstein and bloom 2005 the presence of sodium can eliminate potassium uptake hussain et al 2014 formentin et al 2018 in this study the potassium concentration decreased with increasing water salinity due to increases in sodium concentration sulfur deficiency can affect both chlorophyll and protein synthesis mccauley et al 2011 in this study however no differences among the three treatment were seen and the trend was similar for all the three treatments during the two seasons however zinc concentration increased with ro concentration in this study and this highly reflected on the chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate hu and sparks 1991 also reported reduction in leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate due to zn deficiency in pecan tree heerema 2013 reported recommended ranges of some important ions for pecan leaf including phosphorus 0 013 0 018 meq l potassium 0 035 0 639 meq l magnesium 0 024 0 049 meq l calcium 0 044 0 089 meq l sulfur 0 009 0 022 meq l and zinc 1 529 3 059 meq l compared to this study tables 5 6 in the first season p and mg ions were within the recommended range for all the three treatments k was lower than the recommended range with bgw ca and zn were higher than the recommended ranges for all the three treatments however bgw and ro were higher than the recommended range in s content by increasing the number of irrigations in the second season tables 7 8 p mg and zn increased over the range with ro concentrate irrigation k and s ions were in the range however the control showed increases in the ca ions content from all the above one time deficit in k ions was recorded with bgw irrigation in the first season however in the second season this ion was in the range overall pecan is sensitive to higher ion concentrations and continuous application of calcium dominated ro is not recommended 5 conclusion the use of calcium dominated ro concentrate in irrigation pecans can reduce the cost of the disposal as well as the water demand in southern new mexico the results of this study promoted the possibility of using this valuable source of water in arid and semi arid areas at least for one season there were no differences in pecan s growth height and diameter irrigated with 0 8 4 0 and 8 0 ds m pecans were significantly affected by irrigation with calcium dominated bgw and ro concentrate with reductions in gas exchange parameters the soil irrigated with ro remained wet for longer time than the control and the bgw and the amount of water needed to irrigate the pecans was less and facilitated more leaching than control in this study 50 of the pecan trees irrigated with ro concentrate and 75 of the pecan trees irrigated with bgw survived the two seasons and even the 25 was in dormancy at the end of the second season pecan trees showed some stunting during the second season and that is expected to increase with longer irrigation periods therefore continuous

10546,water scarcity has become a salient problem in southern new mexico a combination of drought and a decrease in surface water for irrigation encouraged to search for other sources of water desalination of brackish groundwater bgw using reverse osmosis ro results in a highly salty water or ro concentrate in this study impacts of using bgw and ro concentrate for irrigating pecan trees inside a greenhouse were evaluated the objective was to determine if pecan trees are suitable for irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate and evaluate the possible effects on pecan growth and physiological parameters for each of two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 three irrigation treatments of 0 8 4 0 bgw and 8 0 ds m ro were applied every 14 days for 8 months four year old pecan trees were planted in pots filled with sandy loam soil response variables included plant height and diameter as well as physiological data including photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content transpiration rate stomatal conductance stem water potential and leaf ions concentrations net pecan growth was 2 75 cm less in ro concentrate irrigated pots than control by the end of the second season plants irrigated with ro had the lowest chlorophyll content 30 75 and the lowest stem water potential 17 22 bar na and cl concentrations reached 0 056 and 0 027 meq l in the leaf samples in ro irrigated pecans all trees survived the first season but only 75 of the pecan trees irrigated with bgw and 50 of those irrigated with ro survived the two seasons of the experiment this suggested that continuous long term irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate is not suitable in arid areas and new irrigation scheduling protocols are needed for safe reuse of bgw and ro concentrate keywords ro concentrate chlorophyll pecan photosynthetic rate 1 introduction water is the most crucial factor for every form of life on our planet water demand has increased because of the increase in population around the globe consequently this important factor of life has been stressed especially in arid and semi arid areas that are characterized by low rainfall extreme temperature high evaporation rates saline groundwater bath et al 2017 flores et al 2017 ozturk et al 2018 and low water quality and availability acosta rangel et al 2019 these environmental factors along with persistent drought and diminishing freshwater supplies have prompted urgent searches for neoteric water resources in arid and semi arid lands across the world flores et al 2017 in southern new mexico the situation is particularly complicated because around 75 of groundwater is brackish ec 3 ds m with low precipitation and high evaporation rates land 2016 bath et al 2017 flores et al 2017 ozturk et al 2018 approximately 54 of water that people use comes from surface water and 46 from groundwater with about 79 of the total surface and groundwater used for agricultural purposes new mexico first 2014 desalination of brackish groundwater bgw produces both potable low saline water and high saline reverse osmosis ro concentrate unep international environmental technology center 1998 this ro concentrate also known as concentrate is usually disposed of in evaporation ponds which are expensive and cause loss of valuable water gonzalez delgado et al 2011 soliz et al 2011 ozturk et al 2018 an alternate method of reuse of the ro concentrate is land application for crop irrigation flores et al 2016 2017 ozturk et al 2018 in the united states pecan is one of the most important specialty crops commercial pecan orchards are located in arid and semi arid areas of the united states deb et al 2013 pecan is reported to be a salt sensitive crop from experiments conducted using sodium chloride nacl solutions deb et al 2013 miyamoto et al 1986 increasing irrigation salinity levels reduced nitrogen accumulation in the seedling leaves suggesting that saline irrigation water disturbs the mechanism that controls the translocation of nitrogen to the leaves deb et al 2013 a soil salinity level of 3 5 ds m can reduce growth by approximately 25 while branch die back occurred at soil salinity levels of 5 ds m and trees may die when soil salinity reaches or exceeds 6 ds m miyamoto et al 1986 sodium affected trees show leaf tip burn whereas chloride affected trees exhibit extensive foliage burn miyamoto et al 1986 symptoms of salt accumulation damage include decreases in growth marginal leaf necrosis and eventual necrosis of entire leaves and defoliation walworth 2014 physiologically in pecans increases in salt concentration in the soil and irrigation water lead to decrease in the photosynthesis decreases in photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and plant height and growth has been reported with increases in salinity alvarez et al 2018 several studies have investigated the effects of soil salinity on pecan trees using nacl solutions however there is lack in information on pecan responses to irrigation water salinity to the best of our knowledge there are no studies using calcium dominant natural bgw and ro concentrate for irrigation for extended periods the brackish groundwater national desalination research facility bgndrf in alamogordo new mexico uses the reverse osmosis method to treat bgw from four wells on the facility in this study bgw and ro concentrate from bgndrf that needs to be disposed of were used to irrigate the pecan trees the hypothesis is that calcium dominant ro concentrate as a valuable source of water and bgw can be considered for irrigating pecan trees year round if growth and physiological parameters are effectively monitored the objective of this study is to determine if pecans are suitable for irrigation by calcium dominant ro concentrate and how ro concentrate irrigation affects the growth and the physiological parameters over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and plant material the study was conducted at the fabian garcia science center of new mexico state university las cruces nm 32 16 704 n 106 46 376 w inside a greenhouse for two seasons from may to december 2017 and 2018 the reason for conducting the experiment inside the greenhouse is that the new mexico department of agriculture does not allow land application of any water with salinity level higher than 4 ds m and the treatments exceeded the allowed salinity threshold the greenhouse structure comprised of one plastic layer with an evaporative cooler system a heating system and temperature controller unit in may 2017 4 year old pecan trees carya illinoinensis wangenh wichita variety archer farms inc las cruces were planted in sandy loam soil filled cylindrical pots of 0 035 m3 height of 36 cm and diameter of 36 cm the sandy loam soil had an organic matter content of 1 5 0 2 and ph of 8 4 0 08 wichita variety with a shorter growing season than other popular pecan varieties of new mexico was selected for this study byford 2005 the same trees were utilized for the two seasons 2 2 experimental design and treatments twelve pots were randomly distributed in a completely randomized design three water treatments were used to irrigate the pecan trees these treatments were brackish groundwater bgw electrical conductivity 4 0 ds m reverse osmosis concentrates ro electrical conductivity 8 ds m and fabian garcia available water electrical conductivity 0 8 ds m table 1 the sar for all irrigation water was 5 1 some cation and anion concentrations are given in table 1 bgw and ro concentrate water were retrieved from bgndrf in alamogordo 32 53 04 n 105 58 37 w these two treatments were selected to create levels of salinity with the control every 14 days the pecan trees were irrigated with 7 l of treatment waters including two teaspoons of tracite foliar npk helena chemical collierville tn as a fertilizer the trees were irrigated 15 times each season all pecan trees were sprayed with insecticides four times each season due to the common infection with white and green aphids in southern new mexico admire pro imidacloprid was sprayed once in july august and september sivanto propylene carbonate was sprayed once in october the plants were moved out of the greenhouse at the end of the first season to expose trees to the natural frost during the winter season 2 3 plant growth and gas exchange parameters the height and stem diameter of the pecan trees were measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment using a meter scale and vernier caliper respectively stem diameters were measured at the breast level the li cor 6400 portable gas exchange system li cor biosciences inc lincoln ne was used to measure the photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance at 50 cm and 110 cm height above the soil surface of the pecan trees leaves for flow rate and co2 the li cor 6400 portable system was adjusted at 400 μmol s 1 and 400 μmol mol 1 respectively the source of light was 6400 02b and the photosynthetic active radiation par was between 998 to 1000 the measurements were made using leaves that cover the chamber at both 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface on sunny days between 10 30 am and 2 30 pm in august september and november 2017 and 2018 2 4 leaf ion content for leaf ion content random leaf samples were collected three times from the pecan trees in august september and november 2017 and 2018 the samples were air dried fine grounded using a grinder and packed in small bags the samples were then sent to agsource laboratories lincoln ne to be analyzed according to us environmental protection agency staff 1982 sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated based on robbins 1983 using the following equation s a r n a 1 c a 2 m g 2 2 where na is sodium ion concentration meq l ca is calcium ion concentration meq l and mg is magnesium ion concentration meq l 2 5 leaf chlorophyll content and stem water potential to determine the effects of the saline water on chlorophyll content of the pecan leaves spad 502 chlorophyll meter was used rodriguez and miller 2000 leaves that fit in the instrument were randomly chosen and reading were recorded the measurements were taken in august september and november 2017 and 2018 stem water potential of the pecan trees was determined using the pms pressure chamber model 1000 pms instrument company albany oregon mccutchan and shackel 1992 branches with leaves were bagged in a foil laminate material similar to mylar provided with the instrument and left around 20 30 min the bagged branches were cut lifting a part of the branch out of the bag the bag was placed into the pressure chamber and locked tightly nitrogen gas was slowly released from the gas tank until the water bubbles came out from the branch and the reading was recorded measurements were made on sunny days between noon to 2 30 pm the measurements were made in august september and november 2017 and 2018 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental design was a completely randomized design with four replications all statistical analyses were performed using sas software v 9 4 data on plant gas exchange parameters and ions content were subjected to analysis of variance using proc mixed procedure tested the effects of treatments across all times differences due to treatments on plant growth height and diameter chlorophyll content and stem water potential were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and means were separated using least significant difference lsd chlorophyll content and stem water potential were then subjected to linear regression analysis to examine the salinity levels effects over the entire period of the experiment an alpha level of 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 greenhouse meteorology during the first season of the experiment in 2017 the temperature inside the greenhouse ranged between 19 5 and 36 4 c and relative humidity between 7 9 and 90 5 during the second season in 2018 temperature inside the greenhouse ranged between 11 18 and 42 39 c and the relative humidity between 6 7 and 93 fig 1 a b the mean variations in air temperature and relative humidity were similar 3 2 plant growth the means of pecans heights and diameters are shown in table 2 no statistically significant differences in the height or diameter of pecan trees were observed at α 0 05 during every growing season from may to december 2017 and 2018 this suggested that saline water did not significantly affect the plant growth during the experiment period during the first season 2017 the net change in plant height and diameter in control treatment were 6 cm and 0 68 mm respectively with bgw irrigation the net change in height and diameter were 3 62 cm and 0 6 mm respectively and with ro irrigation the net change in height and diameter were 6 cm and 1 13 mm respectively table 3 during the second season in control treatment the net change in height and diameter were 3 75 cm and 0 12 mm respectively in bgw the net changes in height and diameter were 3 25 cm and 0 65 mm respectively however in ro irrigated pots a net decrease of 2 75 cm in height but a net increase of 0 09 mm in diameter was observed table 3 3 3 plant gas exchange parameters differences among the three treatments at α 0 05 on the gas exchange parameters at 50 cm and 110 cm of the pecan trees leaves were observed during the three measurement times on august september and november the control treatment had the highest photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate on all measurement times on the two seasons 2017 and 2018 while the ro treatment had the lowest rate table 4 photosynthetic rates at 50 cm above the soil surface of the pecan trees leaves during the first season showed the highest rate with control irrigation 7 98 0 45 μmol m2 s on november 2017 whereas the lowest rate was with bgw irrigation 1 23 0 45 μmol m2 s on august 2017 table 4 on the contrary the highest photosynthetic rate at 110 cm above the soil surface was with control concentrate irrigation 8 01 0 89 μmol m2 s followed by bgw irrigation 6 04 0 89 μmol m2 s on november 2017 table 4 during the second season control treatment continued higher at 50 cm above the soil surface the highest rate was with control irrigation 4 43 0 41 μmol m2 s on november 2018 table 4 also at 110 cm above the soil surface the highest photosynthetic rate was with control irigation 4 43 0 41 μmol m2 s on august 2018 whereas the lowest rate was with bgw irrigation 0 43 0 65 μmol m2 s on september 2018 table 4 the transpiration rate at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the pecan trees generally showed increases over time during the first season table 4 the highest transpiration rate was with control irrigation 2 62 0 37 mol m2 s followed by bgw irrigation 1 87 0 37 mol m2 s at 50 cm above the soil surface whereas the highest rate was with bgw irrigation 2 41 0 34 mol m2 s followed by control irrigation 1 58 0 34 mol m2 s at 110 cm above the soil surface table 4 during the second season fluctuations in the transpiration rate over time can be observed however the rate decreased slightly at both 50 cm and 110 cm of the trees height table 4 the stomatal conductance rate during the first season showed differences at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the plants leaves table 4 the rate generally increased over time for the three treatments the rate for control irrigation was the highest followed by bgw irrigation at 0 090 0 01 and 0 060 0 01 mmol m2 s respectively at 110 cm of the plants the rates had the same trend however the rate increase was lower at 50 cm of the plants during the second season at 50 cm and 110 cm above the soil surface of the plants no differences were observed among the three treatments by time table 4 3 4 chlorophyll content irrigation treatments influenced pecan leaf chlorophyll content during both the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 2 a b for each growing season leaf chlorophyll content was highest for pecan trees irrigated with control solution and lowest for pecan trees irrigated with ro concentrate this suggested that increases in irrigation water salinity level decreases the leaf chlorophyll content during the first season strong linear relationships between day of the year and spad reading chlorophyll content were observed for each treatment however ro concentrate showed the strongest with r2 0 84 compared with control treatment r2 0 79 during the second season however the linear relationship was stronger for the control treatment with r2 0 72 compared to r2 0 45 for the ro concentrate 3 5 stem water potential stem leaf water potential was smaller with ro concentrate irrigation followed by bgw for the two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 fig 3 a b increases in stem water potential over time were observed for all the three treatments during the two seasons however ro concentrate showed the strongest linear relationship with r2 0 49 followed by bgw with r2 0 36 compared with control r2 0 22 in the first season this relationship was stronger in the second season for bgw with r2 0 92 and ro with r2 0 88 compared with r2 0 04 for the control 3 6 leaf ions concentrations tables 5 and 6 show the differences of the leaf ions content and sar for the first season 2017 no differences in magnesium content among the treatments were observed table 5 the highest concentration of calcium ion was with ro concentrate 0 15 0 01 meq l followed by bgw 0 14 0 01 meq l in september 2017 table 5 sodium ion concentration was higher with ro concentrate 0 056 0 00 meq l followed by bgw 0 027 0 00 meq l in november at the end of the first season table 5 the results showed increasing sodium ions concentration with increasing irrigation duration sar values were different among treatments and showed a slight increase with ro concentrate irrigation table 5 no differences in phosphorus and potassium ions were observed table 6 the greatest sulfur concentration of 0 018 0 00 meq l was with the control irrigation followed by ro concentrate 0 017 0 00 meq l in september 2017 table 6 the zinc ion concentration was highest 11 54 1 98 meq l with control irrigation in august followed by ro concentrate irrigation 10 38 3 68 meq l in november 2017 table 6 in the second season 2018 in general no differences were observed among the three treatments in all the ions concentrations except the chloride ions tables 7 and 8 the greatest chloride concentration was with bgw irrigation 0 035 0 00 meq l followed by ro concentration 0 027 0 00 meq l in november 2018 table 7 as the sar was lower than 13 the solutions were considered neither saline nor sodic for the second season 2018 4 discussion one bgw and one ro concentrate irrigated trees went to dormancy stage after three irrigations during the first season however at the beginning of the second season they had normal bud break the average height and diameter of the pecans did not significantly differ among the three treatments in this study for 2017 and 2018 seasons differences in net growth of pecan trees were observed and net growth during 2018 was less than that in 2017 for all irrigation treatments ro irrigated trees showed a net decrease in growth during 2018 season similar height decreases with increasing irrigation salinity levels are reported for barley hordeum vulgare l hussain et al 1997 and chili pepper capsicum annuum l baath et al 2017 alvarez et al 2018 reported decreases in height and growth with mastic tree pistacia lentiscus with nacl dominant irrigation water 4 ds m decreases in olive trees growth with increasing soil salinity were also reported by mousavi et al 2019 other studies showed decreased shoot lengths for salt grass species distichlis spicata l in desert region pessarakli 2011 prairie cordgrass and switchgrass kim et al 2012 miyamoto et al 1986 reported that soil salinity level of 3 5 ds m can reduce pecans growth by 25 while branch die back occur at soil salinity levels of 5 ds m and pecan trees may die when soil salinity exceeds 6 ds m in contrast in this study overall plant growth was not significantly affected by increasing water salinity levels for the two growing seasons the reason could be the age of the pecan trees 4 years old which gave them the ability to develop mechanism to acclimate to increasing irrigation water salinity dormancy was an option for the pecan trees to avoid the unfavorable conditions in this study pecan photosynthetic rate was significantly affected by increasing salinity levels of irrigation water in general as the salinity level increased by increasing the irrigation duration the photosynthetic rates decreased during both seasons 2017 and 2018 this might be due to salt accumulation in the pecan trees leaves that cause inhibition in photosynthetic rate reduction in net carbon fixation due to increase in salinity immediately affected photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll al taee 2018 a similar trend was found with marsh grass spartina alterniflora where the photosynthetic rate was decreased by the increase of water salinity ge et al 2014 reduction in photosynthetic and transpiration rates was the result of applying saline water on tomato yang et al 2019 this was similar with our findings with pecan trees our results agreed with the results reported by mousavi et al 2019 where photosynthetic rate decreased by increasing soil salinity on olive trees exposed to nacl irrigation water and with turfgrass eremochloa ophiuroides li et al 2018 some perennials citrus and grapevines accumulated cl ions in the shoots and inhibited photosynthesis while na ions stored in the root and stem flowers and yeo 1988 decreases in photosynthetic rate with increasing salinity levels on sarcocornia fruticose halophytes plant was reported by redondo gomez et al 2006 whereas increases in another halophyte panicum turgidum photosynthetic rate with increasing salinity levels to 14 ds m was reported koyro et al 2013 another study indicated that irrigation with 3 ds m saline water decreased photosynthetic and stomatal conductance rate for chili pepper capsicum annuum l baath et al 2017 to control the spread of aphids admire pro was applied on july august and september this as a result caused the reduction in photosynthetic transpiration and stomatal conductance rates on august and september for all the three treatments in both seasons this chemical coated the leaf area for long time causing that reduction in photosynthetic transpiration and stomatal conductance rates on the contrary sivanto insecticide sprayed on october did not cause any reduction on november 2017 and 2018 reduction on plant gas exchange parameters due to admire pro application has been reported gonzalez delgado et al 2017 pecan trees treated with organo silicon surfactant showed reduction in photosynthetic rate after 14 days of the treatments wood et al 1997 because stomatal opening affects transpiration rates transpiration and stomatal conductance trends among these variables were similar among treatments the decrease in stomatal conductance rate because of the salt accumulation caused the decrease in transpiration rate for the 2017 and 2018 seasons to reduce the salinity effects plants tend to reduce stomatal conductance to maintain low salts levels on the leaves alvarez et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 and yang et al 2019 reported similar decrease in stomatal and transpiration rate with tomato irrigated saline water our results agreed with the results reported by khataar et al 2018 with bean and wheat irrigated with cacl and nacl on the contrary other study showed increases in transpiration rates with increasing salinity level to 13 5 ds m koyro et al 2013 in this study chlorophyll content was highly affected by increasing salinity decreases in chlorophyll content was observed with increasing water salinity level increases in magnesium with ro concentrate irrigation decreased the leaf chlorophyll content positive correlation has been reported between plant chlorophyll content and calcium magnesium and chloride concentrations al taee 2018 taffouo et al 2010 shimul et al 2014 and zhang et al 2016 reported that decreases in tomato leaves chlorophyll content was observed with increasing water salinity level and that agreed with our study in agreement with our results avocado persea americana showed decreases in leaf chlorophyll content when irrigated with nacl solution for 5 months alvarez acosta et al 2018 irrigation with nacl solution was the reason of the decrease in centipedegrass eremochloa ophiuroides leaf chlorophyll content li et al 2018 changes in water potential can be an indicator of changes in ion concentration hussain et al 2014 plants perform best when irrigated with fresh water that does not cause increases in soil salinity in our observations stem water potential was always lower and caused higher water stress on the pecan trees compared with bgw and control treatments this could be because of the decrease in root water uptake due the increase in irrigation water salinity alvarez et al 2018 reported decreases in leaf water potential on pistacia lentiscus and hussain et al 2014 reported decreases in stem water potential on marsh grass with increasing salinity yang et al 2019 mentioned that adaptation of the plant to salinity leads to alterations in the absorption ejection and isolation of ions as well as the synthesis of compatible solutions to maintain cellular balance specific amounts of ions are needed for plants to grow and function perfectly and increases in these ions amounts can affect the plant negatively because of the need for water for plants life more ions concentrations are gained with water uptake as the irrigation water ions content increased this study showed increases in sodium concentration in the leaf with increasing salinity level with ro concentrate and were consistent with other studies on spartina alterniflora redondo gomez et al 2010 and phlomis purpurea plants alvarez et al 2012 pecan trees are susceptible to salt damage especially to sodium na and chloride cl leaf tip burn was the symptom of pecan trees affected by sodium whereas chloride affected trees exhibit extensive foliage burn miyamoto et al 1986 acosta rangel et al 2019 mentioned that avocado persea americana leaves showed partial burns upon irrigation with saline water ec 1 5 ds m due to cl accumulation from the visual observations in our study the edges of the leaves began to show signs of burning brown color after the fourth irrigation with bgw and ro concentrate in the first season however plants also grew new leaves fig 4 during the second season more burnt leaves and leaf loss were observed from trees irrigated with saline water especially the ro concentrate branches die back began to occur during late august after the eighth irrigation with ro concentrate in the first season and that continued to increase during the second season epstein and bloom 2005 reported that enzymes activation depends on magnesium and scholberg and locascio 1999 mentioned that increases in salinity increased magnesium concentration of tomato and snap bean phaseolus vulgaris l this can cause decrease in chlorophyll content that reflect on the photosynthetic rate in contrast increases in salinity decreased pistacia vera l mg 2 concentration rahneshan et al 2018 calcium can reduce sodium absorption managing the selection of sodium over potassium and the decrease in calcium can increase the percentage of sodium in the soil epstein and bloom 2005 rahneshan et al 2018 stated that the role of ca 2 in mitigating salt toxicity is associated with the selective effect of k na by controlling the flow of na through non selective ion channels the decrease in ca 2 can cause risk to plants growth in this study calcium significantly increased with increasing water salinity with ro concentrate because it was calcium dominant our result agreed with a previous study where the ca 2 increased in the shoot of pistacia vera l rahneshan et al 2018 non significant differences were observed with phosphorus and the concentration remained steady with the three treatments hussain et al 2014 reported decreases in phosphorus concentration with increasing salinity any decrease in phosphorus can cause salient problem for the plant protein and cell signaling epstein and bloom 2005 and affect pistachio seedlings rahneshan et al 2018 potassium is an important element for the photosynthetic process because it activates enzymes involved with adenosine triphosphate atp production thereby contributing to the regulation of photosynthesis epstein and bloom 2005 the presence of sodium can eliminate potassium uptake hussain et al 2014 formentin et al 2018 in this study the potassium concentration decreased with increasing water salinity due to increases in sodium concentration sulfur deficiency can affect both chlorophyll and protein synthesis mccauley et al 2011 in this study however no differences among the three treatment were seen and the trend was similar for all the three treatments during the two seasons however zinc concentration increased with ro concentration in this study and this highly reflected on the chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate hu and sparks 1991 also reported reduction in leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate due to zn deficiency in pecan tree heerema 2013 reported recommended ranges of some important ions for pecan leaf including phosphorus 0 013 0 018 meq l potassium 0 035 0 639 meq l magnesium 0 024 0 049 meq l calcium 0 044 0 089 meq l sulfur 0 009 0 022 meq l and zinc 1 529 3 059 meq l compared to this study tables 5 6 in the first season p and mg ions were within the recommended range for all the three treatments k was lower than the recommended range with bgw ca and zn were higher than the recommended ranges for all the three treatments however bgw and ro were higher than the recommended range in s content by increasing the number of irrigations in the second season tables 7 8 p mg and zn increased over the range with ro concentrate irrigation k and s ions were in the range however the control showed increases in the ca ions content from all the above one time deficit in k ions was recorded with bgw irrigation in the first season however in the second season this ion was in the range overall pecan is sensitive to higher ion concentrations and continuous application of calcium dominated ro is not recommended 5 conclusion the use of calcium dominated ro concentrate in irrigation pecans can reduce the cost of the disposal as well as the water demand in southern new mexico the results of this study promoted the possibility of using this valuable source of water in arid and semi arid areas at least for one season there were no differences in pecan s growth height and diameter irrigated with 0 8 4 0 and 8 0 ds m pecans were significantly affected by irrigation with calcium dominated bgw and ro concentrate with reductions in gas exchange parameters the soil irrigated with ro remained wet for longer time than the control and the bgw and the amount of water needed to irrigate the pecans was less and facilitated more leaching than control in this study 50 of the pecan trees irrigated with ro concentrate and 75 of the pecan trees irrigated with bgw survived the two seasons and even the 25 was in dormancy at the end of the second season pecan trees showed some stunting during the second season and that is expected to increase with longer irrigation periods therefore continuous

10547,high groundwater levels in urban and irrigated areas around the world can lead to infrastructure damage land degradation and crop yield reduction causes can include groundwater flooding due to fluvial processes excess rainfall and irrigation inadequate subsurface drainage and additional sources such as injection and seepage from earthen canals and recharge ponds the principal causes of shallow water tables however are difficult to quantify due to the inter connectedness of all possible causes this paper presents a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in highly managed irrigated stream aquifer systems using a combination of numerical groundwater flow modeling and global sensitivity analysis gsa tools a tested modflow groundwater model and sobol gsa methods are used to simulate and then quantify the influence of all major groundwater stresses on water table elevation for a region in northern colorado usa experiencing high groundwater levels with results showing that recharge from surface water irrigation canal seepage and groundwater pumping have the strongest influence on water table elevation whereas precipitation recharge and recharge from groundwater irrigation have small influences time series sensitivity plots quantify the seasonality of these influences over a decadal period and spatial sensitivity plots indicate regions that are strongly influenced by individual stresses results from best management practice bmp implementation indicate that limiting canal seepage and transitioning 50 of cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1 5 m 3 m over a 5 year period leading to beneficial conditions for crop growth in the root zone and dewatering of subsurface infrastructure these methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide however proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local state or national water law keywords groundwater waterlogging numerical modeling sensitivity analysis 1 introduction high groundwater levels can have severe adverse physical economic and environmental consequences in both urban and agricultural areas including damage to infrastructure land degradation and salinization through waterlogging and productivity and health of rivers the cause of shallow water tables can be due to an assortment of natural and anthropogenic causes including excess rainfall river flooding and accompanying infiltration seepage from earthen irrigation canals poor drainage or lack of proper artificial drainage low permeability soils presence of shallow impermeable clay or rock layers improper irrigation management and rising sea levels adjacent to coastal aquifers burkhalter and gates 2005 cox and mcfarlane 1990 1995 oude essink et al 2010 singh et al 2012 tawhid 2004 xiuling 2001 damages from groundwater flooding in urban areas include sewage system infiltration buildings and infrastructure kreibich et al 2009 basements of buildings schinke et al 2012 and road infrastructure knott et al 2018 2017 whereas damages in agricultural areas include soil salinization and crop yield reductions grassini et al 2007 milroy et al 2009 singh and panda 2013 singh 2015 groundwater levels can rise in coastal areas due to sea level rise leading to soil salinization ascott et al 2017 oude essink et al 2010 ascott et al 2017 provided a methodology to improve understanding of groundwater flooding at the regional scale due to fluvial flooding in england they found that controls on the spatio temporal extent of groundwater flooding are poorly understood but main controls in their study region include antecedent soil moisture conditions rainfall and catchment hydrogeological properties zhang et al 2019 again studying groundwater flooding found that controls are rainfall intensity land surface topography and distance to surface water controls on water table elevation and waterlogging at the regional scale in agricultural has not been systematically performed field surveys and informal interviews can assist in diagnosing the problem tawhid 2004 as was done in the urban groundwater flooding study of kreibich et al 2009 in dresden germany field studies of soil profile and landscape measurement of local climate cox and mcfarlane 1995 water budget analysis and correlation analysis between groundwater head and potential causes jaber et al 2006 can provide approximate contribution of system components to water table elevation however investigating the controls on water table elevation has not yet been performed in an agricultural setting at the regional scale wherein hydrology is complicated by human influences of irrigation and water conveyance the objective of this paper is to present a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in a highly managed irrigated stream aquifer system this is performed through numerical groundwater flow modeling and the use of global sensitivity analysis gsa to rank and quantify the influence of principal groundwater stresses on water able elevation in space and time the method is applied to a 246 km2 agricultural region in northern colorado usa that has recently experienced groundwater flooding of infrastructure e g flooding basements in residential areas flooding of wastewater treatment ponds and cultivated fields time series and maps of sensitivity for each groundwater stress also are provided leading to targeted management practices canal sealing conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation that are investigated for decadal impact on water table elevation 2 methods the general method of identifying causes of waterlogging is illustrated for a region within the south platte river basin colorado usa an overview of the study area is provided first followed by a presentation of the modflow model construction and testing and the application of global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method finally application of best management practices bmp to lower water table elevation in the region are presented 2 1 study area the study area encompasses a 246 km2 region located 64 km northeast of denver colorado within the south plate river basin fig 1 a and specifically within the conductive quaternary alluvium of the basin the area includes the towns of gilcrest and lasalle with a total population of about 3500 the study area is used mainly for agricultural use the main crops are corn alfalfa grass pasture the irrigation type is approximately 50 flood irrigation and 50 sprinkler irrigation with the irrigation season from april through october and irrigation water obtained from four irrigation canals diverting water from the south platte river or from the alluvial aquifer fig 1b shows the location of gilcrest and lasalle the south platte river the four irrigation canals and the location of the 340 pumping wells green dots many wells have pumping rates higher than 5450 m3 day 1000 gal min within the appropriation doctrine of colorado water law the majority of the pumping wells are junior in water right to users of the south platte river and therefore any streamflow depletion induced by pumping must be replaced by other sources of water this has led to the construction of recharge ponds in the area blue dots in fig 1b with the recharge from these ponds and the resulting rise in groundwater gradient and groundwater discharge to the south platte river used to offset the pumping induced streamflow depletion within the past 10 15 years groundwater levels in the region have risen leading to flooded basements waterlogging of cultivated fields and failure of septic systems fig 2 a shows the estimated depth to water table m during fall 2012 based on water level measurements in the network of 40 monitoring wells green dots in fig 2a these wells were installed by four organizations the central colorado water conservancy district the colorado division of water resources colorado state university and the south platte decision support system areas in red on the map have extremely shallow water tables 1 5 m below ground surface and areas in orange have a water table between 1 5 and 3 m below ground surface time series of water table depth m for three of the wells are shown in fig 2b d demonstrating that shallow groundwater has occurred for several decades in some parts of the study area but others have experienced a dramatic rise in groundwater level in general main groundwater inputs include recharge from irrigation events surface water and groundwater sources recharge from rainfall events seepage from earthen irrigation canals and recharge pond recharge groundwater outputs include pumping evapotranspiration in areas of shallow water table and discharge to the south platte river the volumes of these sources and sinks vary annually based on weather patterns water rights and local management decisions 2 2 geology of the study area in the study area the south platte river alluvial aquifer is a heterogeneous geologic unit composed of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay underlain by low permeability bedrock shale aquifer thickness varies from 0 to more than 30 m with most of the area having a thickness of 15 25 m shale outcrops in several locations along the mid south boundary of the study area a digital elevation model dem of the study area is shown in fig 3 a the topography includes a broad fluvial valley along the south platte river the land surface has an elevation of 1510 m in the south lowering to an elevation of 1410 m in the northeast within the south platte river channel highly permeable deposits are found in the central part of the aquifer groundwater flow is generally from south to north following the topography with groundwater discharging to the south platte river barkmann et al 2014 in a previous study investigating groundwater levels in the region barkmann et al 2014 450 boreholes were drilled to explore the three dimensional material structure of the aquifer fig 4 a b borehole data are classified as clay silt sand gravel and mixed types for 7 material types in general the aquifer material is coarser sand gravel near the south platte river these borehole data were used in this study to create a three dimensional 3d material map which is then used to obtain a 3d hydraulic conductivity k map for the modflow model see section 2 3 ordinary kriging is employed to interpolate between the borehole locations kriging for the 3d aquifer system is performed using the stanford geostatistical modeling software sgems remy et al 2009 a 3d cartesian grid with 120 120 50 cells is built in sgems to fully represent the aquifer there are 10 vertical layers evenly distributed between the surface and the bedrock the thickness of the layers ranges from 1 to 3 m each soil type is assigned a k value initial values are shown in table 1 and a 3d ellipsoid is defined to determine the size of the local neighbors around the estimation points 3d kriging is then performed within the ellipsoid of each estimation point to provide each grid cell with an interpolated k value the horizontal and vertical variograms of k of the borehole data are plotted and shown in fig 4c and d to show the spatial continuity of the aquifer material data the higher the variogram values γ is the less similarity between data points as the distance between data points increases lag there are less similarities and reaches a point beyond which there is no more spatial correlation the lag at this point is called the range two exponential models are fitted for the horizontal and vertical directions the vertical range for the borehole data is 30 m whereas the horizontal range is 1970 m fig 5 shows the estimate material map for layers near the top middle and bottom portions of the aquifer the aquifer material is more conductive sand and gravel near the south platte river shown along the north of the study area in black squares pockets of clay are present in more abundance in the middle layer and the bottom of the aquifer has more sand and gravel areas fig 5 lower right hand map also shows the distribution of clay in the area clay layers have accumulated around the mid south portion and east boundary of the model 2 3 numerical groundwater flow modeling 2 3 1 modflow model construction the modflow flow model constructed for the study region has grid cells of 152 4m 152 4m resulting in 120 rows and 120 columns the aquifer is discretized vertically by 10 layers with the top elevation of the first layer extracted from the dem see fig 3a and the bottom of the lowest layer formed from the base of each borehole see fig 4b model active cells are shown in fig 3b and represent the extent of the alluvial aquifer all groundwater source and sink data are provided by a modflow flow of the entire south platte alluvial aquifer system brown and caldwell 2017 constructed in conjunction with the colorado division of water sources south platte decision support system these data are obtained from reported and measured flow rates and structure diversions recharge pond seepage agricultural pumping m i pumping or are estimated using water balance tools precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge canal seepage lateral flow from surrounding aquifers upflow from the underlying bedrock aquifer pumping data is mostly collected through cdss colorado decision support system pumping is simulated as well package and placed in the mid of the aquifer in the moflow model surface water recharge and groundwater recharge are calculated using pre processing routines in which recharge is the difference between applied irrigation rates and the resulting surface runoff and crop evapotranspiration et precipitation recharge surface water recharge and groundwater recharge are all applied to the top layer cells for each stress period canal seepage is obtained by multiplying river diversion rates by a pre determined factor brown and caldwell 2017 the modflow psb partition stress boundary package zeiler et al 2017 was used in which each groundwater stress can be partitioned into separate inputs for example precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge canal seepage recharge and recharge pond seepage are differentiated from general recharge as is the case with typical modflow codes and models using this package the water balance output by the modflow model also partitions stresses into the separate components thereby allowing for more detailed analysis of groundwater inputs outputs initial values of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for each grid cell were based on the material maps generated from the borehole data see figs 4 and 5 these initial values were modified during model calibration see section 2 3 2 specified head boundary conditions are applied along the north boundary and south boundary of the model the head along these boundaries are derived from the historical records of monitoring wells and output from the basin wide groundwater model brown and caldwell 2017 the western boundary of the model is the south platte river streamflow in the river is simulated using modflow s stream flow routing sfr package the sfr package uses a stream water budget and manning s equation to compute the stream flow rate and depth prudic et al 2004 30 reaches and 516 segments are ordered and numbered based on the flow direction with each grid cell designated as a river segment stream width was set to 45 m the riverbed conductance m2 day was calculated using the river length in each cell the hydraulic conductivity of the cell and the streambed thickness assumed to be 1 5 m the sfr package is also used to simulate streamflow in beebe draw see fig 1b using a stream width of 6 m 2 3 2 model simulation and calibration the model runs from 1950 to 2012 using monthly stress periods with 10 time steps per stress period the calibration and testing periods are 1950 2000 and 2000 2012 respectively the initial groundwater head for each grid cell is obtained by interpolating the historical groundwater level from monitoring wells at the beginning of the simulation the model is run using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 the mass balance error of the simulation is 0 45 the model was calibrated using the pest parameter estimation software doherty 2007 pest employs monte carlo methodology to select random parameter values uses a regularization process to attain the uniqueness of calibrated parameters values and uses nonlinear parameter estimation techniques to minimize the residual between observed and simulated values the model is run multiple times to obtain the jacobian matrix which contains the set of partial derivatives of all observations with respect to the changes in model parameter values pest then uses the calculated matrix to provide an improved set of parameters the process continues until residuals are minimized in this study values of aquifer properties are modified by pest to minimize the residual between simulated and observed groundwater heads observed head values are obtained from the network of 40 observation wells in the study region see fig 2 there are in total 1870 groundwater level measurements during 1950 2012 with 652 observations available in the 1950 2000 calibration period and 1218 in the 2000 2012 testing period the sixteen aquifer parameters provided to pest are listed in table 1 along with their maximum value minimum value and final calibrated value aquifer properties included are horizontal hydraulic conductivity k m day specific yield sy vertical anisotropy kv kh ratio and specific storage ss 1 m each grid cell in the model domain is assigned a material type clay clay silt silt silt sand sand sand gravel gravel and an initial k and sy value based on the results of the 3d kriging interpolation see section 2 2 and fig 5 the set of cells belonging to each material type is assigned as a parameter zone with values for each zone updated during the pest calibration process the pest estimation model is employed in the calibration and therefore the solution of the inverse problem is based on the gauss marquardt levenberg method doherty 2015 parallelization was implemented using 10 machines run in parallel to populate the jacobian matrix 2 4 identifying governing groundwater stresses once calibrated and tested the modflow model was used to quantify the influence of groundwater stresses on water table elevation these stresses are precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge groundwater pumping canal seepage and recharge pond seepage these stresses are spatially and temporally distributed within the study area and through the 1950 2012 simulation period the quantification is performed using the sobol method sobol 2001 which provides a quantitative estimate of parameter influence on model output the sobol method is a variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa in which variances of model output are decomposed into fractions attributed to each input first order indices and their interactions second or higher order indices the sensitivity index si is calculated as 1 s i i v a r e y x i v a r y 2 s i i j v a r e y x i x j v a r e y x i v a r e y x j v a r y 3 s i t i s i i j i s i i j j i k j s i i j k where xi is the ith input and y is the output sii siij siijk are the first order second order and third order indices and siti is the total order index sobol s total order sensitivity counts the variances caused by each input variable independently and the interactions with other input variables in all the orders to the output variances in this study the total order index siti is used to represent the influence of the 6 groundwater stresses a total of 224 parameter sets are generated using this method as each groundwater stress varies in space i e cell to cell variation and in time different values for each stress period each input value is scaled on a percentage basis from 0 to 150 of the original value for example all groundwater pumping rates are multiplied by a percentage value resulting in a change in model simulated groundwater head simulations are run only for the 2000 2012 period the sensitivity measure of each groundwater stress is calculated 1 temporally for each simulation stress period and 2 spatially for each modflow grid cell for 1 groundwater head is averaged over all grid cells for each stress period with the change in head related to the change in the groundwater stress value for 2 the groundwater head in each active grid cell is averaged across all stress periods to provide a single value thereby yielding a map of spatially varying sensitivity for each groundwater stress to our knowledge this is a new technique that can provide valuable insights into the spatial controls on water table elevation maps are generated for periods pre and post 2006 during which year many irrigation pumping wells were shut off due to potential effects on streamflow in the south platte river 2 5 effect of best management practices bmps on water table elevation results from the gsa pointed to effective management practices that could lower the water table the modflow model therefore is also used to explore the effect of these identified best management practices bmps based on results shown in section 3 2 these practices are 1 line canals with sealant to prevent canal seepage as canal seepage is simulated using a recharge source this is performed in the model by setting these values to 0 2 change the source of irrigation from surface water to groundwater pumping for all fields currently using canal water this is performed by turning off surface water recharge for these cells increasing groundwater pumping and adding the expected groundwater recharge from the enhanced groundwater pumping for this practice irrigation efficiency is assumed to be 67 this scenario assumes that no augmentation is required i e that enhanced streamflow depletion caused by the additional groundwater pumping does not need to be replaced 3 install subsurface drains to lower the water table particularly in the area around the town of gilcrest which has experienced groundwater levels 1 5 m from the ground surface see fig 1b this is performed using modflow s drain package combinations of these practices also are simulated for example combining 1 and 2 since canal seepage will not occur if canals are not needed to convey irrigation water to fields also 2 is implemented in increments from 10 to 100 conversion of surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation for all scenarios head results are compared with results from the original 2000 2012 simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general model results the pest calibration process improved model accuracy by 15 the final calibrated values for each of the 16 aquifer properties are listed in table 1 1 1 plots of measured groundwater head vs simulated groundwater head are shown in fig 6 for the calibration period 1950 2000 and the testing period 2000 2012 for the calibration period the mean absolute error mae is 1 23 m and the root mean square error rmse is 1 74 m the histogram of residuals difference between measured and simulated also is shown showing that most of the residuals are 3 m with an average residual mean of errors of 0 22 m plots for the testing validation period also are shown with mae 1 34 m rmse 1 65 m and the average residual 0 36 m fig 7 shows time series plot of simulated depth to water table blue line vs observed red dots at four different locations over the study area knowing that the average aquifer thickness in this region is 18 27 m the residuals between simulated and measured head values indicate that the modflow model simulates the groundwater system in a reasonable manner this is also shown through a comparison water table and groundwater flow maps generated by measured data and model output shown in fig 8 fig 8a and b show the estimated water table contour map for spring 2012 from measurements taken from the 40 observation wells cgs 2013 and the contour map from model values both maps show the same trend with groundwater flowing from the south to north to discharge to the south platte river and similar values of groundwater hydraulic gradient fig 8c and d show the spatial distribution of water table depth for spring 2012 conditions with the map on the left showing an interpolation from groundwater head at observation wells cgs 2013 and the map on the right showing cell by cell results from the modflow model red and orange colors indicate areas of shallow 3 m water table in general the simulated results capture the principal patterns in the system with shallow water table in the areas along the south platte river beebe draw near the town of gilcrest and in the region to the northeast of gilcrest and south of la salle the modflow model simulates a region of shallow water table to the south of gilcrest near the irrigation canals which is not present in the cgs map however as shown in fig 2 there are no observation wells in this area and hence the actual groundwater levels are not known however due to seepage from the two irrigation canals high groundwater levels likely are present thus coinciding with the modflow results in general simulated spatial distribution of groundwater levels demonstrate model accuracy the yearly averaged water balance of the aquifer for 2000 2012 is shown in table 2 the first two columns show the flux rate in m3 day and the last two columns show flux values normalized to the lowest value gw sw interactions source i e seepage from the south platte river to the aquifer in the table pumping wells source include recharge from canal seepage and recharge ponds as the well package in modflow was used to simulate these processes the largest source term is recharge 3 34 and the largest sink term is discharge to the south platte river 4 93 this interaction between the aquifer and the river is shown further in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows two cross sections through the model domain showing the ground surface elevation from the dem the water table elevation simulated by modflow and the river surface simulated by modflow both cross sections show a strong groundwater gradient towards the river leading to groundwater discharge to the south platte river fig 10 shows the influence of groundwater pumping on these interactions with fig 10a showing the relationship between groundwater discharge return flow and pumping and fig 10b showing the relationship between pumping and river depth as seen in fig 10a when pumping is high e g 2002 return flows are decreased as pumping decreases the groundwater gradient and therefore decreases the rate of groundwater discharge to the river when pumping is low 2007 2010 return flows are high and increasing demonstrating the strong connection between the groundwater system and the south platte river from fig 10b high pumping 2002 is correlated with a lower stream depth and vice versa although other factors upstream rainfall and return flow also control stream depth in the model domain 3 2 governing stresses on water table elevation the time dependent measures of si for the six groundwater stresses from 2000 to 2012 using the sobol method are shown in fig 11 results are shown for the entire model domain fig 11a and for the region around the town of gilcrest fig 11b results will be discussed for both the 2000 2006 and 2006 2012 time periods since 2006 marks the transition to lower pumping volumes due to effect of groundwater pumping on streamflow depletion for the entire region fig 11a the order of influence si on water table elevation from highest to lowest for the 2000 2006 time period is on average 1 canal seepage 0 3 2 recharge from surface water irrigation 0 28 3 pumping 0 14 4 recharge from groundwater irrigation 0 003 5 recharge from precipitation 0 02 and 6 recharge pond seepage 0 00 after 2006 the impact of pumping decreases due to the overall decrease in groundwater pumping during 2006 2012 for the 2000 2012 period average si of surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping is 0 37 0 37 and 0 08 respectively during the 2006 2012 period the influence of surface water recharge fluctuates with the irrigation season whereas the seasonal pattern of canal seepage is much more subdued the influence of pumping is more pronounced for the gilcrest area from fig 11b average si of surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping is 0 22 0 30 and 0 17 respectively with canal seepage having the strongest influence on water table elevation however before 2006 pumping has the strongest control on water table elevation followed by canal seepage with surface water recharge having almost no effect whereas after 2006 surface water recharge has almost as strong an effect on water table elevation as canal seepage with the influence of pumping decreasing dramatically the spatial sensitivity maps are shown in fig 12 for surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping maps are shown for both the 2000 2006 left and 2006 2012 right period for canal seepage fig 12a water table elevation is most influenced by canal seepage along the canals in the southern part of the region after 2006 the influence of canal seepage increases near the town of gilcrest values between 0 21 and 0 30 whereas values are 0 to 0 1 for the 2000 2006 period fig 12b likely due to the decreased influence of groundwater pumping not surprisingly the water table elevation in agricultural regions of the study area is most influenced by surface water recharge fig 12c d similar to the influence of canal seepage the influence of surface water recharge increases after 2006 fig 8d due to the decrease in groundwater pumping and increase in surface water irrigation during this time period pumping has the strongest influence on water table elevation around the gilcrest and beebe draw areas fig 12e f but this influence decreases after 2006 in the majority of the study region although similar results could be derived from a spatio temporal analysis of groundwater source and sink data the use of the modflow model and the sobol method allow for more refined temporal and spatial relationships as the influence of sources and sinks on neighboring areas are quantified using flow rate calculations within the modflow solution results indicate that surface water recharge and canal seepage are the primary controls of water table elevation both generally throughout the model domain fig 11 and locally fig 12 therefore management practices should focus on limiting these two stresses as much as possible without harming agricultural productivity as shown from the results in fig 12 these practices could be targeted to local areas or specific stretches of individual irrigation canals 3 3 effect of management practices on water table elevation the results of applying the bmps during the 2000 2012 time periods are shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 shows the decrease in groundwater head water table elevation for each grid cell in the model domain by 2012 for the scenarios of subsurface drainage in the gilcrest area 13a canal sealing 13b surface water irrigation transition to groundwater irrigation 13c and the combination of canal sealing and complete surface water irrigation transition to groundwater irrigation subsurface drainage near the gilcrest area 13a lowers the head by up to 0 6 m and could be a viable solution if implemented generally in the areas of high groundwater levels canal sealing fig 13b lowers the head generally in the area with an average decrease of 1 1 m across the study region by the end of 2012 but decreases up to 4 7 m in the areas between the canals replacing surface water irrigation with groundwater irrigation fig 13c has a strong impact over the cultivated area lowering the head by an average of 3 6 m with decreases up to 15 m if irrigation changes are combined with canal lining 13d the head is lowered by an average of 4 6 m and maximum decreases of 20 m as complete conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation in the study region is not practicable additional scenarios were run to investigate the influence of partial conversion fig 14 shows the time series of model wide average groundwater head for percentages 0 100 of conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation the 0 scenario represents the baseline no change scenario showing the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater head throughout the region between 2000 and 2012 full conversion 100 as shown by the spatial results in fig 13c decreases average water table elevation by 4 6 m by 2012 whereas 50 implementation provides a decrease of approximately 2 4 m however even a decrease of 1 5 m resulting from the 30 implementation scenario would be beneficial to local infrastructure e g house basements wastewater treatment plant lagoons and cultivated fields therefore a combination of sealing along selected reaches of individual canals and a 20 30 transition from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation could lower the water table adequately to prevent groundwater flooding in residential and cultivated areas note that these transition scenarios as simulated are not currently feasible within the context of colorado water law as any increase in groundwater pumping due to conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation requires a plan to replace estimated streamflow depletion i e increase recharge pond seepage or groundwater injection 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a new method to assess the impact of groundwater stresses on water table elevation in waterlogged agricultural areas first a numerical groundwater flow model is constructed and used to simulate groundwater head and groundwater flow with results compared against measured groundwater levels second global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are applied to rank and quantify temporally and spatially the influence of each groundwater stress on water table elevation and third management practices are identified from the gsa results and run with the groundwater flow model to quantify spatio temporal effects on water table elevation for the specified region in northern colorado which has experienced significant groundwater flooding in the past 10 15 years surface water irrigation recharge groundwater irrigation recharge precipitation recharge canal seepage groundwater pumping and recharge pond seepage were analyzed for influence on water table elevation during the 2000 2012 time period results indicate that surface water recharge canal seepage and pumping are the most influential stresses with surface water recharge and canal seepage being the most impactful from 2006 to 2012 with the irrigation canal in the southern part of the study region wielding a particularly strong control on water table elevation in the central cultivated areas management practices based on gsa results indicate that sealing the canals or segments of selected canals and transitioning 30 of the cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1 5 m over a 10 year period if more immediate changes are required the degree of implementation should be increased to 50 these methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide however proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local state or national water law for example in the current study region groundwater and surface water are managed conjunctively as a single water source in colorado water law and hence pumping induced streamflow depletion must be accompanied by an augmentation plan that replaces the depleted river water often through seepage from constructed recharge ponds these recharge ponds increase the local water table gradient increasing the groundwater discharge to the river and thereby theoretically cancelling the effect of the pumping well on streamflow the management practices simulated in this study do not include the need for an augmentation plan therefore results show what could happen if colorado water law were suspended in this region to manage the shallow water table problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10547,high groundwater levels in urban and irrigated areas around the world can lead to infrastructure damage land degradation and crop yield reduction causes can include groundwater flooding due to fluvial processes excess rainfall and irrigation inadequate subsurface drainage and additional sources such as injection and seepage from earthen canals and recharge ponds the principal causes of shallow water tables however are difficult to quantify due to the inter connectedness of all possible causes this paper presents a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in highly managed irrigated stream aquifer systems using a combination of numerical groundwater flow modeling and global sensitivity analysis gsa tools a tested modflow groundwater model and sobol gsa methods are used to simulate and then quantify the influence of all major groundwater stresses on water table elevation for a region in northern colorado usa experiencing high groundwater levels with results showing that recharge from surface water irrigation canal seepage and groundwater pumping have the strongest influence on water table elevation whereas precipitation recharge and recharge from groundwater irrigation have small influences time series sensitivity plots quantify the seasonality of these influences over a decadal period and spatial sensitivity plots indicate regions that are strongly influenced by individual stresses results from best management practice bmp implementation indicate that limiting canal seepage and transitioning 50 of cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1 5 m 3 m over a 5 year period leading to beneficial conditions for crop growth in the root zone and dewatering of subsurface infrastructure these methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide however proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local state or national water law keywords groundwater waterlogging numerical modeling sensitivity analysis 1 introduction high groundwater levels can have severe adverse physical economic and environmental consequences in both urban and agricultural areas including damage to infrastructure land degradation and salinization through waterlogging and productivity and health of rivers the cause of shallow water tables can be due to an assortment of natural and anthropogenic causes including excess rainfall river flooding and accompanying infiltration seepage from earthen irrigation canals poor drainage or lack of proper artificial drainage low permeability soils presence of shallow impermeable clay or rock layers improper irrigation management and rising sea levels adjacent to coastal aquifers burkhalter and gates 2005 cox and mcfarlane 1990 1995 oude essink et al 2010 singh et al 2012 tawhid 2004 xiuling 2001 damages from groundwater flooding in urban areas include sewage system infiltration buildings and infrastructure kreibich et al 2009 basements of buildings schinke et al 2012 and road infrastructure knott et al 2018 2017 whereas damages in agricultural areas include soil salinization and crop yield reductions grassini et al 2007 milroy et al 2009 singh and panda 2013 singh 2015 groundwater levels can rise in coastal areas due to sea level rise leading to soil salinization ascott et al 2017 oude essink et al 2010 ascott et al 2017 provided a methodology to improve understanding of groundwater flooding at the regional scale due to fluvial flooding in england they found that controls on the spatio temporal extent of groundwater flooding are poorly understood but main controls in their study region include antecedent soil moisture conditions rainfall and catchment hydrogeological properties zhang et al 2019 again studying groundwater flooding found that controls are rainfall intensity land surface topography and distance to surface water controls on water table elevation and waterlogging at the regional scale in agricultural has not been systematically performed field surveys and informal interviews can assist in diagnosing the problem tawhid 2004 as was done in the urban groundwater flooding study of kreibich et al 2009 in dresden germany field studies of soil profile and landscape measurement of local climate cox and mcfarlane 1995 water budget analysis and correlation analysis between groundwater head and potential causes jaber et al 2006 can provide approximate contribution of system components to water table elevation however investigating the controls on water table elevation has not yet been performed in an agricultural setting at the regional scale wherein hydrology is complicated by human influences of irrigation and water conveyance the objective of this paper is to present a method to analyze and quantify the cause of high groundwater levels in a highly managed irrigated stream aquifer system this is performed through numerical groundwater flow modeling and the use of global sensitivity analysis gsa to rank and quantify the influence of principal groundwater stresses on water able elevation in space and time the method is applied to a 246 km2 agricultural region in northern colorado usa that has recently experienced groundwater flooding of infrastructure e g flooding basements in residential areas flooding of wastewater treatment ponds and cultivated fields time series and maps of sensitivity for each groundwater stress also are provided leading to targeted management practices canal sealing conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation that are investigated for decadal impact on water table elevation 2 methods the general method of identifying causes of waterlogging is illustrated for a region within the south platte river basin colorado usa an overview of the study area is provided first followed by a presentation of the modflow model construction and testing and the application of global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method finally application of best management practices bmp to lower water table elevation in the region are presented 2 1 study area the study area encompasses a 246 km2 region located 64 km northeast of denver colorado within the south plate river basin fig 1 a and specifically within the conductive quaternary alluvium of the basin the area includes the towns of gilcrest and lasalle with a total population of about 3500 the study area is used mainly for agricultural use the main crops are corn alfalfa grass pasture the irrigation type is approximately 50 flood irrigation and 50 sprinkler irrigation with the irrigation season from april through october and irrigation water obtained from four irrigation canals diverting water from the south platte river or from the alluvial aquifer fig 1b shows the location of gilcrest and lasalle the south platte river the four irrigation canals and the location of the 340 pumping wells green dots many wells have pumping rates higher than 5450 m3 day 1000 gal min within the appropriation doctrine of colorado water law the majority of the pumping wells are junior in water right to users of the south platte river and therefore any streamflow depletion induced by pumping must be replaced by other sources of water this has led to the construction of recharge ponds in the area blue dots in fig 1b with the recharge from these ponds and the resulting rise in groundwater gradient and groundwater discharge to the south platte river used to offset the pumping induced streamflow depletion within the past 10 15 years groundwater levels in the region have risen leading to flooded basements waterlogging of cultivated fields and failure of septic systems fig 2 a shows the estimated depth to water table m during fall 2012 based on water level measurements in the network of 40 monitoring wells green dots in fig 2a these wells were installed by four organizations the central colorado water conservancy district the colorado division of water resources colorado state university and the south platte decision support system areas in red on the map have extremely shallow water tables 1 5 m below ground surface and areas in orange have a water table between 1 5 and 3 m below ground surface time series of water table depth m for three of the wells are shown in fig 2b d demonstrating that shallow groundwater has occurred for several decades in some parts of the study area but others have experienced a dramatic rise in groundwater level in general main groundwater inputs include recharge from irrigation events surface water and groundwater sources recharge from rainfall events seepage from earthen irrigation canals and recharge pond recharge groundwater outputs include pumping evapotranspiration in areas of shallow water table and discharge to the south platte river the volumes of these sources and sinks vary annually based on weather patterns water rights and local management decisions 2 2 geology of the study area in the study area the south platte river alluvial aquifer is a heterogeneous geologic unit composed of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay underlain by low permeability bedrock shale aquifer thickness varies from 0 to more than 30 m with most of the area having a thickness of 15 25 m shale outcrops in several locations along the mid south boundary of the study area a digital elevation model dem of the study area is shown in fig 3 a the topography includes a broad fluvial valley along the south platte river the land surface has an elevation of 1510 m in the south lowering to an elevation of 1410 m in the northeast within the south platte river channel highly permeable deposits are found in the central part of the aquifer groundwater flow is generally from south to north following the topography with groundwater discharging to the south platte river barkmann et al 2014 in a previous study investigating groundwater levels in the region barkmann et al 2014 450 boreholes were drilled to explore the three dimensional material structure of the aquifer fig 4 a b borehole data are classified as clay silt sand gravel and mixed types for 7 material types in general the aquifer material is coarser sand gravel near the south platte river these borehole data were used in this study to create a three dimensional 3d material map which is then used to obtain a 3d hydraulic conductivity k map for the modflow model see section 2 3 ordinary kriging is employed to interpolate between the borehole locations kriging for the 3d aquifer system is performed using the stanford geostatistical modeling software sgems remy et al 2009 a 3d cartesian grid with 120 120 50 cells is built in sgems to fully represent the aquifer there are 10 vertical layers evenly distributed between the surface and the bedrock the thickness of the layers ranges from 1 to 3 m each soil type is assigned a k value initial values are shown in table 1 and a 3d ellipsoid is defined to determine the size of the local neighbors around the estimation points 3d kriging is then performed within the ellipsoid of each estimation point to provide each grid cell with an interpolated k value the horizontal and vertical variograms of k of the borehole data are plotted and shown in fig 4c and d to show the spatial continuity of the aquifer material data the higher the variogram values γ is the less similarity between data points as the distance between data points increases lag there are less similarities and reaches a point beyond which there is no more spatial correlation the lag at this point is called the range two exponential models are fitted for the horizontal and vertical directions the vertical range for the borehole data is 30 m whereas the horizontal range is 1970 m fig 5 shows the estimate material map for layers near the top middle and bottom portions of the aquifer the aquifer material is more conductive sand and gravel near the south platte river shown along the north of the study area in black squares pockets of clay are present in more abundance in the middle layer and the bottom of the aquifer has more sand and gravel areas fig 5 lower right hand map also shows the distribution of clay in the area clay layers have accumulated around the mid south portion and east boundary of the model 2 3 numerical groundwater flow modeling 2 3 1 modflow model construction the modflow flow model constructed for the study region has grid cells of 152 4m 152 4m resulting in 120 rows and 120 columns the aquifer is discretized vertically by 10 layers with the top elevation of the first layer extracted from the dem see fig 3a and the bottom of the lowest layer formed from the base of each borehole see fig 4b model active cells are shown in fig 3b and represent the extent of the alluvial aquifer all groundwater source and sink data are provided by a modflow flow of the entire south platte alluvial aquifer system brown and caldwell 2017 constructed in conjunction with the colorado division of water sources south platte decision support system these data are obtained from reported and measured flow rates and structure diversions recharge pond seepage agricultural pumping m i pumping or are estimated using water balance tools precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge canal seepage lateral flow from surrounding aquifers upflow from the underlying bedrock aquifer pumping data is mostly collected through cdss colorado decision support system pumping is simulated as well package and placed in the mid of the aquifer in the moflow model surface water recharge and groundwater recharge are calculated using pre processing routines in which recharge is the difference between applied irrigation rates and the resulting surface runoff and crop evapotranspiration et precipitation recharge surface water recharge and groundwater recharge are all applied to the top layer cells for each stress period canal seepage is obtained by multiplying river diversion rates by a pre determined factor brown and caldwell 2017 the modflow psb partition stress boundary package zeiler et al 2017 was used in which each groundwater stress can be partitioned into separate inputs for example precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge canal seepage recharge and recharge pond seepage are differentiated from general recharge as is the case with typical modflow codes and models using this package the water balance output by the modflow model also partitions stresses into the separate components thereby allowing for more detailed analysis of groundwater inputs outputs initial values of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for each grid cell were based on the material maps generated from the borehole data see figs 4 and 5 these initial values were modified during model calibration see section 2 3 2 specified head boundary conditions are applied along the north boundary and south boundary of the model the head along these boundaries are derived from the historical records of monitoring wells and output from the basin wide groundwater model brown and caldwell 2017 the western boundary of the model is the south platte river streamflow in the river is simulated using modflow s stream flow routing sfr package the sfr package uses a stream water budget and manning s equation to compute the stream flow rate and depth prudic et al 2004 30 reaches and 516 segments are ordered and numbered based on the flow direction with each grid cell designated as a river segment stream width was set to 45 m the riverbed conductance m2 day was calculated using the river length in each cell the hydraulic conductivity of the cell and the streambed thickness assumed to be 1 5 m the sfr package is also used to simulate streamflow in beebe draw see fig 1b using a stream width of 6 m 2 3 2 model simulation and calibration the model runs from 1950 to 2012 using monthly stress periods with 10 time steps per stress period the calibration and testing periods are 1950 2000 and 2000 2012 respectively the initial groundwater head for each grid cell is obtained by interpolating the historical groundwater level from monitoring wells at the beginning of the simulation the model is run using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 the mass balance error of the simulation is 0 45 the model was calibrated using the pest parameter estimation software doherty 2007 pest employs monte carlo methodology to select random parameter values uses a regularization process to attain the uniqueness of calibrated parameters values and uses nonlinear parameter estimation techniques to minimize the residual between observed and simulated values the model is run multiple times to obtain the jacobian matrix which contains the set of partial derivatives of all observations with respect to the changes in model parameter values pest then uses the calculated matrix to provide an improved set of parameters the process continues until residuals are minimized in this study values of aquifer properties are modified by pest to minimize the residual between simulated and observed groundwater heads observed head values are obtained from the network of 40 observation wells in the study region see fig 2 there are in total 1870 groundwater level measurements during 1950 2012 with 652 observations available in the 1950 2000 calibration period and 1218 in the 2000 2012 testing period the sixteen aquifer parameters provided to pest are listed in table 1 along with their maximum value minimum value and final calibrated value aquifer properties included are horizontal hydraulic conductivity k m day specific yield sy vertical anisotropy kv kh ratio and specific storage ss 1 m each grid cell in the model domain is assigned a material type clay clay silt silt silt sand sand sand gravel gravel and an initial k and sy value based on the results of the 3d kriging interpolation see section 2 2 and fig 5 the set of cells belonging to each material type is assigned as a parameter zone with values for each zone updated during the pest calibration process the pest estimation model is employed in the calibration and therefore the solution of the inverse problem is based on the gauss marquardt levenberg method doherty 2015 parallelization was implemented using 10 machines run in parallel to populate the jacobian matrix 2 4 identifying governing groundwater stresses once calibrated and tested the modflow model was used to quantify the influence of groundwater stresses on water table elevation these stresses are precipitation recharge surface water recharge groundwater recharge groundwater pumping canal seepage and recharge pond seepage these stresses are spatially and temporally distributed within the study area and through the 1950 2012 simulation period the quantification is performed using the sobol method sobol 2001 which provides a quantitative estimate of parameter influence on model output the sobol method is a variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa in which variances of model output are decomposed into fractions attributed to each input first order indices and their interactions second or higher order indices the sensitivity index si is calculated as 1 s i i v a r e y x i v a r y 2 s i i j v a r e y x i x j v a r e y x i v a r e y x j v a r y 3 s i t i s i i j i s i i j j i k j s i i j k where xi is the ith input and y is the output sii siij siijk are the first order second order and third order indices and siti is the total order index sobol s total order sensitivity counts the variances caused by each input variable independently and the interactions with other input variables in all the orders to the output variances in this study the total order index siti is used to represent the influence of the 6 groundwater stresses a total of 224 parameter sets are generated using this method as each groundwater stress varies in space i e cell to cell variation and in time different values for each stress period each input value is scaled on a percentage basis from 0 to 150 of the original value for example all groundwater pumping rates are multiplied by a percentage value resulting in a change in model simulated groundwater head simulations are run only for the 2000 2012 period the sensitivity measure of each groundwater stress is calculated 1 temporally for each simulation stress period and 2 spatially for each modflow grid cell for 1 groundwater head is averaged over all grid cells for each stress period with the change in head related to the change in the groundwater stress value for 2 the groundwater head in each active grid cell is averaged across all stress periods to provide a single value thereby yielding a map of spatially varying sensitivity for each groundwater stress to our knowledge this is a new technique that can provide valuable insights into the spatial controls on water table elevation maps are generated for periods pre and post 2006 during which year many irrigation pumping wells were shut off due to potential effects on streamflow in the south platte river 2 5 effect of best management practices bmps on water table elevation results from the gsa pointed to effective management practices that could lower the water table the modflow model therefore is also used to explore the effect of these identified best management practices bmps based on results shown in section 3 2 these practices are 1 line canals with sealant to prevent canal seepage as canal seepage is simulated using a recharge source this is performed in the model by setting these values to 0 2 change the source of irrigation from surface water to groundwater pumping for all fields currently using canal water this is performed by turning off surface water recharge for these cells increasing groundwater pumping and adding the expected groundwater recharge from the enhanced groundwater pumping for this practice irrigation efficiency is assumed to be 67 this scenario assumes that no augmentation is required i e that enhanced streamflow depletion caused by the additional groundwater pumping does not need to be replaced 3 install subsurface drains to lower the water table particularly in the area around the town of gilcrest which has experienced groundwater levels 1 5 m from the ground surface see fig 1b this is performed using modflow s drain package combinations of these practices also are simulated for example combining 1 and 2 since canal seepage will not occur if canals are not needed to convey irrigation water to fields also 2 is implemented in increments from 10 to 100 conversion of surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation for all scenarios head results are compared with results from the original 2000 2012 simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general model results the pest calibration process improved model accuracy by 15 the final calibrated values for each of the 16 aquifer properties are listed in table 1 1 1 plots of measured groundwater head vs simulated groundwater head are shown in fig 6 for the calibration period 1950 2000 and the testing period 2000 2012 for the calibration period the mean absolute error mae is 1 23 m and the root mean square error rmse is 1 74 m the histogram of residuals difference between measured and simulated also is shown showing that most of the residuals are 3 m with an average residual mean of errors of 0 22 m plots for the testing validation period also are shown with mae 1 34 m rmse 1 65 m and the average residual 0 36 m fig 7 shows time series plot of simulated depth to water table blue line vs observed red dots at four different locations over the study area knowing that the average aquifer thickness in this region is 18 27 m the residuals between simulated and measured head values indicate that the modflow model simulates the groundwater system in a reasonable manner this is also shown through a comparison water table and groundwater flow maps generated by measured data and model output shown in fig 8 fig 8a and b show the estimated water table contour map for spring 2012 from measurements taken from the 40 observation wells cgs 2013 and the contour map from model values both maps show the same trend with groundwater flowing from the south to north to discharge to the south platte river and similar values of groundwater hydraulic gradient fig 8c and d show the spatial distribution of water table depth for spring 2012 conditions with the map on the left showing an interpolation from groundwater head at observation wells cgs 2013 and the map on the right showing cell by cell results from the modflow model red and orange colors indicate areas of shallow 3 m water table in general the simulated results capture the principal patterns in the system with shallow water table in the areas along the south platte river beebe draw near the town of gilcrest and in the region to the northeast of gilcrest and south of la salle the modflow model simulates a region of shallow water table to the south of gilcrest near the irrigation canals which is not present in the cgs map however as shown in fig 2 there are no observation wells in this area and hence the actual groundwater levels are not known however due to seepage from the two irrigation canals high groundwater levels likely are present thus coinciding with the modflow results in general simulated spatial distribution of groundwater levels demonstrate model accuracy the yearly averaged water balance of the aquifer for 2000 2012 is shown in table 2 the first two columns show the flux rate in m3 day and the last two columns show flux values normalized to the lowest value gw sw interactions source i e seepage from the south platte river to the aquifer in the table pumping wells source include recharge from canal seepage and recharge ponds as the well package in modflow was used to simulate these processes the largest source term is recharge 3 34 and the largest sink term is discharge to the south platte river 4 93 this interaction between the aquifer and the river is shown further in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows two cross sections through the model domain showing the ground surface elevation from the dem the water table elevation simulated by modflow and the river surface simulated by modflow both cross sections show a strong groundwater gradient towards the river leading to groundwater discharge to the south platte river fig 10 shows the influence of groundwater pumping on these interactions with fig 10a showing the relationship between groundwater discharge return flow and pumping and fig 10b showing the relationship between pumping and river depth as seen in fig 10a when pumping is high e g 2002 return flows are decreased as pumping decreases the groundwater gradient and therefore decreases the rate of groundwater discharge to the river when pumping is low 2007 2010 return flows are high and increasing demonstrating the strong connection between the groundwater system and the south platte river from fig 10b high pumping 2002 is correlated with a lower stream depth and vice versa although other factors upstream rainfall and return flow also control stream depth in the model domain 3 2 governing stresses on water table elevation the time dependent measures of si for the six groundwater stresses from 2000 to 2012 using the sobol method are shown in fig 11 results are shown for the entire model domain fig 11a and for the region around the town of gilcrest fig 11b results will be discussed for both the 2000 2006 and 2006 2012 time periods since 2006 marks the transition to lower pumping volumes due to effect of groundwater pumping on streamflow depletion for the entire region fig 11a the order of influence si on water table elevation from highest to lowest for the 2000 2006 time period is on average 1 canal seepage 0 3 2 recharge from surface water irrigation 0 28 3 pumping 0 14 4 recharge from groundwater irrigation 0 003 5 recharge from precipitation 0 02 and 6 recharge pond seepage 0 00 after 2006 the impact of pumping decreases due to the overall decrease in groundwater pumping during 2006 2012 for the 2000 2012 period average si of surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping is 0 37 0 37 and 0 08 respectively during the 2006 2012 period the influence of surface water recharge fluctuates with the irrigation season whereas the seasonal pattern of canal seepage is much more subdued the influence of pumping is more pronounced for the gilcrest area from fig 11b average si of surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping is 0 22 0 30 and 0 17 respectively with canal seepage having the strongest influence on water table elevation however before 2006 pumping has the strongest control on water table elevation followed by canal seepage with surface water recharge having almost no effect whereas after 2006 surface water recharge has almost as strong an effect on water table elevation as canal seepage with the influence of pumping decreasing dramatically the spatial sensitivity maps are shown in fig 12 for surface water recharge canal seepage and groundwater pumping maps are shown for both the 2000 2006 left and 2006 2012 right period for canal seepage fig 12a water table elevation is most influenced by canal seepage along the canals in the southern part of the region after 2006 the influence of canal seepage increases near the town of gilcrest values between 0 21 and 0 30 whereas values are 0 to 0 1 for the 2000 2006 period fig 12b likely due to the decreased influence of groundwater pumping not surprisingly the water table elevation in agricultural regions of the study area is most influenced by surface water recharge fig 12c d similar to the influence of canal seepage the influence of surface water recharge increases after 2006 fig 8d due to the decrease in groundwater pumping and increase in surface water irrigation during this time period pumping has the strongest influence on water table elevation around the gilcrest and beebe draw areas fig 12e f but this influence decreases after 2006 in the majority of the study region although similar results could be derived from a spatio temporal analysis of groundwater source and sink data the use of the modflow model and the sobol method allow for more refined temporal and spatial relationships as the influence of sources and sinks on neighboring areas are quantified using flow rate calculations within the modflow solution results indicate that surface water recharge and canal seepage are the primary controls of water table elevation both generally throughout the model domain fig 11 and locally fig 12 therefore management practices should focus on limiting these two stresses as much as possible without harming agricultural productivity as shown from the results in fig 12 these practices could be targeted to local areas or specific stretches of individual irrigation canals 3 3 effect of management practices on water table elevation the results of applying the bmps during the 2000 2012 time periods are shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 shows the decrease in groundwater head water table elevation for each grid cell in the model domain by 2012 for the scenarios of subsurface drainage in the gilcrest area 13a canal sealing 13b surface water irrigation transition to groundwater irrigation 13c and the combination of canal sealing and complete surface water irrigation transition to groundwater irrigation subsurface drainage near the gilcrest area 13a lowers the head by up to 0 6 m and could be a viable solution if implemented generally in the areas of high groundwater levels canal sealing fig 13b lowers the head generally in the area with an average decrease of 1 1 m across the study region by the end of 2012 but decreases up to 4 7 m in the areas between the canals replacing surface water irrigation with groundwater irrigation fig 13c has a strong impact over the cultivated area lowering the head by an average of 3 6 m with decreases up to 15 m if irrigation changes are combined with canal lining 13d the head is lowered by an average of 4 6 m and maximum decreases of 20 m as complete conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation in the study region is not practicable additional scenarios were run to investigate the influence of partial conversion fig 14 shows the time series of model wide average groundwater head for percentages 0 100 of conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation the 0 scenario represents the baseline no change scenario showing the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater head throughout the region between 2000 and 2012 full conversion 100 as shown by the spatial results in fig 13c decreases average water table elevation by 4 6 m by 2012 whereas 50 implementation provides a decrease of approximately 2 4 m however even a decrease of 1 5 m resulting from the 30 implementation scenario would be beneficial to local infrastructure e g house basements wastewater treatment plant lagoons and cultivated fields therefore a combination of sealing along selected reaches of individual canals and a 20 30 transition from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation could lower the water table adequately to prevent groundwater flooding in residential and cultivated areas note that these transition scenarios as simulated are not currently feasible within the context of colorado water law as any increase in groundwater pumping due to conversion from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation requires a plan to replace estimated streamflow depletion i e increase recharge pond seepage or groundwater injection 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a new method to assess the impact of groundwater stresses on water table elevation in waterlogged agricultural areas first a numerical groundwater flow model is constructed and used to simulate groundwater head and groundwater flow with results compared against measured groundwater levels second global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are applied to rank and quantify temporally and spatially the influence of each groundwater stress on water table elevation and third management practices are identified from the gsa results and run with the groundwater flow model to quantify spatio temporal effects on water table elevation for the specified region in northern colorado which has experienced significant groundwater flooding in the past 10 15 years surface water irrigation recharge groundwater irrigation recharge precipitation recharge canal seepage groundwater pumping and recharge pond seepage were analyzed for influence on water table elevation during the 2000 2012 time period results indicate that surface water recharge canal seepage and pumping are the most influential stresses with surface water recharge and canal seepage being the most impactful from 2006 to 2012 with the irrigation canal in the southern part of the study region wielding a particularly strong control on water table elevation in the central cultivated areas management practices based on gsa results indicate that sealing the canals or segments of selected canals and transitioning 30 of the cultivated fields from surface water irrigation to groundwater irrigation can decrease water table elevation by 1 5 m over a 10 year period if more immediate changes are required the degree of implementation should be increased to 50 these methods can be applied to any waterlogged region worldwide however proposed management practices to lower water table may be constrained by local state or national water law for example in the current study region groundwater and surface water are managed conjunctively as a single water source in colorado water law and hence pumping induced streamflow depletion must be accompanied by an augmentation plan that replaces the depleted river water often through seepage from constructed recharge ponds these recharge ponds increase the local water table gradient increasing the groundwater discharge to the river and thereby theoretically cancelling the effect of the pumping well on streamflow the management practices simulated in this study do not include the need for an augmentation plan therefore results show what could happen if colorado water law were suspended in this region to manage the shallow water table problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10548,this work presents the first attempt to derive analytical solutions of a space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe for parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 and sfbe e respectively laboratory and field data published in literature were used to evaluate the performances of the fractional models in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils besides the performances of the proposed fractional models were compared with that of a fractional analytical solution developed in the literature for a flat initial water table condition sfbe f according to the results of the sensitivity analysis heterogeneity degree of soil α had a more effect on outputs of the fractional models also the results indicated that the α parameter in the sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe f was capable of describing well the heterogeneity degree of soil the α value was estimated almost 2 in relatively homogenous soil while its values were respectively appraised almost 1 3 and 1 1 in soils with average and relative heterogeneity degrees the fractional models reduced to their counterpart classical ones be p1 be p2 be e and be f in the relatively homogenous soil the measurement and prediction results demonstrated the best and similar performance for the sfbe e and sfbe f models while the sfbe p2 models was the weakest this behavior was also observed by using the classical models compared to the be e the sfbe e provided better prediction results in the heterogeneous soils overall the sfbe e and sfbe f can be applied as practical models to simulate water table profile between two parallel drainpipes for both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils keywords elliptical initial water table profile fractional differentiation order heterogeneity degree scale dependent subsurface drainage 1 introduction drainpipes are main component of a subsurface drainage system which determination of their spacing is a critical step in design of the subsurface drainage system the drainpipe spacing is calculated according to the theories used to describe water flow towards the drainpipe these theories have been divided into steady state and transient state flow conditions ritzema 1994 in nature the water flow towards the drainpipe especially in highly variable rainfall or irrigated areas is usually transient ritzema 1994 the transient flow towards the drainpipe is described by boussinesq equation be singh et al 2006 if the changes in the water table height are small in comparison with the value of the water table height the be for a horizontal impervious base is expressed as follows ritzema 1994 1 x k x h x y t x y k y h x y t y μ d h x y t t where x and y are the space variables in two directions l t is the time variable t k x and k y are the hydraulic conductivities of porous medium lt 1 in the x and y directions respectively h x y t is the water table height l μ is the drainable porosity of the porous medium dimensionless and d is the average thickness of the water transmitting layer ritzema 1994 several analytical and numerical solutions of the be for initial and boundary conditions related to the water flow towards the drainpipe have been presented in the literature the shape of the initial water table profile is an important factor to derive an efficient analytical or numerical solution in real situation the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes may be flat parabolic or elliptical which depends on the soil characteristics and drainage situations singh et al 2006 several researchers have analytically solved one dimensional be for various shapes of the initial water table profile e g dumm 1954 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 singh et al 2006 the main drawback of these analytical solutions is the soil homogeneity assumption which implies that the hydraulic conductivity is uniform down to an impermeable layer singh et al 1996 this simplifying assumption is far from reality because soil is seldom uniform or homogeneous in nature ritzema 1994 and the hydraulic conductivity is a scale dependent parameter hunt 2006 to face the problem of the hydraulic conductivity scale dependency some investigators have taken into account the hydraulic conductivity as a function of distance and developed some drainage equations e g singh et al 1996 while some others have applied the numerical methods to simulate the transient flow towards subsurface drains e g mirlas 2013 xin et al 2016b the main limitation of the first approach is that finding a function which describes adequately the variations of the hydraulic conductivity with distance is difficult however the main limitation of the numerical methods is that they require long runtimes asher et al 2015 also they suffer from conceptual truncation and data errors and convergence problems batu 2006 fractional differentiation is one of the other methods in recent years proposed to overcome the problem of the hydraulic conductivity scale dependency wheatcraft and meerschaert 2008 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a 2013b unlike integer order derivatives the fractional derivatives are non local meaning the fractional derivative of a function at a point x depends on characteristics of the function across the entire domain zhang et al 2009 more specifically the space non locality implies that the function change at a given point depends on the function changes on a wide range of spatial zones su 2014 in a space nonlocal model the parameters of the model are scale independent and the scale effects and the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium are reflected by the order of the space fractional derivative α clarke et al 2005 wheatcraft and meerschaert 2008 zhang et al 2009 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a clarke et al 2005 presented three different ranges to classify the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium according to α value these properties of the space nonlocal models have been proved in the previous experimental studies e g benson et al 2001 huang et al 2006 mehdinejadiani et al 2013b moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 in addition to the non locality property the fractional models generally provide a more precise way to describe a complex system tang et al 2015 notwithstanding the mentioned advantages the fractional derivatives have an inherent complexity tang et al 2015 and various definitions that are incompatible with each other avetisyan and tonoyan 2015 in recent years different fractional forms of the governing differential equation on transient flow of water in porous media were presented by various investigators he 1998 suggested a fractional differential equation for seepage flow in porous media using a fractional darcy s law and analytically solved it with a variational iteration method cloot and botha 2006 obtained a fractional equation for simulating groundwater flow by combing the fractional darcy s law and mass conservation compared to theis equation this equation better described drawdown during a constant rate on a borehole mehdinejadiani et al 2013a derived a space fractional partial diﬀ erential equation governing on unconfined groundwater which was called space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe in another research work mehdinejadaini et al 2013b analytically solved the one dimensional sfbe for simulating water transient flow towards drainpipes by assuming a flat initial water table profile and derived a fractional model the fractional model developed by mehdinejadaini et al 2013b considered the heterogeneity degree of soil as a determinable parameter which was estimated using an inverse problem method according to their studies compared to glover dumm equation the fractional model better simulated water table profiles between two parallel drainpipes in the heterogeneous soil a distributed order fractional diffusion wave equation dofdwe and its solutions for water flow to or from a well were proposed by su et al 2015 they demonstrated that simplified solutions of the dofdwe can be applied to obtain the aquifer parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity aquifer diffusivity and transmissivity su 2017 proposed a set of the fbes and presented the analytical solution of the fbe for the confined and unconfined groundwater flow in addition to above mentioned works there is a large body of literature on the application of the fractional derivatives to simulate water flow in porous media that are not mentioned here for the sake of brevity as above mentioned mehdinejadiani et al 2013b assumed a flat initial water table profile to solve the sfbe however as described earlier the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes may be flat parabolic or elliptical to the authors knowledge the solutions of the sfbe for different shapes of the initial water table profile have not been so far presented this provided a motivation to derive a set of the sfbe analytical solutions called fractional models in this work for different shapes of the initial water table profile therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to develop the analytical solutions of the sfbe for three different shapes of initial water table profiles 2 to estimate the parameters of the fractional models and their counterpart classical ones using a stochastic inverse problem procedure and 3 to compare the performances of the fractional models with each other as well as with their counterpart classical ones 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual model in this work a drainage system with equally spaced and parallel drainpipes overlying an impervious horizontal layer was considered fig 1 a two adjacent drainpipes with inner radius of r 0 were placed at a distance of l apart from each other and installed at a depth of d 1 and height of d above the impervious layer fig 1b the drainpipes were assumed half full during the drainage process a x h cartesian coordinate system was taken with origin in the left drainpipe in mathematical drainage models the h x t usually represents the water table height above drain level and researchers choose the x axis coincident with the drain level to derive the model e g see dumm 1954 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 kumar et al 1994 verma et al 1998 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 cooke et al 2001 mehdinejadiani et al 2013b therefore in this study the x axis was coincided with the drain level and the h axis was considered as water table head see fig 1b the assumptions considered to derive the fractional models were as follows i the water table rises almost suddenly due to an instantaneous recharge such as irrigation or rainfall after stopping the recharge the water table falls gradually and water is drained by the drainpipes ii the water flow towards the drainpipe is transient i e the flow rate varies with time because water is stored in or discharged from the soil it should be noted that the change in soil water storage is reflected by rising or falling the water table ritzema 1994 iii the dupuit forchheimer assumptions are valid i e the horizontal flow is only considered in modeling process iv the unsaturated flow above the water table and the saturated flow along the drainpipes y direction were ignored a detailed inspection of the assumptions reveals that all assumptions used to obtain glover dumm s mathematical model ritzema 1994 except for the homogeneity assumption of soil have been here employed to develop the fractional models in addition the saturated flow towards the drainpipes was considered symmetrical with respect to either the midpoint between two adjacent drainpipes x l 2 or the drainpipes xin et al 2016a as can be seen in fig 1 the maximum value of the water table height occurred at x l 2 this results from the symmetry of the flow pattern and the equal installation depth of the drainpipes 2 2 governing fractional differential equation the governing space fractional differential equation on transient flow towards drainpipes is space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe which is based on fractional mass conservation principle validity of darcy s law and dupuit forchheimer assumptions mehdinejadiani et al 2013a for the case in which the changes in h x y t are small in comparison with the h x y t and the impervious base is horizontal the sfbe is given as follows 2 κ x α x α h x y t κ y β y β h x y t μ d h x y t t where α and β 1 2 are respectively the orders of the space fractional derivative in the x and y directions dimensionless the α and β represent heterogeneity degrees of soil in the x and y directions respectively mehdinejadiani et al 2013a which can be estimated using an inverse problem method κ x lα 1t 1 and κ y lβ 1t 1 are respectively the fractional hydraulic conductivities of the porous medium in the x and y directions α h x y t x α and β h x y t y β are respectively the caputo space fractional derivatives of orders α and β with respect to x and y defined in appendix a and the other variables are defined as in eq 1 according to the conceptual model above the saturated flow in y direction was neglected therefore the one dimensional sfbe was applied to describe water flow towards drainpipes and to obtain the analytical solutions the one dimensional sfbe can be written as follows 3 h x t t κ x d μ α x α h x t as above mentioned the sfbe is based on the dupuit forchheimer assumptions and the d has a constant value to have a constant value of the d and to satisfy the dupuit forchheimer assumptions the following equation was suggested for calculating the d skaggs et al 1973 verma et al 1998 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 4 d 0 5 h 0 d e where h 0 is the initial water table head at x l 2 and d e is the hooghoudt s equivalent depth l in eq 4 both h 0 and d e have constant values and consequently the d will have a constant value as well the d e was employed to take into account the effects of non horizontal flow near the drainpipes when the drainpipes do not reach the impermeable layer similar to fig 1b in this study the flow near the drainpipes is not horizontal and consequently the dupuit forchheimer assumptions are no longer valid to satisfy the dupuit forchheimer assumptions horizontal flow near the drainpipes one can use the concept of hooghoudt s equivalent depth ritzema 1994 this is a traditional approach used in drainage mathematical models for details the interested reader is referred to ritzema 1994 pp 263 287 the value of d e was calculated as follows ritzema 1994 5a d e π 8 l ln l π r 0 f θ where l is the distance between two adjacent drainpipes l r 0 is the inner radius of the drainpipe l and 5b θ 2 π d l where d is the actual depth of the impermeable layer below drainpipes see fig 1b the value of f θ in eq 5a was obtained as follows ritzema 1994 5c f θ n 1 3 5 4 e 2 n θ n 1 e 2 n θ 0 5 θ 5d f θ π 2 4 θ ln θ 2 π 10 6 θ 0 5 note that if θ 10 6 d e d ritzema 1994 2 3 boundary and initial conditions based on the conceptual model as depicted in fig 1b the drainpipes are half full and the water surface in drainpipe is in connection with atmosphere therefore the boundary conditions were considered as follows 6a h 0 t h l t 0 as mentioned earlier the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes varies at different soils and drainage situations four types of initial water table shapes that have been considered in the previous studies include case 1 flat dumm 1954 6b h x 0 h 0 case 2 parabola type 1 fourth degree parabola dumm 1964 6c h x 0 8 h 0 l 4 l 3 x 3 l 2 x 2 4 l x 3 2 x 4 case 3 parabola type 2 singh et al 2006 6d h x 0 16 h 0 l 4 x 2 l x 2 case 4 ellipse singh et al 2006 6e x l 2 2 l 2 h 0 d 2 4 h 0 d 2 d 2 h x 0 d 2 h 0 d 2 1 the analytical solution of the one dimensional sfbe under boundary conditions eq 6a has been only obtained for the flat initial water table profile mehdinejadiani et al 2013b in this study the one dimensional sfbe is analytically solved for boundary conditions eq 6a and parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles the reason for considering these initial conditions is that the shapes of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes can be flat parabola type 1 parabola type 2 or elliptical as mentioned earlier the shape of the initial water table profile depends on the soil characteristics and drainage situations singh et al 2006 the soil characteristics imply texture and structure of soil while the drainage situations signify single and multi level drainage systems 2 4 derivation of analytical mathematical models in this work a spectral representation of the fractional laplacian operator ilic et al 2005 daftardar gejji and jafari 2006 was applied to derive the analytical solutions of the eq 3 the spectral representation was obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem where eigenvalues λ n were given by λ n n π l 2 for n 1 2 3 and corresponding eigenfunctions h n x were nonzero constant multiples of h n x sin n π l x then the solution was set as follows ilic et al 2005 7a h x t n 1 c n t sin n π l x the eq 7a automatically satisfies the boundary conditions eq 6a by inserting eq 7a into eq 3 and simplifying the following ordinary differential equations ode obtained ilic et al 2005 7b d c n t d t κ x d μ n π l α c n t 0 the general solution of the eq 7b is as follows 7c c n t c n 0 exp κ x d μ n π l α t therefore the analytical solution of the eq 3 can be written as follows 7d h x t n 1 c n 0 exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x the coefficient c n 0 in the eq 7d is obtained using the initial conditions 7e h x 0 n 1 c n 0 sin n π l x as can be seen in the eq 7e the c n 0 must be the coefficients of fourier sine series given as follows 7f c n 0 2 l 0 l h x 0 sin n π l x d x as mentioned in subsection 2 3 this study presents the analytical solutions of the sfbe for the parabola type 1 parabola type 1 and elliptical initial water table profiles therefore the coefficient c n 0 and consequently the final analytical solutions were separately obtained for each initial water table profile shape as follows case 2 parabola type 1 initial water table profile 8a c n 0 192 h 0 π 5 n π 2 8 n 5 for n 1 3 5 8b h x t 192 h 0 π 5 n 1 3 5 n π 2 8 n 5 exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x case 3 parabola

n 0 and the definition of their parameters has been presented in appendix b the eqs 8b 9b and 10b are the fractional mathematical models which can be applied to both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils these models are the generalized form of the classical analytical models which have been derived using soil homogeneity assumption by previous investigators e g dumm 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 the performances of the fractional mathematical models developed in this study were compared to the performance of the fractional mathematical model developed by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b and their counterpart classical models as mentioned in introduction mehdinejadiani et al 2013b derived their mathematical model for a flat initial water table profile as follows 11 h x t 4 h 0 π n 1 3 5 1 n exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x for simplicity the eqs 8b 9b 10b and 11 are hereafter denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f respectively also the counterpart classical models of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f are denoted as be p1 be p2 be e and be f respectively 2 5 parameter estimation sensitivity analysis and prediction 2 5 1 parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis the parameters of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f were estimated using a stochastic inverse problem method as well known each inverse model is constituted of three components including design variables objective function and optimization algorithm the design variables are the same parameters of the mathematical models which are estimated using the inverse method the design variables of the inverse models developed for estimating the parameters of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f included the ratio of the fractional hydraulic conductivity to the drainable porosity κ x μ and the heterogeneity degree of soil α whereas the design variables of those developed for estimating the parameters of the be p1 be p2 be e and be f only included the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity to the drainable porosity k x μ indeed the classical models for different initial water table profiles were reproduced by fixing the α parameter of their counterpart fractional models to 2 and by considering the soil homogeneity assumption to find the optimum values of the design variables the lack of fit mean square pachepsky et al 2000 was used as the objective function 12 minimize o f 1 n p i 1 n h i c a l c h i m e a s 2 where o f is the objective function n is the number of the measurement points p is the number of the model parameters h i c a l c is the calculated water table heights above the drain level l at the i th point and h i m e a s is the experimentally measured water table heights above the drain level l at the i th point the details of the experimental data used in this work will be described in section 2 6 it should be noted that all values of h i m e a s were not used to estimate the parameters a part of h i m e a s values was utilized to estimate the parameters and the rest was used to investigate the predictive ability of the models to minimize the objective function a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm was applied this algorithm has been briefly described in appendix c although the pso is a stochastic algorithm and it does not require the sensitivity analysis of model input parameters ding et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects and relative importance of input parameters of the fractional models to this end a normalized sensitivity method was used whose details have been given in appendix d 2 5 2 predictive ability of models after estimating the parameters of the models the water table profiles between two parallel drainpipes at different times not used to estimate the parameters were predicted using the fractional models and their counterpart classical ones the performances of the models were evaluated using graphical displays and statistical criteria the graphical displays used in this study included comparison of matched measured and predicted water table data and comparison of measured and predicted water table profiles the statistical criteria applied to evaluate the model performances included reduced chi square error χ dhanushkodi et al 2017 maximum error me mehdinejadiani et al 2013b and adjusted determination coefficient r a d j 2 lima et al 2015 13a χ 1 n p i

n h i c a l c h i m e a s 2 i 1 n h i m e a s h m e a s 2 where h m e a s is the average of water table height values experimentally measured and the other variables are defined as in eq 12 note that the use of r a d j 2 is due to difference between the parameter number of the developed models and that of classical ones lima et al 2015 it is necessary to mention that a model with the lowest χ and me values and r a d j 2 value closer to unity is the best model 2 6 experimental studies to estimate the parameters and to investigate the predictive ability of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f the water table data experimentally measured are required therefore the experimental studies were carried out at laboratory and field scales to this end the experimental data published in the literature were used at the laboratory scale 30 water table profiles from two experiment sets were used which were collected in sandboxes with different dimensions fig 2 illustrates the general design of the sandboxes applied to collect the water table data where l 2 is the half of the distance between two adjacent drainpipes and d is distance of impervious layer from the drain level also table 1 presents detailed information about laboratory setup and soil texture of each experiment set to evaluate the performances of the sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f at the field scale the water table data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b for an actually operating drainage system were used this drainage system had been constructed on a date palm farm near abadan khuzestan province iran 30 1 49 8 n latitude and 48 29 5 27 e longitude the farm soil is silty clay in texture a tight clay layer exists at about 150 cm depth which is considered as the impervious layer corrugated p v c drainpipes 10 cm in diameter pre wrapped with synthetic envelope of pp450 were installed at about 130 cm depth the distance between two adjacent drainpipes was 30 m five observation wells 10 cm in diameter and approximately 150 cm in depth were installed along a row at different distances of between adjacent drainpipes to measure the water table fluctuations and consequently to determine the water table profiles between adjacent drainpipes 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis of fractional models fig 3 shows the results of sensitivity analysis for the fractional models it is found from fig 3a and b that all fractional models are more sensitive to the changes in the α parameter than the variations in the κ x μ parameter the most sensitive model to the changes in the parameters is the sfbe f followed by sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe p2 respectively in addition the normalized sensitivities of all models increase significantly with increasing the distance from the drainpipes this finding implies that the existence of the perturbation in the model input parameters makes a considerable error in the model output results at the far distances from drainpipe 3 2 parameters of mathematical models and their interpretation for the fine sand used by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b the parameter optimum values of the fractional and classical mathematical models were appraised using water table data at times of 16 30 45 60 90 120 180 and 240 min after drainage start table 2 summarizes the estimated parameters of the mathematical models and the associated values of o f the o f values of the fractional mathematical models at the optimum points of the parameters reveal that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide good fits to the data followed by sfbe p1 and sfbe p2 respectively as can be seen in table 2 the α values of all fractional mathematical models studied here especially in the sfbe e and sfbe f are very close to 2 this demonstrates the fine sand is relatively homogeneous clarke et al 2005 this finding is in excellent agreement with the physical properties of the fine sand applied by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b because they used a very uniform sand to minimize its heterogeneity degree overall the fractional models except for the sfbe p2 show relatively similar results in the form of values of the o f and design variables for all initial water table profiles similar to the fractional models the o f values of the classical models imply the superiority of the be e be f and be p1 over the be p2 in general a detailed inspection of the results reveals that the κ x μ optimum values and o f values of the fractional models especially in the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 are approximately equal to the k x μ optimum values and o f values of the classical ones these demonstrate that the fractional models reduce to the classical ones in the relatively homogeneous soil for the soil used by pandey et al 1992 the optimum values of the parameters were estimated using water table data at times of 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after drainage start this soil composed of about 54 sand 21 silt and 26 clay and classified as sandy clay loam according to the usda classification table 2 lists the parameter values and along with the o f values one can see from table 2 that the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 approximately have similar fit results these three models give good fits to the data whereas the sfbe p2 offers a weak fit the α values of the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 imply that the soil used by pandey et al 1992 has an average heterogeneity degree clarke et al 2005 this conclusion seems logical with regards to the physical properties of the soil applied by pandey et al 1992 the reduction of the α value to 1 3 can be resulted from the existence of wide range of the particle sizes in the soil mass 54 sand 21 silt and 26 clay while the non reduction of the α value to less than 1 3 can be related to carefully pack the sandbox pandey et al 1992 filled the sandbox carefully with the sandy clay loam soil to minimize preferential flow paths this can create a less heterogeneous porous medium because the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium and the presence of the preferential paths are correlated to each other kapetas et al 2014 as observed in table 2 the sfbe p2 not only does not fit well to the data but also does not reflect the expected heterogeneity degree of the soil similar to the fractional models the be e be f and be p1 provide much better fits to the data than the be p2 see table 2 also the comparison of the fit results reveals that the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 give somewhat better fits to the data than be e be f and be p1 respectively for the field experimental data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b the water table data at times of 3 5 and 10 days after drainage start were used to estimate the parameter optimum values of the mathematical models table 2 presents the fit results of the mathematical models to the field experimental data the o f values elucidate that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide much better fits to the data followed by sfbe p1 and sfbe p2 respectively according to the α values of the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 the farm soil appears to be relatively heterogeneous clarke et al 2005 this finding is acceptable from practical viewpoint because the soil is usually heterogeneous at the filed scale similar to the obtained results using pandey et al s 1992 data it is also observed here that the sfbe p2 does not describe the soil heterogeneity degree with regards to the o f values of the classical models the be e be f and be p1 give much better fits to the data in comparison with the be p2 according to the o f values the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 provide much better fits in comparison with the be e be f and be p1 3 3 predictive performance of models in the fine sand the water table profiles at times of 12 20 28 39 48 70 100 150 210 270 and 300 min after start of drainage were predicted using the fractional and classical models to this end the parameters of the models estimated by simultaneously fitting multiple water table profiles at different times were applied table 3 summarizes the values of the statistical criteria and fig 4 shows the comparison of the measured water table data with those predicted by each model as evident from table 3 and fig 4 the sfbe e and sfbe f provide the best prediction results whereas the sfbe p1 gives somewhat weaker results in contrast to the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 there are pronounced discrepancies between the measured data and the predicted results by the sfbe p2 a detailed inspection of the predicted water table profiles at different times after drainage start confirms these findings for example fig 5 depicts the measured and predicted water table profiles at times of 20 70 210 and 300 min after start of drainage as observed the sfbe e and sfbe f predict the water table profiles at different times appropriately whereas the sfbe p2 is unable to adequately simulate the profiles for the classical models similar to the fractional ones the be e and be f offer the best performances followed by the be p1 also with regards to the statistical criteria and graphical comparisons table 3 and figs 4 and 5 the be p2 gives the weakest performance in the sandy clay loam soil the predictive abilities of the fractional and classical models were investigated at times of 3 5 7 and 9 days after start of drainage the associated χ r a d j 2 and me values are listed in table 3 and the matched measured and predicted water table data are shown in fig 6 as observed the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 approximately have similar performances these three models simulate the water table data adequately whereas the sfbe p2 provides weaker results the comparison of the measured and predicted water table profiles at different times also reflects this finding e g see fig 7 in the classical models the χ r a d j 2 and me values table 3 and the comparison of the measured and predicted data figs 6 and 7 reveal the performance superiority of the be e be f and be p1 over be p2 at the field scale the water table profiles at times of 2 4 and 6 days after start of drainage were predicted the prediction results demonstrate that the performances of the sfbe e and sfbe f are nearly the same and are somewhat better than those of the sfbe p1 see table 3 and fig 8 it is also discovered from table 3 and fig 8 that the sfbe p2 cannot describe the water table data satisfactorily a detailed examination of the simulation results at different times after start of drainage confirms the above mentioned results for example fig 9 shows the measured and simulated water table profiles at times of 2 and 4 days after drainage start as observed the profiles simulated by the sfbe e and sfbe f exactly coincide with each other and somewhat better describe the profiles experimentally measured than the sfbe p1 it is also found from fig 9 that the sfbe p2 provides the weakest results among the fractional models in the classical models the comparison of the model performances indicates a similar trend to what was observed in the fractional models see table 3 and figs 8 and 9 this means that the be e and be f nearly have the same performances and provide somewhat better simulation results as compared to the be p1 also as evident from table 3 and figs 8 and 9 the simulated results by the be p2 are very far from the measured data 3 4 comparison of fractional and classical models as mentioned in subsections 3 2 and 3 3 the models supposed the elliptical or flat initial water table profile approximately have the same performances and provide better results in comparison with the models assumed the parabola type 1 or parabola type 2 initial water table profile therefore for the sake of brevity we only compare the fractional model taken into consideration the elliptical initial water table profile sfbe e with its counterpart classical model be e as concluded in subsection 3 2 the sfbe e reduces to the be e in the sand fine as a relatively homogeneous soil the identical χ r a d j 2 and me values of the sfbe e and be e table 3 and similar fit and prediction results figs 4 and 5 confirm the similar performance of the sfbe e and be e in the relatively homogeneous soil the comparison of the sfbe e and be e performances at the laboratory and field scales with the heterogeneous soils indicates the superiority of the sfbe e over the be e as observed in table 3 the χ and me values decrease from 0 0119 to 0 0050 58 and from 0 303 to 0 159 48 respectively and the r a d j 2 value increases from 0 769 to 0 902 17 when the sfbe e instead of the be e is applied to simulate the water table profile at the laboratory scale with the averagely heterogeneous soil similarly the application of the sfbe e instead of the be e at the field scale with the relatively heterogeneous soil decreases the χ and me values and increases the r a d j 2 value significantly respectively about 49 37 and 13 figs 6 7 8 9 confirm these findings 4 conclusion in this study a space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe was analytically solved for parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles the derived fractional models and their counterpart classical ones were denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e be p1 be p2 and be e respectively the performances of the models were investigated at the laboratory and field scales for soils with various heterogeneity degrees also the performances of the above mentioned models were compared to that of a fractional model developed for a flat initial water table profile sfbe f and its counterpart classical one be f the parameters of the models were estimated using a stochastic inverse problem method which utilized a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm also the relative importance of input parameters of the fractional models κ x μ and α was assessed by conducting a sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis reveals that the fractional models are more affected by the changes in the α parameter also the α value in the sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe f represents well the heterogeneity degree of soil the α value especially in the sfbe e and sfbe f are nearly equal to 2 and the fractional models reduce to the classical ones in the relatively homogeneous soil a total comparison of the fractional models with their counterpart classical ones demonstrates that the fractional models for all initial water table conditions are superior over the classical ones especially in the heterogeneous soils also the detailed comparison of the fractional model performances reveals that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide similar and better performances than the sfbe p1 whereas the sfbe p2 gives the weakest performance it is interesting to mention that this trend is also observed in the classical models the comparison of the sfbe e performances with the be e ones demonstrated that the sfbe e is highly superior to the be e in the heterogeneous soils in a nutshell it can be concluded that the sfbe e and sfbe f are highly effective models to simulate the water table profiles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils declaration of competing interests

be noted that in this study α 1 2 and consequently m 2 appendix b derivation of coefficient c n 0 as mentioned early the coefficients c n 0 are the coefficients of fourier sine series see eq 7f therefore coefficient c n 0 for each initial water table profile shape was obtained by solving integral mentioned in the eq 7f case 2 parabola type 1 initial water table profile by inserting the eq 6c

10548,this work presents the first attempt to derive analytical solutions of a space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe for parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 and sfbe e respectively laboratory and field data published in literature were used to evaluate the performances of the fractional models in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils besides the performances of the proposed fractional models were compared with that of a fractional analytical solution developed in the literature for a flat initial water table condition sfbe f according to the results of the sensitivity analysis heterogeneity degree of soil α had a more effect on outputs of the fractional models also the results indicated that the α parameter in the sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe f was capable of describing well the heterogeneity degree of soil the α value was estimated almost 2 in relatively homogenous soil while its values were respectively appraised almost 1 3 and 1 1 in soils with average and relative heterogeneity degrees the fractional models reduced to their counterpart classical ones be p1 be p2 be e and be f in the relatively homogenous soil the measurement and prediction results demonstrated the best and similar performance for the sfbe e and sfbe f models while the sfbe p2 models was the weakest this behavior was also observed by using the classical models compared to the be e the sfbe e provided better prediction results in the heterogeneous soils overall the sfbe e and sfbe f can be applied as practical models to simulate water table profile between two parallel drainpipes for both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils keywords elliptical initial water table profile fractional differentiation order heterogeneity degree scale dependent subsurface drainage 1 introduction drainpipes are main component of a subsurface drainage system which determination of their spacing is a critical step in design of the subsurface drainage system the drainpipe spacing is calculated according to the theories used to describe water flow towards the drainpipe these theories have been divided into steady state and transient state flow conditions ritzema 1994 in nature the water flow towards the drainpipe especially in highly variable rainfall or irrigated areas is usually transient ritzema 1994 the transient flow towards the drainpipe is described by boussinesq equation be singh et al 2006 if the changes in the water table height are small in comparison with the value of the water table height the be for a horizontal impervious base is expressed as follows ritzema 1994 1 x k x h x y t x y k y h x y t y μ d h x y t t where x and y are the space variables in two directions l t is the time variable t k x and k y are the hydraulic conductivities of porous medium lt 1 in the x and y directions respectively h x y t is the water table height l μ is the drainable porosity of the porous medium dimensionless and d is the average thickness of the water transmitting layer ritzema 1994 several analytical and numerical solutions of the be for initial and boundary conditions related to the water flow towards the drainpipe have been presented in the literature the shape of the initial water table profile is an important factor to derive an efficient analytical or numerical solution in real situation the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes may be flat parabolic or elliptical which depends on the soil characteristics and drainage situations singh et al 2006 several researchers have analytically solved one dimensional be for various shapes of the initial water table profile e g dumm 1954 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 singh et al 2006 the main drawback of these analytical solutions is the soil homogeneity assumption which implies that the hydraulic conductivity is uniform down to an impermeable layer singh et al 1996 this simplifying assumption is far from reality because soil is seldom uniform or homogeneous in nature ritzema 1994 and the hydraulic conductivity is a scale dependent parameter hunt 2006 to face the problem of the hydraulic conductivity scale dependency some investigators have taken into account the hydraulic conductivity as a function of distance and developed some drainage equations e g singh et al 1996 while some others have applied the numerical methods to simulate the transient flow towards subsurface drains e g mirlas 2013 xin et al 2016b the main limitation of the first approach is that finding a function which describes adequately the variations of the hydraulic conductivity with distance is difficult however the main limitation of the numerical methods is that they require long runtimes asher et al 2015 also they suffer from conceptual truncation and data errors and convergence problems batu 2006 fractional differentiation is one of the other methods in recent years proposed to overcome the problem of the hydraulic conductivity scale dependency wheatcraft and meerschaert 2008 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a 2013b unlike integer order derivatives the fractional derivatives are non local meaning the fractional derivative of a function at a point x depends on characteristics of the function across the entire domain zhang et al 2009 more specifically the space non locality implies that the function change at a given point depends on the function changes on a wide range of spatial zones su 2014 in a space nonlocal model the parameters of the model are scale independent and the scale effects and the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium are reflected by the order of the space fractional derivative α clarke et al 2005 wheatcraft and meerschaert 2008 zhang et al 2009 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a clarke et al 2005 presented three different ranges to classify the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium according to α value these properties of the space nonlocal models have been proved in the previous experimental studies e g benson et al 2001 huang et al 2006 mehdinejadiani et al 2013b moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 in addition to the non locality property the fractional models generally provide a more precise way to describe a complex system tang et al 2015 notwithstanding the mentioned advantages the fractional derivatives have an inherent complexity tang et al 2015 and various definitions that are incompatible with each other avetisyan and tonoyan 2015 in recent years different fractional forms of the governing differential equation on transient flow of water in porous media were presented by various investigators he 1998 suggested a fractional differential equation for seepage flow in porous media using a fractional darcy s law and analytically solved it with a variational iteration method cloot and botha 2006 obtained a fractional equation for simulating groundwater flow by combing the fractional darcy s law and mass conservation compared to theis equation this equation better described drawdown during a constant rate on a borehole mehdinejadiani et al 2013a derived a space fractional partial diﬀ erential equation governing on unconfined groundwater which was called space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe in another research work mehdinejadaini et al 2013b analytically solved the one dimensional sfbe for simulating water transient flow towards drainpipes by assuming a flat initial water table profile and derived a fractional model the fractional model developed by mehdinejadaini et al 2013b considered the heterogeneity degree of soil as a determinable parameter which was estimated using an inverse problem method according to their studies compared to glover dumm equation the fractional model better simulated water table profiles between two parallel drainpipes in the heterogeneous soil a distributed order fractional diffusion wave equation dofdwe and its solutions for water flow to or from a well were proposed by su et al 2015 they demonstrated that simplified solutions of the dofdwe can be applied to obtain the aquifer parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity aquifer diffusivity and transmissivity su 2017 proposed a set of the fbes and presented the analytical solution of the fbe for the confined and unconfined groundwater flow in addition to above mentioned works there is a large body of literature on the application of the fractional derivatives to simulate water flow in porous media that are not mentioned here for the sake of brevity as above mentioned mehdinejadiani et al 2013b assumed a flat initial water table profile to solve the sfbe however as described earlier the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes may be flat parabolic or elliptical to the authors knowledge the solutions of the sfbe for different shapes of the initial water table profile have not been so far presented this provided a motivation to derive a set of the sfbe analytical solutions called fractional models in this work for different shapes of the initial water table profile therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to develop the analytical solutions of the sfbe for three different shapes of initial water table profiles 2 to estimate the parameters of the fractional models and their counterpart classical ones using a stochastic inverse problem procedure and 3 to compare the performances of the fractional models with each other as well as with their counterpart classical ones 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual model in this work a drainage system with equally spaced and parallel drainpipes overlying an impervious horizontal layer was considered fig 1 a two adjacent drainpipes with inner radius of r 0 were placed at a distance of l apart from each other and installed at a depth of d 1 and height of d above the impervious layer fig 1b the drainpipes were assumed half full during the drainage process a x h cartesian coordinate system was taken with origin in the left drainpipe in mathematical drainage models the h x t usually represents the water table height above drain level and researchers choose the x axis coincident with the drain level to derive the model e g see dumm 1954 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 kumar et al 1994 verma et al 1998 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 cooke et al 2001 mehdinejadiani et al 2013b therefore in this study the x axis was coincided with the drain level and the h axis was considered as water table head see fig 1b the assumptions considered to derive the fractional models were as follows i the water table rises almost suddenly due to an instantaneous recharge such as irrigation or rainfall after stopping the recharge the water table falls gradually and water is drained by the drainpipes ii the water flow towards the drainpipe is transient i e the flow rate varies with time because water is stored in or discharged from the soil it should be noted that the change in soil water storage is reflected by rising or falling the water table ritzema 1994 iii the dupuit forchheimer assumptions are valid i e the horizontal flow is only considered in modeling process iv the unsaturated flow above the water table and the saturated flow along the drainpipes y direction were ignored a detailed inspection of the assumptions reveals that all assumptions used to obtain glover dumm s mathematical model ritzema 1994 except for the homogeneity assumption of soil have been here employed to develop the fractional models in addition the saturated flow towards the drainpipes was considered symmetrical with respect to either the midpoint between two adjacent drainpipes x l 2 or the drainpipes xin et al 2016a as can be seen in fig 1 the maximum value of the water table height occurred at x l 2 this results from the symmetry of the flow pattern and the equal installation depth of the drainpipes 2 2 governing fractional differential equation the governing space fractional differential equation on transient flow towards drainpipes is space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe which is based on fractional mass conservation principle validity of darcy s law and dupuit forchheimer assumptions mehdinejadiani et al 2013a for the case in which the changes in h x y t are small in comparison with the h x y t and the impervious base is horizontal the sfbe is given as follows 2 κ x α x α h x y t κ y β y β h x y t μ d h x y t t where α and β 1 2 are respectively the orders of the space fractional derivative in the x and y directions dimensionless the α and β represent heterogeneity degrees of soil in the x and y directions respectively mehdinejadiani et al 2013a which can be estimated using an inverse problem method κ x lα 1t 1 and κ y lβ 1t 1 are respectively the fractional hydraulic conductivities of the porous medium in the x and y directions α h x y t x α and β h x y t y β are respectively the caputo space fractional derivatives of orders α and β with respect to x and y defined in appendix a and the other variables are defined as in eq 1 according to the conceptual model above the saturated flow in y direction was neglected therefore the one dimensional sfbe was applied to describe water flow towards drainpipes and to obtain the analytical solutions the one dimensional sfbe can be written as follows 3 h x t t κ x d μ α x α h x t as above mentioned the sfbe is based on the dupuit forchheimer assumptions and the d has a constant value to have a constant value of the d and to satisfy the dupuit forchheimer assumptions the following equation was suggested for calculating the d skaggs et al 1973 verma et al 1998 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 4 d 0 5 h 0 d e where h 0 is the initial water table head at x l 2 and d e is the hooghoudt s equivalent depth l in eq 4 both h 0 and d e have constant values and consequently the d will have a constant value as well the d e was employed to take into account the effects of non horizontal flow near the drainpipes when the drainpipes do not reach the impermeable layer similar to fig 1b in this study the flow near the drainpipes is not horizontal and consequently the dupuit forchheimer assumptions are no longer valid to satisfy the dupuit forchheimer assumptions horizontal flow near the drainpipes one can use the concept of hooghoudt s equivalent depth ritzema 1994 this is a traditional approach used in drainage mathematical models for details the interested reader is referred to ritzema 1994 pp 263 287 the value of d e was calculated as follows ritzema 1994 5a d e π 8 l ln l π r 0 f θ where l is the distance between two adjacent drainpipes l r 0 is the inner radius of the drainpipe l and 5b θ 2 π d l where d is the actual depth of the impermeable layer below drainpipes see fig 1b the value of f θ in eq 5a was obtained as follows ritzema 1994 5c f θ n 1 3 5 4 e 2 n θ n 1 e 2 n θ 0 5 θ 5d f θ π 2 4 θ ln θ 2 π 10 6 θ 0 5 note that if θ 10 6 d e d ritzema 1994 2 3 boundary and initial conditions based on the conceptual model as depicted in fig 1b the drainpipes are half full and the water surface in drainpipe is in connection with atmosphere therefore the boundary conditions were considered as follows 6a h 0 t h l t 0 as mentioned earlier the shape of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes varies at different soils and drainage situations four types of initial water table shapes that have been considered in the previous studies include case 1 flat dumm 1954 6b h x 0 h 0 case 2 parabola type 1 fourth degree parabola dumm 1964 6c h x 0 8 h 0 l 4 l 3 x 3 l 2 x 2 4 l x 3 2 x 4 case 3 parabola type 2 singh et al 2006 6d h x 0 16 h 0 l 4 x 2 l x 2 case 4 ellipse singh et al 2006 6e x l 2 2 l 2 h 0 d 2 4 h 0 d 2 d 2 h x 0 d 2 h 0 d 2 1 the analytical solution of the one dimensional sfbe under boundary conditions eq 6a has been only obtained for the flat initial water table profile mehdinejadiani et al 2013b in this study the one dimensional sfbe is analytically solved for boundary conditions eq 6a and parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles the reason for considering these initial conditions is that the shapes of the initial water table profile between two parallel drainpipes can be flat parabola type 1 parabola type 2 or elliptical as mentioned earlier the shape of the initial water table profile depends on the soil characteristics and drainage situations singh et al 2006 the soil characteristics imply texture and structure of soil while the drainage situations signify single and multi level drainage systems 2 4 derivation of analytical mathematical models in this work a spectral representation of the fractional laplacian operator ilic et al 2005 daftardar gejji and jafari 2006 was applied to derive the analytical solutions of the eq 3 the spectral representation was obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem where eigenvalues λ n were given by λ n n π l 2 for n 1 2 3 and corresponding eigenfunctions h n x were nonzero constant multiples of h n x sin n π l x then the solution was set as follows ilic et al 2005 7a h x t n 1 c n t sin n π l x the eq 7a automatically satisfies the boundary conditions eq 6a by inserting eq 7a into eq 3 and simplifying the following ordinary differential equations ode obtained ilic et al 2005 7b d c n t d t κ x d μ n π l α c n t 0 the general solution of the eq 7b is as follows 7c c n t c n 0 exp κ x d μ n π l α t therefore the analytical solution of the eq 3 can be written as follows 7d h x t n 1 c n 0 exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x the coefficient c n 0 in the eq 7d is obtained using the initial conditions 7e h x 0 n 1 c n 0 sin n π l x as can be seen in the eq 7e the c n 0 must be the coefficients of fourier sine series given as follows 7f c n 0 2 l 0 l h x 0 sin n π l x d x as mentioned in subsection 2 3 this study presents the analytical solutions of the sfbe for the parabola type 1 parabola type 1 and elliptical initial water table profiles therefore the coefficient c n 0 and consequently the final analytical solutions were separately obtained for each initial water table profile shape as follows case 2 parabola type 1 initial water table profile 8a c n 0 192 h 0 π 5 n π 2 8 n 5 for n 1 3 5 8b h x t 192 h 0 π 5 n 1 3 5 n π 2 8 n 5 exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x case 3 parabola

n 0 and the definition of their parameters has been presented in appendix b the eqs 8b 9b and 10b are the fractional mathematical models which can be applied to both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils these models are the generalized form of the classical analytical models which have been derived using soil homogeneity assumption by previous investigators e g dumm 1964 uziak and chieng 1989 the performances of the fractional mathematical models developed in this study were compared to the performance of the fractional mathematical model developed by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b and their counterpart classical models as mentioned in introduction mehdinejadiani et al 2013b derived their mathematical model for a flat initial water table profile as follows 11 h x t 4 h 0 π n 1 3 5 1 n exp κ x d μ n π l α t sin n π l x for simplicity the eqs 8b 9b 10b and 11 are hereafter denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f respectively also the counterpart classical models of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f are denoted as be p1 be p2 be e and be f respectively 2 5 parameter estimation sensitivity analysis and prediction 2 5 1 parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis the parameters of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f were estimated using a stochastic inverse problem method as well known each inverse model is constituted of three components including design variables objective function and optimization algorithm the design variables are the same parameters of the mathematical models which are estimated using the inverse method the design variables of the inverse models developed for estimating the parameters of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e and sfbe f included the ratio of the fractional hydraulic conductivity to the drainable porosity κ x μ and the heterogeneity degree of soil α whereas the design variables of those developed for estimating the parameters of the be p1 be p2 be e and be f only included the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity to the drainable porosity k x μ indeed the classical models for different initial water table profiles were reproduced by fixing the α parameter of their counterpart fractional models to 2 and by considering the soil homogeneity assumption to find the optimum values of the design variables the lack of fit mean square pachepsky et al 2000 was used as the objective function 12 minimize o f 1 n p i 1 n h i c a l c h i m e a s 2 where o f is the objective function n is the number of the measurement points p is the number of the model parameters h i c a l c is the calculated water table heights above the drain level l at the i th point and h i m e a s is the experimentally measured water table heights above the drain level l at the i th point the details of the experimental data used in this work will be described in section 2 6 it should be noted that all values of h i m e a s were not used to estimate the parameters a part of h i m e a s values was utilized to estimate the parameters and the rest was used to investigate the predictive ability of the models to minimize the objective function a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm was applied this algorithm has been briefly described in appendix c although the pso is a stochastic algorithm and it does not require the sensitivity analysis of model input parameters ding et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects and relative importance of input parameters of the fractional models to this end a normalized sensitivity method was used whose details have been given in appendix d 2 5 2 predictive ability of models after estimating the parameters of the models the water table profiles between two parallel drainpipes at different times not used to estimate the parameters were predicted using the fractional models and their counterpart classical ones the performances of the models were evaluated using graphical displays and statistical criteria the graphical displays used in this study included comparison of matched measured and predicted water table data and comparison of measured and predicted water table profiles the statistical criteria applied to evaluate the model performances included reduced chi square error χ dhanushkodi et al 2017 maximum error me mehdinejadiani et al 2013b and adjusted determination coefficient r a d j 2 lima et al 2015 13a χ 1 n p i 1 n h i c a l c h i m e a s 2 13b m e m a x h i c a l c h i m e a s i 1 n 13c r a d j 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n p 1 where r 2 is the determination coefficient calculated as follows lima et al 2015 13d r 2 1 i 1 n h i c a l c h i m e a s 2 i 1 n h i m e a s h m e a s 2 where h m e a s is the average of water table height values experimentally measured and the other variables are defined as in eq 12 note that the use of r a d j 2 is due to difference between the parameter number of the developed models and that of classical ones lima et al 2015 it is necessary to mention that a model with the lowest χ and me values and r a d j 2 value closer to unity is the best model 2 6 experimental studies to estimate the parameters and to investigate the predictive ability of the sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f the water table data experimentally measured are required therefore the experimental studies were carried out at laboratory and field scales to this end the experimental data published in the literature were used at the laboratory scale 30 water table profiles from two experiment sets were used which were collected in sandboxes with different dimensions fig 2 illustrates the general design of the sandboxes applied to collect the water table data where l 2 is the half of the distance between two adjacent drainpipes and d is distance of impervious layer from the drain level also table 1 presents detailed information about laboratory setup and soil texture of each experiment set to evaluate the performances of the sfbe e sfbe f be p1 be p2 be e and be f at the field scale the water table data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b for an actually operating drainage system were used this drainage system had been constructed on a date palm farm near abadan khuzestan province iran 30 1 49 8 n latitude and 48 29 5 27 e longitude the farm soil is silty clay in texture a tight clay layer exists at about 150 cm depth which is considered as the impervious layer corrugated p v c drainpipes 10 cm in diameter pre wrapped with synthetic envelope of pp450 were installed at about 130 cm depth the distance between two adjacent drainpipes was 30 m five observation wells 10 cm in diameter and approximately 150 cm in depth were installed along a row at different distances of between adjacent drainpipes to measure the water table fluctuations and consequently to determine the water table profiles between adjacent drainpipes 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis of fractional models fig 3 shows the results of sensitivity analysis for the fractional models it is found from fig 3a and b that all fractional models are more sensitive to the changes in the α parameter than the variations in the κ x μ parameter the most sensitive model to the changes in the parameters is the sfbe f followed by sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe p2 respectively in addition the normalized sensitivities of all models increase significantly with increasing the distance from the drainpipes this finding implies that the existence of the perturbation in the model input parameters makes a considerable error in the model output results at the far distances from drainpipe 3 2 parameters of mathematical models and their interpretation for the fine sand used by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b the parameter optimum values of the fractional and classical mathematical models were appraised using water table data at times of 16 30 45 60 90 120 180 and 240 min after drainage start table 2 summarizes the estimated parameters of the mathematical models and the associated values of o f the o f values of the fractional mathematical models at the optimum points of the parameters reveal that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide good fits to the data followed by sfbe p1 and sfbe p2 respectively as can be seen in table 2 the α values of all fractional mathematical models studied here especially in the sfbe e and sfbe f are very close to 2 this demonstrates the fine sand is relatively homogeneous clarke et al 2005 this finding is in excellent agreement with the physical properties of the fine sand applied by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b because they used a very uniform sand to minimize its heterogeneity degree overall the fractional models except for the sfbe p2 show relatively similar results in the form of values of the o f and design variables for all initial water table profiles similar to the fractional models the o f values of the classical models imply the superiority of the be e be f and be p1 over the be p2 in general a detailed inspection of the results reveals that the κ x μ optimum values and o f values of the fractional models especially in the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 are approximately equal to the k x μ optimum values and o f values of the classical ones these demonstrate that the fractional models reduce to the classical ones in the relatively homogeneous soil for the soil used by pandey et al 1992 the optimum values of the parameters were estimated using water table data at times of 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after drainage start this soil composed of about 54 sand 21 silt and 26 clay and classified as sandy clay loam according to the usda classification table 2 lists the parameter values and along with the o f values one can see from table 2 that the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 approximately have similar fit results these three models give good fits to the data whereas the sfbe p2 offers a weak fit the α values of the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 imply that the soil used by pandey et al 1992 has an average heterogeneity degree clarke et al 2005 this conclusion seems logical with regards to the physical properties of the soil applied by pandey et al 1992 the reduction of the α value to 1 3 can be resulted from the existence of wide range of the particle sizes in the soil mass 54 sand 21 silt and 26 clay while the non reduction of the α value to less than 1 3 can be related to carefully pack the sandbox pandey et al 1992 filled the sandbox carefully with the sandy clay loam soil to minimize preferential flow paths this can create a less heterogeneous porous medium because the heterogeneity degree of the porous medium and the presence of the preferential paths are correlated to each other kapetas et al 2014 as observed in table 2 the sfbe p2 not only does not fit well to the data but also does not reflect the expected heterogeneity degree of the soil similar to the fractional models the be e be f and be p1 provide much better fits to the data than the be p2 see table 2 also the comparison of the fit results reveals that the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 give somewhat better fits to the data than be e be f and be p1 respectively for the field experimental data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013b the water table data at times of 3 5 and 10 days after drainage start were used to estimate the parameter optimum values of the mathematical models table 2 presents the fit results of the mathematical models to the field experimental data the o f values elucidate that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide much better fits to the data followed by sfbe p1 and sfbe p2 respectively according to the α values of the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 the farm soil appears to be relatively heterogeneous clarke et al 2005 this finding is acceptable from practical viewpoint because the soil is usually heterogeneous at the filed scale similar to the obtained results using pandey et al s 1992 data it is also observed here that the sfbe p2 does not describe the soil heterogeneity degree with regards to the o f values of the classical models the be e be f and be p1 give much better fits to the data in comparison with the be p2 according to the o f values the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 provide much better fits in comparison with the be e be f and be p1 3 3 predictive performance of models in the fine sand the water table profiles at times of 12 20 28 39 48 70 100 150 210 270 and 300 min after start of drainage were predicted using the fractional and classical models to this end the parameters of the models estimated by simultaneously fitting multiple water table profiles at different times were applied table 3 summarizes the values of the statistical criteria and fig 4 shows the comparison of the measured water table data with those predicted by each model as evident from table 3 and fig 4 the sfbe e and sfbe f provide the best prediction results whereas the sfbe p1 gives somewhat weaker results in contrast to the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 there are pronounced discrepancies between the measured data and the predicted results by the sfbe p2 a detailed inspection of the predicted water table profiles at different times after drainage start confirms these findings for example fig 5 depicts the measured and predicted water table profiles at times of 20 70 210 and 300 min after start of drainage as observed the sfbe e and sfbe f predict the water table profiles at different times appropriately whereas the sfbe p2 is unable to adequately simulate the profiles for the classical models similar to the fractional ones the be e and be f offer the best performances followed by the be p1 also with regards to the statistical criteria and graphical comparisons table 3 and figs 4 and 5 the be p2 gives the weakest performance in the sandy clay loam soil the predictive abilities of the fractional and classical models were investigated at times of 3 5 7 and 9 days after start of drainage the associated χ r a d j 2 and me values are listed in table 3 and the matched measured and predicted water table data are shown in fig 6 as observed the sfbe e sfbe f and sfbe p1 approximately have similar performances these three models simulate the water table data adequately whereas the sfbe p2 provides weaker results the comparison of the measured and predicted water table profiles at different times also reflects this finding e g see fig 7 in the classical models the χ r a d j 2 and me values table 3 and the comparison of the measured and predicted data figs 6 and 7 reveal the performance superiority of the be e be f and be p1 over be p2 at the field scale the water table profiles at times of 2 4 and 6 days after start of drainage were predicted the prediction results demonstrate that the performances of the sfbe e and sfbe f are nearly the same and are somewhat better than those of the sfbe p1 see table 3 and fig 8 it is also discovered from table 3 and fig 8 that the sfbe p2 cannot describe the water table data satisfactorily a detailed examination of the simulation results at different times after start of drainage confirms the above mentioned results for example fig 9 shows the measured and simulated water table profiles at times of 2 and 4 days after drainage start as observed the profiles simulated by the sfbe e and sfbe f exactly coincide with each other and somewhat better describe the profiles experimentally measured than the sfbe p1 it is also found from fig 9 that the sfbe p2 provides the weakest results among the fractional models in the classical models the comparison of the model performances indicates a similar trend to what was observed in the fractional models see table 3 and figs 8 and 9 this means that the be e and be f nearly have the same performances and provide somewhat better simulation results as compared to the be p1 also as evident from table 3 and figs 8 and 9 the simulated results by the be p2 are very far from the measured data 3 4 comparison of fractional and classical models as mentioned in subsections 3 2 and 3 3 the models supposed the elliptical or flat initial water table profile approximately have the same performances and provide better results in comparison with the models assumed the parabola type 1 or parabola type 2 initial water table profile therefore for the sake of brevity we only compare the fractional model taken into consideration the elliptical initial water table profile sfbe e with its counterpart classical model be e as concluded in subsection 3 2 the sfbe e reduces to the be e in the sand fine as a relatively homogeneous soil the identical χ r a d j 2 and me values of the sfbe e and be e table 3 and similar fit and prediction results figs 4 and 5 confirm the similar performance of the sfbe e and be e in the relatively homogeneous soil the comparison of the sfbe e and be e performances at the laboratory and field scales with the heterogeneous soils indicates the superiority of the sfbe e over the be e as observed in table 3 the χ and me values decrease from 0 0119 to 0 0050 58 and from 0 303 to 0 159 48 respectively and the r a d j 2 value increases from 0 769 to 0 902 17 when the sfbe e instead of the be e is applied to simulate the water table profile at the laboratory scale with the averagely heterogeneous soil similarly the application of the sfbe e instead of the be e at the field scale with the relatively heterogeneous soil decreases the χ and me values and increases the r a d j 2 value significantly respectively about 49 37 and 13 figs 6 7 8 9 confirm these findings 4 conclusion in this study a space fractional boussinesq equation sfbe was analytically solved for parabola type 1 parabola type 2 and elliptical initial water table profiles the derived fractional models and their counterpart classical ones were denoted as sfbe p1 sfbe p2 sfbe e be p1 be p2 and be e respectively the performances of the models were investigated at the laboratory and field scales for soils with various heterogeneity degrees also the performances of the above mentioned models were compared to that of a fractional model developed for a flat initial water table profile sfbe f and its counterpart classical one be f the parameters of the models were estimated using a stochastic inverse problem method which utilized a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm also the relative importance of input parameters of the fractional models κ x μ and α was assessed by conducting a sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis reveals that the fractional models are more affected by the changes in the α parameter also the α value in the sfbe p1 sfbe e and sfbe f represents well the heterogeneity degree of soil the α value especially in the sfbe e and sfbe f are nearly equal to 2 and the fractional models reduce to the classical ones in the relatively homogeneous soil a total comparison of the fractional models with their counterpart classical ones demonstrates that the fractional models for all initial water table conditions are superior over the classical ones especially in the heterogeneous soils also the detailed comparison of the fractional model performances reveals that the sfbe e and sfbe f provide similar and better performances than the sfbe p1 whereas the sfbe p2 gives the weakest performance it is interesting to mention that this trend is also observed in the classical models the comparison of the sfbe e performances with the be e ones demonstrated that the sfbe e is highly superior to the be e in the heterogeneous soils in a nutshell it can be concluded that the sfbe e and sfbe f are highly effective models to simulate the water table profiles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils declaration of competing interests

greatly appreciate two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which led to significant improvement of the manuscript appendix a caputo space fractional derivative the fractional derivative of a function f x is an arbitrary order derivative of the function f x whose differentiation order is an arbitrary positive number podlubny 1999 several different definitions have been proposed for fractional derivative such as riemann liouville grunwald letnikov caputo marchaud and erdélyi kober kochubei and luchko 2019 the caputo definition has been widely used in engineering applications because it requires initial conditions in traditional form for integer order differential equations ray and sahoo 2015 the α order caputo space fractional derivative of a function h x y t with respect

be noted that in this study α 1 2 and consequently m 2 appendix b derivation of coefficient c n 0 as mentioned early the coefficients c n 0 are the coefficients of fourier sine series see eq 7f therefore coefficient c n 0 for each initial water table profile shape was obtained by solving integral mentioned in the eq 7f case 2 parabola type 1 initial water table profile by inserting the eq 6c

after several times integration by parts and simplification can be written as follows b 5 c n 0 128 h 0 π 3 1 n 3 12 n π 2 1 for n 1 3 5 case 4 elliptical initial water table profile in this case due to mathematical complications the elliptical initial water table profile was approximated by two well known negative exponential functions as follows uziak and chieng 1989 b 6a h x 0 a 1 exp b x for 0 x l 2 b 6b h x 0 a 1 exp b l x for l 2 x l where a h 0 1 exp b l 2 and b 2 l 1 h 0 d 2 uziak and chieng 1989 demonstrated that these negative exponential functions adequately approximate the elliptical initial water table profile within the ranges used in drainage studies therefore for case 4 the coefficient c n 0 was obtained by solving the following integral b 7 c n 0 2 a l 0 l 2 1 exp b x sin n π l x d x l 2 l 1 exp b l x sin n π l x d x after several times integration by parts and simplification is obtained b 8 c n 0 2 a 1 n π 1 cos n π 1 n π 2 b l 2 n π 1 cos n π 2 sin n π 2 b l exp b l 2 as well known for n 2 4 6 cos n π 1 and sin n π 2 0 also for n 1 3 5 cos n π 1 and sin n π 2 1 n 1 2 therefore the eq b 8 can be expressed as follows b 9 c n 0 4 a 1 n π e n π 1 n 1 2 b l

pressure to reduce contamination of water bodies nitrate in drinking water abstracted from aquifers is considered to increase the risk of infant methaemoglobinemia also known as blue baby syndrome follett and follett 2001 this is a serious and sometimes fatal condition that affects babies and infants follett and follett 2001 because of this concern and the need to reduce eutrophication of surface water the european union eu nitrates directive directive 91 676 eec anonymous 1991 was enacted in 1991 to reduce contamination of subterranean and surface water with no3 from agricultural sources the eu nitrates directive requires member states i e eu countries to identify areas that have or are at risk of having groundwater with no3 concentrations of more than 50 mg no3 l 1 or eutrophication of surface water such areas are declared nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs and are required to implement an action plan of improved crop management practices to reduce no3 contamination in

subterranean water throughout the eu the nitrates directive and other relevant water quality directives e g those relating to ppps were incorporated into the water framework directive part of the eu water framework directive is to limit the contamination of water bodies with ppps the subsequent eu directive 2009 128 anonymous 2009 was to reduce emissions of ppps by farmers this directive

contamination of water bodies from vegetable production and other agricultural activities in europe is continually increasing in response to growing societal concerns for high water quality in natural systems and for minimal environmental pollution 4 additional pressure applied to vegetable growers to reduce contamination of water bodies in addition to the increasing legislative pressure to reduce n losses to water bodies vegetable growers are also subject to pressure from consumers who increasingly wish to purchase vegetable produce from non contaminating production systems probably the most common certification scheme for fruit and vegetables in europe is global gap https www globalgap org uk en which is generally the minimum standard for eu supermarkets over time global gap is increasing its requirements and recommendations for fertiliser and irrigation management to reduce excessive applications of both n fertiliser and irrigation there is increasing demand by supermarket chains that vegetable producers participate in alternative certification schemes with stricter requirements for environmental production such as planet proof https www planetproof international eu 527

irrigated crop production agriculture competes with urban requirements industry and tourism for limited fresh water resources this is not only an issue for drier regions with relatively low rainfall in recent years temperate areas such as belgium have suffered from serious water shortages during droughts and drier summer periods additionally over abstraction of water resources such as aquifers particularly for irrigation is a major threat to the sustainability of european water resources the consequences include aquifer depletion sea water intrusion in coastal areas and increased pumping costs to obtain aquifer water climate change scenarios of reduced annual rainfall particularly in southern europe of altered rainfall patterns and higher temperatures will exacerbate the issues of competition for limited fresh water and of over abstraction given the limitations of the fresh water supply competition from other sectors and the over exploitation of water resources vegetable growers are under increasing pressure to irrigate as efficiently as possible furthermore excessive irrigation is one of the main factors responsible for no3 leaching from crop and vegetable production quemada et al 2013 good irrigation management of vegetable crops is fundamental to optimise the use of limited fresh water and to minimise no3 leaching loss quemada et al 2013 thompson et al 2020 it is a basic requirement for sustainable irrigated vegetable production 6 water quality issues the low annual rainfall of much of southern europe and the common occurrence of alkaline soils in drier regions provide an environment in which irrigated vegetable production contributes to the on going salinisation of aquifers the use of moderately saline aquifer water for irrigation raises issues of crop selection and salinity management given that salinity management involves additional irrigation to displace salts from the immediate root zone this creates a management conflict with the increasingly important objective of reducing no3 leaching which requires reduced drainage this management conflict known as the no3 leaching salinity paradox yasuor et al 2020 is a growing and important challenge for vegetable production in soil in the mediterranean basin in some mediterranean areas moderate to high concentrations of some microelements such as boron can occur in irrigation water this can be the consequence of environmental and or anthropogenic factors the use of such water limits the potential for the recirculation of nutrient solution in soilless systems carmassi et al 2013 7 soilless cropping systems soilless cropping systems in greenhouses potentially provide numerous advantages for vegetable crop production because of the degree of control over the crop shoot and root environments where practised the collection and recycling of drainage from the growing media substantially reduces nutrient and drainage loss resulting in very high nutrient and water use

the focus is principally on greenhouse production however open field crops are also considered the dutch situation is particularly interesting in the european context because to varying degrees it likely represents the challenges that other european societies will face in the not so distant future following the remarkable success of soilless greenhouse cropping in the netherlands and belgium in terms of yields and reduced nutrient and water losses there has been considerable interest in the possibilities of this system in southern europe massa et al 2020 review experiences and current knowledge on the adoption of soilless cropping in southern europe this review deals with the relevant management issues associated with nutrient and water loss and management strategies diverse technologies available and structural solutions for minimising nutrient and water loss they also discuss the reasons for the recent decline in the adoption of soilless cropping in some important cropping regions of southern europe the combination of review articles in this special issue provides a body of information that demonstrates the state of the art of techniques and tools which are

demanding regarding environmental standards van der salm et al 2020 review recent developments in adapting high technology dutch vegetable production to very high standards of environmental protection the focus is principally on greenhouse production however open field crops are also considered the dutch situation is particularly interesting in the european context because to varying degrees it likely represents the challenges that other european societies will face in the not so distant future following the remarkable success of soilless greenhouse cropping in the netherlands and belgium in terms of yields and reduced nutrient and water losses there has been considerable interest in the possibilities of this system in southern europe massa et al 2020 review experiences and current knowledge on the adoption of soilless cropping in southern europe this review deals with the relevant management issues associated with nutrient and water loss and management strategies diverse technologies available and structural solutions for minimising nutrient and water loss they also discuss the reasons for the recent decline in the adoption of soilless cropping in some important cropping regions of southern europe the combination of review articles in this special issue provides a body of information that demonstrates the state of the art of techniques and tools which are available in europe to reduce the contamination of water bodies from vegetable production this information will be relevant for all societies interested in the production of vegetables required for a healthy diet with minimal negative impact on water resources
