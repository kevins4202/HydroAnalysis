24595,rural communities in the himalayan kingdom of bhutan are dependant on natural capital for their livelihoods climate change impacts on ecosystem could have serious consequences for these communities but little research has been done to explore these potential impacts in this study we used boosted regression tree brt models to model current and potential future distribution of major timber species abies densa pinus wallichiana tsuga dumosa fuelwood species quercus spp betula spp betula utilis rhododendron spp rhododendron arboreum and an important non timber resource ophiocordyceps sinensis in bhutan himalayan region models were based on species presence and absence data from 575 plots and a new high resolution climate dataset developed for bhutan future projections were based on ipcc s representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the 2080s in bhutan mean annual temperature and precipitation of driest quarters were found to be the most influential variables in modelling the current distribution of these species with the distribution of most of the species projected to decrease significantly and shift to higher elevations the current distribution of ophiocordyceps sinensis was modelled to decrease by 79 at the national level with only 21 range overlap between current and future distributions current distribution of timber species like abies densa and tsuga dumosa were modelled to decline by 98 and 99 respectively at national level with very low range overlaps between current and future distribution suggesting high species vulnerability to climate change in contrast fuel wood species like betula spp quercus spp rhododendron arboreum all exhibited less vulnerability to climate change with over 50 of their current range overlapping with future distribution across bhutan and in the nikachu watershed these potential changes in distribution patterns of these species could impact on the functions and ecosystem services provided by these species and socio economic conditions of rural communities reliant on these species for their livelihoods in bhutan lower rates of global greenhouse gas emissions and adoption of adaptation measures and management interventions can reduce these potential impacts 1 introduction communities in mountainous regions are predominantly rural and many depend on forest resources and ecosystem services for their livelihoods gratzer and keeton 2017 choden et al 2020 in developing countries 28 of the total income is from environmental income out of which 77 comes from natural forests angelsen et al 2014 climate can have an influential role on the ecosystem services provided by mountain forests which in turn can put pressure on communities dependant on them for their livelihoods bernier and schoene 2009 gratzer and keeton 2017 the impacts of climate change are therefore expected to have serious consequences for forest dependant communities chaturvedi et al 2011 despite the high dependence on forest resources in mountainous regions the direct impacts of climate change on important forest resources in many regions such as the himalayas has not been extensively studied dutta et al 2014 schickhoff et al 2015 telwala et al 2013 chakraborty et al 2016 this is concerning given that the himalayan region is a global biodiversity hotspot telwala et al 2013 and is reported to be experiencing a three times higher rate of warming than the global average shrestha et al 2012 climate change is anticipated to alter the distribution of forest types and tree species across all the world s biomes with future change likely to occur at rates and magnitudes that are beyond the adaptive capacity of many species and ecosystems seppala et al 2009 a changing climate is expected to cause local extirpation extinction of species a shift of species ranges and niches aitken et al 2008 chen et al 2011 hickling et al 2006 rosenzweig et al 2007 telwala et al 2013 wilson et al 2005 changes in the timing of phenological events rawal et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2009 and changes in species assemblages parmesan and yohe 2003 changes in the composition and structure of ecosystems could lead to loss of key ecological functions and services seppala et al 2009 mountain ecosystems in general are particularly sensitive to distributional change and range shifts because of sharp temperature and precipitation gradients over short distances gratzer and keeton 2017 the predicted influence of climate change in the himalayan region includes changes in phenology and changes in the geographic ranges of species through shifts in the tree line and or contraction in the spatial distribution of plant communities pandit et al 2014 for example the upward displacement of endemic plant species in sikkim himalaya has already been observed with an increase in range of 27 m in altitude per decade between 1849 and 2010 telwala et al 2013 in addition to species range shifts changes in species composition and community structure have also been observed for instance in the tibetan plateau 39 of alpine meadows were converted to shrub lands between 1990 and 2009 brandt et al 2013 the observed impacts of observed climate change are congruent with the predicted impacts of future climate change in the central himalayas for example chakraborty et al 2016 predicted that the ranges for ecological and economically dominant forest tree species such as quercus spp and pinus roxburghii are likely to decrease at lower elevation but increase at higher elevations a study from the eastern himalayas suggests that by the 2050s 2070s 16 18 of endemic angiosperm species are likely to lose their potential habitat manish et al 2016 in addition at the community level 1 to 3 of the current area of meadows could potentially be lost to encroachment by shrubs by the 2050s 2070s manish et al 2016 under a changing climate a high degree of fluidity in vegetation structure and composition should be expected highlighting the importance of evaluating the potential impact of climate change on vegetation in the himalayan region manish et al 2016 species distribution modelling sdm approaches are commonly used for assessing the impact of climate change on species and ecosystems elith and leathwick 2009 sdms assume an equilibrium state exists between climate and vegetation this static climate vegetation approach assumes that the future climate and vegetation relationship will remain the same as in the past this assumption is uncertain and limits the inferences that can be drawn from equilibrium models nitschke and innes 2008 mechanistic models on the other hand are more robust since they identify major climatic and environmental constraints and include more representation of ecological processes that improves understanding the impacts of climate change on species distribution mok et al 2012 despite their potential limitations keenan 2015 mok et al 2012 nitschke et al 2012 sdms are typically the only tools available for assessing potential impacts of climate change on plant species and identifying important geographic areas for conservation aitken et al 2008 sdms can provide useful information for decision makers to develop future management plans jaeschke et al 2014 as long as it is well understood that transient responses of vegetation to climate change constraints on plant recruitment and growth and formation of novel communities may not be represented ravindranath et al 2006 ravindranath and sukumar 1996 1998 bhutan is located within the south asian monsoon region and is characterised by a huge gradient in elevation complex topographic features and diverse land cover dorji et al 2016 and an associated high diversity in climate stewart et al 2017 despite its small geographical area climate is expected to change significantly depending on future trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation projected to increase by 3 5 c and between 80 and 180 mm by the 2050s respectively tse ring et al 2010 bhutan has 71 of its land under forest cover rgob 2016 while 69 of the population is rural based and dependant on natural resources for their livelihoods despite bhutan s perceived sensitivity dorji et al 2016 hoy et al 2016 to the impacts of climate change there is limited information on how climatic conditions and geographical constraints define the current vegetation cover and there has been virtually no investigation of the potential impacts of climate change on forests and people s livelihoods such information is necessary to explore the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems and human livelihoods in bhutan and consider adaptation options dorji et al 2016 initial studies on the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation in bhutan was based on the modelling of holdridge forest classification types nec 2011 a general northward and upward altitudinal movement of major forest biomes was modelled for the 2020s and 2050s with the subtropical biome entering the southern margins of the temperate forest biome and the alpine biome declining nec 2011 there are significant limitations with the holdridge forest classification system peng 2000 a major limitation with using broad zonal vegetation models such as the holdridge forest classification system is that they consider all species to be influenced homogenously by climate and that species composition within the biomes will remain constant under changing climatic conditions and migrate as one unit davis et al 1998 lugo et al 1999 peng 2000 terrestrial ecosystems are however composed of many species which respond individually to changing environmental conditions rather than moving in concert this is likely to result in novel ecosystems with new compositions and different functions davis 1986 this study attempts to address these limitations by using high resolution climate surfaces stewart et al 2017 combined with boosted regression tree statistical models based on forest inventory databases that contain records of tree species presence and absence across bhutan these are used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on important tree species and ophiocordyceps sinensis o sinensis in bhutan the suite of studied species represents important natural resources for supporting rural livelihoods in bhutan choden et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to assess potential shifts in the distributions of important tree species and o sinensis under changing climatic conditions in bhutan plausible scenarios of the impact of climate change on forests and natural resources can support a decision centred approach to adapt to climate change keenan 2015 assessing the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems is therefore critical for developing better conservation and management strategies that can be adopted for both biodiversity conservation and enhancement of community livelihoods joshi et al 2012 the objectives of the study were to i identify climatic variables determining the distribution of important tree species and an important non wood product ii to model the potential future distribution of these species under a future climate change scenario and iii assess the niche overlap between current and potential future distribution of species 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the country level and within the nikachu watershed where information on natural resources and livelihoods were identified by choden 2018 and choden et al 2020 the kingdom of bhutan has an area of 38 394 km2s ranging 300 km east west and 170 km north south nsb 2013 and has one of the most variable mountain terrains in the world elevations range from 150 m to 7500 m above sea level nec 2016 bhutan has 71 of its land under forest cover rgob 2016 69 of the population is rural based and dependant on natural resources for their livelihoods despite bhutan s perceived sensitivity dorji et al 2016 hoy et al 2016 to the impacts of climate change analysis of the relationships between climate geography and vegetation cover is limited the country can be divided into three broad physiographic zones the southern belt consists of the himalayan foothills with altitude ranging from 150 m to 2000 m with sub tropical forest at 150 2000 m a s l covering broadleaf forest chir pine pinus roxburghii forest and tropical low land forest the central belt with the main river valleys and steep mountains ranging from 2000 to 4000 m in altitude supporting temperate forests of fir abies densa forest blue pine pinus wallichiana forest mixed conifer and broadleaf conifer mixed forests and the northern belt encompassing high mountains and alpine meadows above 4000 m nec 2016 nsb 2017 a finer scale study was conducted in the nikachu watershed 45 126 ha in west central region of bhutan fig 1 the watershed has two administrative units blocks sephu and tansibji blocks occur within districts and are the smallest administrative units in bhutan and comprise several villages forest resources play a vital role in the lives of communities living in the watershed although the degree of dependence on these resources varies between the two blocks choden et al 2020 communities in sephu block which represents the higher altitude areas of the watershed are dependant for significant income on sale of o sinensis an insect fungus which fetches high prices in the international market for its medicinal value communities in tansibji located at lower elevations are dependant on forest products for subsistence needs and are more commonly engaged in off farm activities to earn cash income vegetation in the watershed transitions with increasing elevation from cool broadleaved forest to blue pine forest to mixed conifer forest to fir forest to alpine meadows broad leaved forests dominate in the tangsibji block whereas conifer forests and alpine meadows typify sephu block the high altitude rangelands are important head water sources of the nikachhu river 2 2 species presence and absence data the species investigated in this study were abies densa pinus wallichiana and tsuga dumosa important timber species quercus spp betula spp betula utilis rhododendron spp acer spp pinus roxburghii and rhododendron arboreum important fuel wood species and a non wood forest product ophiocordyceps sinensis these species were selected based on a household survey conducted in nikachu watershed in which the communities identified and prioritized the timber and fuel wood species most important for subsistence use and non wood forest product for their cash income choden 2018 georeferenced species presence and absence data used for this study were gathered from several different sources representing different forest types and regions of the country a total of 575 plots spread across the country were used 224 plots were from the national forest inventory nfi dofps 2017 representing wangdiphodrang and trongsa districts the data was collected from a nfi cluster plot laid on a 4 4 km grid the remaining 351 plots of 20 20 m were collated from zhemgang forest division watershed management division wmd wangchuck centennial park wcp jigme dorji wangchuk national park jdnp managed by the department of forest and park services bhutan additional plots were provided from previous studies choden and ohsawa 2011 moktan et al 2016 these plots were located across bhutan representing paro haa wangdiphodrang chukha zhemgang samtse trongsa and gasa districts the plot data from different studies was amalgamated into one large dataset containing records of species presence and absence for the study region 2 3 snow and scrub forests we also modelled the current and future distributions of snow glacier cover and scrub forest as demarcated in the bhutan land use classification system these were modelled as they represent the lower and upper elevation neighbouring communities to the alpine meadows in which o sinensis occurs to model these we randomly selected 2000 presence and absence points that were a minimum of 5 km apart across the distribution of these land cover types we used the same modelling approaches for these land cover types as used for species 2 4 climate data to model the potential distribution of selected species we used high resolution 225 m climate surface layers for bhutan developed by stewart et al 2017 the spatial climate data set was comprised of monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and vapour pressure climate normal interpolated for the 1986 2015 reference period using trivariate smoothing splines stewart et al 2017 to determine potential future distribution of tree species under climate change we used datasets of future climate change from the climate change knowledge portal website created by the world bank http sdwebx worldbank org climateportal the portal provides an online tool for accessing comprehensive global regional and country level data related to climate change and development we selected one future climate projection for bhutan based on representative carbon pathway rcp 8 5 for the 2080 2099 time period as adopted in the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 ipcc 2013 rcp 8 5 represents the highest potential rate of climate change associated with business as usual greenhouse gas emissions and was chosen to represent the upper limit of potential species responses 2 5 species distribution modelling we used boosted regression trees brt to model the current and future distributions of the chosen species brt models are a machine learning approach commonly used to develop species distribution models elith et al 2008 friedman et al 2000 brt combines the strength of regression trees with boosting which is an aggregation of many simple models into one ensemble for better predictive performance the brt model was developed in r version 3 2 3 r core development team 2015 using the r packages dismo hijmans et al 2015 gbm ridgeway 2006 and raster hijman 2015 for fitting models assessing relative influence making projections and mapping potential distributions we split the occurrence and absence data for each species randomly into a training 75 and a testing 25 set then for each species a brt model using gbm step was built with a training data set using a bernoulli distribution and tree complexity learning rate and bag fraction set to 5 0 005 and 0 5 respectively for predicting sites from the brt model we used a testing data set with a fixed number of trees n 5000 2 5 1 predictor variables nineteen bioclimatic variables were chosen from stewart et al 2017 and an additional variable the annual heat moisture index ahmi which represents atmospheric aridity was calculated following paudel et al 2016 all variables considered are summarised in table s1 in the supplement to account for multicollinearity these variables were reduced further after examining the correlation coefficient r multicollinearity exists when there is correlation amongst the predictor variables resulting in possible exclusion of relevant variables and inclusion of irrelevant variables resulting in inaccurate model parameterization graham 2003 a value of r 0 80 pearson s correlation coefficient was chosen as a threshold value to determine the exclusion of highly correlated variables after the exclusion the predictor variables were reduced to six mean annual temperature mat annual range in temperature tar mean annual precipitation map precipitation seasonality ps precipitation of the driest quarter pdq and the annual heat moisture index ahmi 2 5 2 model evaluation model performance was tested using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve auc for threshold independent evaluation the auc constitutes a measure of overall model performance continuous discrimination between suitable and unsuitable habitat irrespective of threshold bobrowski et al 2017 auc has been shown to be independent of prevalence mcpherson et al 2004 and is considered a highly effective measure for performance of ordinal score models allouche et al 2006 the auc is determined through summing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and taking the value between 0 5 and 1 0 yilmaz et al 2017 and values of 0 9 are considered high 0 7 0 9 moderate 0 5 0 7 poor and 0 5 no predictive power franklin 2009 phillips et al 2006 2 5 3 spatial predictions the climate surfaces for the six climate variables provided by stewart et al 2017 and the generated ahmi variables were aggregated into a raster stack the resultant brt models were then applied to this raster stack to model the spatial distribution with climate change a new raster stack was created incorporating modelled changes in climate from the rcp 8 5 scenario for 2080s time periods using a direct adjustment approach see mok et al 2012 the occurrence probability maps of current and potential future projections were illustrated as classified maps of presence and absence by applying the best model fit threshold value for each species distribution all the maps showing modelled current and potential future distribution were created using arcmap 10 2 arcgis 2013 2 5 4 distribution overlap metric the overlap between the modelled current and future distributions of a species was computed using the similarity metric i with the statistic for niche overlap ranging from 0 niche models have no overlap to 1 niche models identical warren et al 2008 2 5 5 species range margin shifts the species range margin shift was calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations of the modelled current and future distributions 3 results 3 1 model performance the model performance for all the species was moderate to high with auc values ranging from 0 8 to 0 97 table 1 and high classification accuracy ranging from 80 to 93 indicating high predictive power for all models table 1 3 2 relative influence of climatic variables on tree species different climate variables influenced the distribution of the studied species fig 2 the distribution of a densa was influenced the most by mat and map for t dumosa its distribution was influenced the most by mat and pdq the distribution of p wallichiana was influenced strongly by three variables with precipitation seasonality being the most influential followed by pdq and tar the strong influence of ps and tar indicated that the variability in temperature and precipitation play an important role in shaping this species distribution for p roxburghii the ahmi variable a measure of aridity was the most dominant at 80 of the influence this highlights that aridity is a key variable discriminating its distribution precipitation of the driest quarter had the most influence on acer spp b utilis and rhododendron spp followed by mat for betula spp mat and pdq were the most influential for r arboreum map followed by mat and ahmi had the biggest influences on this species distribution fig 2 for quercus spp ahmi followed by mat were the most influential 3 3 relative influence of climatic variables on o sinensis the variables that exerted the strongest influence on distribution of o sinensis were tar mat and pdq fig 3 a this is supported by the presence and absence data for this species in bhutan o sinensis occurs where the mean annual temperature between 5 to 5 c precipitation of driest quarter between 60 100 mm and have a temperature annual range between 22 and 28 c see fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 4 future distributions and range overlap the modelled current and future distribution area for both bhutan and the nikachu watershed are summarised in table 2 the spatial maps for the tree species are provided in figure s1 in the supplemental material at the national level the current distribution of a densa was modelled to decline by 98 while in nikachu the modelled contraction was 48 the overlap between current and future distributions was 2 across bhutan and 52 in nikachu table 2 fig s1a the species range was predicted to expand to higher elevations and occupy an area 67 the size of its current distribution table 2 this suggests that even though there is potential for an expansion in the distribution of a densa the low range overlap suggests that existing areas occupied by this species are at extreme risk of climate change see nitschke and innes 2008 which could impact the ability of local communities to access the resource in the future the current distribution of t dumosa was modelled to decrease by 99 across bhutan and 100 within the nikachu watershed table 2 range overlaps between future and current distribution was 1 across bhutan and 0 in the nikachu watershed fig s1b tsuga dumosa s climatically suitable area may shift by over 700 m table 2 these results suggest that t dumosa is extremely vulnerable to climate change across bhutan the current distribution of p wallichiana was modelled to decrease at the national level and within the nikachu watershed by 78 and 100 respectively table 2 fig s1c the species upper range margin was modelled to shift by 460 m the species is vulnerable at both levels with low niche overlaps at 22 at national level and 0 3 in the nikachu watershed with a range overlap of 22 the species exhibits a high vulnerability to climate change in contrast p roxburghii exhibited little vulnerability to climate change with no contraction in range modelled the species was predicted increase in its range by 17 across bhutan and by 130 in nikachu watershed table 2 fig s1d the potential loss of p wallichiana in the nikachu watershed may be compensated over time by p roxburghii the hardwood fuel wood species acer spp betula spp rhododendron arboreum quercus spp and rhododendron spp all exhibited less vulnerability to climate change with 50 of their current range overlapping with the future distribution across bhutan and within the nikachu watershed table 2 the species were modelled to incur losses in their current ranges but large increases in their future ranges with movements to higher and lower elevations see table 2 figure s1 the exception to the fuelwood species response was betula utilis this species was modelled to lose climatic suitability across 93 of its current range in bhutan and 100 of its range in nikachu table 2 the major shift in its range makes this species at extreme risk to climate change while other species range from low to high risk see nitschke and innes 2008 the varied responses of these species illustrate that the response of tree communities in bhutan will likely be species specific with regional differences in vulnerability the current distribution of o sinensis was modelled to decrease by 79 across bhutan with only 21 range overlap between current and future distributions table 2 fig 3b a 24 increase in its range was predicted to occur at higher elevations in an unconstrained model however when the model was constrained by snow glacial cover than the predicted expansion was reduced to 11 the overlap between the future distribution of o sinensis and current snow glacial cover was modelled to be 51 suggesting that a majority of the future distribution of o sinensis would fall within areas currently occupied by snow and glaciers fig 3c the species upper range margin was predicted to shift from 250 m to 1000 m the large potential shift in the upper range margin is dependant on current and future occurrence of snow glaciers and the resultant edaphic conditions required to support o sinensis these factors along with the modelled contraction of o sinensis indicate an extreme vulnerability exists for this species 4 discussion our study presents the first analysis of the potential distribution of major timber fuel wood and o sinensis under changing climatic projections in the bhutan himalayan region the study identified that a variety of climate variables influence the distribution of these important tree species and major forest products and that changes in climate will likely lead to changes in their distributions potential suitable areas for most tree species and o sinensis are likely to decrease within their current ranges however most fuelwood species exhibited lower vulnerability than timber species and o sinensis these potential shifts in distribution will be discussed further in terms of their implications for rural livelihoods and loss of ecosystem services and functions 4 1 implications of potential range shifts of ophiocordyceps sinensis for rural livelihoods the distribution of the fungus is believed to be affected by summer and winter temperatures and precipitation seasonality cannon et al 2009 in our study the distribution of o sinensis was influenced the most by temperature annual range precipitation of driest quarter and annual mean temperature similar influences of temperature and precipitation have also been identified for distribution of o sinensis in other parts of the himalayas such as in the nepal himalaya where it is reported that the distribution of o sinensis was controlled by temperature with suitable mean annual temperature below 15 c and mean temperature of coldest quarter range from 10 to 0 c and precipitation of driest month and precipitation seasonality from 75 to 150 mm shrestha and bawa 2014 we found that precipitation in the driest quarter of 60 100 mm was consistent with shrestha and bawa 2014 as was the temperature range between 5 and 5 c temperature and humidity are also believed to play significant roles in determining o sinensis yields winkler 2009 abundance weckerle et al 2010 and infection and sporulation probability zhang et al 2010 the distribution of the fungus that infects o sinensis is also affected by summer and winter temperatures and precipitation seasonality cannon et al 2009 shrestha and bawa 2014 in our study an upward potential shift in distribution of o sinensis under a high climate change scenario was modelled with areas suitable for o sinensis predicted to decrease by 79 at the national level our finding is consistent with the results of a study for the tibetan plateau that modelled 36 and 39 decrease respectively for years 2050 and 2070 under rcp 8 5 yan et al 2017 however it is in contrast to a study in the nepal himalaya which modelled a potential expansion of 0 1 to 4 9 under all future climate change scenarios shrestha and bawa 2014 this difference could be due to the species records and the modelling method our study used the brt model an ensemble model using both presence and absence data of o sinensis yan et al 2017 also used an ensemble species distribution model calibrated with extensive field records shrestha and bawa 2014 however used a model based on presence only data and which represented only 2 8 of the total distribution area of the species the model approach is likely to be the cause of the divergent response presence absence models are better than presence only data models while brt models are more advantageous over other tree based models because of their ability to handle different types of predictor variables accommodate missing data and have no need for data transformation or removing outliers elith et al 2008 the predicted future distribution of o sinensis overlaps with areas currently covered permanently in snow and glaciers the ability of o sinensis to colonise these areas may be limited and delayed due to the soil forming processes that can take 70 100 years to support alpine meadow communities bernasconi et al 2011 these processes will create a post glacial migration lag that will limit the range expansion of plant species into post glacial environments svenning et al 2008 dullinger et al 2012 zimmer et al 2016 the slow vegetation recovery on deglaciated sites can lead to a climatic debt which can hamper the adaptation of alpine plants to climate change zimmer et al 2016 in bhutan glaciers are shrinking karma et al 2003 we modelled a decline in snow glacial cover as well at the national level which suggests a widespread retreat in snow glacial systems across the country over the next 60 100 years many himalayan glaciers are predicted to retreat or disappear due to climate change erikkson et al 2009 with retreating glacial water the alpine ecosystem could be further disrupted leading to change in species composition and functioning of alpine meadows and could lead to habitat alteration and loss of economically significant and ecologically sensitive species in the alpine meadows such as o sinensis picorrhiza spp fritillaria spp and rhodiola spp in bhutan moaf 2011 this study suggests that o sinensis in bhutan is extremely vulnerable to future climate change this will put additional pressure on the resource which is already facing sustainability issues from overharvesting gaire et al 2015 shrestha and bawa 2013 winkler 2008 habitat destruction and overexploitation negi et al 2015 shrivastava 2010 and overgrazing hu et al 2005 yan et al 2017 both climate change and over exploitation are the main causes for the o sinensis production crash in china stone 2008 future distribution models should consider other factors such as harvesting intensities biotic interactions land use changes and vegetation dynamics for better prediction of o sinensis in the himalayan region the modelled contraction within its range and constrained potential shift to higher elevations could potentially impact the livelihoods of those communities living in the nikachu watershed who are dependant on this resource for their cash income see choden et al 2020 the impact will be due to loss of a harvestable resource within areas that become climatically unsuitable but also through restricted access as the distribution contracts to higher altitudes it will become even harder for the collectors to access collection sites the potential change in distribution of o sinensis would cause concern amongst communities in bhutan who have been given access to this resource and have become heavily dependant on it for their livelihoods for example the higher altitude communities in sephu block in the study area in nikachu watershed choden et al 2020 with declining distribution of o sinensis the communities living in sephu block could become highly vulnerable under changing climatic conditions since it is their main source of cash income choden et al 2020 increased monitoring timely management interventions and adaptation measures will be important to sustain the livelihoods of communities in the higher altitudes of bhutan combined with other potential impacts measures for adaptation to climate change deserve immediate attention from policy makers manish et al 2016 4 2 potential range shifts of timber species our study results are supported by other studies in bhutan and from other parts of the himalayan region which have found that timber species such abies densa tsuga dumosa and pinus wallichiana are sensitive to climate the influence of climate on these important timber species has not only been observed in bhutan but also in other parts of the himalayan region in nepal at the alpine tree line the establishment of abies spectabilis is influenced by summer and winter climatic events gaire et al 2014 temperature has contributed significantly in predicting distribution and density of abies pindrow in swat district of pakistan ali et al 2014 a direct relationship between winter and spring temperatures with the radial growth of himalayan pine pinus wallichiana was observed illustrating the climatic sensitivity of the species and potential factors for upward shift in the tree line yadava et al 2017 our study indicated an upward shift in the distribution of these conifer species which is consistent with other studies in the region ali et al 2014 shifts in the distribution of some tree species have already been observed in the himalayas suwal et al 2016 found that the upper range margin and tree line of abies spectabilis has shifted at a rate of 20 m and 12 m per decade respectively a dendro ecological study in eastern nepal himalaya detected an upward shift of abies spectabilis by about 0 93 m year during the past 200 years gaire et al 2017 while in central nepal an upward shift of abies spectabilis at the rate of 2 61 m per year since 1850 has been observed gaire et al 2014 similarly expansion of abies spectabilis above the historical tree line at two locations in the trans himalayan zone of nepal himalaya has been observed tiwari et al 2017 himalayan pine pinus wallichiana was also observed to have shifted upwards towards higher elevations at rates ranging from 11 to 54 m per decade yadava et al 2017 these observations of tree expansion with recent climate change are consistent with our predictions that species distributions will be sensitive to changes in climate in the future 4 3 potential range shift of fuel wood species the modelled potential future distribution area of fuel wood species showed variation at genus and species level betula utilis rhododendron spp and acer spp were modelled to shift to lower altitudes downhill shifts of plants are often considered anomalous and counter to what is normally expected from global warming but this is explained by species niche tracking of regional change in climatic water balance rather than temperature crimmins et al 2011 this supports our result since it was found that distributions of these species were influenced the most by precipitation in the driest quarter precipitation related variables along with high humidity levels and sufficient soil moisture have greatly influenced the climatic space of betula utilis in the himalayan region bobrowski et al 2017 this shift to lower altitudes could also be because of decreasing seasonal temperature variations in eastern himalaya which are likely to constrain the capabilities of betula utilis to reach the upper elevational limit of its potential distribution range bobrowski et al 2017 with lower probability of survival at the upper distribution boundary so downslope distribution could occur as a response to climate change liang et al 2014 furthermore it was observed that although there was an upward migration of betula utilis up to the mid 20th century in central nepal its upper distribution pattern was observed to be stagnant over recent years gaire et al 2014 at the national level the current distribution of rhododendron spp was modelled to contract by 44 similar observations were reported from a study in sikkim himalaya where considerable shrinkage of the suitable bioclimatic envelope of rhododendron spp in 2080 was modelled kumar 2012 however within the nikachu watershed the modelled contraction of rhododendron spp was only 9 this shows how species response can vary across its distribution and suggest that within the nikachu watershed rhododendron spp is not as vulnerable as in other parts of the country communities living in other parts of the country dependant on rhododendron spp could potentially be affected due to the decrease in climatically suitable area while rhododendron spp were predicted to increase their range under climate change their predicted expansion was dwarfed by the predicted increase in the range of rhododendron arboreum annual precipitation exerted the highest influence followed by annual mean temperature precipitation seasonality and aridity on the distribution of rhododendron arboreum precipitation variables along with temperature strongly influenced the bioclimatic space for rhododendron arboreum in south and southeast asia ranjitkar et al 2014 tree rhododendrons particularly rhododendron arboreum are considered to have high phenotypic plasticity allowing them to survive outside their current climatic range it has been suggested that if left undisturbed they could cope with rapid climate change ranjitkar et al 2014 which is consistent with the low sensitivity demonstrated by rhododendron arboreum in our study the future climatically suitable area for quercus spp was modelled to increase in area at both the national level and within the nikachu watershed low predicted contractions of the current range and higher range overlaps suggest that quercus spp are at lower risk to climate change that other species in the study region conversely a study in kumaun himalaya region in india modelled a 76 decline in the distribution pattern of quercus semecarpifolia with a 2 c rise in temperature saran et al 2010 a modelling study in the central himalayan region in india also reported a decline in suitable area for quercus semecarpifolia chakraborty et al 2016 in our study due to data limitations we were unable to explore species specific impacts for quercus genera but based on our findings of variation in climate suitability and distribution patterns for betula and rhododendron genera with their corresponding species suggest that there will likely be variations in quercus genera and species as well 4 4 modelled potential range shift of timber and fuel wood species and impacts on community livelihoods the modelled shifts in distribution areas of important tree species like abies densa suggest that communities living in nikachu watershed could potentially lose access to their preferred timber species in future and might need to resort to alternative species communities in the nikachu watershed prefer abies densa over other timber species because of its strength and durability and due to its resistance to insect attacks choden 2018 according to the climate impact survey on biodiversity at the national level in bhutan communities reported observing a shift in p wallichiana forests to higher elevations and encroachment into picea spp acer spp and betula spp forests moaf 2011 in the nikachu watershed communities reported observing shifts in p wallichiana forest and their replacement of fir forests choden 2018 this may have implications for timber supply capacity for house construction and other purposes in addition to climatic stress additional pressure from disturbances such as grazing fire girdling and harvesting practices could further exacerbate the loss of abies densa these disturbances have already been observed as major factors affecting these timber species by forest managers choden 2018 our study indicated a possible 130 increase in future potential distribution of the sub tropical species p roxburghii an upward shift in the maximum altitude of this species was modelled suggesting it could be used as a possible replacement of higher altitude tree species within the lower altitudes of the nikachu watershed in the dry valley slopes of bhutan p roxburghii grows persistently under low soil moisture content which was unsuitable for other species wangda and ohsawa 2006 in other parts of the himalaya for example in the kanchenjunga landscape areas suitable for p roxburghii have been modelled to increase under a high climate change scenario rcp 8 5 in the 2070s similar range shifts of other sub tropical species to higher altitudes such as castanopsis hystrix schima wallichi eurya acuminata ficus roxburghii and alnus nepalensis have also been reported chaudhary et al 2011 under climate change sub tropical species could potentially replace temperate species in the region which could result in significant changes in biodiversity and its concomitant functions and services in the watershed lower altitude communities might need to change their timber and fuel wood species usage from t dumosa and p wallichiana to sub tropical species furthermore the lower altitude communities in the nikachu watershed already collect pine needles from p wallichiana forest but with potential replacement by sub tropical pine p roxburghii they could collect sub tropical pine needles for animal bedding and farm yard manure compost changes in tree distribution patterns could result in alterations to ecosystem functions and services affecting communities availing themselves of those services in the watershed our results indicate the potential for replacement of higher altitude conifers with deciduous species which could lead to changes in evapotranspiration rates and increased stream water discharge a study in south eastern australia found that a change in provisioning services such as timber and water supply could occur if a transition from ash forest eucalyptus regnans to acacia acacia dealbata a melanoxylon woodland occurred colloff et al 2016 a study in north carolina in the usa indicated that when eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis was replaced by deciduous trees such as acer spp and betula spp a change in hydrological flux occurred leading to increases in stream water discharge during winter and declines during the growing season brantley et al 2013 a change in water flow patterns could also affect the hydropower generation capability at a watershed level particularly for nikachu watershed since water from nikachu watershed is utilised to run the 118 mw tansibji hydropower project in the west central region of bhutan and there are also micro hydro power plants 70 kw at chendebji 0 03 mw at tanbsibji in the watershed benefitting 84 households additionally water flowing out of the watershed is also utilised by the 720 mw mangdechhu hydropower project range shifts of tree species could also affect associated flora that are important for community livelihoods especially those non timber forest products which occupy shaded niches below the forest canopy for example changes in distribution and density of tree species such as abies pindrow in the swat valley in pakistan can result in considerable impact associated medicinal aromatic plants which in turn could impact the health and economy of the rural communities ali et al 2014 in bhutan about 245 species of non timber forest products have been documented uprety et al 2016 including lucrative mushrooms such as matsutake tricholoma matsutake which grows under the canopy of pinus wallichiana picea spinulosa and quercus griffithi namgay 2005 with range shifts of these tree species the habitat of these ntfps could be affected and hence the rural livelihoods dependant on them 5 conclusion this study of major timber and fuelwood species and the important non timber product ophiocordyceps sinensis in bhutan indicates that their distribution patterns are strongly influenced by different climatic factors and that the distribution of these forest resources will respond variably to potential future changes in climate these potential changes in distribution patterns could impact on the functions and the ecosystem services provided by forest ecosystems and on the socio economic conditions of rural communities especially those communities whose livelihoods are dependant upon these forest resources these plausible changes in tree species distribution patterns under a high level of greenhouse gas emissions represents the upper limit of potential impacts on community livelihoods lower rates of global greenhouse gas emissions and adoption of adaptation measures and management interventions based on analyses of future community needs can reduce these potential impacts there is a need to discuss such future trajectories amongst relevant stakeholders and develop a shared understanding and set common goals

24595,rural communities in the himalayan kingdom of bhutan are dependant on natural capital for their livelihoods climate change impacts on ecosystem could have serious consequences for these communities but little research has been done to explore these potential impacts in this study we used boosted regression tree brt models to model current and potential future distribution of major timber species abies densa pinus wallichiana tsuga dumosa fuelwood species quercus spp betula spp betula utilis rhododendron spp rhododendron arboreum and an important non timber resource ophiocordyceps sinensis in bhutan himalayan region models were based on species presence and absence data from 575 plots and a new high resolution climate dataset developed for bhutan future projections were based on ipcc s representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the 2080s in bhutan mean annual temperature and precipitation of driest quarters were found to be the most influential variables in modelling the current distribution of these species with the distribution of most of the species projected to decrease significantly and shift to higher elevations the current distribution of ophiocordyceps sinensis was modelled to decrease by 79 at the national level with only 21 range overlap between current and future distributions current distribution of timber species like abies densa and tsuga dumosa were modelled to decline by 98 and 99 respectively at national level with very low range overlaps between current and future distribution suggesting high species vulnerability to climate change in contrast fuel wood species like betula spp quercus spp rhododendron arboreum all exhibited less vulnerability to climate change with over 50 of their current range overlapping with future distribution across bhutan and in the nikachu watershed these potential changes in distribution patterns of these species could impact on the functions and ecosystem services provided by these species and socio economic conditions of rural communities reliant on these species for their livelihoods in bhutan lower rates of global greenhouse gas emissions and adoption of adaptation measures and management interventions can reduce these potential impacts 1 introduction communities in mountainous regions are predominantly rural and many depend on forest resources and ecosystem services for their livelihoods gratzer and keeton 2017 choden et al 2020 in developing countries 28 of the total income is from environmental income out of which 77 comes from natural forests angelsen et al 2014 climate can have an influential role on the ecosystem services provided by mountain forests which in turn can put pressure on communities dependant on them for their livelihoods bernier and schoene 2009 gratzer and keeton 2017 the impacts of climate change are therefore expected to have serious consequences for forest dependant communities chaturvedi et al 2011 despite the high dependence on forest resources in mountainous regions the direct impacts of climate change on important forest resources in many regions such as the himalayas has not been extensively studied dutta et al 2014 schickhoff et al 2015 telwala et al 2013 chakraborty et al 2016 this is concerning given that the himalayan region is a global biodiversity hotspot telwala et al 2013 and is reported to be experiencing a three times higher rate of warming than the global average shrestha et al 2012 climate change is anticipated to alter the distribution of forest types and tree species across all the world s biomes with future change likely to occur at rates and magnitudes that are beyond the adaptive capacity of many species and ecosystems seppala et al 2009 a changing climate is expected to cause local extirpation extinction of species a shift of species ranges and niches aitken et al 2008 chen et al 2011 hickling et al 2006 rosenzweig et al 2007 telwala et al 2013 wilson et al 2005 changes in the timing of phenological events rawal et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2009 and changes in species assemblages parmesan and yohe 2003 changes in the composition and structure of ecosystems could lead to loss of key ecological functions and services seppala et al 2009 mountain ecosystems in general are particularly sensitive to distributional change and range shifts because of sharp temperature and precipitation gradients over short distances gratzer and keeton 2017 the predicted influence of climate change in the himalayan region includes changes in phenology and changes in the geographic ranges of species through shifts in the tree line and or contraction in the spatial distribution of plant communities pandit et al 2014 for example the upward displacement of endemic plant species in sikkim himalaya has already been observed with an increase in range of 27 m in altitude per decade between 1849 and 2010 telwala et al 2013 in addition to species range shifts changes in species composition and community structure have also been observed for instance in the tibetan plateau 39 of alpine meadows were converted to shrub lands between 1990 and 2009 brandt et al 2013 the observed impacts of observed climate change are congruent with the predicted impacts of future climate change in the central himalayas for example chakraborty et al 2016 predicted that the ranges for ecological and economically dominant forest tree species such as quercus spp and pinus roxburghii are likely to decrease at lower elevation but increase at higher elevations a study from the eastern himalayas suggests that by the 2050s 2070s 16 18 of endemic angiosperm species are likely to lose their potential habitat manish et al 2016 in addition at the community level 1 to 3 of the current area of meadows could potentially be lost to encroachment by shrubs by the 2050s 2070s manish et al 2016 under a changing climate a high degree of fluidity in vegetation structure and composition should be expected highlighting the importance of evaluating the potential impact of climate change on vegetation in the himalayan region manish et al 2016 species distribution modelling sdm approaches are commonly used for assessing the impact of climate change on species and ecosystems elith and leathwick 2009 sdms assume an equilibrium state exists between climate and vegetation this static climate vegetation approach assumes that the future climate and vegetation relationship will remain the same as in the past this assumption is uncertain and limits the inferences that can be drawn from equilibrium models nitschke and innes 2008 mechanistic models on the other hand are more robust since they identify major climatic and environmental constraints and include more representation of ecological processes that improves understanding the impacts of climate change on species distribution mok et al 2012 despite their potential limitations keenan 2015 mok et al 2012 nitschke et al 2012 sdms are typically the only tools available for assessing potential impacts of climate change on plant species and identifying important geographic areas for conservation aitken et al 2008 sdms can provide useful information for decision makers to develop future management plans jaeschke et al 2014 as long as it is well understood that transient responses of vegetation to climate change constraints on plant recruitment and growth and formation of novel communities may not be represented ravindranath et al 2006 ravindranath and sukumar 1996 1998 bhutan is located within the south asian monsoon region and is characterised by a huge gradient in elevation complex topographic features and diverse land cover dorji et al 2016 and an associated high diversity in climate stewart et al 2017 despite its small geographical area climate is expected to change significantly depending on future trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation projected to increase by 3 5 c and between 80 and 180 mm by the 2050s respectively tse ring et al 2010 bhutan has 71 of its land under forest cover rgob 2016 while 69 of the population is rural based and dependant on natural resources for their livelihoods despite bhutan s perceived sensitivity dorji et al 2016 hoy et al 2016 to the impacts of climate change there is limited information on how climatic conditions and geographical constraints define the current vegetation cover and there has been virtually no investigation of the potential impacts of climate change on forests and people s livelihoods such information is necessary to explore the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems and human livelihoods in bhutan and consider adaptation options dorji et al 2016 initial studies on the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation in bhutan was based on the modelling of holdridge forest classification types nec 2011 a general northward and upward altitudinal movement of major forest biomes was modelled for the 2020s and 2050s with the subtropical biome entering the southern margins of the temperate forest biome and the alpine biome declining nec 2011 there are significant limitations with the holdridge forest classification system peng 2000 a major limitation with using broad zonal vegetation models such as the holdridge forest classification system is that they consider all species to be influenced homogenously by climate and that species composition within the biomes will remain constant under changing climatic conditions and migrate as one unit davis et al 1998 lugo et al 1999 peng 2000 terrestrial ecosystems are however composed of many species which respond individually to changing environmental conditions rather than moving in concert this is likely to result in novel ecosystems with new compositions and different functions davis 1986 this study attempts to address these limitations by using high resolution climate surfaces stewart et al 2017 combined with boosted regression tree statistical models based on forest inventory databases that contain records of tree species presence and absence across bhutan these are used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on important tree species and ophiocordyceps sinensis o sinensis in bhutan the suite of studied species represents important natural resources for supporting rural livelihoods in bhutan choden et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to assess potential shifts in the distributions of important tree species and o sinensis under changing climatic conditions in bhutan plausible scenarios of the impact of climate change on forests and natural resources can support a decision centred approach to adapt to climate change keenan 2015 assessing the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems is therefore critical for developing better conservation and management strategies that can be adopted for both biodiversity conservation and enhancement of community livelihoods joshi et al 2012 the objectives of the study were to i identify climatic variables determining the distribution of important tree species and an important non wood product ii to model the potential future distribution of these species under a future climate change scenario and iii assess the niche overlap between current and potential future distribution of species 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the country level and within the nikachu watershed where information on natural resources and livelihoods were identified by choden 2018 and choden et al 2020 the kingdom of bhutan has an area of 38 394 km2s ranging 300 km east west and 170 km north south nsb 2013 and has one of the most variable mountain terrains in the world elevations range from 150 m to 7500 m above sea level nec 2016 bhutan has 71 of its land under forest cover rgob 2016 69 of the population is rural based and dependant on natural resources for their livelihoods despite bhutan s perceived sensitivity dorji et al 2016 hoy et al 2016 to the impacts of climate change analysis of the relationships between climate geography and vegetation cover is limited the country can be divided into three broad physiographic zones the southern belt consists of the himalayan foothills with altitude ranging from 150 m to 2000 m with sub tropical forest at 150 2000 m a s l covering broadleaf forest chir pine pinus roxburghii forest and tropical low land forest the central belt with the main river valleys and steep mountains ranging from 2000 to 4000 m in altitude supporting temperate forests of fir abies densa forest blue pine pinus wallichiana forest mixed conifer and broadleaf conifer mixed forests and the northern belt encompassing high mountains and alpine meadows above 4000 m nec 2016 nsb 2017 a finer scale study was conducted in the nikachu watershed 45 126 ha in west central region of bhutan fig 1 the watershed has two administrative units blocks sephu and tansibji blocks occur within districts and are the smallest administrative units in bhutan and comprise several villages forest resources play a vital role in the lives of communities living in the watershed although the degree of dependence on these resources varies between the two blocks choden et al 2020 communities in sephu block which represents the higher altitude areas of the watershed are dependant for significant income on sale of o sinensis an insect fungus which fetches high prices in the international market for its medicinal value communities in tansibji located at lower elevations are dependant on forest products for subsistence needs and are more commonly engaged in off farm activities to earn cash income vegetation in the watershed transitions with increasing elevation from cool broadleaved forest to blue pine forest to mixed conifer forest to fir forest to alpine meadows broad leaved forests dominate in the tangsibji block whereas conifer forests and alpine meadows typify sephu block the high altitude rangelands are important head water sources of the nikachhu river 2 2 species presence and absence data the species investigated in this study were abies densa pinus wallichiana and tsuga dumosa important timber species quercus spp betula spp betula utilis rhododendron spp acer spp pinus roxburghii and rhododendron arboreum important fuel wood species and a non wood forest product ophiocordyceps sinensis these species were selected based on a household survey conducted in nikachu watershed in which the communities identified and prioritized the timber and fuel wood species most important for subsistence use and non wood forest product for their cash income choden 2018 georeferenced species presence and absence data used for this study were gathered from several different sources representing different forest types and regions of the country a total of 575 plots spread across the country were used 224 plots were from the national forest inventory nfi dofps 2017 representing wangdiphodrang and trongsa districts the data was collected from a nfi cluster plot laid on a 4 4 km grid the remaining 351 plots of 20 20 m were collated from zhemgang forest division watershed management division wmd wangchuck centennial park wcp jigme dorji wangchuk national park jdnp managed by the department of forest and park services bhutan additional plots were provided from previous studies choden and ohsawa 2011 moktan et al 2016 these plots were located across bhutan representing paro haa wangdiphodrang chukha zhemgang samtse trongsa and gasa districts the plot data from different studies was amalgamated into one large dataset containing records of species presence and absence for the study region 2 3 snow and scrub forests we also modelled the current and future distributions of snow glacier cover and scrub forest as demarcated in the bhutan land use classification system these were modelled as they represent the lower and upper elevation neighbouring communities to the alpine meadows in which o sinensis occurs to model these we randomly selected 2000 presence and absence points that were a minimum of 5 km apart across the distribution of these land cover types we used the same modelling approaches for these land cover types as used for species 2 4 climate data to model the potential distribution of selected species we used high resolution 225 m climate surface layers for bhutan developed by stewart et al 2017 the spatial climate data set was comprised of monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and vapour pressure climate normal interpolated for the 1986 2015 reference period using trivariate smoothing splines stewart et al 2017 to determine potential future distribution of tree species under climate change we used datasets of future climate change from the climate change knowledge portal website created by the world bank http sdwebx worldbank org climateportal the portal provides an online tool for accessing comprehensive global regional and country level data related to climate change and development we selected one future climate projection for bhutan based on representative carbon pathway rcp 8 5 for the 2080 2099 time period as adopted in the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 ipcc 2013 rcp 8 5 represents the highest potential rate of climate change associated with business as usual greenhouse gas emissions and was chosen to represent the upper limit of potential species responses 2 5 species distribution modelling we used boosted regression trees brt to model the current and future distributions of the chosen species brt models are a machine learning approach commonly used to develop species distribution models elith et al 2008 friedman et al 2000 brt combines the strength of regression trees with boosting which is an aggregation of many simple models into one ensemble for better predictive performance the brt model was developed in r version 3 2 3 r core development team 2015 using the r packages dismo hijmans et al 2015 gbm ridgeway 2006 and raster hijman 2015 for fitting models assessing relative influence making projections and mapping potential distributions we split the occurrence and absence data for each species randomly into a training 75 and a testing 25 set then for each species a brt model using gbm step was built with a training data set using a bernoulli distribution and tree complexity learning rate and bag fraction set to 5 0 005 and 0 5 respectively for predicting sites from the brt model we used a testing data set with a fixed number of trees n 5000 2 5 1 predictor variables nineteen bioclimatic variables were chosen from stewart et al 2017 and an additional variable the annual heat moisture index ahmi which represents atmospheric aridity was calculated following paudel et al 2016 all variables considered are summarised in table s1 in the supplement to account for multicollinearity these variables were reduced further after examining the correlation coefficient r multicollinearity exists when there is correlation amongst the predictor variables resulting in possible exclusion of relevant variables and inclusion of irrelevant variables resulting in inaccurate model parameterization graham 2003 a value of r 0 80 pearson s correlation coefficient was chosen as a threshold value to determine the exclusion of highly correlated variables after the exclusion the predictor variables were reduced to six mean annual temperature mat annual range in temperature tar mean annual precipitation map precipitation seasonality ps precipitation of the driest quarter pdq and the annual heat moisture index ahmi 2 5 2 model evaluation model performance was tested using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve auc for threshold independent evaluation the auc constitutes a measure of overall model performance continuous discrimination between suitable and unsuitable habitat irrespective of threshold bobrowski et al 2017 auc has been shown to be independent of prevalence mcpherson et al 2004 and is considered a highly effective measure for performance of ordinal score models allouche et al 2006 the auc is determined through summing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and taking the value between 0 5 and 1 0 yilmaz et al 2017 and values of 0 9 are considered high 0 7 0 9 moderate 0 5 0 7 poor and 0 5 no predictive power franklin 2009 phillips et al 2006 2 5 3 spatial predictions the climate surfaces for the six climate variables provided by stewart et al 2017 and the generated ahmi variables were aggregated into a raster stack the resultant brt models were then applied to this raster stack to model the spatial distribution with climate change a new raster stack was created incorporating modelled changes in climate from the rcp 8 5 scenario for 2080s time periods using a direct adjustment approach see mok et al 2012 the occurrence probability maps of current and potential future projections were illustrated as classified maps of presence and absence by applying the best model fit threshold value for each species distribution all the maps showing modelled current and potential future distribution were created using arcmap 10 2 arcgis 2013 2 5 4 distribution overlap metric the overlap between the modelled current and future distributions of a species was computed using the similarity metric i with the statistic for niche overlap ranging from 0 niche models have no overlap to 1 niche models identical warren et al 2008 2 5 5 species range margin shifts the species range margin shift was calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations of the modelled current and future distributions 3 results 3 1 model performance the model performance for all the species was moderate to high with auc values ranging from 0 8 to 0 97 table 1 and high classification accuracy ranging from 80 to 93 indicating high predictive power for all models table 1 3 2 relative influence of climatic variables on tree species different climate variables influenced the distribution of the studied species fig 2 the distribution of a densa was influenced the most by mat and map for t dumosa its distribution was influenced the most by mat and pdq the distribution of p wallichiana was influenced strongly by three variables with precipitation seasonality being the most influential followed by pdq and tar the strong influence of ps and tar indicated that the variability in temperature and precipitation play an important role in shaping this species distribution for p roxburghii the ahmi variable a measure of aridity was the most dominant at 80 of the influence this highlights that aridity is a key variable discriminating its distribution precipitation of the driest quarter had the most influence on acer spp b utilis and rhododendron spp followed by mat for betula spp mat and pdq were the most influential for r arboreum map followed by mat and ahmi had the biggest influences on this species distribution fig 2 for quercus spp ahmi followed by mat were the most influential 3 3 relative influence of climatic variables on o sinensis the variables that exerted the strongest influence on distribution of o sinensis were tar mat and pdq fig 3 a this is supported by the presence and absence data for this species in bhutan o sinensis occurs where the mean annual temperature between 5 to 5 c precipitation of driest quarter between 60 100 mm and have a temperature annual range between 22 and 28 c see fig s2 in the supplementary material 3 4 future distributions and range overlap the modelled current and future distribution area for both bhutan and the nikachu watershed are summarised in table 2 the spatial maps for the tree species are provided in figure s1 in the supplemental material at the national level the current distribution of a densa was modelled to decline by 98 while in nikachu the modelled contraction was 48 the overlap between current and future distributions was 2 across bhutan and 52 in nikachu table 2 fig s1a the species range was predicted to expand to higher elevations and occupy an area 67 the size of its current distribution table 2 this suggests that even though there is potential for an expansion in the distribution of a densa the low range overlap suggests that existing areas occupied by this species are at extreme risk of climate change see nitschke and innes 2008 which could impact the ability of local communities to access the resource in the future the current distribution of t dumosa was modelled to decrease by 99 across bhutan and 100 within the nikachu watershed table 2 range overlaps between future and current distribution was 1 across bhutan and 0 in the nikachu watershed fig s1b tsuga dumosa s climatically suitable area may shift by over 700 m table 2 these results suggest that t dumosa is extremely vulnerable to climate change across bhutan the current distribution of p wallichiana was modelled to decrease at the national level and within the nikachu watershed by 78 and 100 respectively table 2 fig s1c the species upper range margin was modelled to shift by 460 m the species is vulnerable at both levels with low niche overlaps at 22 at national level and 0 3 in the nikachu watershed with a range overlap of 22 the species exhibits a high vulnerability to climate change in contrast p roxburghii exhibited little vulnerability to climate change with no contraction in range modelled the species was predicted increase in its range by 17 across bhutan and by 130 in nikachu watershed table 2 fig s1d the potential loss of p wallichiana in the nikachu watershed may be compensated over time by p roxburghii the hardwood fuel wood species acer spp betula spp rhododendron arboreum quercus spp and rhododendron spp all exhibited less vulnerability to climate change with 50 of their current range overlapping with the future distribution across bhutan and within the nikachu watershed table 2 the species were modelled to incur losses in their current ranges but large increases in their future ranges with movements to higher and lower elevations see table 2 figure s1 the exception to the fuelwood species response was betula utilis this species was modelled to lose climatic suitability across 93 of its current range in bhutan and 100 of its range in nikachu table 2 the major shift in its range makes this species at extreme risk to climate change while other species range from low to high risk see nitschke and innes 2008 the varied responses of these species illustrate that the response of tree communities in bhutan will likely be species specific with regional differences in vulnerability the current distribution of o sinensis was modelled to decrease by 79 across bhutan with only 21 range overlap between current and future distributions table 2 fig 3b a 24 increase in its range was predicted to occur at higher elevations in an unconstrained model however when the model was constrained by snow glacial cover than the predicted expansion was reduced to 11 the overlap between the future distribution of o sinensis and current snow glacial cover was modelled to be 51 suggesting that a majority of the future distribution of o sinensis would fall within areas currently occupied by snow and glaciers fig 3c the species upper range margin was predicted to shift from 250 m to 1000 m the large potential shift in the upper range margin is dependant on current and future occurrence of snow glaciers and the resultant edaphic conditions required to support o sinensis these factors along with the modelled contraction of o sinensis indicate an extreme vulnerability exists for this species 4 discussion our study presents the first analysis of the potential distribution of major timber fuel wood and o sinensis under changing climatic projections in the bhutan himalayan region the study identified that a variety of climate variables influence the distribution of these important tree species and major forest products and that changes in climate will likely lead to changes in their distributions potential suitable areas for most tree species and o sinensis are likely to decrease within their current ranges however most fuelwood species exhibited lower vulnerability than timber species and o sinensis these potential shifts in distribution will be discussed further in terms of their implications for rural livelihoods and loss of ecosystem services and functions 4 1 implications of potential range shifts of ophiocordyceps sinensis for rural livelihoods the distribution of the fungus is believed to be affected by summer and winter temperatures and precipitation seasonality cannon et al 2009 in our study the distribution of o sinensis was influenced the most by temperature annual range precipitation of driest quarter and annual mean temperature similar influences of temperature and precipitation have also been identified for distribution of o sinensis in other parts of the himalayas such as in the nepal himalaya where it is reported that the distribution of o sinensis was controlled by temperature with suitable mean annual temperature below 15 c and mean temperature of coldest quarter range from 10 to 0 c and precipitation of driest month and precipitation seasonality from 75 to 150 mm shrestha and bawa 2014 we found that precipitation in the driest quarter of 60 100 mm was consistent with shrestha and bawa 2014 as was the temperature range between 5 and 5 c temperature and humidity are also believed to play significant roles in determining o sinensis yields winkler 2009 abundance weckerle et al 2010 and infection and sporulation probability zhang et al 2010 the distribution of the fungus that infects o sinensis is also affected by summer and winter temperatures and precipitation seasonality cannon et al 2009 shrestha and bawa 2014 in our study an upward potential shift in distribution of o sinensis under a high climate change scenario was modelled with areas suitable for o sinensis predicted to decrease by 79 at the national level our finding is consistent with the results of a study for the tibetan plateau that modelled 36 and 39 decrease respectively for years 2050 and 2070 under rcp 8 5 yan et al 2017 however it is in contrast to a study in the nepal himalaya which modelled a potential expansion of 0 1 to 4 9 under all future climate change scenarios shrestha and bawa 2014 this difference could be due to the species records and the modelling method our study used the brt model an ensemble model using both presence and absence data of o sinensis yan et al 2017 also used an ensemble species distribution model calibrated with extensive field records shrestha and bawa 2014 however used a model based on presence only data and which represented only 2 8 of the total distribution area of the species the model approach is likely to be the cause of the divergent response presence absence models are better than presence only data models while brt models are more advantageous over other tree based models because of their ability to handle different types of predictor variables accommodate missing data and have no need for data transformation or removing outliers elith et al 2008 the predicted future distribution of o sinensis overlaps with areas currently covered permanently in snow and glaciers the ability of o sinensis to colonise these areas may be limited and delayed due to the soil forming processes that can take 70 100 years to support alpine meadow communities bernasconi et al 2011 these processes will create a post glacial migration lag that will limit the range expansion of plant species into post glacial environments svenning et al 2008 dullinger et al 2012 zimmer et al 2016 the slow vegetation recovery on deglaciated sites can lead to a climatic debt which can hamper the adaptation of alpine plants to climate change zimmer et al 2016 in bhutan glaciers are shrinking karma et al 2003 we modelled a decline in snow glacial cover as well at the national level which suggests a widespread retreat in snow glacial systems across the country over the next 60 100 years many himalayan glaciers are predicted to retreat or disappear due to climate change erikkson et al 2009 with retreating glacial water the alpine ecosystem could be further disrupted leading to change in species composition and functioning of alpine meadows and could lead to habitat alteration and loss of economically significant and ecologically sensitive species in the alpine meadows such as o sinensis picorrhiza spp fritillaria spp and rhodiola spp in bhutan moaf 2011 this study suggests that o sinensis in bhutan is extremely vulnerable to future climate change this will put additional pressure on the resource which is already facing sustainability issues from overharvesting gaire et al 2015 shrestha and bawa 2013 winkler 2008 habitat destruction and overexploitation negi et al 2015 shrivastava 2010 and overgrazing hu et al 2005 yan et al 2017 both climate change and over exploitation are the main causes for the o sinensis production crash in china stone 2008 future distribution models should consider other factors such as harvesting intensities biotic interactions land use changes and vegetation dynamics for better prediction of o sinensis in the himalayan region the modelled contraction within its range and constrained potential shift to higher elevations could potentially impact the livelihoods of those communities living in the nikachu watershed who are dependant on this resource for their cash income see choden et al 2020 the impact will be due to loss of a harvestable resource within areas that become climatically unsuitable but also through restricted access as the distribution contracts to higher altitudes it will become even harder for the collectors to access collection sites the potential change in distribution of o sinensis would cause concern amongst communities in bhutan who have been given access to this resource and have become heavily dependant on it for their livelihoods for example the higher altitude communities in sephu block in the study area in nikachu watershed choden et al 2020 with declining distribution of o sinensis the communities living in sephu block could become highly vulnerable under changing climatic conditions since it is their main source of cash income choden et al 2020 increased monitoring timely management interventions and adaptation measures will be important to sustain the livelihoods of communities in the higher altitudes of bhutan combined with other potential impacts measures for adaptation to climate change deserve immediate attention from policy makers manish et al 2016 4 2 potential range shifts of timber species our study results are supported by other studies in bhutan and from other parts of the himalayan region which have found that timber species such abies densa tsuga dumosa and pinus wallichiana are sensitive to climate the influence of climate on these important timber species has not only been observed in bhutan but also in other parts of the himalayan region in nepal at the alpine tree line the establishment of abies spectabilis is influenced by summer and winter climatic events gaire et al 2014 temperature has contributed significantly in predicting distribution and density of abies pindrow in swat district of pakistan ali et al 2014 a direct relationship between winter and spring temperatures with the radial growth of himalayan pine pinus wallichiana was observed illustrating the climatic sensitivity of the species and potential factors for upward shift in the tree line yadava et al 2017 our study indicated an upward shift in the distribution of these conifer species which is consistent with other studies in the region ali et al 2014 shifts in the distribution of some tree species have already been observed in the himalayas suwal et al 2016 found that the upper range margin and tree line of abies spectabilis has shifted at a rate of 20 m and 12 m per decade respectively a dendro ecological study in eastern nepal himalaya detected an upward shift of abies spectabilis by about 0 93 m year during the past 200 years gaire et al 2017 while in central nepal an upward shift of abies spectabilis at the rate of 2 61 m per year since 1850 has been observed gaire et al 2014 similarly expansion of abies spectabilis above the historical tree line at two locations in the trans himalayan zone of nepal himalaya has been observed tiwari et al 2017 himalayan pine pinus wallichiana was also observed to have shifted upwards towards higher elevations at rates ranging from 11 to 54 m per decade yadava et al 2017 these observations of tree expansion with recent climate change are consistent with our predictions that species distributions will be sensitive to changes in climate in the future 4 3 potential range shift of fuel wood species the modelled potential future distribution area of fuel wood species showed variation at genus and species level betula utilis rhododendron spp and acer spp were modelled to shift to lower altitudes downhill shifts of plants are often considered anomalous and counter to what is normally expected from global warming but this is explained by species niche tracking of regional change in climatic water balance rather than temperature crimmins et al 2011 this supports our result since it was found that distributions of these species were influenced the most by precipitation in the driest quarter precipitation related variables along with high humidity levels and sufficient soil moisture have greatly influenced the climatic space of betula utilis in the himalayan region bobrowski et al 2017 this shift to lower altitudes could also be because of decreasing seasonal temperature variations in eastern himalaya which are likely to constrain the capabilities of betula utilis to reach the upper elevational limit of its potential distribution range bobrowski et al 2017 with lower probability of survival at the upper distribution boundary so downslope distribution could occur as a response to climate change liang et al 2014 furthermore it was observed that although there was an upward migration of betula utilis up to the mid 20th century in central nepal its upper distribution pattern was observed to be stagnant over recent years gaire et al 2014 at the national level the current distribution of rhododendron spp was modelled to contract by 44 similar observations were reported from a study in sikkim himalaya where considerable shrinkage of the suitable bioclimatic envelope of rhododendron spp in 2080 was modelled kumar 2012 however within the nikachu watershed the modelled contraction of rhododendron spp was only 9 this shows how species response can vary across its distribution and suggest that within the nikachu watershed rhododendron spp is not as vulnerable as in other parts of the country communities living in other parts of the country dependant on rhododendron spp could potentially be affected due to the decrease in climatically suitable area while rhododendron spp were predicted to increase their range under climate change their predicted expansion was dwarfed by the predicted increase in the range of rhododendron arboreum annual precipitation exerted the highest influence followed by annual mean temperature precipitation seasonality and aridity on the distribution of rhododendron arboreum precipitation variables along with temperature strongly influenced the bioclimatic space for rhododendron arboreum in south and southeast asia ranjitkar et al 2014 tree rhododendrons particularly rhododendron arboreum are considered to have high phenotypic plasticity allowing them to survive outside their current climatic range it has been suggested that if left undisturbed they could cope with rapid climate change ranjitkar et al 2014 which is consistent with the low sensitivity demonstrated by rhododendron arboreum in our study the future climatically suitable area for quercus spp was modelled to increase in area at both the national level and within the nikachu watershed low predicted contractions of the current range and higher range overlaps suggest that quercus spp are at lower risk to climate change that other species in the study region conversely a study in kumaun himalaya region in india modelled a 76 decline in the distribution pattern of quercus semecarpifolia with a 2 c rise in temperature saran et al 2010 a modelling study in the central himalayan region in india also reported a decline in suitable area for quercus semecarpifolia chakraborty et al 2016 in our study due to data limitations we were unable to explore species specific impacts for quercus genera but based on our findings of variation in climate suitability and distribution patterns for betula and rhododendron genera with their corresponding species suggest that there will likely be variations in quercus genera and species as well 4 4 modelled potential range shift of timber and fuel wood species and impacts on community livelihoods the modelled shifts in distribution areas of important tree species like abies densa suggest that communities living in nikachu watershed could potentially lose access to their preferred timber species in future and might need to resort to alternative species communities in the nikachu watershed prefer abies densa over other timber species because of its strength and durability and due to its resistance to insect attacks choden 2018 according to the climate impact survey on biodiversity at the national level in bhutan communities reported observing a shift in p wallichiana forests to higher elevations and encroachment into picea spp acer spp and betula spp forests moaf 2011 in the nikachu watershed communities reported observing shifts in p wallichiana forest and their replacement of fir forests choden 2018 this may have implications for timber supply capacity for house construction and other purposes in addition to climatic stress additional pressure from disturbances such as grazing fire girdling and harvesting practices could further exacerbate the loss of abies densa these disturbances have already been observed as major factors affecting these timber species by forest managers choden 2018 our study indicated a possible 130 increase in future potential distribution of the sub tropical species p roxburghii an upward shift in the maximum altitude of this species was modelled suggesting it could be used as a possible replacement of higher altitude tree species within the lower altitudes of the nikachu watershed in the dry valley slopes of bhutan p roxburghii grows persistently under low soil moisture content which was unsuitable for other species wangda and ohsawa 2006 in other parts of the himalaya for example in the kanchenjunga landscape areas suitable for p roxburghii have been modelled to increase under a high climate change scenario rcp 8 5 in the 2070s similar range shifts of other sub tropical species to higher altitudes such as castanopsis hystrix schima wallichi eurya acuminata ficus roxburghii and alnus nepalensis have also been reported chaudhary et al 2011 under climate change sub tropical species could potentially replace temperate species in the region which could result in significant changes in biodiversity and its concomitant functions and services in the watershed lower altitude communities might need to change their timber and fuel wood species usage from t dumosa and p wallichiana to sub tropical species furthermore the lower altitude communities in the nikachu watershed already collect pine needles from p wallichiana forest but with potential replacement by sub tropical pine p roxburghii they could collect sub tropical pine needles for animal bedding and farm yard manure compost changes in tree distribution patterns could result in alterations to ecosystem functions and services affecting communities availing themselves of those services in the watershed our results indicate the potential for replacement of higher altitude conifers with deciduous species which could lead to changes in evapotranspiration rates and increased stream water discharge a study in south eastern australia found that a change in provisioning services such as timber and water supply could occur if a transition from ash forest eucalyptus regnans to acacia acacia dealbata a melanoxylon woodland occurred colloff et al 2016 a study in north carolina in the usa indicated that when eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis was replaced by deciduous trees such as acer spp and betula spp a change in hydrological flux occurred leading to increases in stream water discharge during winter and declines during the growing season brantley et al 2013 a change in water flow patterns could also affect the hydropower generation capability at a watershed level particularly for nikachu watershed since water from nikachu watershed is utilised to run the 118 mw tansibji hydropower project in the west central region of bhutan and there are also micro hydro power plants 70 kw at chendebji 0 03 mw at tanbsibji in the watershed benefitting 84 households additionally water flowing out of the watershed is also utilised by the 720 mw mangdechhu hydropower project range shifts of tree species could also affect associated flora that are important for community livelihoods especially those non timber forest products which occupy shaded niches below the forest canopy for example changes in distribution and density of tree species such as abies pindrow in the swat valley in pakistan can result in considerable impact associated medicinal aromatic plants which in turn could impact the health and economy of the rural communities ali et al 2014 in bhutan about 245 species of non timber forest products have been documented uprety et al 2016 including lucrative mushrooms such as matsutake tricholoma matsutake which grows under the canopy of pinus wallichiana picea spinulosa and quercus griffithi namgay 2005 with range shifts of these tree species the habitat of these ntfps could be affected and hence the rural livelihoods dependant on them 5 conclusion this study of major timber and fuelwood species and the important non timber product ophiocordyceps sinensis in bhutan indicates that their distribution patterns are strongly influenced by different climatic factors and that the distribution of these forest resources will respond variably to potential future changes in climate these potential changes in distribution patterns could impact on the functions and the ecosystem services provided by forest ecosystems and on the socio economic conditions of rural communities especially those communities whose livelihoods are dependant upon these forest resources these plausible changes in tree species distribution patterns under a high level of greenhouse gas emissions represents the upper limit of potential impacts on community livelihoods lower rates of global greenhouse gas emissions and adoption of adaptation measures and management interventions based on analyses of future community needs can reduce these potential impacts there is a need to discuss such future trajectories amongst relevant stakeholders and develop a shared understanding and set common goals

24596,increasing demand for artemia sp as a nutritive food for shrimp and fish drives hatcheries to culture the species in fulfilling market requirements the goal is to optimize food concentration for artemia sp by performing laboratory experiments six different amounts viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of chaetoceros sp are used as food to the experiment the variation in food concentrations has a significant impact on the species internal growth mechanism which produces disparity in the species growth trait phenotype these phenotypic growth deviations can be well understood through the species growth trajectories which are governed by the physical laws of newtonian mechanics the optimization of food concentration involves several iterations of conventional experiments which are not time and cost effective biologists have a strong desire to resolve the issue through alternative theoretical approaches the basic concept of geometry and newtonian mechanics are applied to the size profile of artemia sp to determine the level of food concentration at which it gains the maximum maturity size we also provide simulation based theoretical modeling which would help to optimize the food concentration of the artemia sp we conclude that growth acceleration and jerk of newtonian mechanics is the key regulator for this optimization game keywords growth monitoring laws of physics maturity size retardation simulation trade off 1 introduction satisfying the consumers demands for foods cost effectively is a great challenge for the hatchery industries extensive uses of different phytoplankton and zooplankton as live foods for the shrimp and fish hatcheries enlighten the importance of the regular maintenance and monitoring of the plankton s live cultures brown 2002 morris and mischke 1999 artemia sp commonly known as the brine shrimp is one of such prominent zooplankton used widely in hatchery industries and aquacultural researches for the high dietary values of its cysts nauplii and adults bengtson et al 1991 lim et al 2001 wouters et al 2002 gandy et al 2007 wrb 2006 dhont and sorgeloos 2002 sorgeloos 1986 abreu grobois et al 1991 the market demands for artemia are rising equivalently with the increasing popularity of aquaculture sorgeloos et al 1998 consequently the species growth process needs to undergo extensive laboratory iterations and optimizations to get the maximum yields however the iterations process imparts huge costs to the entire culture protocol and the hatchery people need to fulfill the market demands cost effectively since hatchery industries always search for new ideas or techniques to achieve their desired goals here analysis of the growth trajectories through theoretical approaches makes the processes easy in optimizing the high yielding and cost effective growth conditions for the hatcheries theoretical measures also help to identify the inherent property and minute differences among several similar looking growth profiles kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 the growth process of any species is generally controlled by several yardsticks like relative growth rates maximum cohort size carrying capacity steady state initiation phase etc which provide all the necessary information regarding the species growth it is mentionable that the different laws of physics mostly drive inherent growth principles the growth acceleration is an important measure to clarify any species underlying growth mechanism due to its versatility buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 swinnen et al 2004 determination of the growth acceleration on the growth process of artemia sp i e the combined effect of the rigorous theoretical works and the regular laboratory experiments would surely benefit the hatchery industries from both the biological and the economic points of view one of the most important growth influential factor is the amount of food bengtson et al 1991 lim et al 2001 wouters et al 2002 gandy et al 2007 wrb 2006 dhont and sorgeloos 2002 sorgeloos 1986 abreu grobois et al 1991 lora vilchis and voltolina 2003 lora vilchis et al 2004 pacheco vega et al 2015 several authors investigated the growth responses of artemia sp under different marine plankton species including chaetoceros sp as prey abreu grobois et al 1991 evjemo et al 2000 lora vilchis and voltolina 2003 lora vilchis et al 2004 pacheco vega et al 2015 balachandar and rajaram 2018 however there is a lack of substantial evidence on the most favorable concentration of the food prey for artemia when species is fixed only one study was done on this issue under single prey species isochrysis galbana evjemo and olsen 1999 chaetoceros is an economically very important microalga having high demands in aquaculture due to its fast growth and high nutritional values compared to other marine microalgae simon 1978 phatarpekar et al 2000 brown 2002 rodriguez et al 2012 hence investigating the effect of different concentrations of chaetoceros sp on the growth and maturity of artemia sp under laboratory setup seems a crucial pre requisite for standardizing the culture system of brine shrimp with the microalga in aquaculture research literature suggests that there is a natural propensity of species to grow with a limit even of having unlimited resources evjemo and olsen 1999 evjemo et al 2000 in low food concentration the species growth rate begins to decelerate and becomes restricted below the highest population size from the primitive species like plankton to the most advanced species like a human evjemo and olsen 1999 hopfenberg 2003 kundu et al 2018 deceleration continues until an equilibrium level is achieved evjemo and olsen 1999 hopfenberg 2003 thus the limit in the environment makes a species growth trajectory sigmoidal in shape the maximum size at maturity is synergistic with the term carrying capacity of the species in population dynamics more specifically in population dynamics the carrying capacity of any species is defined as the maximum population size that the environment can sustain although in population dynamics size is synonymous with population abundance but it can represent all growth variables viz height weight length etc more generically in the present study the bodyweight of artemia is used as the species growth metric the growth variable bodyweight is denoted as the size variable now a question arises how the particular level of food concentration can be identified accurately beyond which even after providing additional foods to the system no significant changes occur in the size variables of the growth profile evjemo and olsen 1999 the autopsy of the growth process of the artemia sp can act as the precursor behind the explanation of the question mentioned above the sigmoidal growth process of any species can be categorized into three significant consecutive periods viz lag log and the stationary phases yates and smotzer 2007 the lag phase is the initial or adjustment period of life during which the species adapts to its environment buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 swinnen et al 2004 during the exponential phase or log phase species initiates reproduction at a rate proportional to the population density swinnen et al 2004 yates and smotzer 2007 however the limited resources and several environmental conditions restrain the species unlimited growth and the species attains the stationary phase the species reaches the maximum cohort size carrying capacity by attaining the stationary phase of their growth process so exploring the species precise growth information is only possible through phase wise growth analyses several authors explained the species growth cycle with some of the fundamental laws of the mechanics buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 ginzburg 1986 swinnen et al 2004 ulanowicz 1999 the basic laws of particle physics mainly comprise the displacement velocity and acceleration of any particle the velocity profile demonstrates the rate of change of the displacement of a particle and the acceleration illustrates the rate of change of the particle s velocity buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 first pointed out the relationship between the growth acceleration and the three phases of the sigmoidal growth cycle in the spirit of the fundamental aspects of classical mechanics the species growth profile can also be well demonstrated through its growth velocity and acceleration profiles by comparing the famous malthus law with the first principle of newtonian mechanics ginzburg 1986 reasons behind the variation in the magnitudes of the size at maturity due to different food concentrations must be well explained by the disparity in time points of initiation of steady states in the growth cycle hence we have set four fold objectives 1 estimation of the growth trajectory of the size variable under different food concentrations of artemia sp 2 test the variation among size at maturity for identifying favorable food concentration 3 explanations of the discrepancies among the size at maturity by estimating the time points of initiation of steady states growth rates growth velocity growth accelerations retardation etc through the theoretical formulae derived directly from the growth equation 4 to consider the consortium of the numerical simulation approach to reduce the effort of iterations of laboratory experiments cost effectively and decide the optimum food concentration levels of artemia sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedures the first step of the present study is to perform a laboratory based experiment with various concentrations of the phytoplankton chaetoceros sp as food for the zooplankton artemia sp six different amounts viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of chaetoceros sp were used for the experiment the experiment was done in two phases by maintaining the same protocol the artemia samples were hatched under identical conditions in the first phase we have two replicates due to the limitation of logistic support but in the second phase we have three replicates under advanced experimental support it is expected that the triplet replication data must have a low standard error in comparison with the two replicate dataset another natural and smart suggestion is to look at the entire data with five replicates by merging the observations from the first and second phases for reducing standard error entire growth profile analysis and optimization of the growth variable of artemia is done based on the five replicates see fig 1 additionally we have also included the size profile plots of artemia in appendix a 1 based on the data of two phases separately all the three profile plots based on two three and five replicates are generated with bodyweight data of artemia the entire experimental protocol to measure the weight data are described in the subsequent sections 2 1 1 experimental setups a hatching of zooplankton the artemia cysts were soaked in natural seawater salinity 18 20 ppt and in proper hatching conditions temperature 23 25 c illumination 1000 lux continuous aeration lavens and sorgeloos 1996 after 40 48 h of incubation the free swimming nauplii were emerged out those newly hatched nauplii were used as the test samples b algal culture the running culture of chaetoceros sp was maintained in the laboratory by following the semi continuous microalgae culture method sorgeloos 1986 for the experimental purposes chaetoceros sp was grown in ten 2 liter conical flasks using the same volume of the standard f 2 medium guillard and ryther 1962 at 24 c after 48 h of incubation full grown culture i e culture reached the log phase the microalgae cultures were used to prepare food for the experiment c food preparation the culture of chaetoceros sp was first centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 20 min to get the pellet pellet is the aggregates of cells or a mass of cells devoid of the culture s liquid part the pellets were then semi dried in the silica desiccators for 4 h so that the remaining water from the pellet could be evaporated and used as food six different amounts of semi dried chaetoceros pellets viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg were weighed separately for each replicate of the experimental setup after that 1 ml of 34 ppt saline water was added with each of the weighed pellets to make the suspensions of chaetoceros cells for use as experimental food here the food suspension was prepared with the 34 ppt saline water so that the salinity of both the food and experimental water could match 2 1 2 experiment conducted a rearing and weight measurement of the zooplankton newly hatched nauplii were rinsed into the distilled water d h 2 o before weight measurements the individual weight of single nauplii was negligible which drew some errors in the weight measurement process the weight machine s performance was standardized for taking the cumulative weight of at least 30 nauplii after performing several iterations so we took the thirty 30 zooplankton individuals cumulative wet weight and introduced them in an experimental beaker similarly each of the other experimental beakers was provided with thirty individuals of artemia after taking the bodyweight reading from the first time point the same set of zooplankton individuals were supposed to use throughout the entire experimental tenure for capturing the time dependent growth responses of artemia sp therefore the test samples were handled delicately and replaced at the live condition to the respective experimental setups each experimental beaker contained 299 ml of 34 ppt saline water abreu grobois et al 1991 evjemo et al 2000 lora vilchis et al 2004 while transferring the live zooplankton into it additional 1 ml of food would adjust the total volume of the experimental solution to 300 ml on the other hand simultaneous supporting cultures which are the replica of each experimental setup were maintained throughout the experiment s entire length parallel stock cultures were maintained to continue the experiment uninterruptedly by replacing the individuals from the experimental setup if some would die due to any reasons please note the individuals grown under a similar environmental setup can be taken as the representative of the experimental population b food distribution and making the final setup the introduction of six different amounts 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of food chaetoceros creates variations in the experimental conditions experimental beakers containing 299 ml of 34 ppt saline water and 30 zooplankton in each were provided with 1 ml of chaetoceros cells suspension from the specific amount of foods thus we got the final concentrations of the food chaetoceros sp viz 0 003 mg ml 0 016 mg ml 0 033 mg ml 0 05 mg ml 0 083 mg ml and 0 15 mg ml respectively the experimental beakers were kept under mild aeration 1000 lux lights 24 25 c temperature and less human interference c criterion of termination of the experiment sexual dimorphism is very prominent in this species lavens and sorgeloos 1996 therefore determination of physical and reproductive maturity for artemia sp can be identified with the formation of conjugal or reproductive pairs the experiment was terminated based on the development of mating pairs however the experiment was continued for three 3 additional days from the date of mating pair formations until egg mass appeared in female artemia further continuation of the experiment would not be worthwhile as the data might be upper biased due to egg mass weight thus the entire experiment continued for a total of sixteen 16 days 2 2 outcomes from the experiment and the data two types of data are generated from the growth experiment of artemia sp fed with different concentrations of chaetoceros sp detailing of the data are as follows i time wise size age wise bodyweight datasets for artemia growth are obtained from each of the five replicates of six 6 experimental treatments separately please see appendix a 1 for more information we pursue our whole analysis by considering the averages of those five replicates from each experimental setup so finally a total of six datasets must be available for our analysis however treatments no 1 and 2 viz setup with 1 mg and 5 mg food respectively failed to survive the experiment s entire period hence we do not consider those two food concentrations for further analysis and ultimately proceed with four 4 datasets of 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg food concentrations each dataset from each growth trajectory contains sixteen 16 data points which represent the average value of corresponding artemia bodyweight taken from the five replicates of each time point age of artemia sp the interval of the time is for one 1 day see fig 1 we have represented the age of artemia as the time and bodyweight as the size variables for all the figures in the entire manuscript the size profiles of artemia sp based on our experimental data are given in fig 1 the standard errors in fig 1 show wide variations among the replicates we perform the bootstrap regression analysis with our experimental data set to get the better estimate of the standard errors the profile 2 is due to the bootstrap sampling procedure with the vertical solid line red as the standard error it is ensured from fig 2 that the generation of more bootstrap samples reduces the variation of the standard errors the algorithm of the bootstrap technique is present in appendix c ii other essential data generated from the experiment are about the numbers of reproductive pair formation in artemia and variations in the day of the first appearance of the mating pairs under different experimental conditions a reproductive pair has been formed first at the age of day 10 in the maximum food content of 45 mg and by the end of the experiment age of day 16 the total number of the conjugal reached three 3 in the 25 mg food content setup the first conjugal has formed on the 12th day age of artemia and a total of three 3 pairs of conjugal are formed till the last day of the experiment the setup with a food content of 15 mg has attained only one 1 pair of reproductive pairs on the very last day of the experiment the other setup 10 mg food content has not shown any reproductive pairs during the entire experimental period we believe that this reproductive pair related dataset would help us in making decisions about the relationship between food concentrations and the maturity of artemia in section 4 2 3 growth curve fitting the first step of analyzing the growth trajectory is to find a suitable growth curve model for the experimented data to identify the nature of the growth of artemia sp to meet the present study s first objective estimating the size variable of artemia sp is essential two alternative methods estimate the growth curve models parameters either to use the size or rate equations with additive noise the following stochastic differential equations govern the size and rate equations 1 x t f t θ σ t θ θ 2 1 x t d x t d t d ln x t d t g t x t ϕ σ t ϕ φ here f t θ g t x t ϕ are respectively the size and rgr relative growth rate forms of the standard growth law with θ φ as the parameter space t denotes the additive noise with mean 0 variance 1 and σ is the intensity of the noise for estimating the parameter the nonlinear least square principle are applied where the left hand side of eqs 1 2 can be treated as the response variable and f t θ g t x t ϕ are the nonlinear functions of the corresponding explanatory variables the assumptions of the gaussian distribution for the noise are not essential for deriving the nonlinear least square but to study the optimum property of the estimator is needful the response variable of eq 2 is unobservable the empirical estimate of fisher s rgr fisher 1921 is used the convergence of the nonlinear least squares is uncertain either eq 1 or 2 can be used for estimating the parameters of the underlying growth curve models the most popular method for growth curve fitting in population ecology is the rgr modeling as it is superior to the size modeling seber and wild 2003 bhowmick and bhattacharya 2014 paul et al 2021 the relative growth rate estimates the growth rate relative to the initial size of the population several other authors elaborately explain the apparent advantage of using rgr modeling and its applications kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 paul et al 2021 2 4 comparison of the size at maturity our present study is aimed to identify the food chaetoceros concentration that supports artemia to gain its maximum size at maturity carrying capacity among different levels of food quantities since four 4 estimated carrying capacities are finally obtained from the fitted growth data of artemia of the four 4 experimental setup however for the sake of convenience two distinct estimated carrying capacities viz k i and k j for the i t h and j t h amount of food concentration are assigned respectively to express these notions theoretically the statistical test between these paired sets of carrying capacities would help us to identify whether any significant difference presents or not this testing of hypothesis can be formulated by considering the null hypothesis as h 0 k i k j against the alternative hypothesis h 1 k i k j the estimated values are obtained from the nonlinear least square regression the underlying assumption behind the consistency of the regression procedure is that the errors i are normally distributed it implies that the estimated model parameters i e θ can also be treated as the maximum likelihood estimator mle seber and wild 2003 now from the asymptotic theory of mle it can be said that the distribution of the model parameters is θ i n θ i v a r θ i for i 1 1 4 here the v a r θ i represents the asymptotic variance of the corresponding model parameters the discussion above helps us to construct the following test statistic in order to pursue the testing process 3 τ i j k i k j v a r k i v a r k j here the null distribution the distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is correct of the test statistic 3 follows the standard normal distribution now the rejection of the null hypothesis occurs at some critical value τ i j z α where z α represents the 100 1 α percentile of the standard normal distribution based on the testing process the significant difference between the carrying capacities for the different food concentrations is easily identified with the desired accuracy level since it is an experiment under a controlled environment so it may be possible that there is a much more significant difference between any paired magnitude of carrying capacity say k γ k δ due to the γ t h δ t h level of food concentration with γ δ it creates a chance that the optimum level of food concentration may lie in between γ t h δ t h level of food concentration which in turn would minimize the significant differences between the magnitude of carrying capacities although it would make an opportunity for the experimenter in the future to pinpoint the exact level of food concentration favorable to the growth condition of artemia sp in a large scale hatchery it would not make any profound impact to culminate the significant differences between the paired set of carrying capacities we need to focus on the stationary phase of the artemia sp growth cycle 2 5 initiation of the steady state buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 mention that the growth acceleration increases from the initial period of the species life cycle and achieves the maximum at the end of the lag phase this point acts as a precursor of the initiation of the exponential or log phase in any species growth profile the growth acceleration converts into the retardation on commencing the exponential phase and it dies out at the point of inflection henceforth pi as the growth velocity becomes maximum at that point note that the absolute growth rate s declination specifies the negative magnitude of the retardation after attaining the pi the deceleration period continues in the log phase and will terminate at the end of the log phase after attaining the minimum growth acceleration at that point the log phase ending point acts as an indicator of the initiation of the stationary phase in any species growth profile literature survey shows that most of the authors buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 yates and smotzer 2007 zwietering et al 1992 aguirre et al 2013 madar et al 2013 are much more concerned regarding the lag phase of any species growth profile nevertheless we are more interested in the stationary phase of artemia sp we keep the analysis regarding the lag phase of artemia sp as the future scope of our paper we perform the regression analysis with our experimental data set against the three well known growth models viz gompertz theta logistic and logistic the statistical output from the growth curve fitting of our experimental data with the three growth equations mentioned above indicates that the logistic growth model is the best fit for the dataset we discuss the detailed selection method in the subsequent section 3 1 the functional form of the logistic law can be expressed as 4 d x t d t r x t 1 x t k the rgr function of the logistic law is denoted by 5 1 x t d x t d t r 1 x t k where x t represents the population of artemia sp at any time t however the model parameter r k denotes the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity of the species respectively growth velocity of the species can be expressed v t d x t d t and the growth acceleration as the rate of change in the growth velocity i e a t d v t d t d 2 x t d t 2 the following theorem will provide necessary information regarding the initiation of both exponential log and stationary phase of any species follows the logistic growth law theorem 2 1 the growth acceleration a t of any species is maximized at a population size x t 3 3 6 k and minimized at x t 3 3 6 k for the logistic growth curve proof see appendix a 2 for the proof remark 1 the log phase of any species terminates at a time t l o e t 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 for the logistic growth process where l o e t stands for the log phase ending time proof see appendix a 3 for the proof fig 5 b shows that the growth acceleration further increases from its negative magnitude to zero after attaining its minimum at the end of the log phase the further gaining of zero acceleration indicates the achievement of that cohort s maximum population size which means the species enters its steady state the growth velocity of any species is acting along the tangent at each time point to the corresponding growth profile zwietering et al 1992 the extrapolation of the tangent at the point l o e t produces a point of intersection with the species maximum cohort size and the line joining from that point of intersection with the time domain i e the perpendicular line orange in fig 5 a of the growth profile will provide a unique point on that curve we defined this point as the corridor to enter into the steady state of any species growth profile and named it as the stead state initiation point henceforth s s i t the coordinate of the point l o e t for the logistic growth law is given by 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 3 3 6 k now the equation of the tangent at that point l o e t is expressed by 6 x t 3 3 6 k r k 6 t 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 the detailed calculations are in appendix a 4 we define the extrapolation of the tangent 6 with the carrying capacity of the logistic growth curve as the key to identify the time point at which species have entered into their steady state obeying this method the steady state initiation time point s s i t is 7 3 3 r 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 t s s i t detailed analysis is in appendix a 5 since the present growth dynamic study of artemia sp in the laboratory environment based on the four distinct amount of food concentrations so the analytical expression of the log phase ending time i e t l o e t provided in remark 1 along with the steady state initiation time i e t s s i t 7 would infer us about the four different magnitudes of the l o e t and s s i t respectively see fig 6 the hypothesis testing is necessary to identify whether significant differences among these four corresponding time points exist or not in both of the analytic expressions of l o e t and s s i t the model parameters i e θ x 0 r k are present in a nested way i e we can express both l o e t and s s i t as ϕ x 0 r k it motivates us to apply the univariate delta method casella and berger 2002 to find the variance of the distinct time points based on these different magnitudes of the variance and as per the above discussion we can construct the test statistic for this testing as 8 p i j l o e t i l o e t j v a r l o e t i v a r l o e t j the null distribution of the test statistic follows the standard gaussian distribution the variance of l o e t is calculated based on the following expression of the univariate delta method 9 v a r ϕ θ σ i 1 3 v a r θ i ϕ θ i 2 θ 2 σ i j ϕ i θ ϕ j θ c o v θ i θ j based on the discussion in section 3 1 3 we also consider the rejection of the null hypothesis happens at some critical value p i j z α where z α represents the 100 1 α percentile of the standard normal distribution 3 results 3 1 estimation of the model parameters proper estimates of model parameters to growth data enlighten the underlying mechanism behind the species growth cycle in this regard we treat both the size of artemia sp and the rgr as the response variable separately it may be difficult to identify the growth variations among such similar looking size profiles in comparison the graphic pattern of the empirical estimate of rgr against the time or size is sufficient to guess the proper family of growth curves that have reasonable proximity with the given data kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 paul et al 2021 3 1 1 model selection criteria the rgr profiles in fig 3 show a decreasing pattern to the size of artemia sp for the mentioned amount of food quantities in growth curve literature the decreasing rgr profile pattern to the size is observed in the gompertz theta logistic and logistic growth laws chakraborty et al 2019 so we select these three models for the statistical analysis of our experimental dataset we construct the nonlinear regression framework by considering the rgr as the response variable and the size as the predictor variable the regression works delineate that these three models have good proximity to our dataset to compare the gompertz theta logistic and the logistic models we use the akaike information criterion aic as the statistical measure the best model is selected based on the lowest aic value akaike 1974 burnham and anderson 2004a b we enlist all the estimated model parameters and the magnitudes of aics for these three models in the tables 1 4 the statistical measure confirms that the logistic law has the best association with the four datasets see fig 4 so we select the logistic growth equation for our further analysis the size fitting is performed based on the analytical solution of the logistic eq 4 the closed form expression of the solution is given by 10 x t k 1 k x 0 1 e r t where x 0 represents the initial population size 3 1 2 selection of noise structure generally the growth curve models parameters are estimated through nonlinear least squares where the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated these typical structures of errors are known as white noise however most of the biological processes associated with growth data may demonstrate some degree of serial dependencies or temporal autocorrelation it is alternatively represented as the color noise or the endogenous autocorrelation which typically has disproportionate spectral power at low frequencies bullmore et al 2001 moon and gunther 2020 mathematically if the model residuals are serially independent then the off diagonal elements of the variance covariance matrix ω of the white noise are zero i e ω σ 2 i where i is the identity matrix and σ 2 is the homoscedastic variance note that in case of color noise the off diagonal elements of ω must be non zero seber and wild 2003 actually for color noise we assume the residuals are autocorrelated with order 1 such that the errors t can be represented by the following autocorrelated equations 11 t ρ t 1 u t ρ 1 where u t be white noise the presence absence of autocorrelation among residuals can be tested through the prais winstein method prais and winsten 1954 the test is conducted with the null hypothesis h 0 ρ 0 against the alternative hypothesis h 1 ρ 0 the test statistic required for the method is given by 12 ρ σ t 2 q 1 t t 1 σ t 2 q 1 t 1 2 the null distribution of the test statistic follows the t distribution with q 1 number of degrees of freedom where q being the number of sample size here we assume the average bodyweight of 30 individuals in five replicates as the representative magnitude of the weight of the species and if the color noise is present the representative values may be autocorrelated sarkar et al 2001 we perform the prais winstein method of testing with our experimental dataset and found that the null hypothesis is accepted at a 5 level of significance prais and winsten 1954 this result leads to continue our regression work with the white noise structure of errors the protocol of these tests is provided in appendix c the gauss newton algorithm is used in the nonlinear regression method to minimize the residual sum of squares r core team 2019 the convergence of the iterative algorithm highly depends on the choice of the initial value of the model parameters bhowmick et al 2015 we consider our experimental results as the initial guess for the corresponding model parameters the estimated model parameters along with the estimate of l o e t s s i t are depicted in table 5 it is observed in table 5 that the maximum cohort size or carrying capacity of each experimental condition are increased with the increased amount of food quantity likewise the estimated l o e t s and s s i t s of different experimental growth profiles are also needed to be compared statistically however l o e t and s s i t both are scaler multiple to each other so providing the statistical comparison for either l o e t or s s i t is enough to draw the inference about the growth dynamics of artemia sp remark 2 we observe a certain amount of variation in our experimental dataset it happens due to the usage of the replicate data in this regard we perform the bootstrap regression analysis so that a better estimate of the standard error can be provided we adopt the bootstrap regression technique where bootstrap samples are drawn from the estimated error observations we have 16 paired observations of response and explanatory variables in our data so the regression setup generates 16 estimated errors we bootstrapped 40 samples each of size 16 to produce 40 sets of regression data then we estimated the parameters for each of the sets and finally calculated the standard errors the time series diagram 2 ensures that the variation of the standard error is now tolerable with the bootstrapped data set however for the better accuracy of the estimate of model parameters we also enumerate the bias corrected accelerated confidence interval bca for each of the four distinct food levels we enlist the parameter estimates based on the bootstrap regression in tables 6 9 the bootstrap confidence intervals are not too wide in each of the four distinct food levels moreover the model parameter estimates from our experimental datasets are lying within the bca confidence intervals it judged the reliability of the enumeration of the bca confidence interval 3 1 3 statistical tests the pairwise statistical comparisons table 10 with the consortium of hypothetical tests between the maturity sizes of artemia sp under the different food chaetoceros sp quantities confirm that no significant difference exists between the carrying capacities at the paired levels of food quantities such as 10 15 mg and 25 45 mg the increment in the food quantity from 10 to 15 mg and again from 25 to 45 mg does not significantly impact the maturity size gained by artemia sp however a significant amount of variations is present between the maturity sizes at the paired levels of food quantities 15 25 mg and 15 45 mg as the food level 45 mg is the linear increment from the 25 mg food amount the significant difference between the 15 and 25 mg should be reflected in the species maturity size gain moreover the significant variations among the estimated l o e t s table 11 under the specific food quantities also show similar results with the maturity size hypothesis testings outputs so the hypothetical testings overall results infer an interval within which the optimal amount of food level should be present in our study the optimal food quantity lies within the closed interval 15 25 here one can identify the optimum food quantity from the repeated measurements of extensive laboratory experiments however it is obvious that the rigorous experimental protocol is time consuming and also increases the total expenditure for the laboratory or a unit of a hatchery in this regard the optimal conditions for a species growth also can be achieved through generating theoretical curves from few laboratory iterations which may lower the total cost and time behind the growth optimization processes the theoretical justification to generate numerous growth curves from minimum numbers of experiments can be achieved by the simulation experiment so in this paper we follow the simulation experiment s path in the subsequent section 3 2 to identify the optimum level of food quantity to avoid the cost of laboratory iterations 3 2 simulation study the experiment of studying the growth dynamics of artemia sp by differing the amounts of food chaetoceros sp is performed in a lab based controlled environment the hypothesis testing yields the fact that the species size at the maturity is identical for the paired set of 10 mg 15 mg and 25 mg 45 mg food concentration respectively however there is a significant difference between the species asymptotic size at the 15 mg 25 mg food quantities the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5 level supports the issue the intrinsic growth rate henceforth igr of the species is the major yardstick in making this difference the estimated values of the igr r in table 5 depicts that primarily the magnitude of the igr increases up to the 15 mg food amount and then it shows a decreasing pattern for the 25 mg 45 mg food level more importantly there exists a much more difference between the magnitude of the igr at 15 mg 25 mg food quantities it motivates us to pose the problem of studying the growth dynamics of artemia sp in a new direction since there is a large difference between the igr value of the 15 mg 25 mg levels of food amount we expect that the increasing trend of the magnitude of igr continues up to a certain amount of food behind that 15 mg for the sake of simplicity we assume that level of food quantity be ζ mg where the igr achieves its maximum value x say now the motto of our simulation study is to identify that food concentration level ζ in this regard we construct the table 12 the table 12 ensures that our problem has a close synergy with the interpolation technique in any standard numerical procedure as the required food concentration value i e ζ lies in between the closed interval 10 45 the basic idea behind any numerical interpolation is that there must be some functional relationship between the nodes and the corresponding nodal values in the interpolation process spirit we consider some functional relationships between the food concentration and igr of artemia sp which we would have to determine one should obtain such kind of functional relationship by applying the concept of interpolating polynomial the number of nodes present in table 12 is four ignoring the node ζ which is to be determined indicating the interpolating polynomial degree should be less or equal to three the non equispaced nodes of table 12 resist from adopting newton s interpolation method therefore we should use any particular interpolation method which is applicable for both the equispaced and non equispaced nodes lagrange s interpolation technique will serve this purpose the algorithm of lagrange s interpolation method is described in appendix b the application of the lagrange s interpolation method on table 12 yields a third degree closed interpolating polynomial where the independent variable is the food concentration and the dependent variable is the igr of artemia sp the mathematical expression of the interpolating polynomial is 13 i g r r 0 00027 c 3 0 0215 c 2 0 48825 c 2 5675 with c as the food concentration this simulation experiment enlightens that the magnitude of the igr is not maximized at the 15 mg food concentration rather the maximization occurs at the food concentration ζ 16 45 mg correct up to two decimal places with igr magnitude x 0 8481400 t 1 the simulated results depict that the low availability of the food concentration initially compelled the species to increase their igr up to its maximized level following the increasing trend the igr decreases due to the enhancement of the food level the recognizing ability of the moderate amount of food in the system by artemia sp helps them reducing their igr after achieving the maximum value the reduction in igr will enhance the species growth phases extensively which in turn increase their size at maturity now in order to identify the asymptotic size at that food concentration level ζ we require another interpolation procedure between the species food concentration and their asymptotic size we construct table 13 for this interpolation process proceeding similarly we can find another lagrange s interpolating polynomial describing the functional relationship between the species food concentration and their size at maturity the exact analytic expression of this relationship is 14 k 3 57619 1 0 5 c 3 0 002621429 c 2 0 04834881 c 0 7411071 both of the functional relations viz 13 and 14 will help us to generate a series of growth profile and acceleration trajectories for the different level of food concentration between 15 and 25 mg food concentration value which is depicted in fig 7 a while we are increasing the food concentration the igr is initially increasing but it will show a decreasing trend after certain concentrations now the question is what is the concentration for which the igr is maximized we perform two simulation experiments using lagrange s interpolation method for estimating the concentration for which the igr becomes the maximum it is also important to estimate the size at maturity for this concentration additionally we are also interested to know the estimated value of the size at maturity for some intermediate concentrations between ζ and 25 mg it would help us to justify whether the 25 mg is a favorable food concentration for maximizing the size at maturity beyond those concentrations the asymptotic size at maturity does not significantly change if we choose some intermediate concentrations between 15 mg and 25 mg food concentration size at maturity also appeared at the intermediate value between two maturity sizes outcomes from this simulation study are discussed in section 4 3 3 variations in the absolute growth rates estimated size profiles of the artemia sp fig 6 reveal the species growth response towards the distinct amounts of food viz 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg respectively the profiles depict that the species growth rate initially seems to be identical but the difference in the food quantity level leads them to attain a distinct level of maturity sizes the estimated velocity profile fig 8 a to the species size also describes the scenario the main reason behind the difference in the maturity level is probably due to the different magnitudes of the growth velocities of artemia sp which is not ensured from the size profiles fig 6 apart from this outlook fig 8 a exhibits that the magnitude of the growth velocity attains the highest peak due to the 15 mg food quantity even the species is provided with a greater amount of food than the 15 mg on providing both the 10 mg and 15 mg food amounts the predatory behavior of the artemia sp initially maintains their healthy growth rate the presence of the more amount of chaetoceros sp in the 15 mg food level than the 10 mg increase their growth velocity swiftly followed by the attainment of the inflection point the growth velocity will decrease rapidly due to the shortage of nutrients however fig 8 a depicts that even the concentrations of chaetoceros sp are relatively larger in the 25 mg and 45 mg food levels but the absolute growth velocities are comparatively lower than the 15 mg food quantity the maturity size gained under the 25 mg and 45 mg food levels is larger than the 15 mg set up thus the inherent mechanism behind the species growth after attaining the point of inflection is not visible in the velocity profile 8 a to discuss the growth behavior of artemia sp in a confined way we need to study the species acceleration profile the acceleration profile can portray the points where the rate of change of velocities occurs due to variations in the food levels the artemia experiment is performed under a laboratory environment so the growth rate kicks up almost from the initial time point because of the regular periodic support of the food supplements as a consequence the lag phases of the logistic growth trajectory are almost missing for all the four food concentrations see fig 8 a and fig 8 b 3 4 synergy with particle physics if we want to explain species growth acceleration with a practical example from our surroundings we have to talk about driving a car on a hilly road velocity acceleration and retardation are well known terminologies associated with the incident of driving a car while a driver is running a car the driver s skill can be determined by the amount of jerk produced at the time of change of the acceleration in mechanics jerk is the change of acceleration over time the passengers may feel the jerk when the driver wants to decrease his acceleration or increase retardation suddenly to stop the car before a fixed location on the road if the magnitude of the maximum retardation increases then to return to its original mode of velocity and to stop at the same fixed location the passengers may experience more jerks on the other hand if the driver is skilled enough and somehow managed to decrease the retardation the passengers are exposed to fewer jerks similarly in any growth process the species passes through a retardation zone after attaining the point of inflection buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 the growth cycle of artemia sp is also showing a retardation zone for these four distinct levels of food quantity see fig 8 b the maximum retardation is achieved almost at the same size for the two food quantity levels 10 mg and 15 mg the magnitude of the maximum retardation is more for 15 mg compared to the 10 mg the same phenomena are observed in the case of the 25 mg and 45 mg food amounts dimension analysis of the acceleration profile to the species size depicts the jerk s change rate to the species growth velocity it directly implies that the species growth acceleration profile has a strong correlation with their growth jerk the post attainment of high growth velocity indicates performing a more amount of jerk to reach the steady state i e to stop the car before a fixed location on the road hence the species with the maximum absolute growth rate should control its growth velocity to reach the maximum cohort size by avoiding more jerk initially in the case of 10 mg food amount the density of chaetoceros sp is relatively lesser than that of 15 mg food value simultaneously the feeding behavior of artemia sp leads them to achieve a higher magnitude of the maximum growth velocity in the 15 mg food concentration than the other food values surprisingly the rapid declination of growth velocity is also observed in 15 mg food amount the plausible reason might be that the population of artemia under the 15 mg food quantity setup utilized more food for achieving such a high magnitude of growth rate later the scarcity of food leads them to minimize their growth acceleration a lot in order to enter the stationary phase otherwise the species would experience more jerks with the corresponding change of their growth velocity in 15 mg food quantity this phenomenon is synergistic with the above discussion i e experiencing more jerks by any passenger thus the drastic reduction of the growth velocity acts as a precursor to maximize the growth retardation with a very high magnitude initial high growth velocity and later food shortage compel the species in 15 mg setup to maximize their growth retardation consequently the growth of artemia sp is restricted at a lower level of maturity under the 15 mg food setup the phenomenon is not similar for the 25 mg and 45 mg food quantity in both cases the incident of food shortage does not take part in the growth phases of the artemia sp due to the presence of a sufficient amount of foods in the systems so the species need not increase their retardation a lot to enter the stationary phase after achieving the maximum growth velocity the moderate level of the growth retardation then plays the role of positive catalysts to attain their maturity with large size although the increased percentage of the food quantity from the 25 mg to 45 mg i e 80 is larger than the increased percentage of the food value from the 15 mg to 25 mg i e 60 the maturity size gained between the 25 mg and 45 mg food amount does not differ significantly after attaining the maximum growth velocity in the 45 mg food amount there remains more than a sufficient amount of food in the system resulting the artemia under 45 mg food level experience satiation in the feeding process which is also known as the predator satiation in the field of ecology gentleman and neuheimer 2008 so the maturity size of artemia sp for the 45 mg food level is at par with that of the 25 mg food quantities thus from both the economic point of view and the ecological point of view 25 mg amount of chaetoceros sp would be the optimum food level for the sustainability of the artemia sp in any laboratory based environment 4 discussions identification of the most favorable food quantity for the maximum size gained by artemia sp would be in the right direction if the theoretical results are justified with proper biological events from the experimental observations we all know that the formation of the reproductive pairs in artemia is one of the vital signatures indicating species maturity so here we include the relation between the numbers of the reproductive pair formation and the maturity size gained by artemia under varying food amounts into the elaborate discussions the data 2 2 shows that the 10 mg population has not formed any reproductive pair until the last day of the experiment the matter of the 10 mg population can be explained as a case of insufficiency of the food supply that has not supported the high yield of the maximum size bodyweight gained as well as the reproductive efficiency by the artemia population within the experimental time frame on the other hand even the 15 mg population has formed a reproductive pair on the last day of the experiment still the maturity size gained by the artemia population is restricted at a lower level in comparison to the rest of the two other high food quantity 25 mg and 45 mg setups because of the moderate amount of food supply to the system by the 15 mg quantity may bring stress to the artemia and thus the population tries to reach their stability or maturity very fast however the moderate amount of food source can support the fast growth of the species only up to a specific limit and after that the individuals growths get retarded as a result despite reaching the s s i t significantly faster than the others they show late and less reproductive maturity than the 25 and 45 mg food setups on the contrary each of the population from 25 mg and 45 mg food setups develop three reproductive pairs separately throughout the entire span of the experiment the reason should be due to the sufficient amount of foods to the systems that are favorable for achieving both the maximum asymptote size and reproductive maturity by the species however hypothesis testing studies already prove that no significant benefit occurs in the gaining of the maximum size even after increasing the food amount from 25 mg to 45 mg for 30 artemia sp moreover it would be just a wastage of food nutrients time and money if we apply the 45 mg food chaetoceros sp for 30 individuals of artemia sp thus despite having more than a sufficient amount of food in the 45 mg setup is not advantageous for the hatcheries in identifying the maximum maturity size causing economically beneficiary protocol for the artemia production instead using a sufficient amount of food i e 25 mg is enough for yielding both the maximum maturity size and reproductive maturation by the artemia sp under specific laboratory conditions however the simulation study through the interpolation method reveals that for an intermediate concentration value i e ζ 16 45 the igr is maximized with the magnitude 0 8481400 for this intermediate concentration the size at the maturity is 0 4959847 the relative increase of the size at maturity to the size at food quantity 15 mg is 4 which is much below compared to the relative size increase 27 for the food amount 25 mg if the relative increase of size between 25 mg and 45 mg food quantity is compared it is only 3 that means beyond the food level 25 mg since the maturity size does not significantly change due to the limitation of species maximum growth capacity hence it is reasonable to choose the food quantity 25 mg as one of the most favorable food concentration for the healthy growth of artemia sp however the rigorous experiment is necessary to narrow down the value of the most favorable food amount which should appear between the 16 45 mg and 25 mg nevertheless there should be a trade off to optimize the food concentration and the size at the maturity based on the laboratory experiment s several iterations moreover it is mandatory to mention here that although this laboratory experimentation is done with thirty 30 individuals of artemia sp for the sake of the minimum number of experimental sample handling the experiment can be generalized for any number of individuals for both experimental and theoretical approaches the growth profiles will be similar for other numbers of individuals and food concentrations except for the scalar multiplier of the maturation values therefore depending upon the species strains numbers of the experimented individuals and growth influential environmental conditions etc the hatcheries or the researchers of this domain can standardize their best yielding culture protocol with the help of minor laboratory iterations only in general the present experimental study with the theoretical and simulated design can give us a well defined clue for the experimental scientists to optimize the optimum food concentration for artemia sp which would be ultimately helpful for the industry and management 5 conclusion summing up and comparing all the results drawn by the experimental observations reproductive maturation data statistical and mathematical analysis of the experimented data we can conclude that the optimal range of the chaetoceros sp quantity lies in between the 15 mg to 25 mg for the attainment of the maximum growth of artemia sp under specific laboratory conditions moreover we can also infer that 25 mg quantity of chaetoceros sp can be set and standardized as the highest growth yielding food

a x 0 x 1 x n b which are not necessarily equispaced and the corresponding entries are y i f x i for i 0 1 n we now wish to find a polynomial l n x in x of degree n such that 21 l n x f x i y i since l n x is a polynomial of degree n so we may take l n x as 22 l n x a 0 x x 1 x x 2 x x n a 1 x x 0 x x 2 x x n a n x x 0 x x 1 x x n 1 with a 0 a 1 a n are the coefficients which are to be determined

winstein method the regression model can be given by 24 y i g β η i i i 1 2 n where g is a known function of η i and β is the vector of parameters to be estimated given the observed vector y i we find the estimate of β which minimizes the residual sum of squares between y i and g β n i defined by 25 d β σ i 1 n y i g β η i 2 the estimate of β is 26 β m i n β d β we have our parameter estimate of β the residuals are then obtained as 27 i y i g β η i this bootstrap approach is to simply bootstrap the residuals this is accomplished by constructing the distribution f n that places probability 1 n at each i we then generate bootstrap residuals i for i 1 2 n where the i are obtained by sampling independently from f n i e we sample with replacement from 1 2 n we then have a bootstrap sample data set 28 y i g β η i i i 1 2 n for each such bootstrap data set y i we obtain 29 β m i n β d y β the procedure is repeated for each b bootstrap sample the normal theory interval assumes that the statistic β is normally distributed which is often approximately the case for statistics in sufficiently large samples and uses the bootstrap estimate of sampling variance to construct a 100 1 α confidence interval of the form 30 β z 1 α 2 s e β z 1 α 2 is the 1 α 2 quantile of the standard normal distribution the protocol of this is algorithm is given in the following step 1 we construct a regression set up with our experimental size data with q time points step 2 we collect the residuals generated due to the curve fitting where the size vector x 1 x 2 x q is considered as the response variable step 3 we permute those residuals with the method of simple random sampling with replacement srswr step 4 we perform the bootstrap regression technique with those permuted errors step 5 the regression process is continued up to b number of times step 6 we generate the residuals from such b number of bootstrap samples step 7 we perform the correlation test among with the bootstrap residuals through the prais winstein method eq 12 step 8 the null distribution of the test statistic 12 follows the t distribution so the acceptance of t test will ensure us that there is no

24596,increasing demand for artemia sp as a nutritive food for shrimp and fish drives hatcheries to culture the species in fulfilling market requirements the goal is to optimize food concentration for artemia sp by performing laboratory experiments six different amounts viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of chaetoceros sp are used as food to the experiment the variation in food concentrations has a significant impact on the species internal growth mechanism which produces disparity in the species growth trait phenotype these phenotypic growth deviations can be well understood through the species growth trajectories which are governed by the physical laws of newtonian mechanics the optimization of food concentration involves several iterations of conventional experiments which are not time and cost effective biologists have a strong desire to resolve the issue through alternative theoretical approaches the basic concept of geometry and newtonian mechanics are applied to the size profile of artemia sp to determine the level of food concentration at which it gains the maximum maturity size we also provide simulation based theoretical modeling which would help to optimize the food concentration of the artemia sp we conclude that growth acceleration and jerk of newtonian mechanics is the key regulator for this optimization game keywords growth monitoring laws of physics maturity size retardation simulation trade off 1 introduction satisfying the consumers demands for foods cost effectively is a great challenge for the hatchery industries extensive uses of different phytoplankton and zooplankton as live foods for the shrimp and fish hatcheries enlighten the importance of the regular maintenance and monitoring of the plankton s live cultures brown 2002 morris and mischke 1999 artemia sp commonly known as the brine shrimp is one of such prominent zooplankton used widely in hatchery industries and aquacultural researches for the high dietary values of its cysts nauplii and adults bengtson et al 1991 lim et al 2001 wouters et al 2002 gandy et al 2007 wrb 2006 dhont and sorgeloos 2002 sorgeloos 1986 abreu grobois et al 1991 the market demands for artemia are rising equivalently with the increasing popularity of aquaculture sorgeloos et al 1998 consequently the species growth process needs to undergo extensive laboratory iterations and optimizations to get the maximum yields however the iterations process imparts huge costs to the entire culture protocol and the hatchery people need to fulfill the market demands cost effectively since hatchery industries always search for new ideas or techniques to achieve their desired goals here analysis of the growth trajectories through theoretical approaches makes the processes easy in optimizing the high yielding and cost effective growth conditions for the hatcheries theoretical measures also help to identify the inherent property and minute differences among several similar looking growth profiles kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 the growth process of any species is generally controlled by several yardsticks like relative growth rates maximum cohort size carrying capacity steady state initiation phase etc which provide all the necessary information regarding the species growth it is mentionable that the different laws of physics mostly drive inherent growth principles the growth acceleration is an important measure to clarify any species underlying growth mechanism due to its versatility buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 swinnen et al 2004 determination of the growth acceleration on the growth process of artemia sp i e the combined effect of the rigorous theoretical works and the regular laboratory experiments would surely benefit the hatchery industries from both the biological and the economic points of view one of the most important growth influential factor is the amount of food bengtson et al 1991 lim et al 2001 wouters et al 2002 gandy et al 2007 wrb 2006 dhont and sorgeloos 2002 sorgeloos 1986 abreu grobois et al 1991 lora vilchis and voltolina 2003 lora vilchis et al 2004 pacheco vega et al 2015 several authors investigated the growth responses of artemia sp under different marine plankton species including chaetoceros sp as prey abreu grobois et al 1991 evjemo et al 2000 lora vilchis and voltolina 2003 lora vilchis et al 2004 pacheco vega et al 2015 balachandar and rajaram 2018 however there is a lack of substantial evidence on the most favorable concentration of the food prey for artemia when species is fixed only one study was done on this issue under single prey species isochrysis galbana evjemo and olsen 1999 chaetoceros is an economically very important microalga having high demands in aquaculture due to its fast growth and high nutritional values compared to other marine microalgae simon 1978 phatarpekar et al 2000 brown 2002 rodriguez et al 2012 hence investigating the effect of different concentrations of chaetoceros sp on the growth and maturity of artemia sp under laboratory setup seems a crucial pre requisite for standardizing the culture system of brine shrimp with the microalga in aquaculture research literature suggests that there is a natural propensity of species to grow with a limit even of having unlimited resources evjemo and olsen 1999 evjemo et al 2000 in low food concentration the species growth rate begins to decelerate and becomes restricted below the highest population size from the primitive species like plankton to the most advanced species like a human evjemo and olsen 1999 hopfenberg 2003 kundu et al 2018 deceleration continues until an equilibrium level is achieved evjemo and olsen 1999 hopfenberg 2003 thus the limit in the environment makes a species growth trajectory sigmoidal in shape the maximum size at maturity is synergistic with the term carrying capacity of the species in population dynamics more specifically in population dynamics the carrying capacity of any species is defined as the maximum population size that the environment can sustain although in population dynamics size is synonymous with population abundance but it can represent all growth variables viz height weight length etc more generically in the present study the bodyweight of artemia is used as the species growth metric the growth variable bodyweight is denoted as the size variable now a question arises how the particular level of food concentration can be identified accurately beyond which even after providing additional foods to the system no significant changes occur in the size variables of the growth profile evjemo and olsen 1999 the autopsy of the growth process of the artemia sp can act as the precursor behind the explanation of the question mentioned above the sigmoidal growth process of any species can be categorized into three significant consecutive periods viz lag log and the stationary phases yates and smotzer 2007 the lag phase is the initial or adjustment period of life during which the species adapts to its environment buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 swinnen et al 2004 during the exponential phase or log phase species initiates reproduction at a rate proportional to the population density swinnen et al 2004 yates and smotzer 2007 however the limited resources and several environmental conditions restrain the species unlimited growth and the species attains the stationary phase the species reaches the maximum cohort size carrying capacity by attaining the stationary phase of their growth process so exploring the species precise growth information is only possible through phase wise growth analyses several authors explained the species growth cycle with some of the fundamental laws of the mechanics buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 ginzburg 1986 swinnen et al 2004 ulanowicz 1999 the basic laws of particle physics mainly comprise the displacement velocity and acceleration of any particle the velocity profile demonstrates the rate of change of the displacement of a particle and the acceleration illustrates the rate of change of the particle s velocity buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 first pointed out the relationship between the growth acceleration and the three phases of the sigmoidal growth cycle in the spirit of the fundamental aspects of classical mechanics the species growth profile can also be well demonstrated through its growth velocity and acceleration profiles by comparing the famous malthus law with the first principle of newtonian mechanics ginzburg 1986 reasons behind the variation in the magnitudes of the size at maturity due to different food concentrations must be well explained by the disparity in time points of initiation of steady states in the growth cycle hence we have set four fold objectives 1 estimation of the growth trajectory of the size variable under different food concentrations of artemia sp 2 test the variation among size at maturity for identifying favorable food concentration 3 explanations of the discrepancies among the size at maturity by estimating the time points of initiation of steady states growth rates growth velocity growth accelerations retardation etc through the theoretical formulae derived directly from the growth equation 4 to consider the consortium of the numerical simulation approach to reduce the effort of iterations of laboratory experiments cost effectively and decide the optimum food concentration levels of artemia sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedures the first step of the present study is to perform a laboratory based experiment with various concentrations of the phytoplankton chaetoceros sp as food for the zooplankton artemia sp six different amounts viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of chaetoceros sp were used for the experiment the experiment was done in two phases by maintaining the same protocol the artemia samples were hatched under identical conditions in the first phase we have two replicates due to the limitation of logistic support but in the second phase we have three replicates under advanced experimental support it is expected that the triplet replication data must have a low standard error in comparison with the two replicate dataset another natural and smart suggestion is to look at the entire data with five replicates by merging the observations from the first and second phases for reducing standard error entire growth profile analysis and optimization of the growth variable of artemia is done based on the five replicates see fig 1 additionally we have also included the size profile plots of artemia in appendix a 1 based on the data of two phases separately all the three profile plots based on two three and five replicates are generated with bodyweight data of artemia the entire experimental protocol to measure the weight data are described in the subsequent sections 2 1 1 experimental setups a hatching of zooplankton the artemia cysts were soaked in natural seawater salinity 18 20 ppt and in proper hatching conditions temperature 23 25 c illumination 1000 lux continuous aeration lavens and sorgeloos 1996 after 40 48 h of incubation the free swimming nauplii were emerged out those newly hatched nauplii were used as the test samples b algal culture the running culture of chaetoceros sp was maintained in the laboratory by following the semi continuous microalgae culture method sorgeloos 1986 for the experimental purposes chaetoceros sp was grown in ten 2 liter conical flasks using the same volume of the standard f 2 medium guillard and ryther 1962 at 24 c after 48 h of incubation full grown culture i e culture reached the log phase the microalgae cultures were used to prepare food for the experiment c food preparation the culture of chaetoceros sp was first centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 20 min to get the pellet pellet is the aggregates of cells or a mass of cells devoid of the culture s liquid part the pellets were then semi dried in the silica desiccators for 4 h so that the remaining water from the pellet could be evaporated and used as food six different amounts of semi dried chaetoceros pellets viz 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg were weighed separately for each replicate of the experimental setup after that 1 ml of 34 ppt saline water was added with each of the weighed pellets to make the suspensions of chaetoceros cells for use as experimental food here the food suspension was prepared with the 34 ppt saline water so that the salinity of both the food and experimental water could match 2 1 2 experiment conducted a rearing and weight measurement of the zooplankton newly hatched nauplii were rinsed into the distilled water d h 2 o before weight measurements the individual weight of single nauplii was negligible which drew some errors in the weight measurement process the weight machine s performance was standardized for taking the cumulative weight of at least 30 nauplii after performing several iterations so we took the thirty 30 zooplankton individuals cumulative wet weight and introduced them in an experimental beaker similarly each of the other experimental beakers was provided with thirty individuals of artemia after taking the bodyweight reading from the first time point the same set of zooplankton individuals were supposed to use throughout the entire experimental tenure for capturing the time dependent growth responses of artemia sp therefore the test samples were handled delicately and replaced at the live condition to the respective experimental setups each experimental beaker contained 299 ml of 34 ppt saline water abreu grobois et al 1991 evjemo et al 2000 lora vilchis et al 2004 while transferring the live zooplankton into it additional 1 ml of food would adjust the total volume of the experimental solution to 300 ml on the other hand simultaneous supporting cultures which are the replica of each experimental setup were maintained throughout the experiment s entire length parallel stock cultures were maintained to continue the experiment uninterruptedly by replacing the individuals from the experimental setup if some would die due to any reasons please note the individuals grown under a similar environmental setup can be taken as the representative of the experimental population b food distribution and making the final setup the introduction of six different amounts 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg of food chaetoceros creates variations in the experimental conditions experimental beakers containing 299 ml of 34 ppt saline water and 30 zooplankton in each were provided with 1 ml of chaetoceros cells suspension from the specific amount of foods thus we got the final concentrations of the food chaetoceros sp viz 0 003 mg ml 0 016 mg ml 0 033 mg ml 0 05 mg ml 0 083 mg ml and 0 15 mg ml respectively the experimental beakers were kept under mild aeration 1000 lux lights 24 25 c temperature and less human interference c criterion of termination of the experiment sexual dimorphism is very prominent in this species lavens and sorgeloos 1996 therefore determination of physical and reproductive maturity for artemia sp can be identified with the formation of conjugal or reproductive pairs the experiment was terminated based on the development of mating pairs however the experiment was continued for three 3 additional days from the date of mating pair formations until egg mass appeared in female artemia further continuation of the experiment would not be worthwhile as the data might be upper biased due to egg mass weight thus the entire experiment continued for a total of sixteen 16 days 2 2 outcomes from the experiment and the data two types of data are generated from the growth experiment of artemia sp fed with different concentrations of chaetoceros sp detailing of the data are as follows i time wise size age wise bodyweight datasets for artemia growth are obtained from each of the five replicates of six 6 experimental treatments separately please see appendix a 1 for more information we pursue our whole analysis by considering the averages of those five replicates from each experimental setup so finally a total of six datasets must be available for our analysis however treatments no 1 and 2 viz setup with 1 mg and 5 mg food respectively failed to survive the experiment s entire period hence we do not consider those two food concentrations for further analysis and ultimately proceed with four 4 datasets of 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg food concentrations each dataset from each growth trajectory contains sixteen 16 data points which represent the average value of corresponding artemia bodyweight taken from the five replicates of each time point age of artemia sp the interval of the time is for one 1 day see fig 1 we have represented the age of artemia as the time and bodyweight as the size variables for all the figures in the entire manuscript the size profiles of artemia sp based on our experimental data are given in fig 1 the standard errors in fig 1 show wide variations among the replicates we perform the bootstrap regression analysis with our experimental data set to get the better estimate of the standard errors the profile 2 is due to the bootstrap sampling procedure with the vertical solid line red as the standard error it is ensured from fig 2 that the generation of more bootstrap samples reduces the variation of the standard errors the algorithm of the bootstrap technique is present in appendix c ii other essential data generated from the experiment are about the numbers of reproductive pair formation in artemia and variations in the day of the first appearance of the mating pairs under different experimental conditions a reproductive pair has been formed first at the age of day 10 in the maximum food content of 45 mg and by the end of the experiment age of day 16 the total number of the conjugal reached three 3 in the 25 mg food content setup the first conjugal has formed on the 12th day age of artemia and a total of three 3 pairs of conjugal are formed till the last day of the experiment the setup with a food content of 15 mg has attained only one 1 pair of reproductive pairs on the very last day of the experiment the other setup 10 mg food content has not shown any reproductive pairs during the entire experimental period we believe that this reproductive pair related dataset would help us in making decisions about the relationship between food concentrations and the maturity of artemia in section 4 2 3 growth curve fitting the first step of analyzing the growth trajectory is to find a suitable growth curve model for the experimented data to identify the nature of the growth of artemia sp to meet the present study s first objective estimating the size variable of artemia sp is essential two alternative methods estimate the growth curve models parameters either to use the size or rate equations with additive noise the following stochastic differential equations govern the size and rate equations 1 x t f t θ σ t θ θ 2 1 x t d x t d t d ln x t d t g t x t ϕ σ t ϕ φ here f t θ g t x t ϕ are respectively the size and rgr relative growth rate forms of the standard growth law with θ φ as the parameter space t denotes the additive noise with mean 0 variance 1 and σ is the intensity of the noise for estimating the parameter the nonlinear least square principle are applied where the left hand side of eqs 1 2 can be treated as the response variable and f t θ g t x t ϕ are the nonlinear functions of the corresponding explanatory variables the assumptions of the gaussian distribution for the noise are not essential for deriving the nonlinear least square but to study the optimum property of the estimator is needful the response variable of eq 2 is unobservable the empirical estimate of fisher s rgr fisher 1921 is used the convergence of the nonlinear least squares is uncertain either eq 1 or 2 can be used for estimating the parameters of the underlying growth curve models the most popular method for growth curve fitting in population ecology is the rgr modeling as it is superior to the size modeling seber and wild 2003 bhowmick and bhattacharya 2014 paul et al 2021 the relative growth rate estimates the growth rate relative to the initial size of the population several other authors elaborately explain the apparent advantage of using rgr modeling and its applications kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 paul et al 2021 2 4 comparison of the size at maturity our present study is aimed to identify the food chaetoceros concentration that supports artemia to gain its maximum size at maturity carrying capacity among different levels of food quantities since four 4 estimated carrying capacities are finally obtained from the fitted growth data of artemia of the four 4 experimental setup however for the sake of convenience two distinct estimated carrying capacities viz k i and k j for the i t h and j t h amount of food concentration are assigned respectively to express these notions theoretically the statistical test between these paired sets of carrying capacities would help us to identify whether any significant difference presents or not this testing of hypothesis can be formulated by considering the null hypothesis as h 0 k i k j against the alternative hypothesis h 1 k i k j the estimated values are obtained from the nonlinear least square regression the underlying assumption behind the consistency of the regression procedure is that the errors i are normally distributed it implies that the estimated model parameters i e θ can also be treated as the maximum likelihood estimator mle seber and wild 2003 now from the asymptotic theory of mle it can be said that the distribution of the model parameters is θ i n θ i v a r θ i for i 1 1 4 here the v a r θ i represents the asymptotic variance of the corresponding model parameters the discussion above helps us to construct the following test statistic in order to pursue the testing process 3 τ i j k i k j v a r k i v a r k j here the null distribution the distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is correct of the test statistic 3 follows the standard normal distribution now the rejection of the null hypothesis occurs at some critical value τ i j z α where z α represents the 100 1 α percentile of the standard normal distribution based on the testing process the significant difference between the carrying capacities for the different food concentrations is easily identified with the desired accuracy level since it is an experiment under a controlled environment so it may be possible that there is a much more significant difference between any paired magnitude of carrying capacity say k γ k δ due to the γ t h δ t h level of food concentration with γ δ it creates a chance that the optimum level of food concentration may lie in between γ t h δ t h level of food concentration which in turn would minimize the significant differences between the magnitude of carrying capacities although it would make an opportunity for the experimenter in the future to pinpoint the exact level of food concentration favorable to the growth condition of artemia sp in a large scale hatchery it would not make any profound impact to culminate the significant differences between the paired set of carrying capacities we need to focus on the stationary phase of the artemia sp growth cycle 2 5 initiation of the steady state buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 mention that the growth acceleration increases from the initial period of the species life cycle and achieves the maximum at the end of the lag phase this point acts as a precursor of the initiation of the exponential or log phase in any species growth profile the growth acceleration converts into the retardation on commencing the exponential phase and it dies out at the point of inflection henceforth pi as the growth velocity becomes maximum at that point note that the absolute growth rate s declination specifies the negative magnitude of the retardation after attaining the pi the deceleration period continues in the log phase and will terminate at the end of the log phase after attaining the minimum growth acceleration at that point the log phase ending point acts as an indicator of the initiation of the stationary phase in any species growth profile literature survey shows that most of the authors buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 yates and smotzer 2007 zwietering et al 1992 aguirre et al 2013 madar et al 2013 are much more concerned regarding the lag phase of any species growth profile nevertheless we are more interested in the stationary phase of artemia sp we keep the analysis regarding the lag phase of artemia sp as the future scope of our paper we perform the regression analysis with our experimental data set against the three well known growth models viz gompertz theta logistic and logistic the statistical output from the growth curve fitting of our experimental data with the three growth equations mentioned above indicates that the logistic growth model is the best fit for the dataset we discuss the detailed selection method in the subsequent section 3 1 the functional form of the logistic law can be expressed as 4 d x t d t r x t 1 x t k the rgr function of the logistic law is denoted by 5 1 x t d x t d t r 1 x t k where x t represents the population of artemia sp at any time t however the model parameter r k denotes the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity of the species respectively growth velocity of the species can be expressed v t d x t d t and the growth acceleration as the rate of change in the growth velocity i e a t d v t d t d 2 x t d t 2 the following theorem will provide necessary information regarding the initiation of both exponential log and stationary phase of any species follows the logistic growth law theorem 2 1 the growth acceleration a t of any species is maximized at a population size x t 3 3 6 k and minimized at x t 3 3 6 k for the logistic growth curve proof see appendix a 2 for the proof remark 1 the log phase of any species terminates at a time t l o e t 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 for the logistic growth process where l o e t stands for the log phase ending time proof see appendix a 3 for the proof fig 5 b shows that the growth acceleration further increases from its negative magnitude to zero after attaining its minimum at the end of the log phase the further gaining of zero acceleration indicates the achievement of that cohort s maximum population size which means the species enters its steady state the growth velocity of any species is acting along the tangent at each time point to the corresponding growth profile zwietering et al 1992 the extrapolation of the tangent at the point l o e t produces a point of intersection with the species maximum cohort size and the line joining from that point of intersection with the time domain i e the perpendicular line orange in fig 5 a of the growth profile will provide a unique point on that curve we defined this point as the corridor to enter into the steady state of any species growth profile and named it as the stead state initiation point henceforth s s i t the coordinate of the point l o e t for the logistic growth law is given by 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 3 3 6 k now the equation of the tangent at that point l o e t is expressed by 6 x t 3 3 6 k r k 6 t 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 the detailed calculations are in appendix a 4 we define the extrapolation of the tangent 6 with the carrying capacity of the logistic growth curve as the key to identify the time point at which species have entered into their steady state obeying this method the steady state initiation time point s s i t is 7 3 3 r 1 r ln 3 3 3 3 k x 0 1 t s s i t detailed analysis is in appendix a 5 since the present growth dynamic study of artemia sp in the laboratory environment based on the four distinct amount of food concentrations so the analytical expression of the log phase ending time i e t l o e t provided in remark 1 along with the steady state initiation time i e t s s i t 7 would infer us about the four different magnitudes of the l o e t and s s i t respectively see fig 6 the hypothesis testing is necessary to identify whether significant differences among these four corresponding time points exist or not in both of the analytic expressions of l o e t and s s i t the model parameters i e θ x 0 r k are present in a nested way i e we can express both l o e t and s s i t as ϕ x 0 r k it motivates us to apply the univariate delta method casella and berger 2002 to find the variance of the distinct time points based on these different magnitudes of the variance and as per the above discussion we can construct the test statistic for this testing as 8 p i j l o e t i l o e t j v a r l o e t i v a r l o e t j the null distribution of the test statistic follows the standard gaussian distribution the variance of l o e t is calculated based on the following expression of the univariate delta method 9 v a r ϕ θ σ i 1 3 v a r θ i ϕ θ i 2 θ 2 σ i j ϕ i θ ϕ j θ c o v θ i θ j based on the discussion in section 3 1 3 we also consider the rejection of the null hypothesis happens at some critical value p i j z α where z α represents the 100 1 α percentile of the standard normal distribution 3 results 3 1 estimation of the model parameters proper estimates of model parameters to growth data enlighten the underlying mechanism behind the species growth cycle in this regard we treat both the size of artemia sp and the rgr as the response variable separately it may be difficult to identify the growth variations among such similar looking size profiles in comparison the graphic pattern of the empirical estimate of rgr against the time or size is sufficient to guess the proper family of growth curves that have reasonable proximity with the given data kundu et al 2018 sibly et al 2007 gupta et al 2012 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2019 paul et al 2021 3 1 1 model selection criteria the rgr profiles in fig 3 show a decreasing pattern to the size of artemia sp for the mentioned amount of food quantities in growth curve literature the decreasing rgr profile pattern to the size is observed in the gompertz theta logistic and logistic growth laws chakraborty et al 2019 so we select these three models for the statistical analysis of our experimental dataset we construct the nonlinear regression framework by considering the rgr as the response variable and the size as the predictor variable the regression works delineate that these three models have good proximity to our dataset to compare the gompertz theta logistic and the logistic models we use the akaike information criterion aic as the statistical measure the best model is selected based on the lowest aic value akaike 1974 burnham and anderson 2004a b we enlist all the estimated model parameters and the magnitudes of aics for these three models in the tables 1 4 the statistical measure confirms that the logistic law has the best association with the four datasets see fig 4 so we select the logistic growth equation for our further analysis the size fitting is performed based on the analytical solution of the logistic eq 4 the closed form expression of the solution is given by 10 x t k 1 k x 0 1 e r t where x 0 represents the initial population size 3 1 2 selection of noise structure generally the growth curve models parameters are estimated through nonlinear least squares where the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated these typical structures of errors are known as white noise however most of the biological processes associated with growth data may demonstrate some degree of serial dependencies or temporal autocorrelation it is alternatively represented as the color noise or the endogenous autocorrelation which typically has disproportionate spectral power at low frequencies bullmore et al 2001 moon and gunther 2020 mathematically if the model residuals are serially independent then the off diagonal elements of the variance covariance matrix ω of the white noise are zero i e ω σ 2 i where i is the identity matrix and σ 2 is the homoscedastic variance note that in case of color noise the off diagonal elements of ω must be non zero seber and wild 2003 actually for color noise we assume the residuals are autocorrelated with order 1 such that the errors t can be represented by the following autocorrelated equations 11 t ρ t 1 u t ρ 1 where u t be white noise the presence absence of autocorrelation among residuals can be tested through the prais winstein method prais and winsten 1954 the test is conducted with the null hypothesis h 0 ρ 0 against the alternative hypothesis h 1 ρ 0 the test statistic required for the method is given by 12 ρ σ t 2 q 1 t t 1 σ t 2 q 1 t 1 2 the null distribution of the test statistic follows the t distribution with q 1 number of degrees of freedom where q being the number of sample size here we assume the average bodyweight of 30 individuals in five replicates as the representative magnitude of the weight of the species and if the color noise is present the representative values may be autocorrelated sarkar et al 2001 we perform the prais winstein method of testing with our experimental dataset and found that the null hypothesis is accepted at a 5 level of significance prais and winsten 1954 this result leads to continue our regression work with the white noise structure of errors the protocol of these tests is provided in appendix c the gauss newton algorithm is used in the nonlinear regression method to minimize the residual sum of squares r core team 2019 the convergence of the iterative algorithm highly depends on the choice of the initial value of the model parameters bhowmick et al 2015 we consider our experimental results as the initial guess for the corresponding model parameters the estimated model parameters along with the estimate of l o e t s s i t are depicted in table 5 it is observed in table 5 that the maximum cohort size or carrying capacity of each experimental condition are increased with the increased amount of food quantity likewise the estimated l o e t s and s s i t s of different experimental growth profiles are also needed to be compared statistically however l o e t and s s i t both are scaler multiple to each other so providing the statistical comparison for either l o e t or s s i t is enough to draw the inference about the growth dynamics of artemia sp remark 2 we observe a certain amount of variation in our experimental dataset it happens due to the usage of the replicate data in this regard we perform the bootstrap regression analysis so that a better estimate of the standard error can be provided we adopt the bootstrap regression technique where bootstrap samples are drawn from the estimated error observations we have 16 paired observations of response and explanatory variables in our data so the regression setup generates 16 estimated errors we bootstrapped 40 samples each of size 16 to produce 40 sets of regression data then we estimated the parameters for each of the sets and finally calculated the standard errors the time series diagram 2 ensures that the variation of the standard error is now tolerable with the bootstrapped data set however for the better accuracy of the estimate of model parameters we also enumerate the bias corrected accelerated confidence interval bca for each of the four distinct food levels we enlist the parameter estimates based on the bootstrap regression in tables 6 9 the bootstrap confidence intervals are not too wide in each of the four distinct food levels moreover the model parameter estimates from our experimental datasets are lying within the bca confidence intervals it judged the reliability of the enumeration of the bca confidence interval 3 1 3 statistical tests the pairwise statistical comparisons table 10 with the consortium of hypothetical tests between the maturity sizes of artemia sp under the different food chaetoceros sp quantities confirm that no significant difference exists between the carrying capacities at the paired levels of food quantities such as 10 15 mg and 25 45 mg the increment in the food quantity from 10 to 15 mg and again from 25 to 45 mg does not significantly impact the maturity size gained by artemia sp however a significant amount of variations is present between the maturity sizes at the paired levels of food quantities 15 25 mg and 15 45 mg as the food level 45 mg is the linear increment from the 25 mg food amount the significant difference between the 15 and 25 mg should be reflected in the species maturity size gain moreover the significant variations among the estimated l o e t s table 11 under the specific food quantities also show similar results with the maturity size hypothesis testings outputs so the hypothetical testings overall results infer an interval within which the optimal amount of food level should be present in our study the optimal food quantity lies within the closed interval 15 25 here one can identify the optimum food quantity from the repeated measurements of extensive laboratory experiments however it is obvious that the rigorous experimental protocol is time consuming and also increases the total expenditure for the laboratory or a unit of a hatchery in this regard the optimal conditions for a species growth also can be achieved through generating theoretical curves from few laboratory iterations which may lower the total cost and time behind the growth optimization processes the theoretical justification to generate numerous growth curves from minimum numbers of experiments can be achieved by the simulation experiment so in this paper we follow the simulation experiment s path in the subsequent section 3 2 to identify the optimum level of food quantity to avoid the cost of laboratory iterations 3 2 simulation study the experiment of studying the growth dynamics of artemia sp by differing the amounts of food chaetoceros sp is performed in a lab based controlled environment the hypothesis testing yields the fact that the species size at the maturity is identical for the paired set of 10 mg 15 mg and 25 mg 45 mg food concentration respectively however there is a significant difference between the species asymptotic size at the 15 mg 25 mg food quantities the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5 level supports the issue the intrinsic growth rate henceforth igr of the species is the major yardstick in making this difference the estimated values of the igr r in table 5 depicts that primarily the magnitude of the igr increases up to the 15 mg food amount and then it shows a decreasing pattern for the 25 mg 45 mg food level more importantly there exists a much more difference between the magnitude of the igr at 15 mg 25 mg food quantities it motivates us to pose the problem of studying the growth dynamics of artemia sp in a new direction since there is a large difference between the igr value of the 15 mg 25 mg levels of food amount we expect that the increasing trend of the magnitude of igr continues up to a certain amount of food behind that 15 mg for the sake of simplicity we assume that level of food quantity be ζ mg where the igr achieves its maximum value x say now the motto of our simulation study is to identify that food concentration level ζ in this regard we construct the table 12 the table 12 ensures that our problem has a close synergy with the interpolation technique in any standard numerical procedure as the required food concentration value i e ζ lies in between the closed interval 10 45 the basic idea behind any numerical interpolation is that there must be some functional relationship between the nodes and the corresponding nodal values in the interpolation process spirit we consider some functional relationships between the food concentration and igr of artemia sp which we would have to determine one should obtain such kind of functional relationship by applying the concept of interpolating polynomial the number of nodes present in table 12 is four ignoring the node ζ which is to be determined indicating the interpolating polynomial degree should be less or equal to three the non equispaced nodes of table 12 resist from adopting newton s interpolation method therefore we should use any particular interpolation method which is applicable for both the equispaced and non equispaced nodes lagrange s interpolation technique will serve this purpose the algorithm of lagrange s interpolation method is described in appendix b the application of the lagrange s interpolation method on table 12 yields a third degree closed interpolating polynomial where the independent variable is the food concentration and the dependent variable is the igr of artemia sp the mathematical expression of the interpolating polynomial is 13 i g r r 0 00027 c 3 0 0215 c 2 0 48825 c 2 5675 with c as the food concentration this simulation experiment enlightens that the magnitude of the igr is not maximized at the 15 mg food concentration rather the maximization occurs at the food concentration ζ 16 45 mg correct up to two decimal places with igr magnitude x 0 8481400 t 1 the simulated results depict that the low availability of the food concentration initially compelled the species to increase their igr up to its maximized level following the increasing trend the igr decreases due to the enhancement of the food level the recognizing ability of the moderate amount of food in the system by artemia sp helps them reducing their igr after achieving the maximum value the reduction in igr will enhance the species growth phases extensively which in turn increase their size at maturity now in order to identify the asymptotic size at that food concentration level ζ we require another interpolation procedure between the species food concentration and their asymptotic size we construct table 13 for this interpolation process proceeding similarly we can find another lagrange s interpolating polynomial describing the functional relationship between the species food concentration and their size at maturity the exact analytic expression of this relationship is 14 k 3 57619 1 0 5 c 3 0 002621429 c 2 0 04834881 c 0 7411071 both of the functional relations viz 13 and 14 will help us to generate a series of growth profile and acceleration trajectories for the different level of food concentration between 15 and 25 mg food concentration value which is depicted in fig 7 a while we are increasing the food concentration the igr is initially increasing but it will show a decreasing trend after certain concentrations now the question is what is the concentration for which the igr is maximized we perform two simulation experiments using lagrange s interpolation method for estimating the concentration for which the igr becomes the maximum it is also important to estimate the size at maturity for this concentration additionally we are also interested to know the estimated value of the size at maturity for some intermediate concentrations between ζ and 25 mg it would help us to justify whether the 25 mg is a favorable food concentration for maximizing the size at maturity beyond those concentrations the asymptotic size at maturity does not significantly change if we choose some intermediate concentrations between 15 mg and 25 mg food concentration size at maturity also appeared at the intermediate value between two maturity sizes outcomes from this simulation study are discussed in section 4 3 3 variations in the absolute growth rates estimated size profiles of the artemia sp fig 6 reveal the species growth response towards the distinct amounts of food viz 10 mg 15 mg 25 mg and 45 mg respectively the profiles depict that the species growth rate initially seems to be identical but the difference in the food quantity level leads them to attain a distinct level of maturity sizes the estimated velocity profile fig 8 a to the species size also describes the scenario the main reason behind the difference in the maturity level is probably due to the different magnitudes of the growth velocities of artemia sp which is not ensured from the size profiles fig 6 apart from this outlook fig 8 a exhibits that the magnitude of the growth velocity attains the highest peak due to the 15 mg food quantity even the species is provided with a greater amount of food than the 15 mg on providing both the 10 mg and 15 mg food amounts the predatory behavior of the artemia sp initially maintains their healthy growth rate the presence of the more amount of chaetoceros sp in the 15 mg food level than the 10 mg increase their growth velocity swiftly followed by the attainment of the inflection point the growth velocity will decrease rapidly due to the shortage of nutrients however fig 8 a depicts that even the concentrations of chaetoceros sp are relatively larger in the 25 mg and 45 mg food levels but the absolute growth velocities are comparatively lower than the 15 mg food quantity the maturity size gained under the 25 mg and 45 mg food levels is larger than the 15 mg set up thus the inherent mechanism behind the species growth after attaining the point of inflection is not visible in the velocity profile 8 a to discuss the growth behavior of artemia sp in a confined way we need to study the species acceleration profile the acceleration profile can portray the points where the rate of change of velocities occurs due to variations in the food levels the artemia experiment is performed under a laboratory environment so the growth rate kicks up almost from the initial time point because of the regular periodic support of the food supplements as a consequence the lag phases of the logistic growth trajectory are almost missing for all the four food concentrations see fig 8 a and fig 8 b 3 4 synergy with particle physics if we want to explain species growth acceleration with a practical example from our surroundings we have to talk about driving a car on a hilly road velocity acceleration and retardation are well known terminologies associated with the incident of driving a car while a driver is running a car the driver s skill can be determined by the amount of jerk produced at the time of change of the acceleration in mechanics jerk is the change of acceleration over time the passengers may feel the jerk when the driver wants to decrease his acceleration or increase retardation suddenly to stop the car before a fixed location on the road if the magnitude of the maximum retardation increases then to return to its original mode of velocity and to stop at the same fixed location the passengers may experience more jerks on the other hand if the driver is skilled enough and somehow managed to decrease the retardation the passengers are exposed to fewer jerks similarly in any growth process the species passes through a retardation zone after attaining the point of inflection buchanan and cygnarowicz 1990 the growth cycle of artemia sp is also showing a retardation zone for these four distinct levels of food quantity see fig 8 b the maximum retardation is achieved almost at the same size for the two food quantity levels 10 mg and 15 mg the magnitude of the maximum retardation is more for 15 mg compared to the 10 mg the same phenomena are observed in the case of the 25 mg and 45 mg food amounts dimension analysis of the acceleration profile to the species size depicts the jerk s change rate to the species growth velocity it directly implies that the species growth acceleration profile has a strong correlation with their growth jerk the post attainment of high growth velocity indicates performing a more amount of jerk to reach the steady state i e to stop the car before a fixed location on the road hence the species with the maximum absolute growth rate should control its growth velocity to reach the maximum cohort size by avoiding more jerk initially in the case of 10 mg food amount the density of chaetoceros sp is relatively lesser than that of 15 mg food value simultaneously the feeding behavior of artemia sp leads them to achieve a higher magnitude of the maximum growth velocity in the 15 mg food concentration than the other food values surprisingly the rapid declination of growth velocity is also observed in 15 mg food amount the plausible reason might be that the population of artemia under the 15 mg food quantity setup utilized more food for achieving such a high magnitude of growth rate later the scarcity of food leads them to minimize their growth acceleration a lot in order to enter the stationary phase otherwise the species would experience more jerks with the corresponding change of their growth velocity in 15 mg food quantity this phenomenon is synergistic with the above discussion i e experiencing more jerks by any passenger thus the drastic reduction of the growth velocity acts as a precursor to maximize the growth retardation with a very high magnitude initial high growth velocity and later food shortage compel the species in 15 mg setup to maximize their growth retardation consequently the growth of artemia sp is restricted at a lower level of maturity under the 15 mg food setup the phenomenon is not similar for the 25 mg and 45 mg food quantity in both cases the incident of food shortage does not take part in the growth phases of the artemia sp due to the presence of a sufficient amount of foods in the systems so the species need not increase their retardation a lot to enter the stationary phase after achieving the maximum growth velocity the moderate level of the growth retardation then plays the role of positive catalysts to attain their maturity with large size although the increased percentage of the food quantity from the 25 mg to 45 mg i e 80 is larger than the increased percentage of the food value from the 15 mg to 25 mg i e 60 the maturity size gained between the 25 mg and 45 mg food amount does not differ significantly after attaining the maximum growth velocity in the 45 mg food amount there remains more than a sufficient amount of food in the system resulting the artemia under 45 mg food level experience satiation in the feeding process which is also known as the predator satiation in the field of ecology gentleman and neuheimer 2008 so the maturity size of artemia sp for the 45 mg food level is at par with that of the 25 mg food quantities thus from both the economic point of view and the ecological point of view 25 mg amount of chaetoceros sp would be the optimum food level for the sustainability of the artemia sp in any laboratory based environment 4 discussions identification of the most favorable food quantity for the maximum size gained by artemia sp would be in the right direction if the theoretical results are justified with proper biological events from the experimental observations we all know that the formation of the reproductive pairs in artemia is one of the vital signatures indicating species maturity so here we include the relation between the numbers of the reproductive pair formation and the maturity size gained by artemia under varying food amounts into the elaborate discussions the data 2 2 shows that the 10 mg population has not formed any reproductive pair until the last day of the experiment the matter of the 10 mg population can be explained as a case of insufficiency of the food supply that has not supported the high yield of the maximum size bodyweight gained as well as the reproductive efficiency by the artemia population within the experimental time frame on the other hand even the 15 mg population has formed a reproductive pair on the last day of the experiment still the maturity size gained by the artemia population is restricted at a lower level in comparison to the rest of the two other high food quantity 25 mg and 45 mg setups because of the moderate amount of food supply to the system by the 15 mg quantity may bring stress to the artemia and thus the population tries to reach their stability or maturity very fast however the moderate amount of food source can support the fast growth of the species only up to a specific limit and after that the individuals growths get retarded as a result despite reaching the s s i t significantly faster than the others they show late and less reproductive maturity than the 25 and 45 mg food setups on the contrary each of the population from 25 mg and 45 mg food setups develop three reproductive pairs separately throughout the entire span of the experiment the reason should be due to the sufficient amount of foods to the systems that are favorable for achieving both the maximum asymptote size and reproductive maturity by the species however hypothesis testing studies already prove that no significant benefit occurs in the gaining of the maximum size even after increasing the food amount from 25 mg to 45 mg for 30 artemia sp moreover it would be just a wastage of food nutrients time and money if we apply the 45 mg food chaetoceros sp for 30 individuals of artemia sp thus despite having more than a sufficient amount of food in the 45 mg setup is not advantageous for the hatcheries in identifying the maximum maturity size causing economically beneficiary protocol for the artemia production instead using a sufficient amount of food i e 25 mg is enough for yielding both the maximum maturity size and reproductive maturation by the artemia sp under specific laboratory conditions however the simulation study through the interpolation method reveals that for an intermediate concentration value i e ζ 16 45 the igr is maximized with the magnitude 0 8481400 for this intermediate concentration the size at the maturity is 0 4959847 the relative increase of the size at maturity to the size at food quantity 15 mg is 4 which is much below compared to the relative size increase 27 for the food amount 25 mg if the relative increase of size between 25 mg and 45 mg food quantity is compared it is only 3 that means beyond the food level 25 mg since the maturity size does not significantly change due to the limitation of species maximum growth capacity hence it is reasonable to choose the food quantity 25 mg as one of the most favorable food concentration for the healthy growth of artemia sp however the rigorous experiment is necessary to narrow down the value of the most favorable food amount which should appear between the 16 45 mg and 25 mg nevertheless there should be a trade off to optimize the food concentration and the size at the maturity based on the laboratory experiment s several iterations moreover it is mandatory to mention here that although this laboratory experimentation is done with thirty 30 individuals of artemia sp for the sake of the minimum number of experimental sample handling the experiment can be generalized for any number of individuals for both experimental and theoretical approaches the growth profiles will be similar for other numbers of individuals and food concentrations except for the scalar multiplier of the maturation values therefore depending upon the species strains numbers of the experimented individuals and growth influential environmental conditions etc the hatcheries or the researchers of this domain can standardize their best yielding culture protocol with the help of minor laboratory iterations only in general the present experimental study with the theoretical and simulated design can give us a well defined clue for the experimental scientists to optimize the optimum food concentration for artemia sp which would be ultimately helpful for the industry and management 5 conclusion summing up and comparing all the results drawn by the experimental observations reproductive maturation data statistical and mathematical analysis of the experimented data we can conclude that the optimal range of the chaetoceros sp quantity lies in between the 15 mg to 25 mg for the attainment of the maximum growth of artemia sp under specific laboratory conditions moreover we can also infer that 25 mg quantity of chaetoceros sp can be set and standardized as the highest growth yielding food quantity for artemia sp under specific laboratory conditions with many theoretical results the entire study can open up new avenues for optimizing other related species food concentrations which are

24597,as an important ecological factor shaping terrestrial ecosystem states and destabilizing coastal forest ecosystems typhoon events have become the focus of attention in recent years however there are limited studies on the change of carbon storage dynamics of subtropical forest ecosystems under typhoon disturbance here we developed a theoretical ecosystem carbon cycle model combined with forest inventory data and measurements to evaluate pluriannual typhoon response of east monsoon subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics in tiantong mountain 29 48 n 121 47 e we focused on the relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics and forest resistance and resilience to typhoon disturbances we showed that the disturbed plant biomass contributed to the reduced forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity the modeling analyses underscored the critical role of biomass turnover time in forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity the soil organic matter was highly stable under severe typhoons while the resistance of biomass and litter carbon amounts to increasingly severe typhoons decreased the theoretical estimates provided by this study are instructive for the policy making of subtropical forest conservation and management under global environmental changes keywords carbon dynamics climate change extreme events forest equilibrium state 1 introduction forests act as a large carbon sink to take in 33 of the anthropogenic co2 emissions pan et al 2011 and account for about 45 of the land carbon sink bonan 2008 tropical and subtropical forests contribute to about 70 of the global forest carbon sink pan et al 2011 suarez et al 2019 subtropical forests are largely located in the east asian monsoon region and the eddy covariance observations suggest the total net ecosystem productivity nep of this region accounts for 8 of global forest nep yu et al 2014 the east asian monsoon subtropical forests under increasing atmospheric nitrogen n deposition are expected to be a large carbon sink cui et al 2019 qiao et al 2020 therefore understanding the carbon storage dynamics of east asian monsoon subtropical forests is crucial for land atmosphere carbon exchange predictions and climate mitigation in the future forests with large biomass carbon stocks are vulnerable to the impact of strong winds such as typhoons reichstein et al 2013 large defoliations branch stripping and even uprooting are the most common effects of typhoon on the forest ecosystem lin et al 2010 in the east asian monsoon subtropical regions forest structure and function of the coastal region have been threatened by typhoons in the past decades increasingly intensified landfalling typhoons have struck the forests of subtropical coastal region marois and mitsch 2015 for example typhoon has dominated temporal fluctuations of litterfall mass in a subtropical forest in a 21 years field measurement lin et al 2017 the magnitudes of nep responses to typhoons are greatly affected due to the defoliation resulted from strong wind and intensive rainfall chen et al 2014 typhoon induced foliation losses can decline forest aboveground biomass lin et al 2017 biomass turnover time a proxy of tree longevity at ecosystem level plays a crucial role in plant growth dynamics and contributes to the feedback between the carbon cycle and climate erb et al 2016 it measures how fast carbon will be released from biomass pool and is critical in regulating the carbon storage capacity wang et al 2021 as a key variable property of ecosystem biomass turnover time plays an important role in linking key processes in carbon cycle of forests malhi 2012 and varies with precipitation fire and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances carvalhais et al 2014 given the large carbon uptake by subtropical forests how the internal ecosystem properties and typhoon characteristics jointly affect the forest carbon storage dynamics remain unclear there are growing concerns and studies about the intensifying forest disturbance regimes which pose a great risk to forest ecosystem services due to the disturbed forest carbon storage metsaranta et al 2010 seidl et al 2014 2018 here we estimate the long term typhoon impacts on subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics by modeling ecosystem properties and typhoon characteristics the ecosystem is represented by a three pool carbon cycle model weng et al 2012 and the typhoon disturbance regime is characterized by the average severity and frequency the responses of ecosystem function to typhoon disturbance have been generally described by resistance and resilience chang et al 2018 these two components consider concurrent and delayed effects of disturbances on ecosystem huang and xia 2019 resistance quantifies the capacity to maintain its original level during the disturbance and resilience describes the rate of ecosystem function recovering to its normal state after disturbance the tiantong forest site is located in the subtropical coastal region and is frequently struck by typhoons table 1 using the 4 year 2012 2015 litterfall measurements and forest inventory data at the tiantong site we adopt an ecosystem carbon cycle model to represent the ecosystem carbon processes and a typhoon disturbance regime to characterize the typhoon severity and frequency thus the derived analytical solution from the integration of the typhoon processes with the ecosystem carbon dynamics pattern is to examine the typhoon effect on the ecosystem carbon storage dynamics with the field measurements and simulation experiments at the tiantong subtropical forest site this study aims to explore the following three issues a relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics b role of biomass turnover time in typhoon disturbance affecting the ecosystem carbon storage capacity and c resistance and resilience of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics to typhoon disturbances under various severity scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 site description tiantong mountain 29 48 n 121 47 e is located in low hilly areas in the most eastern central subtropical zone of zhejiang province in china with much forest vegetation well preserved the average annual temperature and annual mean precipitation is 16 2 c and 1374 7 mm respectively qiao et al 2020 the elevation of this site is approximately 300 m ranging from 304 3 to 602 9 m the tiantong forest site is about 12 15 km away from the east coastline of china and is frequently affected by typhoons table 1 thus it is an ideal place for evaluating the effect of typhoons on the dynamics of evergreen broadleaf forests ebfs the dominant species are castanopsis fargesii schima superba cyclobalanopsis sessilifolia eurya loquaiana and litsea elongata subjected to the humid and warm climate the frequent typhoon disturbance is a great concern for ecosystem dynamics especially for litterfall fallen leaves and twigs dynamics sato et al 2010 and nutrient cycling responses to typhoons wang et al 2015 xu et al 2004 2 2 empirical results from field study experiment 2 2 1 forest inventory the inventory was conducted in a 20 ha permanent plot of the tiantong mountain fig s1 every five years this plot is a rectangle with 500 m long from east to west and 400 m wide from south to north one of the components of the forest global earth observatory forestgeo network https forestgeo si edu it is composed of 500 quadrats each 20 m 20 m in size by setting stone piles at every 20 m which were further divided into 16 subplots of 5 m 5 m qiao et al 2020 two inventories of these subplots have been conducted in 2010 and 2015 respectively all woody plants with diameter 1 cm at breast height dbh were numbered and dbh measured as well as the species identification and coordinates recorded for the inventory in 2010 154 species were recorded mean dbh of each species ranged from 1 00 to 44 64 cm the inventory conducted in 2015 recorded 159 species and the mean dbh ranged from 1 24 to 43 74 cm detailed dbh measurements for each species of the two inventories can be found in table s1 2 2 2 litterfall collection to monitor the temporal dynamics of litterfall 187 collectors were uniformly placed in the 20 ha plot fig s2 in august 2011 each with an average height of 0 6 m and a valid collection area of 0 5 m 2 fig s3 here we employed the litterfall measurements collected every half a month from january 2012 to december 2015 the litterfall collected was classified according to leaves branches flowers barks seed appendages and woody debris after drying at 65 c in the oven for more than 48 h to a constant weight all the weight of components from litterfall was recorded 2 2 3 soil heterotrophic respiration measurement heterotrophic respiration of soil was measured with trench method as described by zhou et al zhou et al 2007 to be specific three 0 65 m 0 65 m quadrats were randomly set up in each subplot a trench was dug at a depth of 0 8 m at which depth there was little fine root distribution the 2 5 mm thick pvc plates clung to the wall of the trench to allow water to flow each plate had 120 evenly distributed 5 mm diameter holes and was covered with a 400 mesh nylon net to prevent the external roots from growing in the quadrat to minimize the disturbance of trenching the trench was refilled according to the original soil profile the heterotrophic respiration was measured once or twice a month between 9 00 am and 14 00 pm using an li 8100 portable soil co2 flux system attached to the soil co2 flux chamber li cor inc lincoln ne usa 2 3 parameter estimation from field data we used the empirical results from the field experiments to estimate parameter values used in this study see the summary in table 2 we estimated the aboveground biomass agb by a general and well validated biomass allometric model pilli et al 2006 1 m a d b where m is the agb of an individual tree d is the diameter at breast height dbh parameter a 0 3 ρ where ρ is wood density parameter b 2 5 were adopted from pilli et al 2006 to estimate the total biomass of a standing tree we used the ratio of agb to belowground biomass bgb of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests 4 39 this number was calculated based on the forest data from 984 sites across china li and ren 2004 each litterfall collector was placed in the center with a radius of 30 m and the area of each plot that maximized the amount of valid litterfall is 900 π m 2 the annual total dry weight of litterfall a t d w leaves and branches included of each collector was counted from the year 2012 to 2015 based on the above data the following parameters were obtained net primary productivity npp of plot i was estimated by the following equation 2 n p p a b o v e g r o u n d i a g b 2015 i a g b 2010 i 5 where a g b 2010 i a g b 2015 i were the aboveground biomass of the first and second inventory of plot i in 2010 and 2015 respectively for evergreen broadleaf forests the partitioning coefficients of npp on leaf root and wood are 0 249 0 551 and 0 200 respectively xia et al 2013 thus c influx of plot i was 3 u i n p p i n p p a b o v e g r o u n d i 0 449 consequently the forest c input u was estimated as 4 u i u i s i 187 0 711 k g c m 2 yea r 1 where s i is the area of plot i we used the ratio of c stock divided by c flux as the approximation of turnover times zhou and luo 2008 that is for each plot i 5 τ 1 i b i o m a s s 2015 i n p p i where b i o m a s s 2015 i is the c stock of plot i in 2015 inventory according to the measurement data from tiantong plot the biomass of surface litter slb was 2 589 kg m 2 together with the agb of the coarse wood debris cwd that obtained for each plot then τ 2 i s l b 900 π a g b c w d i a t d w i where τ 2 i is the turnover time of litterfall in each plot i the total surface litter from litterfall collectors e g leaves and fine root in each plot s l b 900 π and the aboveground biomass of coarse wood debris a g b c w d i were the c stock of litter pool the c flux of litter pool was the recorded average annual total dry weight of litterfall in each plot a t d w i then the parameter τ 1 and τ 2 were estimated as 6 τ 1 i τ 1 i 187 35 year 7 τ 2 i τ 2 i 187 7 1 year the turnover time τ 3 was calculated as the soil carbon inventory divided by the c outflux of the reservoir the heterotrophic respiration rate of the soil of the tiantong plot was about 476 8 g c m 2 yea r 1 and the content of soil organic carbon was about 13 000 g m 2 so τ 3 27 3 year η is the c transfer coefficient from litter to som and set as 0 25 here hamilton et al 2002 weng et al 2012 2 4 model description in this section a three pool ecosystem carbon c cycle model including the stand biomass litter and soil carbon pool was adopted to represent the forest ecosystem c cycle fig 1 and this scheme has been also used in modeling disturbance effects on ecosystem c dynamics by weng et al 2012 in this model u stands for the c input that is the net primary productivity npp mainly supporting for the plant biomass growth x 1 is the amount of c in the biomass pool with a c turnover time τ 1 x 2 and x 3 are the c content of the litter pool and soil organic matter som with the c turnover time of τ 2 and τ 3 respectively weng et al 2012 litter pool is consisted of the dead plant and litterfalls part of which is released to the atmosphere by heterotrophic respiration and part of which is stabilized to become som som would be broken down slowly by microbial respiration released into air as co2 typhoon or other wind storms affect forest ecosystem c storage dynamics by the intensification of litterfall leading to an increasing size of litter c pools the fraction of c content transferred from living biomass pools to litter pools largely depend on the wind severity here we introduce how typhoon disturbances are modeled and how the forest ecosystem c storage dynamic process responds to typhoons according to previous studies about the disturbance characteristics smithwick et al 2006 we assume typhoon disturbance are poisson events and thus the typhoon regime is defined as the mean typhoon return interval λ a parameter of poisson distribution the mean severity of typhoon effects on forest biomass s low moderate or high levels of removal of carbon from biomass pool and the probability density function of s the probability of a typhoon happened in a given year is thus defined as p t y p h o o n 1 λ and the distribution of intervals between two consequential typhoons is 8 f t λ 1 λ exp t λ where t is the interval between two consecutive typhoon disturbance events the severity defined as the fraction of biomass removed by typhoons ranges from 0 to1 from the first principles for typhoon s is normally much lower than 1 following the mathematical derivations in weng et al 2012 the expectation of plant biomass x 1 in a disturbance regime which is defined by λ and s is 9 x 1 u τ 1 λ λ s τ 1 with the assumption of constant carbon input u and turnover rate τ1 which define a recovery pattern as u τ 1 1 exp t τ 1 the carbon content that was reduced from the biomass c pool due to typhoon disturbance was delivered to the litter pool at the same time the default turnover rate of the biomass pool was 1 τ 1 at equilibrium state the total litter input equals npp so the major impact of typhoon on ecosystem c cycling was that it moved c from the biomass pool to the litter pool the c storage of litter pool equals the product of c input and turnover time of litter pool 10 x 2 u τ 2 and the expectation of soil pool c is x 3 η u τ 3 where η is the transfer ratio from litters to som thus the c storage capacity of forest ecosystem represented by the conceptual model fig 1 at equilibrium state can be written as 11 x u τ 1 λ λ s τ 1 u τ 2 η u τ 3 considering the characteristics of typhoon we defined a typhoon disturbance index which was the portion of c amounts in biomass removed by typhoon per unit time denoted as σ s λ where s stands for the mean fraction of biomass removed by typhoons the ecosystem carbon storage capacity csc same as defined by luo et al 2017 is the production of c input and the turnover time that is 12 csc npp turnover time the carbon storage capacity represents the maximum amount of carbon that an ecosystem can store under given environmental conditions for the specific year here it is used as an index to evaluate the capability of carbon sink for the subtropical forest ecosystem 2 5 forest resistance and resilience indicators to clarify how shifts in typhoon disturbance will affect subtropical forest functions the resistance and resilience as two indices were used to quantify the effects of typhoon on forest ecosystems huang and xia 2019 the resistance measures how stable a forest is to keep the c content during typhoon periods while resilience describes the ability of forest to recover from the last typhoon de keersmaecker et al 2015 van ruijven and berendse 2010 here we used the definition of resistance and resilience from isbell et al 2015 the two indices were calculated as follows 13 resistance x n x t x n 14 resilience x t x n x t 1 x n where x n x t and x t 1 represent the average carbon amounts during normal years that excluded typhoon years the c content in the year that typhoon happened and that of the next year after a typhoon disturbance respectively these two indices are directly comparable for different c pools because they are unitless 2 6 typhoons scenarios setting we designed three typhoon scenarios varying at severity levels and frequency we used s1 s2 and s3 to represent three typhoon severities of 30 60 and 90 of which the forest has been damaged respectively mean typhoon return interval ranged from 0 to 120 years these scenarios were implemented into the modeling approach to assess potential impacts of typhoon over long period of times 500 years on ecosystem carbon fluxes carbon storage capacity resilience and resistance of forest ecosystem 3 results 3 1 relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics our simulations showed the different reductions of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics in response to enhanced typhoon disturbances indicated by three severity scenarios fig 2 the losses of biomass pool and ecosystem carbon storage capacity csc were reinforced with the increasing typhoon severities fig 2a d and c amounts of the litter and som pool showed a quick and slight increase during the typhoon disturbances respectively fig 2b c during the 500 year simulation the mean annual biomass pool for the s1 scenario was higher 19 52 kg c m 2 than the s2 scenario 16 39 kg c m 2 and s3 scenario 14 02 kg c m 2 for the som pool it ranged from 2 73 kg c m 2 s3 to 3 68 kg c m 2 s1 the severer typhoon disturbance caused a decrease by 26 9 in the ecosystem csc when the typhoon severity varied from s1 severity 0 3 to s3 severity 0 9 litter pool of the s3 scenario 3 13 kg c m 2 exhibited lower than the moderate typhoon scenarios in the 500 year simulation typhoon return intervals during the simulation were randomly set and in our result typhoon disturbance occurred 12 times fig 2a although the litter pool for s3 scenario showed the largest increase during the 12 typhoon events the annual mean litter pool for s3 scenario was lower than s1 3 98 kg c m 2 and s2 3 46 kg c m 2 scenarios compared with the annual mean pool size the som pool during the typhoon events showed a minor decrease by 6 for s1 scenario 6 1 for s2 scenario and 7 for s3 scenario respectively in general it is the frequency instead of severity that explains most of the variability in the different scenario tests fig 3 the shorter the interval between typhoons the higher the frequency of typhoons in a range of severity increasing typhoon frequency leaded to rapid changes in ecosystem csc for a certain frequency the varied typhoon severities had similar effects on ecosystem csc that is the severer the typhoon the less csc the ecosystem had shorter typhoon return interval impacted the recovery of the carbon storage after typhoon disturbances 40 years and led to a decrease of ecosystem csc fig 3 the ecosystem carbon storage dynamics for each severity scenario showed similar recovery pattern under the various typhoon return intervals fig 2 the forest ecosystem could store more carbon under longer typhoon return intervals and less severe typhoons fig 3 3 2 typhoon induced variations of biomass turnover time and ecosystem carbon storage capacity forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics modeled with a typhoon disturbance regime is determined by ecosystem properties biomass turnover time affected by typhoon on the one hand and by typhoon characteristics severity and frequency on the other hand the disturbance index was defined to describe the fraction of biomass carbon removed by typhoon per unit of time thus this modeling approach evaluated the carbon storage at dynamic equilibrium states can be viewed as a function of ecosystem internal properties and typhoon characteristics the biomass turnover time was affected directly by the typhoon induced defoliation and we calculated the effects of typhoon disturbance ratio of severity to interval and biomass turnover time on forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity fig 4 with moderate typhoon disturbance σ 0 1 0 01 the increasing biomass turnover time i e less defoliation and slower carbon cycling rate accelerated the ecosystem csc fig 4 fig 4 showed that the sensitivity of ecosystem carbon storage to typhoon was determined by the biomass turnover time affected by typhoons both internal ecosystem properties and disturbance characteristics contributed to the response of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity to typhoons 3 3 modeled forest resistance and resilience to typhoon disturbances the simulated typhoon resistance of biomass pool litter pool and ecosystem csc varied with severities and the typhoon resistance of som pool showed no significant variations under increasingly severe typhoons fig 5 a typhoon resistance of biomass pool and litter pool was the most sensitive to the variations of typhoon severity with the increasing typhoon severities resistance of biomass pool was significantly reduced from 4 09 1 9 for s1 scenario to 1 14 0 04 for s3 scenario p 0 001 and the resistance of litter pool peaked at 2 81 0 48 s1 scenario followed by 1 06 0 35 s2 scenario and lastly by 0 46 0 16 s3 scenario the typhoon resistance of ecosystem csc showed statistical differences between the s1 scenario and s3 scenario p 0 05 our resilience simulations also revealed that the typhoon resilience of biomass pool litter pool som pool and ecosystem csc did not show significant differences among the severity scenarios fig 5b this implied that resilience of the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics is insensitive to the variations of typhoon severities 4 discussion 4 1 changes in biomass turnover time and ecosystem carbon storage capacity with varied typhoon regimes biomass turnover time as a key parameter to determine carbon storage in forest ecosystems is sensitive to precipitation natural and anthropogenic disturbances and management activities carvalhais et al 2014 erb et al 2016 changes in biomass turnover time and typhoon regime contribute to the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics under typhoon disturbance typhoon induced defoliation and biomass losses could accelerate the rate of carbon turnover in the ecosystem carbon cycling and finally lower the mean time that carbon atoms reside in the ecosystem xia et al 2013 part of the biomass losses are transformed to litterfall and coarse woody debris and cause co2 emission to the atmosphere by the microbial activities luo et al 2017 xia et al 2013 the reduced biomass turnover time caused by defoliation and branch fall thus influences the ecosystem carbon storage capacity fig 4 attentions should be paid to the role of ecosystem properties in response to typhoon 4 2 stabilization mechanism of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics under typhoon disturbances typhoon disturbance plays an important role in shaping the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics of coastal regions the result of typhoon resilience suggests that the subtropical forests are high resilient to the typhoon disturbance subtropical forests are capable of recovering from regular typhoon disturbance in one year lin et al 2017 biomass and litter pools are more likely to be disturbed by typhoon explained by defoliated litters and tree mortality lin et al 2020 furthermore evidences showed that wind disturbance was the dominant cause of the observed increase of large trees mortality in this subtropical monsoon evergreen forest lu et al 2021 thus typhoons do play a critical role in forest carbon dynamics in the subtropical forest of china s coastal region while the som pool shows a high stability to typhoon disturbance fig 5 wind and rain are two typical forces for typhoon we do not connect the impacts of typhoons to the view of hydrology geomorphology and biogeochemistry in this study for example rainfall effect on soil respiration and carbon stored in the soil ryan and law 2005 these complex interactions and processes are beneficial to the understanding of forest recovery from typhoon regime 4 3 robustness of the model performance the robustness analyses show the uncertainties caused by the assumptions of the constant carbon input over time we showed the npp dynamics at constant npp and that at variable npp fig 6 a generated based on a realistic npp pattern weng et al 2012 we also tested the biases for two typhoon scenarios with slight and moderate severity levels fig 6b d the ratios of the simulated carbon content of the biomass litter and som pool at two npp patterns were closely equaling to 1 the som pool performed the best robust at two npp patterns with the ratio less than 1 002 for the scenario of s1 the recovery pattern of all three carbon pools were identical at two npp patterns thus the uncertainties resulted from constant npp were small over long period of times in the case of a mild or moderate typhoon severity which close to the actual situation 4 4 model limitation and uncertainty there are uncertainties in modeling the overall impacts of typhoons on forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics limited typhoon information may not be able to fully represent the long term characteristics of typhoons although typhoon data are collected to match the field experimental data in this study so the results may vary with the severity and frequency of future typhoons sensitive to climate changes the post typhoon field surveys are needed to evaluate the modeling typhoon effects it is cautious that although the model predicts the forest carbon storage at the dynamic equilibrium states the modeling results are constrained from the data input more details of ecosystem processes at the local scale are necessary to improve the model performance the assumption we used in the model like the constant mineralization rate for the litter and som following first order decay functions would cause uncertainties due to the model structure xia et al 2013 however due to the stable soil organic matter and the lag effects to climate changes over long time scales schmidt et al 2011 trumbore 1997 this assumption can be viewed as an approximation in modeling approach although we have shown the model performance is robust with slight and moderate severity levels fig 6 attention must be paid to the uncertainty caused by the constant npp assumption in the case of extremely strong typhoons with typhoon severity up to 90 most of the ratios of simulated carbon storage at constant npp to that at variable npp were off and above 1 fig 7 in biomass pool the maximum deviation is up to 3 76 times fig 7a and 1 83 in litter pool fig 7b however it is noted that the som pool remained the best robust performance with the maximum ratio less than 1 015 notably at 90 severity fig 7c 4 5 implications this study is an attempt to analyze the typhoon disturbance in influencing the forest ecosystem carbon storage by modeling experiments long term ground measurements are strongly needed in the future to further investigate the potential mechanisms for the post typhoon recovery of forest ecosystem function forest disturbance regimes have been changing profoundly in recent years with climate being a prominent driver of disturbance change seidl et al 2014 typhoon whose frequency is to be increasing is a common disturbance in subtropical forests lin et al 2017 modeling of typhoon disturbance effects on ecosystem carbon storage dynamic is insightful for understanding the role of subtropical forests of china s coastal region in global carbon cycle on the one hand because the subtropical forest ecosystems in the east asian monsoon region provide a large net carbon sink and figure prominently in the global carbon budget yu et al 2014 the knowledge of typhoon effects on evergreen broadleaf forests ebfs is improved through this study thus the instruction of conservations for subtropical forests on the other hand the typhoon regime study helps to improve the understanding of the link between forest carbon storage dynamics and disturbances under climate change and to provide reference for future forest development analysis in most earth system models esms e g the community land model 5 0 clm5 0 have comprehensive and explicit representations of the key biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes and disturbance regimes like fire however few esms have detailed processes of wind effects on terrestrial carbon cycle as an independent module which implies the demand to establish a theoretical model to understand the carbon storage capacity of forests under typhoon disturbance this work provides a perspective to understand the carbon storage capacity by models thus the results acquired from this model can be used as an estimation tool for large scale inversion and model initialization 5 conclusions in summary this study investigates an important topic in global change ecology as typhoon frequency is to be increasing with climate change leading to uncertain impacts on the forest carbon cycling in south east asia a region with significant carbon stocks this study simulates typhoon response of subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics based on an original experimental design and a conceptual ecosystem carbon cycle model considering the typhoon disturbance regime the results show both the internal ecosystem properties and disturbance regime contributed to the response of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity to typhoons furthermore typhoons influence the resistance of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity primarily through biomass and litter carbon amounts whereas soil organic matter remains a high stability under typhoon disturbance over long period of times although the increasing severe typhoon disturbance threatens the structure and function of east asian monsoon subtropical forests in the coastal regions limiting the prediction in land atmosphere carbon exchange and forest management for forest conservation the results show the subtropical forests could be able to recover from regular typhoon disturbances even if typhoon frequency is to be increasing with climate change credit author statement jiaye ping conceptualization methodology investigation data curation visualization writing original draft jian zhou

24597,as an important ecological factor shaping terrestrial ecosystem states and destabilizing coastal forest ecosystems typhoon events have become the focus of attention in recent years however there are limited studies on the change of carbon storage dynamics of subtropical forest ecosystems under typhoon disturbance here we developed a theoretical ecosystem carbon cycle model combined with forest inventory data and measurements to evaluate pluriannual typhoon response of east monsoon subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics in tiantong mountain 29 48 n 121 47 e we focused on the relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics and forest resistance and resilience to typhoon disturbances we showed that the disturbed plant biomass contributed to the reduced forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity the modeling analyses underscored the critical role of biomass turnover time in forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity the soil organic matter was highly stable under severe typhoons while the resistance of biomass and litter carbon amounts to increasingly severe typhoons decreased the theoretical estimates provided by this study are

introduction forests act as a large carbon sink to take in 33 of the anthropogenic co2 emissions pan et al 2011 and account for about 45 of the land carbon sink bonan 2008 tropical and subtropical

land atmosphere carbon exchange predictions and climate mitigation in the future forests with large biomass carbon stocks are vulnerable to the impact of strong winds such as typhoons reichstein et al 2013 large defoliations branch stripping and even uprooting are the most common effects of typhoon on the forest ecosystem lin et al 2010 in the east asian monsoon subtropical regions forest structure and function of the coastal region have been threatened by typhoons in the past decades increasingly intensified landfalling typhoons have struck the forests of subtropical coastal region marois and mitsch 2015 for example typhoon has dominated temporal fluctuations of litterfall mass in a subtropical forest in a 21 years field measurement lin et al 2017 the magnitudes of nep responses to typhoons are greatly affected due to the defoliation resulted from strong wind and intensive rainfall chen et al 2014 typhoon induced foliation losses can decline forest aboveground biomass lin et al 2017 biomass turnover time a proxy of tree longevity at ecosystem level plays a crucial role in plant growth dynamics and contributes to the feedback between the carbon cycle and climate erb et al 2016 it measures how fast carbon will be released from biomass pool and is critical in regulating the carbon storage capacity wang et al 2021 as a key variable property of ecosystem biomass turnover time plays an important role in linking key processes in carbon cycle of forests malhi 2012 and varies with precipitation fire and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances carvalhais et al 2014 given the large carbon uptake by subtropical forests how the internal ecosystem properties and typhoon characteristics jointly affect the forest carbon storage dynamics remain unclear there are growing concerns and studies about the intensifying forest disturbance regimes which pose a great risk to forest ecosystem services due to the disturbed forest carbon storage metsaranta et al 2010 seidl et al 2014 2018 here we estimate the long term typhoon impacts on subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics by modeling ecosystem properties and typhoon characteristics the ecosystem is represented by a three pool carbon cycle model weng et al 2012 and the typhoon disturbance regime is characterized by the average severity and frequency the responses of ecosystem function to typhoon disturbance have been generally described by resistance and resilience chang et al 2018 these two components consider concurrent and delayed effects of disturbances on ecosystem huang and xia 2019 resistance quantifies the capacity to maintain its original level during the disturbance and resilience describes the rate of ecosystem function recovering to its normal state after disturbance the tiantong forest site is located in the subtropical coastal region and is frequently struck by typhoons table 1 using the 4 year 2012 2015 litterfall measurements and forest inventory data at the tiantong site we adopt an ecosystem carbon cycle model to represent the ecosystem carbon processes and a typhoon disturbance regime to characterize the typhoon severity and frequency thus the derived analytical solution from the integration of the typhoon processes with the ecosystem carbon dynamics pattern is to examine the typhoon effect on the ecosystem carbon storage dynamics with the field measurements and simulation experiments at the tiantong subtropical forest site this study aims to explore the following three issues a relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics b role of biomass turnover time in typhoon disturbance affecting the ecosystem carbon storage capacity and c resistance and resilience of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics to typhoon disturbances under various severity scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 site description tiantong mountain 29 48 n 121 47 e is located in low hilly areas in the most eastern central subtropical zone of zhejiang province in china with much forest vegetation well preserved the average annual temperature and annual mean precipitation is 16 2 c and 1374 7 mm respectively qiao et al 2020 the elevation of this site is approximately 300 m ranging from 304 3 to 602 9 m the tiantong forest site is about 12 15 km away from the east coastline of china and is frequently affected by typhoons table 1 thus it is an ideal place for evaluating the effect of typhoons on the dynamics of evergreen broadleaf forests ebfs the dominant species are castanopsis fargesii schima superba cyclobalanopsis sessilifolia eurya loquaiana and litsea elongata subjected to the humid and warm climate the frequent typhoon disturbance is a great concern for ecosystem dynamics especially for litterfall fallen leaves and twigs dynamics sato et al 2010 and nutrient cycling responses to typhoons wang et al 2015 xu et al 2004 2 2 empirical results from field study experiment 2 2 1 forest inventory the inventory was conducted in a 20 ha permanent plot of the tiantong mountain fig s1 every five years this plot is a rectangle with 500 m long from east to west and 400 m wide from south to north one of the components of the forest global earth observatory forestgeo network https forestgeo si edu it is composed of 500 quadrats each 20 m 20 m in size by setting stone piles at every 20 m which were further divided into 16 subplots of 5 m 5 m qiao et al 2020 two inventories of these subplots have been conducted in 2010 and 2015 respectively all woody plants with diameter 1 cm at breast height dbh were numbered and dbh measured as well as the species identification and coordinates recorded for the inventory in 2010 154 species were recorded mean dbh of each species ranged from 1 00 to 44 64 cm the inventory conducted in 2015 recorded 159 species and the mean dbh ranged from 1 24 to 43 74 cm detailed dbh measurements for each species of the two inventories can be found in table s1 2 2 2 litterfall collection to monitor the temporal dynamics of litterfall 187 collectors were uniformly placed in the 20 ha plot fig s2 in august 2011 each with an average height of 0 6 m and a valid collection area of 0 5 m 2 fig s3 here we employed the litterfall measurements collected every half a month from january 2012 to december 2015 the litterfall collected was classified according to leaves branches flowers barks seed appendages and woody debris after drying at 65 c in the oven for more than 48 h to a constant weight all the weight of components from litterfall was recorded 2 2 3 soil heterotrophic respiration measurement heterotrophic respiration of soil was measured with trench method as described by zhou et al zhou et al 2007 to be specific three 0 65 m 0 65 m quadrats were randomly set up in each subplot a trench was dug at a depth of 0 8 m at which depth there was little fine root distribution the 2 5 mm thick pvc plates clung to the wall of the trench to allow water to flow each plate had 120 evenly distributed 5 mm diameter holes and was covered with a 400 mesh nylon net to prevent the external roots from growing in the quadrat to minimize the disturbance of trenching the trench was refilled according to the original soil profile the heterotrophic respiration was measured once or twice a month between 9 00 am and 14 00 pm using an li 8100 portable soil co2 flux system attached to the soil co2 flux chamber li cor inc lincoln ne usa 2 3 parameter estimation from field data we used the empirical results from the field experiments to estimate parameter values used in this study see the summary in table 2 we estimated the aboveground biomass agb by a general and well validated biomass allometric model pilli et al 2006 1 m a d b where m is the agb of an individual tree d is the diameter at breast height dbh parameter a 0 3 ρ where ρ is wood density parameter b 2 5 were adopted from pilli et al 2006 to estimate the total biomass of a standing tree we used the ratio of agb to belowground biomass bgb of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests 4 39 this number was calculated based on the forest data from 984 sites across china li and ren 2004 each litterfall collector was placed in the center with a radius of 30 m and the area of each plot that maximized the amount of valid litterfall is 900 π m 2 the annual total dry weight of litterfall a t d w leaves and branches included of each collector was counted from the year 2012 to 2015 based on the above data the following parameters were obtained net primary productivity npp of plot i was estimated by the following equation 2 n p p a b o v e g r o u n d i a g b 2015 i a g b 2010 i 5 where a g b 2010 i a g b 2015 i were the aboveground biomass of the first and second inventory of plot i in 2010 and 2015 respectively for evergreen broadleaf forests the partitioning coefficients of npp on leaf root and wood are 0 249 0 551 and 0 200 respectively xia et al 2013 thus c influx of plot i was 3 u i n p p i n p p a b o v e g r o u n d i 0 449 consequently the forest c input u was estimated as 4 u i u i s i 187 0 711 k g c m 2 yea r 1 where s i is the area of plot i we used the ratio of c stock divided by c flux as the approximation of turnover times zhou and luo 2008 that is for each plot i 5 τ 1 i b i o m a s s 2015 i n p p i where b i o m a s s 2015 i is the c stock of plot i in 2015 inventory according to the measurement data from tiantong plot the biomass of surface litter slb was 2 589 kg m 2 together with the agb of the coarse wood debris cwd that obtained for each plot then τ 2 i s l b 900 π a g b c w d i a t d w i where τ 2 i is the turnover time of litterfall in each plot i the total surface litter from litterfall collectors e g leaves and fine root in each plot s l b 900 π and the aboveground biomass of coarse wood debris a g b c w d i were the c stock of litter pool the c flux of litter pool was the recorded average annual total dry weight of litterfall in each plot a t d w i then the parameter τ 1 and τ 2 were estimated as 6 τ 1 i τ 1 i 187 35 year 7 τ 2 i τ 2 i 187 7 1 year the turnover time τ 3 was calculated as the soil carbon inventory divided by the c outflux of the reservoir the heterotrophic respiration rate of the soil of the tiantong plot was about 476 8 g c m 2 yea r 1 and the content of soil organic carbon was about 13 000 g m 2 so τ 3 27 3 year η is the c transfer coefficient from litter to som and set as 0 25 here hamilton et al 2002 weng et al 2012 2 4 model description in this section a three pool ecosystem carbon c cycle model including the stand biomass litter and soil carbon pool was adopted to represent the forest ecosystem c cycle fig 1 and this scheme has been also used in modeling disturbance effects on ecosystem c dynamics by weng et al 2012 in this model u stands for the c input that is the net primary productivity npp mainly supporting for the plant biomass growth x 1 is the amount of c in the biomass pool with a c turnover time τ 1 x 2 and x 3 are the c content of the litter pool and soil organic matter som with the c turnover time of τ 2 and τ 3 respectively weng et al 2012 litter pool is consisted of the dead plant and litterfalls part of which is released to the atmosphere by heterotrophic respiration and part of which is stabilized to become som som would be broken down slowly by microbial respiration released into air as co2 typhoon or other wind storms affect forest ecosystem c storage dynamics by the intensification of litterfall leading to an increasing size of litter c pools the fraction of c content transferred from living biomass pools to litter pools largely depend on the wind severity here we introduce how typhoon disturbances are modeled and how the forest ecosystem c storage dynamic process responds to typhoons according to previous studies about the disturbance characteristics smithwick et al 2006 we assume typhoon disturbance are poisson events and thus the typhoon regime is defined as the mean typhoon return interval λ a parameter of poisson distribution the mean severity of typhoon effects on forest biomass s low moderate or high levels of removal of carbon from biomass pool and the probability density function of s the probability of a typhoon happened in a given year is thus defined as p t y p h o o n 1 λ and the distribution of intervals between two consequential typhoons is 8 f t λ 1 λ exp t λ where t is the interval between two consecutive typhoon disturbance events the severity defined as the fraction of biomass removed by typhoons ranges from 0 to1 from the first principles for typhoon s is normally much lower than 1 following the mathematical derivations in weng et al 2012 the expectation of plant biomass x 1 in a disturbance regime which is defined by λ and s is 9 x 1 u τ 1 λ λ s τ 1 with the assumption of constant carbon input u and turnover rate τ1 which define a recovery pattern as u τ 1 1 exp t τ 1 the carbon content that was reduced from the biomass c pool due to typhoon disturbance was delivered to the litter pool at the same time the default turnover rate of the biomass pool was 1 τ 1 at equilibrium state the total litter input equals npp so the major impact of typhoon on ecosystem c cycling was that it moved c from the biomass pool to the litter pool the c storage of litter pool equals the product of c input and turnover time of litter pool 10 x 2 u τ 2 and the expectation of soil pool c is x 3 η u τ 3 where η is the transfer ratio from litters to som thus the c storage capacity of forest ecosystem represented by the conceptual model fig 1 at equilibrium state can be written as 11 x u τ 1 λ λ s τ 1 u τ 2 η u τ 3 considering the characteristics of typhoon we defined a typhoon disturbance index which was the portion of c amounts in biomass removed by typhoon per unit time denoted as σ s λ where s stands for the mean fraction of biomass removed by typhoons the ecosystem carbon storage capacity csc same as defined by luo et al 2017 is the production of c input and the turnover time that is 12 csc npp turnover time the carbon storage capacity represents the maximum amount of carbon that an ecosystem can store under given environmental conditions for the specific year here it is used as an index to evaluate the capability of carbon sink for the subtropical forest ecosystem 2 5 forest resistance and resilience indicators to clarify how shifts in typhoon disturbance will affect subtropical forest functions the resistance and resilience as two indices were used to quantify the effects of typhoon on forest ecosystems huang and xia 2019 the resistance measures how stable a forest is to keep the c content during typhoon periods while resilience describes the ability of forest to recover from the last typhoon de keersmaecker et al 2015 van ruijven and berendse 2010 here we used the definition of resistance and resilience from isbell et al 2015 the two indices were calculated as follows 13 resistance x n x t x n 14 resilience x t x n x t 1 x n where x n x t and x t 1 represent the average carbon amounts during normal years that excluded typhoon years the c content in the year that typhoon happened and that of the next year after a typhoon disturbance respectively these two indices are directly comparable for different c pools because they are unitless 2 6 typhoons scenarios setting we designed three typhoon scenarios varying at severity levels and frequency we used s1 s2 and s3 to represent three typhoon severities of 30 60 and 90 of which the forest has been damaged respectively mean typhoon return interval ranged from 0 to 120 years these scenarios were implemented into the modeling approach to assess potential impacts of typhoon over long period of times 500 years on ecosystem carbon fluxes carbon storage capacity resilience and resistance of forest ecosystem 3 results 3 1 relationships between typhoon regime and ecosystem carbon storage dynamics our simulations showed the different reductions of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics in response to enhanced typhoon disturbances indicated by three severity scenarios fig 2 the losses of biomass pool and ecosystem carbon storage capacity csc were reinforced with the increasing typhoon severities fig 2a d and c amounts of the litter and som pool showed a quick and slight increase during the typhoon disturbances respectively fig 2b c during the 500 year simulation the mean annual biomass pool for the s1 scenario was higher 19 52 kg c m 2 than the s2 scenario 16 39 kg c m 2 and s3 scenario 14 02 kg c m 2 for the som pool it ranged from 2 73 kg c m 2 s3 to 3 68 kg c m 2 s1 the severer typhoon disturbance caused a decrease by 26 9 in the ecosystem csc when the typhoon severity varied from s1 severity 0 3 to s3 severity 0 9 litter pool of the s3 scenario 3 13 kg c m 2 exhibited lower than the moderate typhoon scenarios in the 500 year simulation typhoon return intervals during the simulation were randomly set and in our result typhoon disturbance occurred 12 times fig 2a although the litter pool for s3 scenario showed the largest increase during the 12 typhoon events the annual mean litter pool for s3 scenario was lower than s1 3 98 kg c m 2 and s2 3 46 kg c m 2 scenarios compared with the annual mean pool size the som pool during the typhoon events showed a minor decrease by 6 for s1 scenario 6 1 for s2 scenario and 7 for s3 scenario respectively in general it is the frequency instead of severity that explains most of the variability in the different scenario tests fig 3 the shorter the interval between typhoons the higher the frequency of typhoons in a range of severity increasing typhoon frequency leaded to rapid changes in ecosystem csc for a certain frequency the varied typhoon severities had similar effects on ecosystem csc that is the severer the typhoon the less csc the ecosystem had shorter typhoon return interval impacted the recovery of the carbon storage after typhoon disturbances 40 years and led to a decrease of ecosystem csc fig 3 the ecosystem carbon storage dynamics for each severity scenario showed similar recovery pattern under the various typhoon return intervals fig 2 the forest ecosystem could store more carbon under longer typhoon return intervals and less severe typhoons fig 3 3 2 typhoon induced variations of biomass turnover time and ecosystem carbon storage capacity forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics modeled with a typhoon disturbance regime is determined by ecosystem properties biomass turnover time affected by typhoon on the one hand and by typhoon characteristics severity and frequency on the other hand the disturbance index was defined to describe the fraction of biomass carbon removed by typhoon per unit of time thus this modeling approach evaluated the carbon storage at dynamic equilibrium states can be viewed as a function of ecosystem internal properties and typhoon characteristics the biomass turnover time was affected directly by the typhoon induced defoliation and we calculated the effects of typhoon disturbance ratio of severity to interval and biomass turnover time on forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity fig 4 with moderate typhoon disturbance σ 0 1 0 01 the increasing biomass turnover time i e less defoliation and slower carbon cycling rate accelerated the ecosystem csc fig 4 fig 4 showed that the sensitivity of ecosystem carbon storage to typhoon was determined by the biomass turnover time affected by typhoons both internal ecosystem properties and disturbance characteristics contributed to the response of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity to typhoons 3 3 modeled forest resistance and resilience to typhoon disturbances the simulated typhoon resistance of biomass pool litter pool and ecosystem csc varied with severities and the typhoon resistance of som pool showed no significant variations under increasingly severe typhoons fig 5 a typhoon resistance of biomass pool and litter pool was the most sensitive to the variations of typhoon severity with the increasing typhoon severities resistance of biomass pool was significantly reduced from 4 09 1 9 for s1 scenario to 1 14 0 04 for s3 scenario p 0 001 and the resistance of litter pool peaked at 2 81 0 48 s1 scenario followed by 1 06 0 35 s2 scenario and lastly by 0 46 0 16 s3 scenario the typhoon resistance of ecosystem csc showed statistical differences between the s1 scenario and s3 scenario p 0 05 our resilience simulations also revealed that the typhoon resilience of biomass pool litter pool som pool and ecosystem csc did not show significant differences among the severity scenarios fig 5b this implied that resilience of the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics is insensitive to the variations of typhoon severities 4 discussion 4 1 changes in biomass turnover time and ecosystem carbon storage capacity with varied typhoon regimes biomass turnover time as a key parameter to determine carbon storage in forest ecosystems is sensitive to precipitation natural and anthropogenic disturbances and management activities carvalhais et al 2014 erb et al 2016 changes in biomass turnover time and typhoon regime contribute to the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics under typhoon disturbance typhoon induced defoliation and biomass losses could accelerate the rate of carbon turnover in the ecosystem carbon cycling and finally lower the mean time that carbon atoms reside in the ecosystem xia et al 2013 part of the biomass losses are transformed to litterfall and coarse woody debris and cause co2 emission to the atmosphere by the microbial activities luo et al 2017 xia et al 2013 the reduced biomass turnover time caused by defoliation and branch fall thus influences the ecosystem carbon storage capacity fig 4 attentions should be paid to the role of ecosystem properties in response to typhoon 4 2 stabilization mechanism of ecosystem carbon storage dynamics under typhoon disturbances typhoon disturbance plays an important role in shaping the forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics of coastal regions the result of typhoon resilience suggests that the subtropical forests are high resilient to the typhoon disturbance subtropical forests are capable of recovering from regular typhoon disturbance in one year lin et al 2017 biomass and litter pools are more likely to be disturbed by typhoon explained by defoliated litters and tree mortality lin et al 2020 furthermore evidences showed that wind disturbance was the dominant cause of the observed increase of large trees mortality in this subtropical monsoon evergreen forest lu et al 2021 thus typhoons do play a critical role in forest carbon dynamics in the subtropical forest of china s coastal region while the som pool shows a high stability to typhoon disturbance fig 5 wind and rain are two typical forces for typhoon we do not connect the impacts of typhoons to the view of hydrology geomorphology and biogeochemistry in this study for example rainfall effect on soil respiration and carbon stored in the soil ryan and law 2005 these complex interactions and processes are beneficial to the understanding of forest recovery from typhoon regime 4 3 robustness of the model performance the robustness analyses show the uncertainties caused by the assumptions of the constant carbon input over time we showed the npp dynamics at constant npp and that at variable npp fig 6 a generated based on a realistic npp pattern weng et al 2012 we also tested the biases for two typhoon scenarios with slight and moderate severity levels fig 6b d the ratios of the simulated carbon content of the biomass litter and som pool at two npp patterns were closely equaling to 1 the som pool performed the best robust at two npp patterns with the ratio less than 1 002 for the scenario of s1 the recovery pattern of all three carbon pools were identical at two npp patterns thus the uncertainties resulted from constant npp were small over long period of times in the case of a mild or moderate typhoon severity which close to the actual situation 4 4 model limitation and uncertainty there are uncertainties in modeling the overall impacts of typhoons on forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics limited typhoon information may not be able to fully represent the long term characteristics of typhoons although typhoon data are collected to match the field experimental data in this study so the results may vary with the severity and frequency of future typhoons sensitive to climate changes the post typhoon field surveys are needed to evaluate the modeling typhoon effects it is cautious that although the model predicts the forest carbon storage at the dynamic equilibrium states the modeling results are constrained from the data input more details of ecosystem processes at the local scale are necessary to improve the model performance the assumption we used in the model like the constant mineralization rate for the litter and som following first order decay functions would cause uncertainties due to the model structure xia et al 2013 however due to the stable soil organic matter and the lag effects to climate changes over long time scales schmidt et al 2011 trumbore 1997 this assumption can be viewed as an approximation in modeling approach although we have shown the model performance is robust with slight and moderate severity levels fig 6 attention must be paid to the uncertainty caused by the constant npp assumption in the case of extremely strong typhoons with typhoon severity up to 90 most of the ratios of simulated carbon storage at constant npp to that at variable npp were off and above 1 fig 7 in biomass pool the maximum deviation is up to 3 76 times fig 7a and 1 83 in litter pool fig 7b however it is noted that the som pool remained the best robust performance with the maximum ratio less than 1 015 notably at 90 severity fig 7c 4 5 implications this study is an attempt to analyze the typhoon disturbance in influencing the forest ecosystem carbon storage by modeling experiments long term ground measurements are strongly needed in the future to further investigate the potential mechanisms for the post typhoon recovery of forest ecosystem function forest disturbance regimes have been changing profoundly in recent years with climate being a prominent driver of disturbance change seidl et al 2014 typhoon whose frequency is to be increasing is a common disturbance in subtropical forests lin et al 2017 modeling of typhoon disturbance effects on ecosystem carbon storage dynamic is insightful for understanding the role of subtropical forests of china s coastal region in global carbon cycle on the one hand because the subtropical forest ecosystems in the east asian monsoon region provide a large net carbon sink and figure prominently in the global carbon budget yu et al 2014 the knowledge of typhoon effects on evergreen broadleaf forests ebfs is improved through this study thus the instruction of conservations for subtropical forests on the other hand the typhoon regime study helps to improve the understanding of the link between forest carbon storage dynamics and disturbances under climate change and to provide reference for future forest development analysis in most earth system models esms e g the community land model 5 0 clm5 0 have comprehensive and explicit representations of the key biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes and disturbance regimes like fire however few esms have detailed processes of wind effects on terrestrial carbon cycle as an independent module which implies the demand to establish a theoretical model to understand the carbon storage capacity of forests under typhoon disturbance this work provides a perspective to understand the carbon storage capacity by models thus the results acquired from this model can be used as an estimation tool for large scale inversion and model initialization 5 conclusions in summary this study investigates an important topic in global change ecology as typhoon frequency is to be increasing with climate change leading to uncertain impacts on the forest carbon cycling in south east asia a region with significant carbon stocks this study simulates typhoon response of subtropical forest ecosystem carbon storage dynamics based on an original experimental design and a conceptual ecosystem carbon cycle model considering the typhoon disturbance regime the results show both the internal ecosystem properties and disturbance regime contributed to the response of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity to typhoons furthermore typhoons influence the resistance of forest ecosystem carbon storage capacity primarily through biomass and litter carbon amounts whereas soil organic matter remains a high stability under typhoon disturbance over long period of times although the increasing severe typhoon disturbance threatens the structure and function of east asian monsoon subtropical forests in the coastal regions limiting the prediction in land atmosphere carbon exchange and forest management for forest conservation the results show the subtropical forests could be able to recover from regular typhoon disturbances even if typhoon frequency is to be increasing with climate change credit author statement jiaye ping conceptualization methodology investigation data curation visualization writing original draft jian zhou

24598,iran s hyrcanian forests cover a relatively narrow strip in the north part of iran which are among the most important and valuable ecosystems registered in unesco s world heritage list although there are worries about the impact of climate change the influences of this issue on tree species in the hyrcanian forest less studied the effect of climate change on species distribution usually results in species shifting to higher altitudes and latitudes in this study the effect of climate change on the elevation shift of oriental beech as one of the most abundant and important tree species of the hyrcanian forests was investigated using an ensemble species distribution model for the current year 2050 and 2070 under different climatic scenarios totally 1092 occurrences of the beech were recorded for constructing the models results showed the mean elevation of the beech at the current climate conditions was 1110 m which will be shifted to higher altitudes the mean elevation distribution under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were 1210 m 1279 2 m 1280 m and 1340 m for the year 2050 for the year 2070 they were 1190 m 1370 m 1340 m and 1460 2 m as a result the species will shift to higher altitudes under the future climate change the predicted potential distributions suggested that the most suitable areas for oriental beech at the current climate conditions are in the center mazandaran province and west guilan province because of climate change high potential habitats for the beech will shift from east to west that can provide a vision into the availability of suitable

across the country babaian et al 2009 therefore tree species are expected to shift to higher altitudes in the present study we hypothesize that favorable habitats of oriental beech will shift upward to higher altitudes with changing climatic conditions for this purpose we investigated this hypothesis by using species distribution models and evaluated the results in iran s hyrcanian forests 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the hyrcanian forests of iran located between 35 48 n and 37 55 n to 48 31 e and 56 10 e where the average rainfall is 530 mm in the east to 1530 mm in the west and the average annual temperature over the past decade in the western part has been 15 c and 17 5 c in the east sagheb talebi et al 2014 the oriental beech fagus orientalis l is one of the most abundant and economic hardwood species ahmadi et al 2017 which account for approximately 17 6 of the total forest area 30 of standing volume and 23 6 of the number of stems ahmadi et al 2013 species occurrences from north of iran was obtained from the northern iran national inventory network in three provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan for other parts of its distribution we used serra diaz et al 2017 dataset the sdms for the oriental beech were built based on 1543 occurences fig 1 3 environmental variables since the climate variables are regarded as the most important variables used in most species distribution modeling studies ramirez villegas et al 2014 we also prepared bioclimatic variable maps table 1 that included nineteen variables for the current and future climatic conditions with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 from the worldclim database www worldclim org bioclimatic variables were obtained from temperature and monthly rainfall to produce biologically significant variables these variables show annual trends such as mean annual temperature annual precipitation seasonality including annual range in temperature and precipitation and extreme or limiting climatic factors such as the temperature of the coldest and warmest months and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters fernández et al 2015 the overview of the species distribution modeling of the oriental beech is summarized in a flowchart presented in fig 2 the final output of modeling framework is density plot that shows distribution of suitable areas for oriental beech in the hyrcanian forests although eight bioclimatic variables were introduced as the most important factors in earlier studies taleshi et al 2019 ahmadi et al 2020a for better selection of environmental variables affecting the distribution of oriental beech we used 10 bioclimatic variables introduced by cai et al 2021 for the modeling including bio02 mean diurnal range bio03 isothermality bio05 max temperature of warmest month bio06 min temperature of coldest month bio07 temperature annual range bio08 mean temperature of wettest quarter bio09 mean temperature of driest quarter bio13 precipitation of wettest month bio15 precipitation seasonality and bio17 precipitation of driest quarter to avoid multicollinearity of variables resulting in model over fitting dormann et al 2013 we assessed the variance inflation factor vif and removed variables with vif greater than 10 as a result we used all 10 variables to modeling species distribution of oriental beech for future climate data we used the downscaled data from six widely used general circulation models gcms currently available for simulating the global climate response to increasing greenhouse gas concentration gcms

pierre simon laplace ipsl cm5a lr and nasa goddard institute for space studies giss e2 r we used two temporal projections available in the worldclim database the year 2050 and 2070 for representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 hijmans et al 2017 4 species distribution model an ensemble of sdms from four modeling algorithms obtained for modeling generalized additive models gam boosted regression trees brt random forest rf and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars these algorithms have been used individually in many studies araújo and new 2007 such measures as true skill statistics tss allouche et al 2006 and area under curve auc have been used to evaluate the models individually all the models were used to assess the distribution of the oriental beech in northern iran with tss and values above 0 6 to construct an ensemble model jensen et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2020 in this study in order to validate the species distribution models the blockcv cross validation method proposed by valavi et al 2019 was used in this method evaluation and calibration data are separated spatially that works better than the biomod 2 default validation jensen et al 2021 this evaluation process was repeated 10 times we only included the models in the ensemble approach with tss larger than 0 6 the final potential suitability map had a value ranging from zero to 1 we performed the ensemble modeling using the emmeanbytss and emcabytss algorithms jensen et al 2021 the emmean algorithm combines all the individual models into an ensemble model containing the mean prediction for all individual models the emca algorithm computes the committee average of all model predictions meaning that the output will describe model agreement on predicting either presence or absence where high values mean high agreement on predicting the presence and low values close to zero means high agreement on predicting absence hence quantifying the uncertainty of the mean predictions in the biomod2 package in r statistical software r core team 2018 the general methods for evaluating the species distribution model are tss and auc the current climatic data were used to model the suitable habitat for the beech projections and for the future we performed four future climate scenarios rcp2 6 2050 rcp2 6 2070 rcp4 5 2050 rcp4 5 2070 rcp6 2050 rcp6 2070 rcp8 5 2050 and rcp8 5 2070 to predict the suitable habitat to avoid multicollinearity of variables we used the variance inflation factor vif using the usdm package naimi 2015 in r software model building and the ensemble forecasting were performed within the biomod2 package version 3 3 7 thuiller et al 2009 in r software 5 results species distribution modeling showed all models had high accuracy based on auc and tss statistics rf model had better performance for modeling the distribution of oriental beech in the north of iran fig 3 among the methods mars had a lower performance in the prediction of the oriental beech distribution with lower amounts of auc and tss while the random forest model had less variance in terms of auc and tss values in 10 runs response curves of the oriental beech to the environment variables for 10 repeated evaluations are presented in the fig 4 the suitable range of mean diurnal range varied from 10 to 14 for isothermality the suitable range of oriental beech distribution is more than 30 and suitable range for maximum temperature of warmest month is in a short range and only from 300 to 350 the two variables minimum temperature of coldest month and temperature annual range do not show a significant trend for the distribution of oriental beech the suitable range of mean temperature of wettest quarter varied from 50 to 150 and for mean temperature of driest quarter ranged from 200 to 300 the point in this figure is that relationship between the distribution of oriental beech and precipitation of wettest month which with decreasing precipitation the probability of the presence of this species has decreased the suitable range of precipitation seasonality varied from 35 to 65 and the precipitation of driest quarter has no significant relationship with oriental beech present the predicted results of ensemble sdm for oriental beech showed a different range of habitat suitability the predicted potential distributions suggested that the most suitable areas for the oriental beech at the current climate conditions are in the center mazandaran province and west guilan province of the study area fig 5 because of climate change suitable habitats for beech forests shift from east to west in hyrcanian forests figs 5 13 6 changes in habitat suitability of oriental beech in hyrcanian forest the range of lost stable and gain areas under different climatic scenarios is presented in fig 14 maximum suitable habitat loss for the oriental beech was predicted under rcp 8 5 2070 and the minimum was under rcp 2 6 2050 notable in the results of this study was the gain areas under different climatic scenarios which in all scenarios were very low results of the ensemble species distribution model showed that the mean altitudinal distribution of the oriental beech at current climate conditions is 1110 m a s l under future climate change this species will be shifted to the higher elevation 12 108 m 1280 2 m 1290 m and 1340 m for the year 2050 for the year 2070 they were 1190 3 m 1370 3 m 1340 m and 1460 2 m under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 respectively table 2 in addition to changes in the altitude range the distribution range of beech stands will be narrower under future climate and it moves from lower to higher altitudes figs 15 and 16 in 2050 for all climate scenarios at lower altitudes an upward shifting is predicted with increasing density of beech stands at higher altitudes fig 15 it can be seen that the maximum suitable areas for the oriental beech in the future will be considerably higher but the distribution range of this species will be narrowed modeling the distribution at the current conditions showed the highest density of suitable areas are at 500 to 1500 m that in the year 2050 and 2070 this range would be between 1000 and 1500 m figs 15 and 16 7 discussion in the present study we first investigated the distribution of beech species under the influence of climate change in all vegetation areas of this species the results of the present study showed the species distribution models of the oriental beech distribution in iran s hyrcanian forests and other parts of its distribution based on the results of the model evaluation criteria the rf had the highest accuracy while the mars had the worst performance the future projection of the ensemble sdm showed that climate change would have a negative effect on the distribution of the oriental beech that this changes in the hyrcanian forest of iran is sever in other words this valuable species is losing much of its favorable habitats in northern iran the model projections of the present study indicated that oriental beech in the hyrcanian forests of iran will probably change in the future mostly in elevation and this species shift to high elevation and also shift from east to west part of this region among the world s ecosystems mountain forests and their unique habitats are clearly sensitive to climate change and drastically reduced distribution ranges are characteristic of mountain ecosystems that have small spaces to move further to higher altitudes since the hyrcanian forests are a narrow strip this could be the case for the loss of much of the favorable habitats for the oriental beech due to climate change alavi et al 2019 although climate change has been proven as one of the limiting factors of species distribution in northern iran in many studies azizi and roshani 2008 babaian et al 2009 jafari 2008 specifical studies about the potential impacts of climate change are very limited for instance ahmadi et al 2020 showed a high reduction in suitable areas for the english yew under climate change which is also confirmed by alavi et al 2019 taleshi et al 2019 assessed beta diversity and changes in alpha diversity of the tree species under climate change in the hyrcanian forests of iran and showed that the impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species could be very severe and posed a high risk of loss in forest functions and services because of high sensitivity of beech to climate change beech forests around the world have been predicted to decline as the result of increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall iverson and prasad 2002 matsui et al 2009 kramer et al 2010 scharnweber et al 2011 kunz et al 2018 pavlovic et al 2019 the impact of climate change on the distribution of trees can be complex and varies from one species to another however shifting to higher altitudes and longitudinal shifting are among the most prominent effects that have been predicted in many studies peñuelas et al 2007 dorado liñán et al 2017 sedmáková et al 2019 pavlovic et al 2019 mátyás et al 2010 found that an increase of 1 c in temperature could result in an upward shift of beech about 170 m along the mountain slope the present study showed that beech trees not only shifted to higher altitudes but also from east to west of the hyrcanian forests which is due to a further increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation in the east the average rainfall in the east of the study area was about 530 mm and the average annual temperature in the east was 17 5 c sagheb talebi et al 2014 this evidence shows that with increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall species shifting from east to west can be expected although the distribution models in this study and other ones with high accuracy showed that suitable areas for species shift to higher altitudes under climate change there are some limiting factors in hyrcanian forests the idea that the distribution range of a species is exclusively determined by one mechanism may be incorrect because multiple mechanisms such as competition dispersal limitation and human activities can also affect the species distribution range in many studies the climate was assumed to play an important role in determining the altitudinal range distribution of species and studying the range sizes 8 conclusion the potential impact of climate change was evaluated on the oriental beech as an abundant and valuable tree species of the hyrcanian forests in north of iran an ensemble species distribution model was used to predict the distribution of the oriental beech in current year 2050 and 2070 under different climatic scenarios the most suitable areas for this tree at the current climate conditions were found to be the center mazandaran province and west guilan province because of climate change suitable habitats for beech forests change and high potential habitats in the hyrcanian forests will be shifted from east to west the main objective of the present study was the potential impact of climate change on elevation distribution at the current climate conditions the mean altitudinal distribution of the oriental beech in the hyrcanian forests of iran is 1110 8 m a s l and under future climatic conditions will be shifted to high altitudes and mean altitudinal distribution under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 in 2050 were 1210 m 1280 m 1290 m 1340 m and in 2070 were 1190 m 1370 m 1340 8 m and 1460 m respectively in conclusion in addition to protecting the established individuals we suggest such strategies as habitat improvement by planting and maintaining seedlings and restoring oriental beech trees in reforestation programs in suitable sites predicted in this study declaration

24598,iran s hyrcanian forests cover a relatively narrow strip in the north part of iran which are among the most important and valuable ecosystems registered in unesco s world heritage list although there are worries about the impact of climate change the influences of this issue on tree species in the hyrcanian forest less studied the effect of climate change on species distribution usually results in species shifting to higher altitudes and latitudes in this study the effect of climate change on the elevation shift of oriental beech as one of the most abundant and important tree species of the hyrcanian forests was investigated using an ensemble species distribution model for the current year 2050 and 2070 under different climatic scenarios totally 1092 occurrences of the beech were recorded for constructing the models results showed the mean elevation of the beech at the current climate conditions was 1110 m which will be shifted to higher altitudes the mean elevation distribution under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were 1210 m 1279 2 m 1280 m and 1340 m for the year 2050 for the year 2070 they were 1190 m 1370 m 1340 m and 1460 2 m as a result the species will shift to higher altitudes under the future climate change the predicted potential distributions suggested that the most suitable areas for oriental beech at the current climate conditions are in the center mazandaran province and west guilan province because of climate change high potential habitats for the beech will shift from east to west that can provide a vision into the availability of suitable

southern europe and parts of the caspian sea willner et al 2017 oriental beech fagus orientalis l is a medium size deciduous tree that distributed in warmer and drier sites in comparison to european beech this species is distributed in its easternmost growing area in the forests along the caspian sea which called hyrcanian forest the hyrcanian forests of iran comprise a relatively narrow strip of the northern slopes of the alborz mountains along the caspian sea from astara in the northwest to gorgan province in the northeast these forests are about 800 kms long and 110 kms wide with a total area of 1 85 million hectares sagheb talebi et al 2014 the hyrcanian forests range from sea level to a maximum of 2800 m above sea level taleshi et al 2019 accounting for 15 of iran s total forests and 1 1 of the country s total area ahmadi et al 2016 these forests have about 80 tree species marvi mohadjer et al 2012 including rare and valuable species such as sorbus torminalis prunus avium

change ipcc and core writing team 2014 will affect the forest ecosystems easterling et al 2000 anderegg et al 2015 oriental beech is one of the most abundant species in the hyrcanian forests accounting for more than 30 of these forests although there are many concerns about the effects of climate change the response of plant species is largely rare in the hyrcanian forest where several studies have pointed out its sensitivity to future climate change including the expected decrease in the geographical range of tree species accompanied by an upward shifting to the high altitude taleshi et al 2019 alavi et al 2019 ahmadi et al 2020 at present higher altitudes over 2400 m are not suitable for the growth of many tree species due to lower temperatures and lasting cold in spring ahmadi et al 2017 the average temperature in northern iran is expected to rise by the end of the century azizi and roshani 2008 jafari 2008 which will be accompanied by 9 reduction in precipitation across the country babaian et al 2009 therefore tree species are expected to shift to higher altitudes in the present study we hypothesize that favorable habitats of oriental beech will shift upward to higher altitudes with changing climatic conditions for this purpose we investigated this hypothesis by using species distribution models and evaluated the results in iran s hyrcanian forests 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the hyrcanian forests of iran located between 35 48 n and 37 55 n to 48 31 e and 56 10 e where the average rainfall is 530 mm in the east to 1530 mm in the west and the average annual temperature over the past decade in the western part has been 15 c and 17 5 c in the east sagheb talebi et al 2014 the oriental beech fagus orientalis l is one of the most abundant and economic hardwood species ahmadi et al 2017 which account for approximately 17 6 of the total forest area 30 of standing volume and 23 6 of the number of stems ahmadi et al 2013 species occurrences from north of iran was obtained from the northern iran national inventory network in three provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan for other parts of its distribution we used serra diaz et al 2017 dataset the sdms for the oriental beech were built based on 1543 occurences fig 1 3 environmental variables since the climate variables are regarded as the most important variables used in most species distribution modeling studies ramirez villegas et al 2014 we also prepared bioclimatic variable maps table 1 that included nineteen variables for the current and future climatic conditions with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 from the worldclim database www worldclim org bioclimatic variables were obtained from temperature and monthly rainfall to produce biologically

of the oriental beech is summarized in a flowchart presented in fig 2 the final output of modeling framework is density plot that shows distribution of suitable areas for oriental beech in the hyrcanian forests although eight bioclimatic variables were introduced as the most important factors in earlier studies taleshi et al 2019 ahmadi et al 2020a for better selection of environmental

northern iran with tss and values above 0 6 to construct an ensemble model jensen et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2020 in this study in order to validate the species distribution models the blockcv cross validation method proposed by valavi et al 2019 was used in this method evaluation and calibration data are separated spatially that works better than the biomod 2 default validation jensen et al 2021

and tss statistics rf model had better performance for modeling the distribution of oriental beech in the north of iran fig 3 among the methods mars had a lower performance in the prediction of the oriental beech distribution with lower amounts of auc and tss while the random forest model had less variance in terms of auc and tss values in 10 runs response curves of the oriental beech to the environment variables for 10 repeated evaluations are presented in the fig 4 the suitable range of mean diurnal range varied from 10 to 14 for isothermality the suitable range of oriental beech distribution is more than 30 and suitable range for maximum temperature of warmest month is in a short range and only from 300 to 350 the two variables minimum temperature of coldest month and temperature annual range do not show a significant trend for the distribution of oriental beech the suitable range of mean temperature of wettest quarter varied from 50 to 150 and for mean temperature of driest quarter ranged from 200 to 300 the point in this figure is that relationship between the distribution of oriental beech and precipitation of wettest month which with decreasing precipitation the probability of the presence of this species has decreased the suitable range of precipitation seasonality varied from 35 to 65 and the precipitation of driest quarter has no significant relationship with oriental beech present the predicted results of ensemble sdm for oriental beech showed a different range of habitat suitability the predicted potential distributions suggested that the most suitable areas for the oriental beech at the current climate conditions are in the center mazandaran province and west guilan province of the study area fig 5 because of climate change

areas under different climatic scenarios is presented in fig 14 maximum suitable habitat loss for the oriental beech was predicted under rcp 8 5 2070 and the minimum was under rcp 2 6 2050 notable in the results of this study was the gain areas under different climatic scenarios which in all scenarios were very low results of the ensemble species distribution model showed that the mean altitudinal distribution of the oriental beech at current climate conditions is 1110 m a s l under future climate change this species will be shifted to the higher elevation 12 108 m 1280 2 m 1290 m and 1340 m for the year 2050 for the year 2070 they were 1190 3 m 1370 3 m 1340 m and 1460 2 m under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 respectively table 2 in addition to changes in the altitude range the distribution range of beech stands will be narrower under future climate and it moves from lower to higher altitudes figs 15 and 16 in 2050 for all climate scenarios at lower altitudes an upward shifting is predicted with increasing density of beech stands at higher altitudes fig 15 it can be seen that the maximum suitable areas for the oriental beech in the future will be considerably higher but the distribution range of this species will be narrowed modeling the distribution at the current conditions showed the highest density of suitable areas are at 500 to 1500 m that in the year 2050 and 2070 this range would be between 1000 and 1500 m figs 15 and 16 7 discussion in the present study we first investigated the distribution of beech species under the influence of climate change in all vegetation areas of

shift of beech about 170 m along the mountain slope the present study showed that beech trees not only shifted to higher altitudes but also from east to west of the hyrcanian forests which is due to a further increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation in the east the average rainfall in the east of the study area was about 530 mm and the average annual temperature in the east was 17 5 c sagheb talebi et al 2014 this evidence shows that with increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall species shifting from east to west can be expected although the distribution models in this study and other ones with high accuracy showed that suitable areas for species shift to higher altitudes under climate change there are some limiting factors in hyrcanian forests the idea that the distribution range of a species is exclusively determined by one mechanism may be incorrect because multiple mechanisms such as competition dispersal limitation and human activities can also affect the species distribution range in many studies the climate was assumed to play an important role in determining the altitudinal range distribution of species and studying the range sizes 8 conclusion the potential impact of climate change was evaluated on the oriental beech as an abundant and valuable tree species of the hyrcanian forests in north of iran an ensemble species distribution model was used to predict the distribution of the oriental beech in current year 2050 and 2070 under different climatic scenarios the most suitable areas for this tree at the current climate conditions were found to be the center mazandaran province and west guilan province because of climate change suitable habitats for beech forests change and high potential habitats in the hyrcanian forests will be shifted from east to west the main objective of the present study was the potential impact of climate change on elevation distribution at the current climate conditions the mean altitudinal distribution of the oriental beech in the hyrcanian forests of iran is 1110 8 m a s l and under future climatic conditions will be shifted to high altitudes and mean altitudinal distribution under rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 in 2050 were 1210 m 1280 m 1290 m 1340 m and in 2070 were 1190 m 1370 m 1340 8 m and 1460 m respectively in conclusion in addition to protecting the established individuals we suggest such strategies as habitat improvement by planting and maintaining seedlings and restoring oriental beech trees in reforestation programs in suitable sites predicted in this study declaration

24599,agriculture production in pakistan is one of the main economic and social sector it contributes about 20 25 to the country gdp and provides more than 60 employment opportunities for rural peoples playing a backbone role in the country economy and food security however sustainable production of the agricultural system is very important to address a societal concern for environmental impacts and nutritional value while maintaining an economically feasible production system for farmers therefore this study used various indicators based on emergy accounting method to analyze the sustainability of the agriculture production systems in pakistan from 2001 to 2015 in four provinces namely punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan are investigated the analysis indicates that 1 in all selected provinces the maximum portion among all inputs are purchase non renewable inputs and purchase renewables input among in purchase non renewable comprise inputs the largest portion are for labors agriculture machinery and fertilizer inputs while in purchase renewables comprise inputs the largest share are for water that used during irrigation purposes in all provinces 2 in punjab and sindh among purchase non renewable comprise inputs the labor pesticides and diesel were found decreased while in khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan the pesticides diesel and electricity were found declined the efficiency of overall output agriculture production in selected provinces are in the order of punjab sindh kbyber pakhtunkhwa baluchistan the output emergy share of the agriculture production increased by 66 in punjab 34 in sindh 110 in khyber pakhtunkhwa and 72 in baluchistan in the study period 3 the analysis of overall agriculture performance through emergy based indicators indicates that the nrp non renewable portion ratio for punjab declined by 12 while for sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan increased by 1 8 and 1 respectively that is why the eir emergy investment ratio value is lower in punjab and higher in other selected provinces 4 the esi emergy sustainability index values were declined for punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan by 18 91 16 19 35 51 and 11 21 respectively with average values of 0 51 0 11 0 22 and 0 21 indicates increased in punjab than other provinces we believe this study provides the policy makers and producers the understanding of the important drivers influencing agricultural system productivity and environmental social and economic sustainability and to create more adaptable and responsive management practices and strategies for truly sustainable agricultural production systems in pakistan keywords agricultural production agriculture sustainability emergy pakistan 1 introduction agriculture is considered one of the important sector providing various relevant commodities through which food security of the countries is dependent gasparatos 2011 the sustainable management of agriculture production system is very fundamental and significant based on the latest estimation of world food programme of hunger statistic about 925 million people live in a state of hunger in the world eldakak et al 2013 caira and ferranti 2016 it is also estimated that another 2000 million humans will be included to this list by 2050 therefore sustainable management of agriculture production system is essential for achieving the goal of sustainable development and for providing enough food to humans further difficulties arise from some wrong management practices which negatively affect the long term production ability therefore it is very important to integrate present scientific knowledge with farmers knowledge for better understanding and improving of sustainable agricultural practices harpinder and sandhu 2007 researchers in sustainable agriculture system trying to understand how to increase agriculture production by using environmental friendly technologies and practices without degrading the environment the assimilation of ecological and biological processes such as nitrogen cycling nutrient cycling parasitism soil formation process and predation are among the principles of sustainable agriculture pretty 2008 wasiak 2017 the word sustainability in the agriculture context currently captures the attention of environmentalists ecologists industrialists scientists government officials and economists campbell and garmestani 2012 the comprehensive importance of sustainability in agriculture ecosystem is to fulfill human requirements for food enhance the environmental sustainability improve the economic sustainability and promote social sustainability a well managed or sustainable agricultural ecosystem should provide abundant services that can be equitable feasible and suitable tanguay et al 2010 according to the main aim of the sustainable development goals sdg sustainable agriculture is ultimately aimed at fulfilling the needs of peoples for a long period of time without degrading the environment and renewable resources using a lower amount of non renewable resources sustaining and improving both the economic capability and life quality declerck et al 2016 therefore human requirements and agriculture conservation should be balanced for agriculture production at macro scale tendall et al 2015 bullock et al 2017 kazemi et al 2018 such an objective needs the implementation of novel production patterns based on practices that can ensure the agriculture production without damaging the environmental quality clark and tilman 2017 gomiero et al 2011 qi et al 2018b especially considering the developing nations like pakistan agriculture is a fundamental economic sector playing a key role in poverty reduction food security and economic growth timer 2002 in pakistan agriculture contributes to about 25 of the whole country gdp gross domestic product engaging almost 50 of the country labor force pakistan bureau of statistics 2015 considering a total area of 79 6 mha 21 2 mha is cultivated out of which 4 21 mha is irrigated the irrigation system of pakistan is the world largest one basharat 2019 moreover pakistan is among the top producers of wheat sugarcane rice cotton mango etc even with such an incredible development according to world food program wfp pakistan is striving with enormous levels of insecurity in food and more than 48 people struggling with food insecurity united nations world food program 2009 according to the pakistan population census 2017 such insecurity is due to the rapid increase in population having a growth rate of 2 4 and wasteful usage of water resources in fact almost 90 of the existing water resources are used for the agriculture conversely it is estimated that per capita availability of fresh water was 1500 m3 which is amongst the lowermost in asian countries according to the latest estimations pakistan will become a water scarce country between 2020 and 2035 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in addition the country is often hit by several disasters man made and natural such as droughts floods landslides and earthquakes that affect the agricultural development on a huge scale pakistan government is currently supporting the development of agriculture taking various measures to improve the storage and efficient use of water to provide good quality crops and low cost electricity to reduce the prices of fertilizers and such initiatives will develop the agriculture sector in coming years in order to support the development of informed policy actions this study focuses on a sustainability evaluation of agriculture sector in pakistan at provincial scale in particular the aim of this work is to evaluate the agricultural sustainability through emergy accounting analysis of four provinces of pakistan during the period 2001 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 study area for agriculture production system sustainability assessment this study chooses pakistan more specifically its four provinces such as punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan as shown in fig 1 as study cases the different climatic environmental and socioeconomic features in each selected province result in a distinct agriculture production system in pakistan almost in each province wheat rice cotton sugarcane and maize are considered as the major s crops in terms of its large area large production large export among all selected provinces punjab province is considered as the heart of pakistan due to its large agriculture areas which accounts for 72 82 followed by sindh accounts for 14 20 khyber pakhtunkhwa 8 39 and baluchistan 4 67 of total agriculture area gop 2015 zulfiqar and thapa 2017 in agriculture sector of pakistan highest amount of labor force is engage more specifically is one of the main income source of rural peoples living all provinces of pakistan the highest percentage of labor force about is 60 in punjab province followed by 24 in sindh province 11 in kpk and 4 in baluchistan the synthetic fertilizers such as nitrogen based fertilizers potash fertilizers and phosphate fertilizers are consumed in punjab in agriculture production system about 71 followed by 20 consumed in sindh 6 in khyber pakhtunkhwa and 4 in baluchistan province 2 2 emergy accounting analysis of agriculture production system 2 2 1 emergy accounting the concept of emergy was proposed by the system ecologist h t odum he defined emergy as the available energy either in one or in different form involved directly or indirectly through a process to make a product or a service odum 1996 odum 1988 the emergy value of any resource reveals the amount of available energy supported by nature in supporting any process the emergy method can be used to evaluate the interactions among environmental economic and social systems by aiming to attain the sustainability in systems brown and ulgiati 2004 this method provides the clear assessment techniques such as weighting factors to judge the systems and to remove errors professional weighting factor that is use for environmental indicators includes variable knowledge unclear information and such factors may damage clearly of the analysis and leads wrong ideas almeida et al 2007 emergy methodology is based on the thermodynamics principles and environmental evaluation tool deals the economic examination to a biophysical alternative as well as it reflects the reliance of exterior resources resources yield and usage efficiency measure the environmental load and calculate the sustainability of a system odum 1996 ulgiati et al 1993 for examples in agriculture ecosystem emergy method analyze and shows the efficiency of agriculture ecosystem through simple energy utilizations the emergy method also directly and indirectly calculates free environmental services and its role and functions to the economic sector of the human beings odum 1996 the system diagram helps to understand the process and flows of different energies and its functions helps to assess the sustainability in various ecosystems offers knowledge about the usage of different types of resources almeida et al 2007 giannetti et al 2006 the indices of emergy is used to assess the ecological societal and economical sustainability of the ecosystem by using the p s r framework pressure state response zhang et al 2012 numerous researcher evaluates the sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by using various types of indicators such as the sustainability of italian agriculture was calculated by using environmental accounting tools such as emergy ulgiati et al 1993 assessing the inputs of energy for agriculture production by using environmental accounting methodology pimentel 2009 agriculture grain production in china was evaluated by wang et al 2014 demand of energy in agriculture ecosystem in iran by using time services evaluation by farajian et al 2018 franzese et al 2013 assessed the efficiency and sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by using emergy based in indicators in brazil the average agriculture productions as indicator used by hayati et al 2011 rasul and thapa 2003 social equity as an indicators used by rasul and thapa 2003 and rural life quality improve as indicator for analyzing social sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by van cauwenbergh et al 2007 environmental performance or sustainability was assessed by using indicator of diversification in crops organic fertilizers pesticides synthetic fertalizers and soil erosion nambiar et al 200 hayati et al 2011 van cauwenbergh et al 2007 bosshard 2000 emergy environmental accounting tools that measure the nature effort together with human efforts that generate products and service expressed in sej solar emergy joules which means that solar emergy equivalent that require to produce a product or services by means of conversions of energy in ecosystem and economy zhao et al 2005 the energy conversion factors in emergy methodology which transform energy form to sej is called transformities defined as the amount of solar emergy that involved directly or indirectly to produced one joule of a product brown and ulgiati 2004 2 2 2 data input and unit emergy values this research is based on the secondary data collected from various government sources such as pakistan country agriculture statistic yearbook collected from pakistan bureau of statistic punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan statistic yearbooks collected from the country provincial statistical bureau the uevs collected from published papers are detailed in table 1 all the uevs used in the calculation process of this paper are based on the latest global emergy baseline geb which is fixed at 12 0e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 2 2 3 system diagram representation as shown in fig 2 the system diagram of agriculture production system that indicates key components of involved in the agriculture production system the flows of various energies and process all the inputs are divided into four categories including renewables r and purchased renewables resource inputs fr non renewable n and purchased renewables resource inputs fn and the inputs belong in each category along with the output of the agriculture productions y table 1 the water use for irrigation labor and seed was consider as fr belong inputs as which was did by previous studies zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 ali et al 2019 2 3 emergy based indicators used for evaluation overall performance of agriculture system 2 3 1 nonrenewable portion nrp agriculture ecosystem requires different types of resources and energy inputs in the form of renewables as well as non renewables inputs to perform it functions and processes the sustainable agriculture ecosystem is the one that reduce or less dependent on non renewables resources because mostly such non renewables resources harmful for the environment pretty 2008 liu et al 2019 therefore nrp is used as the indicator to compare the sustainability of the selected agriculture cultivating ecosystems and the equations are as follows 1 n r p f n n u 100 where nrp is the renewable and non renewables portions in f n a n d n mean non renewables and purchased non renewable emergy used in agriculture production system respectively sej yr u means total emergy used in agriculture production system sej yr 2 3 2 emergy investment ratio eir emergy investment ratio eir is defined as the emergy resources utilized from economy divided by renewable emergy and non renewable resources utilize nature this indicator assesses the investment by which economy made while consuming local resources ohnishi et al 2017 the higher values of this indicator the higher economic development while the smaller value the lower economic cost yet too much higher values mean highly dependent on economic system and too small value indicates the system is in underdevelopment 2 e i r f n f r n r 2 3 3 emergy yield ratio eyr the eyr indicator quantifies the capacity of production system to consumed the resources both renewable resources and non renewable resources the higher values of eyr indicator shows higher productions each invested of emergy zhong et al 2018 3 e y r u f n f r where u means total emergy utilized by the system such as renewables including purchased renewables and non renewables including purchased non renewables in sej yr f n and f r means the purchased renewable and non renewable resource use in agriculture production system sej yr 2 3 4 environmental loading radio elr the elr indicator measures the environmental performance such as the environmental pressure through resources utilizations by the system and is the ratio of renewables and non renewables emergy the higher value indicates the higher environmental load while lower value indicates the lower environmental load zhang et al 2016 4 e l r f n n f r r 2 3 5 environmental sustainability index esi the esi indictor is quantify the overall sustainability of the system through considering the efficiency of the system and environmental load and it the ratio eyr divided by elr the lower values indicate the lower sustainability of the system and higher values indicates higher sustainability of the system david et al 2018 5 e s i e y r e l r 3 results 3 1 overall status and emergy values of r n fn and fr

among all major inputs the largest emergy share is for fn inputs followed by fr inputs for all selected provinces the average percentage of fn inputs for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan was 61 44 88 82 80 88 and 79 59 with an average annual increase of 4 2 9 and 2 respectively such increase was due to the area under cultivation of each province such as punjab accounts 73 of arable land sindh account 14 khyber pakhtunkhwa account 7 and baluchistan account 5 gop 2015a in addition the agricultural production of pakistan is mainly from punjab followed by sindh that is the reason pakistan focused its all agricultural modernization measure in punjab and sindh followed by khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan khan 2012 gop 2015a b zulfiqar and thapa 2017 among all the fn belong inputs the average percent of consumptions of diesel input for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan decline by 81 78 75 and 81 respectively such decrease in diesel consumption is due to increasing trends of electrification in agriculture ali et al 2019 whereas the average annual percent of all other fn belongs inputs were increase for all provinces especially the labors as agriculture is main source of income for rural population in pakistan rehman 2012 agriculture machinery for agricultural mechanization khan 2012 followed by fertilizers inputs for maximum agricultural production hussain 2012 the average annual emergy percent of fr inputs for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan were 28 14 6 23 9 17 and 5 41 respectively the largest emergy percent share from fr belongs inputs was water consumptions for irrigation purposes which was 96 88 95 and 96 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan and their annual average share was increase by 3 5 0 001 and 55 respectively such increasing trends is mainly because presently around about 90 of pakistan fresh water is consumed in agricultural purpose and according the estimate the country between 2020 and 2035 will become water scarce altaf et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 4 2 emergy outputs on average the agriculture productions output in punjab province such as wheat rice cotton oil crops barley tobacco beans hemp vegetables and fruits are among the highest percent share of 77 32 whereas the remaining 22 67 shares are for maize sugarcane millet potato meat poultry egg and inland fish productions the highest increased was recorded annually for maize production which is about 10 time more increase followed by poultry and sugarcane this is because the primary focused of farmers to increase the production of cereal crops leads to meet the local demands of food security of a country as mainly the pakistan main agriculture production is from punjab and also the soil characteristics of the province which is clay loam and sandy loam attributed for the production of such crops gop 2015a khan 2004 the annual output decrease change was recorded for hemp which was recorded as 99 decrease fallowed by barley and beans such decrease in selected crops was due the poor crop diversification only reliant on cereal crops sajjad and parasad 2014 zulfiqar and thapa 2017 sin sindh province among all the agriculture production outputs wheat cotton oil crops poultry and eggs got the highest share of 63 93 and their annual share increase by 1 3 9 92 and 40 respectively whereas the remaining agriculture productions output is around 37 and also their annual percent share decline mainly because growing of cereals crops for country food security and shifting of famers towards cash crops such as cotton etc gop 2013a in kpk province the highest share of outputs is 59 11 for wheat cotton meat poultry eggs and inland fish production and their annual share also increase while all other agriculture outputs are around 40 and their annual share declined in which hemp decline by 88 in kpk around 70 of land is use for cultivation of wheat use for household consumption leading the lowest crop diversification also the area is biophysically diverse which lead to not cultivated crops for commercial scale as well as unavailability of agricultural inputs weak network of transportation and weak transportation and unavailability of water for irrigation purposes gop 2011 gop 2015 khan 2012 in baluchistan province the highest percent shares of agriculture output are 53 27 for cotton millet beans vegetables meat poultry and eggs and their annual output share for each product also increase in which millet output was increase maximum of 168 followed by poultry and eggs production whereas the rest of outputs was on around 46 and their annual percent share for each outputs was declined in which the maximum declined rate was for potato production which was around 68 followed by oil crops similarly baluchistan province is a mountainous area having similar biophysical characteristics of kpk where mostly the area is rain fed the adverse environmental situation such droughts and less rain in sowing period in past couple years lead decrease in the production of cereal crops such as wheat maize rice etc gop 2010 gop 2013a 4 3 comparisons among selected provinces and other previous studies as shown by table 2 the average value of eyr during the years 2001 2015 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 1 11 1 07 1 13 and 1 17 respectively which are almost the same as this indicator shows the production contributions to the economic sector of the country regions david et al 2018 the comparison with other studies were based on the similar application of emergy based indicators and same agriculture inputs classification such as r n fr and fn when comparing with previous studies evaluates by various researchers for different countries and regions almost greater than the selected regions such as 1 43 for india for the 2002 2012 ali et al 2019 1 34 average value for hainan china liu et al 2019 1 16 for campania italy for the year 2010 ghisellini et al 2014 the average value of elr indicator for the year 2001 2015 for the punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 1 9 9 55 4 78 and 5 26 respectively it shows that punjab province is under the minimum environmental pressure and sindh province is under the maximum environmental pressure from the non renewable resource exploitation liu et al 2019 when comparing with previous studies of different regions the highest value of elr is 32 65 in luancheng county china due the maximum usage of non renewable resources ma et al 2015 and 10 43 in italy in 1989 ulgiati et al 1993 whereas in other regions the elr indicator values was somehow similar level to this study such as 8 345 elr value in ansai shaanxi china for corn soybean crop rotation liu et al 2019 the value of eir indicator for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 8 65 13 99 7 52 and 5 73 respectively when comparing the eir indicator value of this with other previous studies for different regions such as 13 1 for denmark rydberg and haden 2006 24 7 for india ali et al 2019 which shows that the agriculture productions of this study was well in the market due to their lower economic cost ma et al 2015 the average value of esi indicator for the year 2001 2015 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 0 59 0 11 0 24 and 0 22 respectively indicating almost similar when comparing with previous studies of different regions except yanchi china 8 55 wang et al 2014 and jiangsu china 1 11 liu and li 2005 as higher values of this indicators indicates the higher sustainability ghisellini et al 2014 liu et al 2019 the average nrp indicator value of punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 34 54 90 36 82 32 and 83 97 respectively showing that punjab province is more sustainable and sindh is unsustainable as sustainable agriculture supports less use dependent on non renewable resources liu et al 2019 4 4 agriculture challenges and policy implications agriculture sector in pakistan is one of the main income source for rural peoples and also plays an important role in the country economy agriculture depends upon humans inputs mainly purchased renewables and non renewable inputs to properly functions and provide the agriculture products swinton et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 among such inputs in the selected provinces i e punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan the average fertilizers usage was found to be 32 28 17 and 18 respectively which shows an increasing trends of usage during the selected years on one hand their excessive usage produces more agriculture production but on the other hand it degrades land and water resources which is reflected in case of pakistan where such excessive usage of synthetic fertilizers environmental related problems and effects sustainability of the agriculture production system zulfiqar and thapa 2017 agriculture machinery increases by 27 in punjab and almost increase two fold in sindh province whereas in kpk and baluchistan provinces the agriculture machinery share are 2 each which has slightly increase over the selected periods all these machinery was just limited to the tractors with cultivators in pakistan which sometime are not present during a specific time of cultivation for poor farmers because of their unaffordable prices and lack of such proper agriculture technologies negatively affects agriculture productions devendra et al 2008 tewari et al 2012 the pesticides usage in all selected provinces decrease due to the awareness in farmers as previously it was due to the farmer s wasteful usage ali et al 2019 the water use for irrigations purposes in punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan among all inputs are 30 5 9 and 4 respectively in pakistan for agriculture purposes fresh water is used but actually the water is one of the scarce resources and according to the experts the country will be water scarce in future if significant conservation and protection measures were not established altaf et al 2009 ali et al 2019 in addition the country did not have modern ways irrigation resulting maximum quantity of water loss mainly due to fading and leaching azam and shafiq 2017 another issue in pakistan is the salinity mainly due to excessive usage of ground water for agriculture purposes especially in sindh and baluchistan provinces memon and thapa 2010 pakistan ranks 8th in term of salinity affected countries fao 2006 along with salinity areas pakistan also faces natural disasters such as drought in baluchistan and floods during monsoon season which mostly destroy the agriculture crops thereby causing damages to the agriculture productions and also increase economic cost zulfiqar and thapa 2017 gop 2015 shah et al 2019 in pakistan 2010 the most devastating floods in the history of pakistan destroy billion acres of arable land and agricultural loss of 2 9 billion azam and shafiq 2017 the electricity usage increase and diesel usage decrease during the year which as due to the unaffordable price of diesel and also due to the decrease of electricity consumptions prices for farmers by government weak infrastructure such as lack of storage facilities and insufficient transportation facilities is another problem faced by pakistan which create agriculture growth disturbance and also create difficulties for farmer s to transport the agriculture products to markets united nations development program 2003 in pakistan various projects were initiated by the new government federal and provincial government including five year national plan for enhancing conservation development of agriculture water sectors and reduced poverty gop 2015 the new government in pakistan initiated 13 agriculture and water developmental projects that will increase the yield of major crops for export to reduce the food security in a country and also to construct the water dams both small and large for electricity as well as to conserve and store the water for irrigation flood control and drought related emergency disaster the express tribune 2019 a project titled prime minister agriculture package was also initiated to support the small farmers through providing direct money soft loan for enhancing and prosper the life of small farmers under such projects the various agriculture facilities will be provided for the farmers such as better quality of seeds cheaper electricity for tube wells lng liquefied natural gas for fertilizers companies and many more to achieve the goals of agriculture productions per hectare and minimize the usage of minimum agriculture inputs gop 2015 several other projects related to agriculture are under progress with the collaborations of chinese government to bring the poor people out of poverty and also to attain the goals of food security dawn 2017 ali et al 2019 along with such projects educational related projects will also to be need to develop the skill knowledge of farmers regarding sustainability ali et al 2018 besides it will reduce the agriculture related issues in the country enhances the agriculture productions reduced poverty through providing jobs opportunities for rural people and will help in food security through achieving higher amount of yields 5 conclusion in pakistan agriculture is considered the backbone of the country s economy and provides more than 60 of employment opportunities for rural peoples in this study we evaluated the sustainability of the agriculture production system in four provinces of pakistan including punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan through emergy accounting analysis from the period of 2001 to 2015 the main finding of the study was in all provinces the maximum portion among all inputs were fn purchase non renewable inputs and fr purchase renewables input among in fn comprise inputs the largest portion was for labors agriculture machinery and fertilizer inputs while in fr comprise inputs the largest share was for water use for irrigation purposes in all provinces in punjab and sindh among fn comprise inputs the labor pesticides and diesel were found decreased while in khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan the pesticides diesel and electricity were found to decline this indicates that in a selected time period farmer s awareness leads to the reduction of the use of pesticides the decline of labor indicates a lack of proper facilities for farmers to get efficient agriculture production diesel dependency leads due to the unavailability of facilities of electricity in regions the agriculture performance through emergy based indicators in which the nrp ratio for punjab was declined by 12 while for sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan it seems to increase by 1 8 and 1 respectively that s why the eir values were lower in punjab while it was higher in other selected provinces the esi values were a decline for punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan by 18 91 16 19 35 51 and 11 21 respectively with an average value of 0 51 0 11 0 22 and 0 21 respectively indicates an increase in punjab than other provinces this study was basically based on the secondary data collected from various governmental reports statistical yearbooks for each province agriculture statistics and various other reports all the calculation was based on such data and specific uevs was collected from various literatures which was the limitation of the study to calculate the averages emergy values of specific agriculture products based on such emergy values the overall performance including sustainability environmental load etc was evaluated in each province through emergy based indicators in a selected time period as the emergy methods assess the overall efficiency and sustainability of agriculture productions system by means of resources usage contribution of nature and human evaluates the cost of environment and helps the policy makers to find the important role of ecosystem on agriculture production system therefore this study will provide resource utilization in agriculture that will help for the policy makers and government agencies on their ongoing agriculture related challenges and projects related to improve the efficiency of the agriculture production systems poverty reduction providing employment in agriculture and food security increase the production efficiency of agriculture credit authorship contribution statement syed mahboob shah methodology validation writing

24599,agriculture production in pakistan is one of the main economic and social sector it contributes about 20 25 to the country gdp and provides more than 60 employment opportunities for rural peoples playing a backbone role in the country economy and food security however sustainable production of the agricultural system is very important to address a societal concern for environmental impacts and nutritional value while maintaining an economically feasible production system for farmers therefore this study used various indicators based on emergy accounting method to analyze the sustainability of the agriculture production systems in pakistan from 2001 to 2015 in four provinces namely punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan are investigated the analysis indicates that 1 in all selected provinces the maximum portion among all inputs are purchase non renewable inputs and purchase renewables input among in purchase non renewable comprise inputs the largest portion are for labors agriculture machinery and fertilizer inputs while in purchase renewables comprise inputs the largest share are for water that used during irrigation purposes in all provinces 2 in punjab and sindh among purchase non renewable comprise inputs the labor pesticides and diesel were found decreased while in khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan the pesticides diesel and electricity were found declined the efficiency of overall output agriculture production in selected provinces are in the order of punjab sindh kbyber pakhtunkhwa baluchistan the output emergy share of the agriculture production increased by 66 in punjab 34 in sindh 110 in khyber pakhtunkhwa and 72 in baluchistan in the study period 3 the analysis of overall agriculture performance through emergy based indicators indicates that the nrp non renewable portion ratio for punjab declined by 12 while for sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan increased by 1 8 and 1 respectively that is why the eir emergy investment ratio value is lower in punjab and higher in other selected provinces 4 the esi emergy sustainability index values were declined for punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan by 18 91 16 19 35 51 and 11 21 respectively with average values of 0 51 0 11 0 22 and 0 21 indicates increased in punjab than other provinces we believe this study provides the policy makers and producers the understanding of the important drivers influencing agricultural system productivity and environmental social and economic sustainability and to create more adaptable and responsive management practices and strategies for truly sustainable agricultural production systems in pakistan keywords agricultural production agriculture sustainability emergy pakistan 1 introduction agriculture is considered one of the important sector providing various relevant commodities through which food security of the countries is dependent gasparatos 2011 the sustainable management of agriculture production system is very fundamental and significant based on the latest estimation of world food programme of hunger statistic about 925 million people live in a state of hunger in the world eldakak et al 2013 caira and ferranti 2016 it is also estimated that another 2000 million humans will be included to this list by 2050 therefore sustainable management of agriculture production system is essential for achieving the goal of sustainable development and for providing enough food to humans further difficulties arise from some wrong management practices which negatively affect the long term production ability therefore it is very important to integrate present scientific knowledge with farmers knowledge for better understanding and improving of sustainable agricultural practices harpinder and sandhu 2007 researchers in sustainable agriculture system trying to understand how to increase agriculture production by using environmental friendly technologies and practices without degrading the environment the assimilation of ecological and biological processes such as nitrogen cycling nutrient cycling parasitism soil formation process and predation are among the principles of sustainable agriculture pretty 2008 wasiak 2017 the word sustainability in the agriculture context currently captures the attention of environmentalists ecologists industrialists scientists government officials and economists campbell and garmestani 2012 the comprehensive importance of sustainability in agriculture ecosystem is to fulfill human requirements for food enhance the environmental sustainability improve the economic sustainability and promote social sustainability a well managed or sustainable agricultural ecosystem should provide abundant services that can be equitable feasible and suitable tanguay et al 2010 according to the main aim of the sustainable development goals sdg sustainable agriculture is ultimately aimed at fulfilling the needs of peoples for a long period of time without degrading the environment and renewable resources using a lower amount of non renewable resources sustaining and improving both the economic capability and life quality declerck et al 2016 therefore human requirements and agriculture conservation should be balanced for agriculture production at macro scale tendall et al 2015 bullock et al 2017 kazemi et al 2018 such an objective needs the implementation of novel production patterns based on practices that can ensure the agriculture production without damaging the environmental quality clark and tilman 2017 gomiero et al 2011 qi et al 2018b especially considering the developing nations like pakistan agriculture is a fundamental economic sector playing a key role in poverty reduction food security and economic growth timer 2002 in pakistan agriculture contributes to about 25 of the whole country gdp gross domestic product engaging almost 50 of the country labor force pakistan bureau of statistics 2015 considering a total area of 79 6 mha 21 2 mha is cultivated out of which 4 21 mha is irrigated the irrigation system of pakistan is the world largest one basharat 2019 moreover pakistan is among the top producers of wheat sugarcane rice cotton mango etc even with such an incredible development according to world food program wfp pakistan is striving with enormous levels of insecurity in food and more than 48 people struggling with food insecurity united nations world food program 2009 according to the pakistan population census 2017 such insecurity is due to the rapid increase in population having a growth rate of 2 4 and wasteful usage of water resources in fact almost 90 of the existing water resources are used for the agriculture conversely it is estimated that per capita availability of fresh water was 1500 m3 which is amongst the lowermost in asian countries according to the latest estimations pakistan will become a water scarce country between 2020 and 2035 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in addition the country is often hit by several disasters man made and natural such as droughts floods landslides and earthquakes that affect the agricultural development on a huge scale pakistan government is currently supporting the development of agriculture taking various measures to improve the storage and efficient use of water to provide good quality crops and low cost electricity to reduce the prices of fertilizers and such initiatives will develop the agriculture sector in coming years in order to support the development of informed policy actions this study focuses on a sustainability evaluation of agriculture sector in pakistan at provincial scale in particular the aim of this work is to evaluate the agricultural sustainability through emergy accounting analysis of four provinces of pakistan during the period 2001 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 study area for agriculture production system sustainability assessment this study chooses pakistan more specifically its four provinces such as punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan as shown in fig 1 as study cases the different climatic environmental and socioeconomic features in each selected province result in a distinct agriculture production system in pakistan almost in each province wheat rice cotton sugarcane and maize are considered as the major s crops in terms of its large area large production large export among all selected provinces punjab province is considered as the heart of pakistan due to its large agriculture areas which accounts for 72 82 followed by sindh accounts for 14 20 khyber pakhtunkhwa 8 39 and baluchistan 4 67 of total agriculture area gop 2015 zulfiqar and thapa 2017 in agriculture sector of pakistan highest amount of labor force is engage more specifically is one of the main income source of rural peoples living all provinces of pakistan the highest percentage of labor force about is 60 in punjab province followed by 24 in sindh province 11 in kpk and 4 in baluchistan the synthetic fertilizers such as nitrogen based fertilizers potash fertilizers and phosphate fertilizers are consumed in punjab in agriculture production system about 71 followed by 20 consumed in sindh 6 in khyber pakhtunkhwa and 4 in baluchistan province 2 2 emergy accounting analysis of agriculture production system 2 2 1 emergy accounting the concept of emergy was proposed by the system ecologist h t odum he defined emergy as the available energy either in one or in different form involved directly or indirectly through a process to make a product or a service odum 1996 odum 1988 the emergy value of any resource reveals the amount of available energy supported by nature in supporting any process the emergy method can be used to evaluate the interactions among environmental economic and social systems by aiming to attain the sustainability in systems brown and ulgiati 2004 this method provides the clear assessment techniques such as weighting factors to judge the systems and to remove errors professional weighting factor that is use for environmental indicators includes variable knowledge unclear information and such factors may damage clearly of the analysis and leads wrong ideas almeida et al 2007 emergy methodology is based on the thermodynamics principles and environmental evaluation tool deals the economic examination to a biophysical alternative as well as it reflects the reliance of exterior resources resources yield and usage efficiency measure the environmental load and calculate the sustainability of a system odum 1996 ulgiati et al 1993 for examples in agriculture ecosystem emergy method analyze and shows the efficiency of agriculture ecosystem through simple energy utilizations the emergy method also directly and indirectly calculates free environmental services and its role and functions to the economic sector of the human beings odum 1996 the system diagram helps to understand the process and flows of different energies and its functions helps to assess the sustainability in various ecosystems offers knowledge about the usage of different types of resources almeida et al 2007 giannetti et al 2006 the indices of emergy is used to assess the ecological societal and economical sustainability of the ecosystem by using the p s r framework pressure state response zhang et al 2012 numerous researcher evaluates the sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by using various types of indicators such as the sustainability of italian agriculture was calculated by using environmental accounting tools such as emergy ulgiati et al 1993 assessing the inputs of energy for agriculture production by using environmental accounting methodology pimentel 2009 agriculture grain production in china was evaluated by wang et al 2014 demand of energy in agriculture ecosystem in iran by using time services evaluation by farajian et al 2018 franzese et al 2013 assessed the efficiency and sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by using emergy based in indicators in brazil the average agriculture productions as indicator used by hayati et al 2011 rasul and thapa 2003 social equity as an indicators used by rasul and thapa 2003 and rural life quality improve as indicator for analyzing social sustainability in agriculture ecosystem by van cauwenbergh et al 2007 environmental performance or sustainability was assessed by using indicator of diversification in crops organic fertilizers pesticides synthetic fertalizers and soil erosion nambiar et al 200 hayati et al 2011 van cauwenbergh et al 2007 bosshard 2000 emergy environmental accounting tools that measure the nature effort together with human efforts that generate products and service expressed in sej solar emergy joules which means that solar emergy equivalent that require to produce a product or services by means of conversions of energy in ecosystem and economy zhao et al 2005 the energy conversion factors in emergy methodology which transform energy form to sej is called transformities defined as the amount of solar emergy that involved directly or indirectly to produced one joule of a product brown and ulgiati 2004 2 2 2 data input and unit emergy values this research is based on the secondary data collected from various government sources such as pakistan country agriculture statistic yearbook collected from pakistan bureau of statistic punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan statistic yearbooks collected from the country provincial statistical bureau the uevs collected from published papers are detailed in table 1 all the uevs used in the calculation process of this paper are based on the latest global emergy baseline geb which is fixed at 12 0e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 2 2 3 system diagram representation as shown in fig 2 the system diagram of agriculture production system that indicates key components of involved in the agriculture production system the flows of various energies and process all the inputs are divided into four categories including renewables r and purchased renewables resource inputs fr non renewable n and purchased renewables resource inputs fn and the inputs belong in each category along with the output of the agriculture productions y table 1 the water use for irrigation labor and seed was consider as fr belong inputs as which was did by previous studies zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 ali et al 2019 2 3 emergy based indicators used for evaluation overall performance of agriculture system 2 3 1 nonrenewable portion nrp agriculture ecosystem requires different types of resources and energy inputs in the form of renewables as well as non renewables inputs to perform it functions and processes the sustainable agriculture ecosystem is the one that reduce or less dependent on non renewables resources because mostly such non renewables resources harmful for the environment pretty 2008 liu et al 2019 therefore nrp is used as the indicator to compare the sustainability of the selected agriculture cultivating ecosystems and the equations are as follows 1 n r p f n n u 100 where nrp is the renewable and non renewables portions in f n a n d n mean non renewables and purchased non renewable emergy used in agriculture production system respectively sej yr u means total emergy used in agriculture production system sej yr 2 3 2 emergy investment ratio eir emergy investment ratio eir is defined as the emergy resources utilized from economy divided by renewable emergy and non renewable resources utilize nature this indicator assesses the investment by which economy made while consuming local resources ohnishi et al 2017 the higher values of this indicator the higher economic development while the smaller value the lower economic cost yet too much higher values mean highly dependent on economic system and too small value indicates the system is in underdevelopment 2 e i r f n f r n r 2 3 3 emergy yield ratio eyr the eyr indicator quantifies the capacity of production system to consumed the resources both renewable resources and non renewable resources the higher values of eyr indicator shows higher productions each invested of emergy zhong et al 2018 3 e y r u f n f r where u means total emergy utilized by the system such as renewables including purchased renewables and non renewables including purchased non renewables in sej yr f n and f r means the purchased renewable and non renewable resource use in agriculture production system sej yr 2 3 4 environmental loading radio elr the elr indicator measures the environmental performance such as the environmental pressure through resources utilizations by the system and is the ratio of renewables and non renewables emergy the higher value indicates the higher environmental load while lower value indicates the lower environmental load zhang et al 2016 4 e l r f n n f r r 2 3 5 environmental sustainability index esi the esi indictor is quantify the overall sustainability of the system through considering the efficiency of the system and environmental load and it the ratio eyr divided by elr the lower values indicate the lower sustainability of the system and higher values indicates higher sustainability of the system david et al 2018 5 e s i e y r e l r 3 results 3 1 overall status and emergy values of r n fn and fr resources input fig 3 displays the overall emergy values of r n fn and fr inputs for four provinces punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan for the year 2001 to 2015 the total average annual emergy input value of punjab agriculture production is 3 65e 21 sej with annual increase rate of 25 31 and an average annual growth rate of 2 the average values of r n fn and fr among all the inputs

highest output of average combine emergy percentage of agriculture productions includes maize 31 96 followed by cotton 19 21 and for the least emergy percentage production include hemp 0 00006 followed by tobacco 0 02 in punjab the combine share emergy percentages increase for maize sugarcane millet potato meat poultry eggs and inland fish production while the rest of agriculture production shows decrease change the minimum change in the rice production declined by 2 while the maximum change is for hemp production declined by 99 in absolute emergy share of agriculture productions was increase for all the agriculture product except the barely beans and vegetables such decline was due to the fewer attentions of policy makers and farmers ali et al 2019 3 4 2 emergy output for sindh province the average annual emergy of the agriculture production of sindh is 4 94e 22 sej yr in which in terms of relative emergy shares of all the other outputs of agriculture was decrease except cotton 3 oil cops 9 poultry 92 and eggs 40 are provided in tables supplementary materials among decline relative emergy portion of agriculture productions barley and millet decrease by 65 each the average highest combine emergy portion for the agriculture outputs are cotton 24 63 followed by wheat 23 19 whereas the lowest average emergy share was for potato and tobacco 0 0001 each in sindh on the other hand the annual average emergy share was declined for maize 23 barely 44 beans 68 and potato 37 while the for the rest the their absolute emergy value was increase 3 4 3 emergy output for khyber pakhtunkhwa province the average annual emergy values for agriculture production for khyber pakhtunkhwa is 7 642e 22 sej yr are provide in tables supplementary materials among all agriculture

declined the highest percentage increase change is found in fish production which increase 651 while the lowest increase change is found in wheat production which is 5 the highest emergy percentage is 22 62 for maize production whereas the lowest emergy percentage 0 00003 for hemp move on the specific emergy values which increase for all the agriculture products except for oil crops barely millet beans hemp potato and fruit productions which was in state of decline 3 4 4 emergy output for baluchistan province the average annual emergy value for agriculture production is 2 25e 22 sej yr of baluchistan province are provided in tables supplementary materials the average combine shares of agriculture products increase such as millet 168 beans 72 vegetables 37 meat 4 poultry 98 and eggs 43 whereas all other agriculture productions declined the highest production is recorded as 28 87 for fruit production while the lowest is recorded as 0 003 for millet production the absolute average emergy share of agriculture production increase for all agriculture products except for sugarcane oil crops barely and potato which declined by 2 49 35 and 50 respectively 3 5 emergy based indicators fig 6 and 7 show the trends of selected emergy based indicators for the selected provinces during the selected time period in punjab the situation of eyr ratio was 1 12 in 2001 and 1 11 in 2015 with an annual decrease of 1 06 similarly the elr ratio was 1 71 in 2001 and 2 09 in the year 2015 and increase with an annual growth rate of 1 the annual average value of eir was 8 6 and increase annually with a growth rate of 1 the esi nrp and n esr annual average values was 0 5 34 34 and 0 07 respectively and declined as 18 91 12 20 and 3 26 respectively in sindh province the average annual value of eyr elr eir esi nrp n esr ratio were 1 07 9 5 13 9 0 11 90 36 0 03 respectively the elr eir and nrp ratio was increase by 17 31 and 1 respectively whereas the eyr esi and n esr ratio was declined by 2 16 and 22 respectively in khyber pakhtunkhwa province the annual average value for the selected emergy indicator such as eyr elr eir esi nrp n esr ratio are 1 13 4 78 7 52 0 24 82 32 and 0 09 respectively in khyber pakhtunkhwa the emergy ratio such as eyr esi and n esr decrease by 4 36 and 28 respectively while the elr eir and nrp increase by 49 38 and 8 respectively similarly in baluchistan province the average annual value for the selected emergy base indictors are 1 17 5 26 5 73 0 22 83 97 and 0 12 for eyr elr eir esi nrp n esr ratio respectively the emergy ratio such as eyr esi and n esr for baluchistan were decline by 3 11 and 21 respectively whereas the elr eir and nrp were rise by 10 20 and 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 emergy inputs this study express that among all major inputs the largest emergy share is for fn inputs followed by fr inputs for all selected provinces the average percentage of fn inputs for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan was 61 44 88 82 80 88 and 79 59 with an average annual increase of 4 2 9 and 2 respectively such increase was due to the area under cultivation of each province such as punjab accounts 73 of arable land sindh account 14 khyber pakhtunkhwa account 7 and baluchistan account 5 gop 2015a in addition the agricultural production of pakistan is mainly from punjab followed by sindh that is the reason pakistan focused its all agricultural modernization measure in punjab and sindh followed by khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan khan 2012 gop 2015a b zulfiqar and thapa 2017 among all the fn belong inputs the average percent of consumptions of diesel input for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan decline by 81 78 75 and 81 respectively such decrease in diesel consumption is due to increasing trends of electrification in agriculture ali et al 2019 whereas the average annual percent of all other fn belongs inputs were increase for all provinces especially the labors as agriculture is main source of income for rural population in pakistan rehman 2012 agriculture machinery for agricultural mechanization khan 2012 followed by fertilizers inputs for maximum agricultural production hussain 2012 the average annual emergy percent of fr inputs for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan were 28 14 6 23 9 17 and 5 41 respectively the largest emergy percent share from fr belongs inputs was water consumptions for irrigation purposes which was 96 88 95 and 96 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan and their annual average share was increase by 3 5 0 001 and 55 respectively such increasing trends is mainly because presently around about 90 of pakistan fresh water is consumed in agricultural purpose and according the estimate the country between 2020 and 2035 will become water scarce altaf et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 4 2 emergy outputs on average the agriculture productions output in punjab province such as wheat rice cotton oil crops barley tobacco beans hemp vegetables and fruits are among the highest percent share of 77 32 whereas the remaining 22 67 shares are for maize sugarcane millet potato meat poultry egg and inland fish productions the highest increased was recorded annually for maize production which is about 10 time more increase followed by poultry and sugarcane this is because the primary focused of farmers to increase the production of cereal crops leads to meet the local demands of food security of a country as mainly the pakistan main agriculture production is from punjab and also the soil characteristics of the province which is clay loam and sandy loam attributed for the production of such crops gop 2015a khan 2004 the annual output decrease change was recorded for hemp which was recorded as 99 decrease fallowed by barley and beans such decrease in selected crops was due the poor crop diversification only reliant on cereal crops sajjad and parasad 2014 zulfiqar and thapa 2017 sin sindh province among all the agriculture production outputs wheat cotton oil crops poultry and eggs got the highest share of 63 93 and their annual share increase by 1 3 9 92 and 40 respectively whereas the remaining agriculture productions output is around 37 and also their annual percent share decline mainly because growing of cereals crops for country food security and shifting of famers towards cash crops such as cotton etc gop 2013a in kpk province the highest share of outputs is 59 11 for wheat cotton meat poultry eggs and inland fish production and their annual share also increase while all other agriculture outputs are around 40 and their annual share declined in which hemp decline by 88 in kpk around 70 of land is use for cultivation of wheat use for household consumption leading the lowest crop diversification also the area is biophysically diverse which lead to not cultivated crops for commercial scale as well as unavailability of agricultural inputs weak network of transportation and weak transportation and unavailability of water for irrigation purposes gop 2011 gop 2015 khan 2012 in baluchistan province the highest percent shares of agriculture output are 53 27 for cotton millet beans vegetables meat poultry and eggs and their annual output share for each product also increase in which millet output was increase maximum of 168 followed by poultry and eggs production whereas the rest of outputs was on around 46 and their annual percent share for each outputs was declined in which the maximum declined rate was for potato production which was around 68 followed by oil crops similarly baluchistan province is a mountainous area having similar biophysical characteristics of kpk where mostly the area is rain fed the adverse environmental situation such droughts and less rain in sowing period in past couple years lead decrease in the production of cereal crops such as wheat maize rice etc gop 2010 gop 2013a 4 3 comparisons among selected provinces and other previous studies as shown by table 2 the average value of eyr during the years 2001 2015 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 1 11 1 07 1 13 and 1 17 respectively which are almost the same as this indicator shows the production contributions to the economic sector of the country regions david et al 2018 the comparison with other studies were based on the similar application of emergy based indicators and same agriculture inputs classification such as r n fr and fn when comparing with previous studies evaluates by various researchers for different countries and regions almost greater than the selected regions such as 1 43 for india for the 2002 2012 ali et al 2019 1 34 average value for hainan china liu et al 2019 1 16 for campania italy for the year 2010 ghisellini et al 2014 the average value of elr indicator for the year 2001 2015 for the punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 1 9 9 55 4 78 and 5 26 respectively it shows that punjab province is under the minimum environmental pressure and sindh province is under the maximum environmental pressure from the non renewable resource exploitation liu et al 2019 when comparing with previous studies of different regions the highest value of elr is 32 65 in luancheng county china due the maximum usage of non renewable resources ma et al 2015 and 10 43 in italy in 1989 ulgiati et al 1993 whereas in other regions the elr indicator values was somehow similar level to this study such as 8 345 elr value in ansai shaanxi china for corn soybean crop rotation liu et al 2019 the value of eir indicator for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 8 65 13 99 7 52 and 5 73 respectively when comparing the eir indicator value of this with other previous studies for different regions such as 13 1 for denmark rydberg and haden 2006 24 7 for india ali et al 2019 which shows that the agriculture productions of this study was well in the market due to their lower economic cost ma et al 2015 the average value of esi indicator for the year 2001 2015 for punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 0 59 0 11 0 24 and 0 22 respectively indicating almost similar when comparing with previous studies of different regions except yanchi china 8 55 wang et al 2014 and jiangsu china 1 11 liu and li 2005 as higher values of this indicators indicates the higher sustainability ghisellini et al 2014 liu et al 2019 the average nrp indicator value of punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan are 34 54 90 36 82 32 and 83 97 respectively showing that punjab province is more sustainable and sindh is unsustainable as sustainable agriculture supports less use dependent on non renewable resources liu et al 2019 4 4 agriculture challenges and policy implications agriculture sector in pakistan is one of the main income source for rural peoples and also plays an important role in the country economy agriculture depends upon humans inputs mainly purchased renewables and non renewable inputs to properly functions and provide the agriculture products swinton et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 among such inputs in the selected provinces i e punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan the average fertilizers usage was found to be 32 28 17 and 18 respectively which shows an increasing trends of usage during the selected years on one hand their excessive usage produces more agriculture production but on the other hand it degrades land and water resources which is reflected in case of pakistan where such excessive usage of synthetic fertilizers environmental related problems and effects sustainability of the agriculture production system zulfiqar and thapa 2017 agriculture machinery increases by 27 in punjab and almost increase two fold in sindh province whereas in kpk and baluchistan provinces the agriculture machinery share are 2 each which has slightly increase over the selected periods all these machinery was just limited to the tractors with cultivators in pakistan which sometime are not present during a specific time of cultivation for poor farmers because of their unaffordable prices and lack of such proper agriculture technologies negatively affects agriculture productions devendra et al 2008 tewari et al 2012 the pesticides usage in all selected provinces decrease due to the awareness in farmers as previously it was due to the farmer s wasteful usage ali et al 2019 the water use for irrigations purposes in punjab sindh kpk and baluchistan among all inputs are 30 5 9 and 4 respectively in pakistan for agriculture purposes fresh water is used but actually the water is one of the scarce resources and according to the experts the country will be water scarce in future if significant conservation and protection measures were not established altaf et al 2009 ali et al 2019 in addition the country did not have modern ways irrigation resulting maximum quantity of water loss mainly due to fading and leaching azam and shafiq 2017 another issue in pakistan is the salinity mainly due to excessive usage of ground water for agriculture purposes especially in sindh and baluchistan provinces memon and thapa 2010 pakistan ranks 8th in term of salinity affected countries fao 2006 along with salinity areas pakistan also faces natural disasters such as drought in baluchistan and floods during monsoon season which mostly destroy the agriculture crops thereby causing damages to the agriculture productions and also increase economic cost zulfiqar and thapa 2017 gop 2015 shah et al 2019 in pakistan 2010 the most devastating floods in the history of pakistan destroy billion acres of arable land and agricultural loss of 2 9 billion azam and shafiq 2017 the electricity usage increase and diesel usage decrease during the year which as due to the unaffordable price of diesel and also due to the decrease of electricity consumptions prices for farmers by government weak infrastructure such as lack of storage facilities and insufficient transportation facilities is another problem faced by pakistan which create agriculture growth disturbance and also create difficulties for farmer s to transport the agriculture products to markets united nations development program 2003 in pakistan various projects were initiated by the new government federal and provincial government including five year national plan for enhancing conservation development of agriculture water sectors and reduced poverty gop 2015 the new government in pakistan initiated 13 agriculture and water developmental projects that will increase the yield of major crops for export to reduce the food security in a country and also to construct the water dams both small and large for electricity as well as to conserve and store the water for irrigation flood control and drought related emergency disaster the express tribune 2019 a project titled prime minister agriculture package was also initiated to support the small farmers through providing direct money soft loan for enhancing and prosper the life of small farmers under such projects the various agriculture facilities will be provided for the farmers such as better quality of seeds cheaper electricity for tube wells lng liquefied natural gas for fertilizers companies and many more to achieve the goals of agriculture productions per hectare and minimize the usage of minimum agriculture inputs gop 2015 several other projects related to agriculture are under progress with the collaborations of chinese government to bring the poor people out of poverty and also to attain the goals of food security dawn 2017 ali et al 2019 along with such projects educational related projects will also to be need to develop the skill knowledge of farmers regarding sustainability ali et al 2018 besides it will reduce the agriculture related issues in the country enhances the agriculture productions reduced poverty through providing jobs opportunities for rural people and will help in food security through achieving higher amount of yields 5 conclusion in pakistan agriculture is considered the backbone of the country s economy and provides more than 60 of employment opportunities for rural peoples in this study we evaluated the sustainability of the agriculture production system in four provinces of pakistan including punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan through emergy accounting analysis from the period of 2001 to 2015 the main finding of the study was in all provinces the maximum portion among all inputs were fn purchase non renewable inputs and fr purchase renewables input among in fn comprise inputs the largest portion was for labors agriculture machinery and fertilizer inputs while in fr comprise inputs the largest share was for water use for irrigation purposes in all provinces in punjab and sindh among fn comprise inputs the labor pesticides and diesel were found decreased while in khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan the pesticides diesel and electricity were found to decline this indicates that in a selected time period farmer s awareness leads to the reduction of the use of pesticides the decline of labor indicates a lack of proper facilities for farmers to get efficient agriculture production diesel dependency leads due to the unavailability of facilities of electricity in regions the agriculture performance through emergy based indicators in which the nrp ratio for punjab was declined by 12 while for sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan it seems to increase by 1 8 and 1 respectively that s why the eir values were lower in punjab while it was higher in other selected provinces the esi values were a decline for punjab sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan by 18 91 16 19 35 51 and 11 21 respectively with an average value of 0 51 0 11 0 22 and 0 21 respectively indicates an increase in punjab than other provinces this study was basically based on the secondary data collected from various governmental reports statistical yearbooks for each province agriculture statistics and various other reports all the calculation was based on such data and specific uevs was collected from various literatures which was the limitation of the study to calculate the averages emergy values of specific agriculture products based on such emergy values the overall performance including sustainability environmental load etc was evaluated in each province through emergy based indicators in a selected time period as the emergy methods assess the overall efficiency and sustainability of agriculture productions system by means of resources usage contribution of nature and human evaluates the cost of environment and helps the policy makers to find the important role of ecosystem on agriculture production system therefore this study will provide resource utilization in agriculture that will help for the policy makers and government agencies on their ongoing agriculture related challenges and projects related to improve the efficiency of the agriculture production systems poverty reduction providing employment in agriculture and food security increase the production efficiency of agriculture credit authorship contribution statement syed mahboob shah methodology validation writing
