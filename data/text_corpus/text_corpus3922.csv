19610,the highly volatile methanethiol mt with an extremely low odor threshold and distinctive putrid smell is often identified as a major odorous compound generated under anaerobic conditions as an intermediate compound in the course of anaerobic digestion the extent of mt emission is closely related to the time of anaerobic reaction in this study lab scale anaerobic digesters were operated at solids retention time srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days to investigate the effect of srt on mt emission the experimental results demonstrated a bell shaped curve of mt emission versus srt with a peak around 20 days srt in order to understand this srt effect a kinetic model was developed to describe mt production and utilization dynamics in the course of anaerobic digestion and calibrated with the experimental results collected from this study the model outcome revealed that the high protein content in the feed sludge together with the large maintenance coefficient of mt fermenters are responsible for the peak mt emission emergence in the range of typical srt used for anaerobic digestion a further analysis of the kinetic model shows that it can be extensively simplified with reasonable approximation to a form that anaerobic digestion practitioners could easily use to predict the mt and srt relationship graphical abstract image keywords anaerobic digestion mathematical

vs volatile solids 1 introduction volatile organic sulfur compounds voscs such as methanethiol mt dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are major odorous compounds identified in wastewater treatment practices associated with anaerobic conditions including sewage conveyance sludge composting anaerobic digestion biosolids dewatering and land application chen et al 2005 hort et al 2013 park and novak 2013 wang et al 2015 among these voscs mt is regarded as the most important odorous compound because of its relatively low odor threshold as well as high volatility feilberg et al 2010 j de bruyn et al 1995 indeed mt is the only vosc regulated by occupational safety and health administration standard for its adverse health effects even at a very low exposure limit e g 10 ppm osha 2012 mt is also the only vosc directly formed from the microbial fermentation of sulfur containing proteins more specifically the amino acid methionine chen et al 2005 higgins et al 2006 it was recognized that the presence of methanogens potentially leads to a lower net mt emission for their utilization of mt the utilization mechanism has been largely attributed to the mt metabolism by methanogens particularly methylotrophic methanogens isolated from freshwater kiene et al 1986 marine and salt lake sediments finster et al 1992 as well as anaerobic digesters de bok et al 2006 since mt is an intermediate compound serving as both the product and substrate of the microbial community in anaerobic digesters it can be hypothesized that the extent of mt emission can be controlled through the optimization of anaerobic reaction kinetics for anaerobic digestion systems solids retention time srt is one of the most fundamental design and operating parameters it determines the population activity as well as the structure of the microbial community in anaerobic digesters and hence the formation and utilization of mt jang et al 2014 shin et al 2010 tian cheng and noike 1994 vanwonterghem et al 2015 with regard to the influence of srt on microbial growth it is well known that increasing the srt can reduce microbial growth rates and increase the fraction of substrate allocated for non growth related maintenance activities such as maintenance of cell integrity and transmembrane gradients of the solute and also the turnover of proteins ghosh and pohland 1974 low and chase 1999 wei et al 2003 significantly higher maintenance related substrate consumption has been observed for many fermentative bacteria at relatively long srts boender et al 2009 ercan et al 2013 goffin et al 2010 overkamp et al 2015 since methionine is biologically converted to the odorous compound mt understanding the effect of srt on maintenance energy allocation and methionine utilization efficiency can potentially lead to the development of mt odor control strategies mathematical modeling is an effective tool to give insights into kinetic behaviors and interpret mechanistic unknowns currently there is very limited kinetic information about mt formation and degradation out of the two existing literature about mt kinetics in wastewater treatment du and parker 2012 simplified mt turnover in anaerobic methionine incubation as a second order kinetics the study by sun et al 2015 modeled mt degradation but not production in sewers biofilms to our knowledge there is still no theoretical kinetic modeling framework available for addressing the effect of srt on mt turnover in anaerobic digestion therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of srt on mt emissions under anaerobic conditions through kinetic modeling to achieve this goal we operated six lab scale anaerobic digesters in semi continuous mode at srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days respectively a mathematical model was developed to describe mt formation and utilization as a function of srt based on the growth kinetics of relevant microbial communities the model was calibrated with experimental results and the maintenance energy requirement was evaluated within the model comparative experiments with inhibitory compound addition were also carried out with the aim of examining the possible methionine catabolism pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digester setup six lab scale anaerobic digesters each with a constant liquid volume of 10 liters and a headspace of 20 liters were operated in semi continuous mode under mesophilic conditions 35 5 0 3 c the digesters were mixed by recirculating biogas from the headspace to the bottom of the reactor with a gas flow rate around 1 l min 1 the biogas production was monitored using tipping bucket meters archae press nashville usa coupled with automatic data loggers the digesters were inoculated with digested sludge from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester from a local wastewater treatment plant each digester was continuously operated for 7 months with srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days the feed sludge consists of thickened primary and secondary sludge from a local treatment plant blended with a dry mass ratio of 62 38 2 2 chemical analysis gas samples collected from the headspaces of either digesters or serum bottles used in this study were measured for methane and mt contents using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector hewlett packard 5890 series ii palo alto california and a 60 m long capillary column with a 0 53 mm diameter agilent db 1 santa clara california headspace gas samples were collected using a 1 ml gas tight syringe hamilton reno nevada standard gases airgas inc radnor pennsylvania were used to develop calibration curves and quantify methane and mt the volatile solids vs and volatile fatty acids were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 the vs content in the blended sludge was relatively stable 2 8 0 25 during the entire study period the protein content in feed sludge 11 85 0 25 g l 1 and mixed liquor was determined using a modified lowry protein assay kit piercemt thermo scientific massachusetts 2 3 inhibition experiment in order to give insight into the mt turnover pathways two inhibitory compounds were employed in this experiment to block either mt production or mt utilization pathway so as to investigate one of the two pathways at a time 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes is an inhibitor that only selectively inhibits the activity of methanogens but not other anaerobes zinder et al 1984 we used bes to block the methanogenic utilization of mt briefly 15 mm bes was added into serum bottles to inhibit mt to methane conversion the over 100 times higher mt emission and negligible methane production measured following the bes addition were used as an indicator of the successful inhibition of methanogenic utilization of mt by bes as for the blockage of mt production it is known that there are mainly two types of metabolism employed by anaerobes to convert methionine to mt namely the stickland reaction or the single amino acid degradation barker 1981 a major difference between the two types of metabolism is that the stickland reaction is dependent on coupled amino acids acting as both hydrogen donors and acceptors while the single amino acid degradation requires the presence of alternative hydrogen acceptors such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens nagase and matsuo 1982 single amino acid degradation can be carried out either by the lyase or the transaminase catalyzed reactions wolle et al 2006 it should be pointed out that pyridoxal 5 phosphate plp is a coenzyme required by both lyases and transaminases to produce mt from methionine wolle et al 2006 aminooxyacetic acid aoa is an inhibitor of plp dependent enzymes functioning by attacking the schiff linkage between plp and the enzymes beeler and churchich 1976 it should be noted that plp is not an essential cofactor for the stickland reaction in which the amino group of methionine is removed through dehydrogenase nisman 1954 consequently adding aoa is supposed to only block mt formation from transaminase or lyase catalyzed degradation of methionine but not from the coupled stickland reaction hence 2 mm aoa was added in addition to 15 mm bes to check whether mt production can be blocked again only single amino acid degradation but not the stickland reaction can be blocked by aoa so the use of aoa will help us verify the mt production pathway the significant drop of mt production following aoa and bes addition was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of aoa inhibition both inhibition studies were carried out in 300 ml serum bottles containing 100 ml sludge collected from corresponding digesters these serum bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then incubated in an incubator shaker maxq shke420 hp thermal thermo scientific massachusetts for 24 h at 35 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of srt on mt concentration and emission anaerobic digestion of blended municipal sludge was carried out in six completely mixed anaerobic digesters for 7 months at srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days as shown in fig 1 both mt concentrations and mt emission rates demonstrated a bell shaped pattern with srts the mt concentration and emission rate increased along with srt from 15 to around 20 25 days when they peaked at 0 18 mg l 1 and 0 0023 mg l 1 h 1 respectively after then both mt concentration and the emission rate decreased as the srt further increased it should be noted that the peak mt emission rate was four to eight times the values at lower 15 days and upper 50 days boundary of the srt range investigated in this study fig 1 suggesting that mt from anaerobic digesters running at srt 20 25 days are likely to be more problematic 3 2 effect of srt on digester performance as shown in fig 2 a and b the methane content and the vs reduction varied very little under different srts within the ranges of 64 5 67 6 and 52 8 55 4 respectively the protein concentration decreased from 7 8 to 6 3 g l 1 with the increase in srt fig 2b the profiles of acetate concentration as well as methane and biogas emission rates monotonously decreased with an increase in srt i e as the srt increased from 15 to 50 d the methane and biogas production rates declined from 62 7 to 23 3 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 09 to 0 03 l l 1 h 1 respectively and the acetate concentration dropped from 336 mg l 1 to 115 mg l 1 over the same time period fig 2a and b the similar trend between the profiles of biogas methane and acetate indicates the predominant role of acetate in driving the production of methane which is a major component of biogas 3 3 mt production and utilization since mt is an intermediate substrate its concentration measured from anaerobic digesters as shown in fig 1 is the net result of concurrent production and utilization the two processes have to be separated to investigate the respective kinetics the mt production rate was investigated by inhibiting methanogenesis using bes as shown in fig 3 a the methane production was almost completely blocked as compared to the control without bes addition due to the lack of mt utilization by active methanogens in this scenario the mt emission rate in fig 3b became two orders of magnitude greater than that in fig 1 without bes addition even though the trends of the two bell shaped profiles look similar in relation to srt it is noteworthy that mt degradation by methanogens is not the only pathway of mt utilization in anaerobic digestion according to higgins et al 2006 mt methylation to form dimethyl sulfide might be an alternative the two magnitude higher mt emission rate observed in fig 3b as a result of methanogen inhibition implies that methanogens were indeed the primary mt utilizers in these anaerobic digesters as a matter of fact similar observation was also reported in previous studies i e the rate of methylotrophic metabolism of mt by methanogens was magnitudes higher than that of the mt methylation du and parker 2012 sun et al 2015 the rapid and dramatic increase of mt emission rate in response to the inactivation of methanogens implies that mt emission can be used as a sensitive indicator to show early warning of possible methanogenesis inhibition in anaerobic digestion in a separate batch experiment aoa was added in addition to bes to inhibit plp a coenzyme essential to catalyze transaminase or lyase based degradation of methionine wolle et al 2006 there was little mt produced following aoa addition fig 3b which indicates that most of the mt was produced from either the transaminase or lyase reactions but not from the stickland reaction that does not need plp nisman 1954 3 4 model development 3 4 1 model assumptions following assumptions were made in the model development 1 as indicated by the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 3 mt was produced mainly by microbial fermentation of methionine and then utilized by methanogens thus these two processes are considered as the dominant mt turnover pathways in the model development 2 to reduce model complexity acetotrophic methanogensis is considered as a predominate methane production pathway as was commonly assumed in other studies bernard et al 2001 koch et al 2010 lopez and borzacconi 2009 müller et al 2002 noykova and gyllenberg 2000 3 the property of feed sludge was assumed to be stable as indicated by the relatively small variations of vs 2 8 0 25 and protein 11 85 0 25 g l 1 contents measured throughout the study period 3 4 2 model framework based on the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 3 mt was produced by microbial fermentation of methionine and then utilized by methanogens the kinetic rates and stoichiometric coefficients of the processes considered in current model framework are summarized in table 1 following two kinetic equations are employed to describe the mt production and utilization kinetics respectively 1 v m e t μ m t x m t y x m t m e t 2 v m t μ c h 4 m t x c h 4 y x c h 4 m t in which v m e t and v m t are the microbial uptake rates of methionine and mt μ mt and μ c h 4 mt are the theoretical specific growth rates of mt producers mt fermenters and utilizers methanogens x m t and x c h 4 represent the concentrations of mt fermenters and methanogens y x m t m e t and y x c h 4 m t are their respective theoretical growth yields to calculate the specific growth rates of the mt producers and utilizers monod equations are applied in eqs 3 and 4 3 μ m t μ ˆ m t s m e t k m e t s m e t 4 μ c h 4 m t μ ˆ c h 4 m t s m t k m t s m t in which s m e t and s m t represent the concentrations of methionine and mt respectively μ ˆ m t and μ ˆ c h 4 m t are the theoretical maximum specific growth rates of mt producers and utilizers respectively likewise k met and k mt are their respective half saturated constants accordingly the dynamic turnover of methionine mt and methane in anaerobic digesters can be described by 5 d s m e t d t v m e t s m e t i n s m e t θ 6 d s m t d t s m t i n θ y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met v mt s m t θ v g s m t h c c 7 d s c h 4 d t s c h 4 i n θ y c h 4 x c h 4 μ c h 4 x c h 4 s c h 4 θ v c h 4 in which t represents time θ is the srt of the completely mixed anaerobic digesters s c h 4 represent the concentrations of methane the influent methionine mt and methane concentrations if any are represented by s m e t i n s m t i n and s c h 4 i n h c c is the dimensionless henry s constant for mt y m t x m t and y c h 4 x c h 4 are the product yields defined as the amount of mt and methane formed along with unit biomass growth v g and v c h 4 represent the biogas and methane production rates from unit mixed liquor μ c h 4 is the specific growth rate of methanogens on acetate given mt and methane are only formed in anaerobic conditions we can assume their concentrations in the fresh feed sludge were extremely low i e s m t i n 0 and s c h 4 i n 0 also the dissolved methane in digester effluent should be negligible as compared to those vaporized for their extremely low solubility wiesenburg and guinasso 2002 i e s c h 4 0 then at the steady state condition when all concentrations were stabilized in anaerobic digesters eqs 5 7 can be simplified as 8 v m e t s m e t i n s m e t θ 9 s m t θ v g s m t h c c y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met v mt 10 v c h 4 y c h 4 x c h 4 μ c h 4 x c h 4 in completely mixed anaerobic digesters used in this study the apparent specific growth rates of all anaerobes should be equal to the reciprocal of srt namely θ 1 therefore the apparent specific growth rates in digesters with srt ranging from 15 to 50 days used in this study should fall within the low range of 0 0008 0 0028 h 1 which are indeed much lower than the typical theoretical maximum growth rates of amino acid fermenters 0 1 0 7 h 1 and methanogens 0 004 0 33 h 1 reported in literature batstone et al 2002 under such slow growth conditions the impact of microbial maintenance energy should become important and must be taken into consideration because a significant portion of the substrate energy has to be allocated for microbial maintenance in this case thus according to pirt 1965 the theoretical specific growth rate can be described as the sum of the apparent specific growth rate and the growth independent maintenance rate as given in eq 11 11 μ m t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t in which m m t is the maintenance energy coefficient of mt producers since most of the methane produced in anaerobic digesters is from acetate as a substrate e g 70 batstone et al 2002 we tentatively assume acetate utilizing methanogens are major mt utilizers for the sake of model simplification the suitability of this simplification is verified in later section a comparison of fig 1 to 2 shows that the concentrations of acetate were three orders of magnitude higher than those of the mt obviously acetate was a major substrate for methanogens and mt was only utilized as a minor substrate then the theoretical specific growth rate of the methanogens can be approximated as 12 μ c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c in which m c h 4 is the maintenance energy coefficient of methanogens y x c h 4 a c is the growth yield of methanogens on acetate accordingly eq 13 can be derived from eqs 3 and 11 to calculate s m e t likewise eq 14 can be derived from eqs 10 and 12 to determine x c h 4 13 s m e t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t k m e t μ ˆ m t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t 14 x c h 4 v c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c y c h 4 x c h 4 for the determination of s m t eq 15 can be derived from eqs 2 8 and 9 15 s m t y m t x m t y x m t m e t s m e t i n s m e t θ 1 θ v g h c c μ c h 4 m t x c h 4 y x c h 4 m t s m t in which μ c h 4 m t can be expressed by eq 4 s m e t and x c h 4 can be expressed by eqs 13 and 14 respectively s m e t i n can be estimated from the measured influent protein content 11 85 0 25 g l 1 by using a typical methionine composition 46 120 mg g 1 in sewage sludge protein lau 1981 quitain et al 2002 subrahmanyam et al 1960 3 4 3 determination of the maintenance coefficient of methanogens technically eq 15 can be used along with eqs 13 and 14 for mt concentration and emission predictions while most of the kinetic coefficients used in eqs 13 15 can be adapted from the classic anaerobic digestion model no 1 framework batstone et al 2002 as listed in table 2 several are rarely studied or reported the maintenance coefficient m c h 4 of methanogens in eq 14 is one of those in order to determine m c h 4 eq 12 is transformed to eq 17 and eq 16 is used to calculate μ c h 4 plotting its term θ μ c h 4 versus θ y x c h 4 a c in fig 4 a by using s ac data from fig 2 a linear plot r2 0 95 with a y intercept of 1 as predicted by eq 17 results in a slope of m c h 4 0 0282 mg mg 1 h 1 it is noteworthy that this maintenance coefficient value is not much different from those reported for regular anaerobes ercan et al 2015 the acceptable fit of experimental data in fig 4a suggests that eqs 12 and 14 used in this study offer suitable simulation of both the growth and maintenance kinetics of methanogens accordingly x c h 4 can be estimated in fig 4b by substituting parameters listed in table 2 and the measured v c h 4 in fig 2 into eq 14 fig 4b shows that x c h 4 only slightly decreased along with the srt increase 16 μ c h 4 μ ˆ c h 4 s a c k a c s a c in which μ ˆ c h 4 is the theoretical maximum specific growth rate of methanogens on acetate s a c is the acetate concentration k a c is the half saturated constant of acetate for methanogens 17 θ μ c h 4 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c 1 3 4 4 determination of the maximum specific mt utilization rate as for the kinetic coefficients of mt utilizers used in eqs 4 and 15 k m t 0 25 mg l 1 is probably the only one that has been reported previously sun et al 2015 i e neither μ ˆ c h 4 m t nor y x c h 4 m t is known in this regard we treated μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t as a single parameter and defined it as the specific maximum mt uptake rate by methanogens then eq 18 can be derived from eqs 2 4 and 9 terms on the left hand side of eq 18 include mt formation rate y p m t y mt v m e t mt discharge rate s m t θ and mt emission rate v g s m t h c c the net difference between these mt turnover rates is equal to the mt utilization rate calculated on the right hand side of eq 18 it should be noted that the only unknown in eq 18 is the term μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t which is the slope of the trend line going through origin in fig 5 the straight line with r2 0 91 plotted with experimental data in fig 5 using eq 18 implies that the mt utilization kinetic model used in this study is able to provides a good fit to the experimental data thereby μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t 0 0025 mg mg 1 h 1 can be determined from fig 5 hereto we have all the necessary coefficients for s mt prediction in eq 15 18 y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met s m t θ v g s m t h c c μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t s m t x c h 4 s m t k m t 3 5 model calibration based on the kinetic model developed above three different sets of experimental data in response to srt were used for parameter estimations the model parameters are shown in table 2 in which m c h 4 was estimated using the acetate concentration based on eq 17 μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t was estimated from the mt production data obtained in the inhibition experiment based on eq 18 and y m t x m t k met as well as m mt were determined from the gases production rates of the digesters based on eq 15 the uncertainty evaluation of the model calibration was carried out based on the monte carlo approach which is particularly suitable for non linear model with a relatively small sample size donoso bravo et al 2011 lopez and borzacconi 2010 müller et al 2002 the theoretical model in eq 15 was used to predict the mt concentration in bulk solution of anaerobic digesters fig 6 a shows that a decent agreement was reached between the theoretical prediction of eq 15 and the experimental results of the steady state mt concentrations measured at various srts in fig 1 with r2 0 89 which verified the adequacy of the kinetic model developed from this study for the description of mt turnover in anaerobic digesters the capacity of eq 15 in predicting experimental results also suggests that the assumptions and simplification made for the model development are acceptable 3 6 model simplification although eq 15 has been shown capable of providing appropriate prediction of mt concentration it appears to be too complicated to use for practitioners so we looked into the possibility of simplifying it as revealed in fig 6b the term μ c h 4 m t x c h 4 y x c h 4 m t s m t representing the specific mt utilization rate in eq 15 is almost 100 times greater than the sum of the terms representing the specific mt discharge rate 1 θ and emission rate v g h c c indicating that the sum of the two terms 1 θ v g h c c is indeed negligible and can be ignored from the denominator of eq 15 moreover since the k mt 0 25 mg l 1 is much greater than the s mt 0 02 0 18 mg l 1 measured in fig 1 the monod type mt utilization kinetics in eq 4 is tentatively approximated as a first order expression namely μ ˆ c h 4 m t s m t k m t additionally as shown in fig 4b the methanogen population is relatively stable within the range of typical srt used for anaerobic digestion the term representing x c h 4 in eq 14 namely v c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c y c h 4 x c h 4 can be also treated as a constant therefore eq 15 can be simplified as 19 s m t k 1 θ s m e t i n s m e t in which k is a constant equal to y m t x m t y x m t m e t 1 θ v g h c c μ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t s m t x c h 4 eq 19 suggests that the steady state mt concentration in anaerobic digesters is primarily determined by the srt and the influent methionine concentration in order to determine the accuracy of this simplified model in eq 19 its prediction of s m t along with srt is compared with that of eq 15 in fig 6a as can be seen although the simplified model predicts a slightly lower srt corresponding to the peak mt emission the two predictions are almost identical confirming the validity of the simplified model in eq 19 in providing acceptable simulation of the steady state mt concentrations in anaerobic digesters 3 7 model implications 3 7 1 model prediction of the srt that produces peak mt emission although odor emission from anaerobic digestion can involve many compounds mt is often identified as the major odorous compound in wastewater treatment practices associated with anaerobic conditions chen et al 2005 du and parker 2012 hort et al 2013 novak et al 2006 park and novak 2013 wang et al 2015 for this regard we mainly focused on mt as a representative odorous compound in this study special safety and odor control measures should be taken towards the anaerobic digesters running at the srt that incurs peak mt emissions the peak mt emission occurs when s m t is in following relation with srt 20 d s m t d θ 0 substituting eqs 13 and 19 into eq 20 gives 21 θ p e a k 1 μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t in which θ p e a k is the srt corresponding to the peak mt emission since m m t y x m t m e t is a constant specific maintenance rate μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t can be interpreted as the maximum apparent specific growth rate that can be achieved under the maintenance condition typically a bioreactor will not operate at a srt shorter than the reciprocal of maximum apparent specific growth rate in order to avoid washout hence eq 21 can be reduced to 22 θ p e a k 1 μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t eq 22 indicates that the value of srt corresponding to the peak mt emission is actually influenced by s m e t i n i e the higher protein content presents in influent sludge the shorter solids retention time will be needed to reach the peak mt emission the θ p e a k in this study is around 20 d as shown in fig 1 3 7 2 effect of feed sludge protein content on the srt that produces peak mt emission eq 22 indicates that the value of srt corresponding to the peak mt emission θ p e a k is actually influenced by s m e t i n the higher protein content presents in influent sludge the shorter srt will be needed to reach the peak mt emission when s m e t i n k m e t eq 22 can be simplified as θ p e a k μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t 1 it should be realized that the term μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t represents the maximum apparent specific growth rate that the mt fermenters can possibly achieve thus the use of any θ μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t 1 will lead to the washout of mt fermenters and in turn the plunge of s mt as srt approaches the lower boundary of the bell shaped curve shown in fig 7 it should be noted that the s mt corresponding to this θ p e a k namely s mt peak is indeed at the maximum value that s mt can possibly reach due to the extremely high s m e t i n provided in this scenario as s m e t i n decreases it is shown in fig 7 that the s mt peak as a product will decrease accordingly while θ p e a k will increase taking a close look at the denominator of eq 22 one should easily see that s m e t i n is actually controlling the apparent specific growth rate corresponding to θ p e a k at a value that is μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t less than the maximum apparent specific growth rate the mt fermenters can possibly achieve namely μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t thus can be seen a decrease in s m e t i n will lead to a decline in apparent specific growth rate at the peak mt emission in eq 22 the reciprocal of which corresponds to the increase of θ p e a k as shown in fig 7 meanwhile according to eq 22 there also exists a minimum s m e t i n k m e t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t which is just enough to support the basic maintenance of mt fermenters by using the kinetic parameters listed in table 2 this minimum s m e t i n can be estimated to be around 100 mg l 1 which is indeed significantly lower than the s m e t i n value 1114 mg l 1 contained in the blended sludge used in this study hence the presence of s mt peak at extremely long θ p e a k is unlikely in reality even if this s mt peak was ever present at this minimum s m e t i n it should be in such an extremely low value as shown in fig 7 that does not need to be considered further in summary the value of θ p e a k is mainly determined by the s m e t i n value contained in the feed sludge one may use eq 22 to predict the θ p e a k so as to evaluate the odor potential for digesters operated at a certain srt 3 7 3 effect of maintenance coefficient on the srt that produces peak mt emission the maintenance mechanism for microbes is a trade off between survival and growth when under unfavorable conditions resources are more devoted to survival of microbes rather than reproduction nyström 2004 according to eq 11 high maintenance requirement will lead to higher theoretical specific growth rate μ m t under a given srt which in turn resulted in higher methionine consumption and mt production as described in eqs 1 and 6 for this reason although the maintenance coefficient is a constant but not a variable in the current model we would like to argue that the magnitude of m m t is indeed responsible for the presence of θ p e a k within the typical srt range used in anaerobic digestion as simulated in fig 8 using eq 19 microbes with larger maintenance coefficient m m t tend to have a longer θ p e a k and a lower s mt peak m m t is indeed a burden to the growth of mt fermenters i e when m m t is large more energy obtained from methionine utilization will be allocated for maintenance but not for growth and consequently a smaller apparent specific growth rate of mt fermenters will be resulted and so is the mt production rate since s m t is the net result of concurrent mt production and utilization larger m m t thus tends to give lower s mt peak as displayed in fig 8 due to the slowdown of mt production rate by large m m t burden it is also not difficult to understand that the mt production will reach equilibrium with a slower mt utilization rate at the steady state these slower mt production and utilization rates only occur in digesters running at a longer srt as shown in fig 8 conversely bacteria with a smaller m m t will have a θ p e a k so small that it will not show up in the typical srt range of anaerobic digesters for example the maintenance rate m y x s of mt fermenters estimated in this study is about 0 16 h 1 table 2 which is over 100 times greater than that of the acetate fermenters at 0 013 h 1 ghosh et al 1975 as a consequence the θ p e a k or in another words the bell shaped curve can only be observed for mt in fig 1 but not for acetate in fig 2b 3 8 implication on mt production pathways as summarized in fig 9 there are primarily three pathways for methionine fermentation to mt i the stickland reaction using coupled amino acids as both electron donors and acceptors to ferment methionine into mt along with propionate carbon dioxide and ammonia batstone et al 2002 ii the transamination reaction using transaminases to convert methionine to 2 oxo 4 methylthio butanoic acid kmba which is subsequently converted to mt along with α ketobutyric acid ammonia and hydrogen production bonnarme et al 2001 and iii the lyase reaction which directly converts methionine to mt α ketobutyric acid ammonia and hydrogen soda 1987 it should be pointed out that unlike stickland reaction both transaminaion and lyase reactions are single amino acid degradation pathways that require plp as a coenzyme for mt production from methionine wolle et al 2006 the fact that mt production was completely stopped when using aoa to inhibit the activity of plp in fig 3a suggests that stickland reaction is not a major pathway for mt production leaving the possibility to either transaminaion or lyase reaction the mt yield from methionine as calculated by y m t x m t y x m t m e t in table 2 is around 0 3218 mg mg 1 which is very close to the stoichiometric mt yield from methionine assuming mt is the only sulfurous product namely 0 3224 mg mg 1 such a complete conversion of methionine to mt just indicates that there was almost no kmba accumulation during the anaerobic digestion in view of the fact that transaminaion reaction always converts part of the methionine to kmba as shown in fig 9 it is our inference that lyase reaction might be the major pathway for methionine to mt conversion in anaerobic digesters 4 conclusions this study found that the mt emission rate follows a bell shaped pattern with srt in anaerobic digesters the subsequent inhibitory experiment showed that net mt emission is primarily determined by the dynamic concurrence of mt production and utilization in the course of anaerobic digestion further kinetic analysis of the mt dynamics revealed that the srt that produces this peak mt emission is likely controlled by the feed sludge protein content and the large maintenance coefficient of mt fermenters is an intrinsic cause of the peak emission in the typical range of srt used for anaerobic digestion a simplified kinetic model was derived and verified from this study for the prediction of mt concentration as well as the srt leading to peak mt emission the possible pathways responsible for mt production were also inferred and lyase catalyzed reaction appears to be responsible for methionine to mt conversion in anaerobic digesters operated in this study acknowledgement this research

19610,the highly volatile methanethiol mt with an extremely low odor threshold and distinctive putrid smell is often identified as a major odorous compound generated under anaerobic conditions as an intermediate compound in the course of anaerobic digestion the extent of mt emission is closely related to the time of anaerobic reaction in this study lab scale anaerobic digesters were operated at solids retention time srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days to investigate the effect of srt on mt emission the experimental results demonstrated a bell shaped curve of mt emission versus srt with a peak around 20 days srt in order to understand this srt effect a kinetic model was developed to describe mt production and utilization dynamics in the course of anaerobic digestion and calibrated with the experimental results collected from this study the model outcome revealed that the high protein content in the feed sludge together with the large maintenance coefficient of mt fermenters are responsible for the peak mt emission emergence in the range of typical srt used for anaerobic digestion a further analysis of the kinetic model shows that it can be extensively simplified with reasonable approximation to a form that anaerobic digestion practitioners could easily use to predict the mt and srt relationship graphical abstract image keywords anaerobic digestion mathematical

vs volatile solids 1 introduction volatile organic sulfur compounds voscs such as methanethiol mt dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are major odorous compounds identified in wastewater treatment practices associated with anaerobic conditions including sewage conveyance sludge composting anaerobic digestion biosolids dewatering and land application chen et al 2005 hort et al 2013 park and novak 2013 wang et al 2015 among these voscs mt is regarded as the most important odorous compound because of its relatively low odor threshold as well as high volatility feilberg et al 2010 j de bruyn et al 1995 indeed mt is the only vosc regulated by occupational safety and health administration standard for its adverse health effects even at a very low exposure limit e g 10 ppm osha 2012 mt is also the only vosc directly formed from the microbial fermentation of sulfur containing proteins more specifically the amino acid methionine chen et al 2005 higgins et al 2006 it was recognized that the presence of methanogens potentially leads to a lower net mt emission for their utilization of mt the utilization mechanism has been largely attributed to the mt metabolism by methanogens particularly methylotrophic methanogens isolated from freshwater kiene et al 1986 marine and salt lake sediments finster et al 1992 as well as anaerobic digesters de bok et al 2006 since mt is an intermediate compound serving as both the product and substrate of the microbial community in anaerobic digesters it can be hypothesized that the extent of mt emission can be controlled through the optimization of anaerobic reaction kinetics for anaerobic digestion systems solids retention time srt is one of the most fundamental design and operating parameters it determines the population activity as well as the structure of the microbial community in anaerobic digesters and hence the formation and utilization of mt jang et al 2014 shin et al 2010 tian cheng and noike 1994 vanwonterghem et al 2015 with regard to the influence of srt on microbial growth it is well known that increasing the srt can reduce microbial growth rates and increase the fraction of substrate allocated for non growth related maintenance activities such as maintenance of cell integrity and transmembrane gradients of the solute and also the turnover of proteins ghosh and pohland 1974 low and chase 1999 wei et al 2003 significantly higher maintenance related substrate consumption has been observed for many fermentative bacteria at relatively long srts boender et al 2009 ercan et al 2013 goffin et al 2010 overkamp et al 2015 since methionine is biologically converted to the odorous compound mt understanding the effect of srt on maintenance energy allocation and methionine utilization efficiency can potentially lead to the development of mt odor control strategies mathematical modeling is an effective tool to give insights into kinetic behaviors and interpret mechanistic unknowns currently there is very limited kinetic information about mt formation and degradation out of the two existing literature about mt kinetics in wastewater treatment du and parker 2012 simplified mt turnover in anaerobic methionine incubation as a second order kinetics the study by sun et al 2015 modeled mt degradation but not production in sewers biofilms to our knowledge there is still no theoretical kinetic modeling framework available for addressing the effect of srt on mt turnover in anaerobic digestion therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of srt on mt emissions under anaerobic conditions through kinetic modeling to achieve this goal we operated six lab scale anaerobic digesters in semi continuous mode at srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days respectively a mathematical model was developed to describe mt formation and utilization as a function of srt based on the growth kinetics of relevant microbial communities the model was calibrated with experimental results and the maintenance energy requirement was evaluated within the model comparative experiments with inhibitory compound addition were also carried out with the aim of examining the possible methionine catabolism pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digester setup six lab scale anaerobic digesters each with a constant liquid volume of 10 liters and a headspace of 20 liters were operated in semi continuous mode under mesophilic conditions 35 5 0 3 c the digesters were mixed by recirculating biogas from the headspace to the bottom of the reactor with a gas flow rate around 1 l min 1 the biogas production was monitored using tipping bucket meters archae press nashville usa coupled with automatic data loggers the digesters were inoculated with digested sludge from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester from a local wastewater treatment plant each digester was continuously operated for 7 months with srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days the feed sludge consists of thickened primary and secondary sludge from a local treatment plant blended with a dry mass ratio of 62 38 2 2 chemical analysis gas samples collected from the headspaces of either digesters or serum bottles used in this study were measured for methane and mt contents using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector hewlett packard 5890 series ii palo alto california and a 60 m long capillary column with a 0 53 mm diameter agilent db 1 santa clara california headspace gas samples were collected using a 1 ml gas tight syringe hamilton reno nevada standard gases airgas inc radnor pennsylvania were used to develop calibration curves and quantify methane and mt the volatile solids vs and volatile fatty acids were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 the vs content in the blended sludge was relatively stable 2 8 0 25 during the entire study period the protein content in feed sludge 11 85 0 25 g l 1 and mixed liquor was determined using a modified lowry protein assay kit piercemt thermo scientific massachusetts 2 3 inhibition experiment in order to give insight into the mt turnover pathways two inhibitory compounds were employed in this experiment to block either mt production or mt utilization pathway so as to investigate one of the two pathways at a time 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes is an inhibitor that only selectively inhibits the activity of methanogens but not other anaerobes zinder et al 1984 we used bes to block the methanogenic utilization of mt briefly 15 mm bes was added into serum bottles to inhibit mt to methane conversion the over 100 times higher mt emission and negligible methane production measured following the bes addition were used as an indicator of the successful inhibition of methanogenic utilization of mt by bes as for the blockage of mt production it is known that there are mainly two types of metabolism employed by anaerobes to convert methionine to mt namely the stickland reaction or the single amino acid degradation barker 1981 a major difference between the two types of metabolism is that the stickland reaction is dependent on coupled amino acids acting as both hydrogen donors and acceptors while the single amino acid degradation requires the presence of alternative hydrogen acceptors such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens nagase and matsuo 1982 single amino acid degradation can be carried out either by the lyase or the transaminase catalyzed reactions wolle et al 2006 it should be pointed out that pyridoxal 5 phosphate plp is a coenzyme required by both lyases and transaminases to produce mt from methionine wolle et al 2006 aminooxyacetic acid aoa is an inhibitor of plp dependent enzymes functioning by attacking the schiff linkage between plp and the enzymes beeler and churchich 1976 it should be noted that plp is not an essential cofactor for the stickland reaction in which the amino group of methionine is removed through dehydrogenase nisman 1954 consequently adding aoa is supposed to only block mt formation from transaminase or lyase catalyzed degradation of methionine but not from the coupled stickland reaction hence 2 mm aoa was added in addition to 15 mm bes to check whether mt production can be blocked again only single amino acid degradation but not the stickland reaction can be blocked by aoa so the use of aoa will help us verify the mt production pathway the significant drop of mt production following aoa and bes addition was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of aoa inhibition both inhibition studies were carried out in 300 ml serum bottles containing 100 ml sludge collected from corresponding digesters these serum bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then incubated in an incubator shaker maxq shke420 hp thermal thermo scientific massachusetts for 24 h at 35 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of srt on mt concentration and emission anaerobic digestion of blended municipal sludge was carried out in six completely mixed anaerobic digesters for 7 months at srts of 15 20 25 30 40 and 50 days as shown in fig 1 both mt concentrations and mt emission rates demonstrated a bell shaped pattern with srts the mt concentration and emission rate increased along with srt from 15 to around 20 25 days when they peaked at 0 18 mg l 1 and 0 0023 mg l 1 h 1 respectively after then both mt concentration and the emission rate decreased as the srt further increased it should be noted that the peak mt emission rate was four to eight times the values at lower 15 days and upper 50 days boundary of the srt range investigated in this study fig 1 suggesting that mt from anaerobic digesters running at srt 20 25 days are likely to be more problematic 3 2 effect of srt on digester performance as shown in fig 2 a and b the methane content and the vs reduction varied very little under different srts within the ranges of 64 5 67 6 and 52 8 55 4 respectively the protein concentration decreased from 7 8 to 6 3 g l 1 with the increase in srt fig 2b the profiles of acetate concentration as well as methane and biogas emission rates monotonously decreased with an increase in srt i e as the srt increased from 15 to 50 d the methane and biogas production rates declined from 62 7 to 23 3 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 09 to 0 03 l l 1 h 1 respectively and the acetate concentration dropped from 336 mg l 1 to 115 mg l 1 over the same time period fig 2a and b the similar trend between the profiles of biogas methane and acetate indicates the predominant role of acetate in driving the production of methane which is a major component of biogas 3 3 mt production and utilization since mt is an intermediate substrate its concentration measured from anaerobic digesters as shown in fig 1 is the net result of concurrent production and utilization the two processes have to be separated to investigate the respective kinetics the mt production rate was investigated by inhibiting methanogenesis using bes as shown in fig 3 a the methane production was almost completely blocked as compared to the control without bes addition due to the lack of mt utilization by active methanogens in this scenario the mt emission rate in fig 3b became two orders of magnitude greater than that in fig 1 without bes addition even though the trends of the two bell shaped profiles look similar in relation to srt it is noteworthy that mt degradation by methanogens is not the only pathway of mt utilization in anaerobic digestion according to higgins et al 2006 mt methylation to form dimethyl sulfide might be an alternative the two magnitude higher mt emission rate observed in fig 3b as a result of methanogen inhibition implies that methanogens were indeed the primary mt utilizers in these anaerobic digesters as a matter of fact similar observation was also reported in previous studies i e the rate of methylotrophic metabolism of mt by methanogens was magnitudes higher than that of the mt methylation du and parker 2012 sun et al 2015 the rapid and dramatic increase of mt emission rate in response to the inactivation of methanogens implies that mt emission can be used as a sensitive indicator to show early warning of possible methanogenesis inhibition in anaerobic digestion in a separate batch experiment aoa was added in addition to bes to inhibit plp a coenzyme essential to catalyze transaminase or lyase based degradation of methionine wolle et al 2006 there was little mt produced following aoa addition fig 3b which indicates that most of the mt was produced from either the transaminase or lyase reactions but not from the stickland reaction that does not need plp nisman 1954 3 4 model development 3 4 1 model assumptions following assumptions were made in the model development 1 as indicated by the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 3 mt was produced mainly by microbial fermentation of methionine and then utilized by methanogens thus these two processes are considered as the dominant mt turnover pathways in the model development 2 to reduce model complexity acetotrophic methanogensis is considered as a predominate methane production pathway as was commonly assumed in other studies bernard et al 2001 koch et al 2010 lopez and borzacconi 2009 müller et al 2002 noykova and gyllenberg 2000 3 the property of feed sludge was assumed to be stable as indicated by the relatively small variations of vs 2 8 0 25 and protein 11 85 0 25 g l 1 contents measured throughout the study period 3 4 2 model framework based on the experimental results shown in figs 1 and 3 mt was produced by microbial fermentation of methionine and then utilized by methanogens the kinetic rates and stoichiometric coefficients of the processes considered in current model framework are summarized in table 1 following two kinetic equations are employed to describe the mt production and utilization kinetics respectively 1 v m e t μ m t x m t y x m t m e t 2 v m t μ c h 4 m t x c h 4 y x c h 4 m t in which v m e t and v m t are the microbial uptake rates of methionine and mt μ mt and μ c h 4 mt are the theoretical specific growth rates of mt producers mt fermenters and utilizers methanogens x m t and x c h 4 represent the concentrations of mt fermenters and methanogens y x m t m e t and y x c h 4 m t are their respective theoretical growth yields to calculate the specific growth rates of the mt producers and utilizers monod equations are applied in eqs 3 and 4 3 μ m t μ ˆ m t s m e t k m e t s m e t 4 μ c h 4 m t μ ˆ c h 4 m t s m t k m t s m t in which s m e t and s m t represent the concentrations of methionine and mt respectively μ ˆ m t and μ ˆ c h 4 m t are the theoretical maximum specific growth rates of mt producers and utilizers respectively likewise k met and k mt are their respective half saturated constants accordingly the dynamic turnover of methionine mt and methane in anaerobic digesters can be described by 5 d s m e t d t v m e t s m e t i n s m e t θ 6 d s m t d t s m t i n θ y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met v mt s m t θ v g s m t h c c 7 d s c h 4 d t s c h 4 i n θ y c h 4 x c h 4 μ c h 4 x c h 4 s c h 4 θ v c h 4 in which t represents time θ is the srt of the completely mixed anaerobic digesters s c h 4 represent the concentrations of methane the influent methionine mt and methane concentrations if any are represented by s m e t i n s m t i n and s c h 4 i n h c c is the dimensionless henry s constant for mt y m t x m t and y c h 4 x c h 4 are the product yields defined as the amount of mt and methane formed along with unit biomass growth v g and v c h 4 represent the biogas and methane production rates from unit mixed liquor μ c h 4 is the specific growth rate of methanogens on acetate given mt and methane are only formed in anaerobic conditions we can assume their concentrations in the fresh feed sludge were extremely low i e s m t i n 0 and s c h 4 i n 0 also the dissolved methane in digester effluent should be negligible as compared to those vaporized for their extremely low solubility wiesenburg and guinasso 2002 i e s c h 4 0 then at the steady state condition when all concentrations were stabilized in anaerobic digesters eqs 5 7 can be simplified as 8 v m e t s m e t i n s m e t θ 9 s m t θ v g s m t h c c y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met v mt 10 v c h 4 y c h 4 x c h 4 μ c h 4 x c h 4 in completely mixed anaerobic digesters used in this study the apparent specific growth rates of all anaerobes should be equal to the reciprocal of srt namely θ 1 therefore the apparent specific growth rates in digesters with srt ranging from 15 to 50 days used in this study should fall within the low range of 0 0008 0 0028 h 1 which are indeed much lower than the typical theoretical maximum growth rates of amino acid fermenters 0 1 0 7 h 1 and methanogens 0 004 0 33 h 1 reported in literature batstone et al 2002 under such slow growth conditions the impact of microbial maintenance energy should become important and must be taken into consideration because a significant portion of the substrate energy has to be allocated for microbial maintenance in this case thus according to pirt 1965 the theoretical specific growth rate can be described as the sum of the apparent specific growth rate and the growth independent maintenance rate as given in eq 11 11 μ m t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t in which m m t is the maintenance energy coefficient of mt producers since most of the methane produced in anaerobic digesters is from acetate as a substrate e g 70 batstone et al 2002 we tentatively assume acetate utilizing methanogens are major mt utilizers for the sake of model simplification the suitability of this simplification is verified in later section a comparison of fig 1 to 2 shows that the concentrations of acetate were three orders of magnitude higher than those of the mt obviously acetate was a major substrate for methanogens and mt was only utilized as a minor substrate then the theoretical specific growth rate of the methanogens can be approximated as 12 μ c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c in which m c h 4 is the maintenance energy coefficient of methanogens y x c h 4 a c is the growth yield of methanogens on acetate accordingly eq 13 can be derived from eqs 3 and 11 to calculate s m e t likewise eq 14 can be derived from eqs 10 and 12 to determine x c h 4 13 s m e t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t k m e t μ ˆ m t 1 θ m m t y x m t m e t 14 x c h 4 v c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c y c h 4 x c h 4 for the determination of s m t eq 15

and x c h 4 can be expressed by eqs 13 and 14 respectively s m e t i n can be estimated from the measured influent protein content 11 85 0 25 g l 1 by using a typical methionine composition 46 120 mg g 1 in sewage sludge protein lau 1981 quitain et al 2002 subrahmanyam et al 1960 3 4 3 determination of the maintenance coefficient of methanogens technically eq 15 can be used along with eqs 13 and 14 for mt concentration and emission predictions while most of the kinetic coefficients used in eqs 13 15 can be adapted from the classic anaerobic digestion model no 1 framework batstone et al 2002 as listed in table 2 several are rarely studied or reported the maintenance coefficient m c h 4 of methanogens in eq 14 is one of those in order to determine m c h 4 eq 12 is transformed to eq 17 and eq 16 is used to calculate μ c h 4 plotting its term θ μ c h 4 versus θ y x c h 4 a c in fig 4 a by using s ac data from fig 2 a linear plot r2 0 95 with a y intercept of 1 as predicted by eq 17 results in a slope of m c h 4 0 0282 mg mg 1 h 1 it is noteworthy that this maintenance coefficient value is not much different from those reported for regular anaerobes ercan et al 2015 the acceptable fit of experimental data in fig 4a suggests that eqs 12 and 14 used in this study offer suitable simulation of both the growth and maintenance kinetics of methanogens accordingly x c h 4 can be estimated in fig 4b by substituting parameters listed in table 2 and the measured v c h 4 in fig 2 into eq 14 fig 4b shows that x c h 4 only slightly decreased along with the srt increase 16 μ c h 4 μ ˆ c h 4 s a c k a c s a c in which μ ˆ c h 4 is the theoretical maximum specific growth rate of methanogens on acetate s a c is the acetate concentration k a c is the half saturated constant of acetate for methanogens 17 θ μ c h 4 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c 1 3 4 4 determination of the maximum specific mt utilization rate as for the kinetic coefficients of mt utilizers used in eqs 4 and 15 k m t 0 25 mg l 1 is probably the only one that has been reported previously sun et al 2015 i e neither μ ˆ c h 4 m t nor y x c h 4 m t is known in this regard we treated μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t as a single parameter and defined it as the specific maximum mt uptake rate by methanogens then eq 18 can be derived from eqs 2 4 and 9 terms on the left hand side of eq 18 include mt formation rate y p m t y mt v m e t mt discharge rate s m t θ and mt emission rate v g s m t h c c the net difference between these mt turnover rates is equal to the mt utilization rate calculated on the right hand side of eq 18 it should be noted that the only unknown in eq 18 is the term μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t which is the slope of the trend line going through origin in fig 5 the straight line with r2 0 91 plotted with experimental data in fig 5 using eq 18 implies that the mt utilization kinetic model used in this study is able to provides a good fit to the experimental data thereby μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t 0 0025 mg mg 1 h 1 can be determined from fig 5 hereto we have all the necessary coefficients for s mt prediction in eq 15 18 y m t x m t y x m t m e t v met s m t θ v g s m t h c c μ ˆ c h 4

estimations the model parameters are shown in table 2 in which m c h 4 was estimated using the acetate concentration based on eq 17 μ ˆ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t was estimated from the mt production data obtained in the inhibition experiment based on eq 18 and y m t x m t k met as well as m mt were determined from the gases production rates of the digesters based on eq 15 the uncertainty evaluation of the model calibration was carried out based on the monte carlo approach which is particularly suitable for non linear model with a relatively small sample size donoso bravo et al 2011 lopez and borzacconi 2010 müller et al 2002 the theoretical model in eq 15 was used to predict the mt concentration in bulk solution of anaerobic digesters fig 6 a shows that a decent agreement was reached between the theoretical prediction of eq 15 and the experimental results of the steady state mt concentrations measured at various srts in fig 1 with r2 0 89 which verified the adequacy of the kinetic model developed from this study for the description of mt turnover in anaerobic digesters the capacity of eq 15 in predicting experimental results also suggests that the assumptions and simplification made for the model development are acceptable 3 6 model simplification although eq 15 has been shown capable of providing appropriate prediction of mt concentration it appears to be too complicated to use for practitioners so we looked into the possibility of simplifying it as revealed in fig 6b the term μ c h 4 m t x c h 4 y x c h 4 m t s m t representing the specific mt utilization rate in eq 15 is almost 100 times greater than the sum of the terms representing the specific mt discharge rate 1 θ and emission rate v g h c c indicating that the sum of the two terms 1 θ v g h c c is indeed negligible and can be ignored from the denominator of eq 15 moreover since the k mt 0 25 mg l 1 is much greater than the s mt 0 02 0 18 mg l 1 measured in fig 1 the monod type mt utilization kinetics in eq 4 is tentatively approximated as a first order expression namely μ ˆ c h 4 m t s m t k m t additionally as shown in fig 4b the methanogen population is relatively stable within the range of typical srt used for anaerobic digestion the term representing x c h 4 in eq 14 namely v c h 4 1 θ m c h 4 y x c h 4 a c y c h 4 x c h 4 can be also treated as a constant therefore eq 15 can be simplified as 19 s m t k 1 θ s m e t i n s m e t in which k is a constant equal to y m t x m t y x m t m e t 1 θ v g h c c μ c h 4 m t y x c h 4 m t s m t x c h 4 eq 19 suggests that the steady state mt concentration in anaerobic digesters is primarily determined by the srt and the influent methionine concentration in order to determine the accuracy of this simplified model in eq 19 its prediction of s m t along with srt is compared with that of eq 15 in fig 6a as can be seen although the simplified model predicts a slightly lower srt corresponding to the peak mt emission the two predictions are almost identical confirming the validity of the simplified model in eq 19 in providing acceptable simulation of the steady state mt concentrations in anaerobic digesters 3 7 model implications 3 7 1 model prediction of the srt that produces peak mt emission although odor emission from anaerobic digestion can involve many compounds mt is often identified as the major odorous compound in wastewater treatment practices associated with anaerobic conditions chen et al 2005 du and parker 2012 hort et al 2013 novak et al 2006 park and novak 2013 wang et al 2015 for this regard we mainly focused on mt as a representative odorous compound in this study special safety and odor control measures should be taken towards the anaerobic digesters running at the srt that incurs peak mt emissions the peak mt emission occurs when s m t is in following relation with srt 20 d s m t d θ 0 substituting eqs 13 and 19 into eq 20 gives 21 θ p e a k 1 μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t in which θ p e a k is the srt corresponding to the peak mt emission since m m t y x m t m e t is a constant specific maintenance rate μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t can be interpreted as the maximum apparent specific growth rate that can be achieved under the maintenance condition typically a bioreactor will not operate at a srt shorter than the reciprocal of maximum apparent specific growth rate in order to avoid washout hence eq 21 can be reduced to 22 θ p e a k 1 μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t eq 22 indicates that the value of srt corresponding to the peak mt emission is actually influenced by s m e t i n i e the higher protein content presents in influent sludge the shorter solids retention time will be needed to reach the peak mt emission the θ p e a k in this study is around 20 d as shown in fig 1 3 7 2 effect of feed sludge protein content on the srt that produces peak mt emission eq 22 indicates that the value of srt corresponding to the peak mt emission θ p e a k is actually influenced by s m e t i n the higher protein content presents in influent sludge the shorter srt will be needed to reach the peak mt emission when s m e t i n k m e t eq 22 can be simplified as θ p e a k μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t 1 it should be realized that the term μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t represents the maximum apparent specific growth rate that the mt fermenters can possibly achieve thus the use of any θ μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t 1 will lead to the washout of mt fermenters and in turn the plunge of s mt as srt approaches the lower boundary of the bell shaped curve shown in fig 7 it should be noted that the s mt corresponding to this θ p e a k namely s mt peak is indeed at the maximum value that s mt can possibly reach due to the extremely high s m e t i n provided in this scenario as s m e t i n decreases it is shown in fig 7 that the s mt peak as a product will decrease accordingly while θ p e a k will increase taking a close look at the denominator of eq 22 one should easily see that s m e t i n is actually controlling the apparent specific growth rate corresponding to θ p e a k at a value that is μ ˆ m t k m e t k m e t s m e t i n μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t less than the maximum apparent specific growth rate the mt fermenters can possibly achieve namely μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t thus can be seen a decrease in s m e t i n will lead to a decline in apparent specific growth rate at the peak mt emission in eq 22 the reciprocal of which corresponds to the increase of θ p e a k as shown in fig 7 meanwhile according to eq 22 there also exists a minimum s m e t i n k m e t m m t y x m t m e t μ ˆ m t m m t y x m t m e t which is just enough to support the basic maintenance of mt fermenters by using the kinetic parameters listed in table 2 this minimum s m e t i n can be estimated to be around 100 mg l 1 which is indeed significantly lower than the s m e t i n value 1114 mg l 1 contained in the blended sludge used in this study hence the presence of s mt peak at extremely long θ p e a k is unlikely in reality even if this s mt peak was ever present at this minimum s m e t i n it should be in such an extremely low value as shown in fig 7 that does not need to be considered further in summary the value of θ p e a k is mainly determined by the s m e t i n value contained in the feed sludge one may use eq 22 to predict the θ p e a k so as to evaluate the odor potential for digesters operated at a certain srt 3 7 3 effect of maintenance coefficient on the srt that produces peak mt emission the maintenance mechanism for microbes is a trade off between survival and growth when under unfavorable conditions resources are more devoted to survival of microbes rather than reproduction nyström 2004 according to eq 11 high maintenance requirement will lead to higher theoretical specific growth rate μ m t under a given srt which in turn resulted in higher methionine consumption and mt production as described in eqs 1 and 6 for this reason although the maintenance coefficient is a constant but not a variable in the current model we would like to argue that the magnitude of m m t is indeed responsible for the presence of θ p e a k within the typical srt range used in anaerobic digestion as simulated in fig 8 using eq 19 microbes with larger maintenance coefficient m m t tend to have a longer θ p e a k and a lower s mt peak m m t is indeed a burden to the growth of mt fermenters i e when m m t is large more energy obtained from methionine utilization will be allocated for maintenance but not for growth and consequently a smaller apparent specific growth rate of mt fermenters will be resulted and so is the mt production rate since s m t is the net result of concurrent mt production and utilization larger m m t thus tends to give lower s mt peak as displayed in fig 8 due to the slowdown of mt production rate by large m m t burden it is also not difficult to understand that the mt production will reach equilibrium with a slower mt utilization rate at the steady state these slower mt production and utilization rates only occur in digesters running at a longer srt as shown in fig 8 conversely bacteria with a smaller m m t will have a θ p e a k so small that it will not show up in the typical srt range of anaerobic digesters for example the maintenance rate m y x s of mt fermenters estimated in this study is about 0 16 h 1 table 2 which is over 100 times greater than that of the acetate fermenters at 0 013 h 1 ghosh et al 1975 as a consequence the θ p e a k or in another words the bell shaped curve can only be observed for mt in fig 1 but not for acetate in fig 2b 3 8 implication on mt production pathways as summarized in fig 9 there are primarily three pathways for methionine fermentation to mt i the stickland reaction using coupled amino acids as both electron donors and acceptors to ferment methionine into mt along with propionate carbon dioxide and ammonia batstone et al 2002 ii the transamination reaction using transaminases to convert methionine to 2 oxo 4 methylthio butanoic acid kmba which is subsequently converted to mt along with α ketobutyric acid ammonia and hydrogen production bonnarme et al 2001 and iii the lyase reaction which directly converts methionine to mt α ketobutyric acid ammonia and hydrogen soda 1987 it should be pointed out that unlike stickland reaction both transaminaion and lyase reactions are single amino acid degradation pathways that require plp as a coenzyme for mt production from methionine wolle et al 2006 the fact that mt production was completely stopped when using aoa to inhibit the activity of plp in fig 3a suggests that stickland reaction is not a major pathway for mt production leaving the possibility to either transaminaion or lyase reaction the mt yield from methionine as calculated by y m t x m t y x m t m e t in table 2 is around 0 3218 mg mg 1 which is very close to the stoichiometric mt yield from methionine assuming mt is the only sulfurous product namely 0 3224 mg mg 1 such a complete conversion of methionine to mt just indicates that there was almost no kmba accumulation during the anaerobic digestion in view of the fact that transaminaion reaction always converts part of the methionine to kmba as shown in fig 9 it is our inference that lyase reaction might be the major pathway for methionine to mt conversion in anaerobic digesters 4 conclusions this study found that the mt emission rate follows a bell shaped pattern with srt in anaerobic digesters the subsequent inhibitory experiment showed that net mt emission is primarily determined by the dynamic concurrence of mt production and utilization in the course of anaerobic digestion further kinetic analysis of the mt dynamics revealed that the srt that produces this peak mt emission is likely controlled by the feed sludge protein content and the large maintenance coefficient of mt fermenters is an intrinsic cause of the peak emission in the typical range of srt used for anaerobic digestion a simplified kinetic model was derived and verified from this study for the prediction of mt concentration as well as the srt leading to peak mt emission the possible pathways responsible for mt production were also inferred and lyase catalyzed reaction appears to be responsible for methionine to mt conversion in anaerobic digesters operated in this study acknowledgement this research

19611,sediment microbes have a great potential to transform reactive n to harmless n2 thus decreasing wastewater nitrogen load into aquatic ecosystems here we examined if spatial allocation of the wastewater discharge by a specially constructed sediment diffuser pipe system enhanced the microbial nitrate reduction processes full scale experiments were set on two finnish lake sites keuruu and petäjävesi and effects on the nitrate removal processes were studied using the stable isotope pairing technique all nitrate reduction rates followed nitrate concentrations being highest at the wastewater influenced sampling points complete denitrification with n2 as an end product was the main nitrate reduction process indicating that the high nitrate and organic matter concentrations of wastewater did not promote nitrous oxide n2o production truncated denitrification or ammonification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra using 3d simulation we demonstrated that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time and amount of wastewater near the sediment surface especially in spring and in autumn altering organic matter concentration and oxygen levels and increasing the denitrification capacity of the sediment we estimated that natural denitrification potentially removed 3 10 of discharged wastewater nitrate in the 33 ha study area of keuruu and the sediment diffusion method increased this areal denitrification capacity on average 45 overall our results indicate that sediment diffusion method can supplement wastewater treatment plant wwtp nitrate removal without enhancing alternative harmful processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification dnra nitrate reduction nitrous oxide nitrogen removal wastewater 1 introduction wastewater

during denitrification no3 is sequentially converted into nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and n2o and in optimal conditions into biologically inert nitrogen gas n2 seitzinger et al 2006 as increasing nitrogen loading enhances nitrogen removal finlay et al 2013 and denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 denitrification can potentially diminish the detrimental effect of wastewater on the receiving ecosystem and act as a supplemental n removal for treated wastewater however high no3 concentrations together with a lack of carbon c can enhance higher production of greenhouse gas n2o relative to n2 through incomplete denitrification zhao et al 2014 thus wastewater induced denitrification although removing reactive n could also be an ecosystem disservice burgin et al 2013 however wastewater typically contains high amounts of organic c as compared to receiving waterbodies debruyn and rasmussen 2002 which may facilitate complete heterotrophic denitrification with the n2 as the end product in the receiving sediments weymann et al 2010 moreover high c n and high c loading have been demonstrated to promote another ecosystem disservice dnra dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium over denitrification kraft et al 2014 hardison et al 2015 dnra converts wastewater no3 into biologically more reactive ammonium nh4 retaining n in the ecosystem previous results from sediments influenced by aquaculture waste christensen et al 2000 suggest that wastewater effluent with both high c and n concentrations could support dnra or even favor it over denitrification in the receiving sediments currently the knowledge on the influence of wastewater on nitrate reduction processes in natural systems is still rather poor since previous studies have focused mainly on changes in the genetic n transformation potential e g rahm et al 2016 saarenheimo et al 2017 they suggest that wastewater supports genetic denitrification potential by bringing more substrate and electron donors to the sediment microbes but also by bringing new wwtp microbes and shaping the natural microbial community in an urban stream study lofton et al 2007 measured higher potential denitrification rates at the wastewater influenced sites than at the pristine upstream sites but there is no information on wastewater driven changes in n2o production furthermore the effect of wastewater on dnra rates has only been measured in baltic sea estuary where it was found to increase dnra bonaglia et al 2014 this means that at the moment it is impossible to estimate the ultimate fate of wastewater nitrate and the true n removal potential of sediment microbes at least in lakes and other freshwater ecosystems in this study we used stable isotope approach ipt nielsen 1992 to measure denitrification truncated denitrification and dnra process rates in boreal lake sediments along a wastewater gradient wastewater could have a significant impact on n transformation processes especially in boreal lakes where denitrification rates are lower as compared to temperate lakes rissanen et al 2013 one important factor regulating denitrification of wastewater effluents in water bodies is the water residence time seitzinger et al 2006 which affects the contact time between water column nitrate and sediment wastewaters are commonly discharged several meters above the sediment surface into lake water columns meaning that in boreal area the seasonal variation in stratification patterns could control the contact times between wastewater and sediment e g wastewater would be near the sediment surface only in winter this would further lead to seasonal differences in sediment denitrification capacity in this study we increased the wastewater contact time throughout the year by discharging the water on the lake sediment surface through a special diffuser pipe system by this we aimed to increase concentration of wastewater near the sediment surface to support natural denitrification by using a full scale experimental approach we aimed to 1 compare how spatial allocation of wastewater affects seasonal n transforming processes and 2 estimate the applicability of the sediment diffuser method in wastewater n removal we hypothesized that wastewater increases denitrification rate but potentially also unfavorable n2o production or dnra in addition we hypothesized that sediment diffusion method reduces seasonal variation leading to higher overall n removal capacity 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the two wwtps keuruu 8200 population equivalent pe and petäjävesi 1800 pe are located in central finland fig 1 both wwtps have primary clarification and secondary treatment activated sludge with nitrification and discharge their treated effluents from a one point outlet to the lake under the normal conditions in keuruu wwtp nitrification process collapsed in winter 2015 due to cold weather in keuruu the recipient lake lake keurusselkä is a large humic lake 117 km2 belonging to kokemäenjoki drainage area with average depth of 6 4 m and a maximum depth of 40 m during the experimental study the diffuser pipe system having 50 holes 30 mm wide on both sides of the 30 m long and 60 cm diameter pe pipe suppl fig 1 was attached to the end of the original wwtp discharge pipe at the depth of 9 m for one year october 2014 november 2015 in petäjävesi the treated wwtp effluent is discharged to lake jämsänvesi which is a medium sized humic lake 0 9 km2 fig 1 belonging to kymijoki drainage area with average depth of 4 2 m and maximum depth of 27 m in august 2016 the original wwtp discharge pipe was extended with a similar diffuser pipe system as in keuruu except it had 100 holes 30 mm wide and the total length was 10 and the diameter 20 cm which directed the wastewater effluent to the sediment surface the costs of the diffuser systems were 35 000 in keuruu including technical design environmental permits construction and installation conducted by private companies

collected using the kajak sediment core sampler kc denmark a s in keuruu there were eight sampling trips between years 2014 and 2015 11 feb 2014 6 may 2014 4 aug 2014 14 oct 2014 20 jan 2015 19 may

fifteen sediment cores sediment height 25 cm and diameter 4 cm were collected per each lake site on both lake areas three main sampling points were sampled each time one located 0 8 km upstream from the wastewater discharge point one at the discharge point and one at approximately 200 300 m downstream from the discharge point except in 11 aug 2014 in petäjävesi see supplemental table 1 to study the effect of sediment diffusion system additional 2 4 points were sampled between discharge and downstream sampling points supplemental table 1 temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column were measured and bottom water collected for measuring concentration of dissolved inorganic ammonium nh4 and nitrate nitrite nox as in saarenheimo et al 2017 2 3 sediment core incubations after sampling intact sediment cores were transported to the university of jyväskylä laboratory and stored at in situ temperature in dark until next day after that the water above the sediment was replaced with water collected from the sampling sites without disturbing sediment surface 15no3 label k15no3 cambridge isotope laboratories was added to give an initial concentration of 150 μmol l and the cores one core per sampling point were capped with rubber stoppers and incubated at in situ temperature and in dark for 4 h with constant stirring 90 rpm pre incubation time of 5 min was used nielsen 1992 which could have led to appr 20 underestimation of d14 in lower temperatures due to inhomogeneous mixing of the endogenous 14no3 with the exogenous 15no3 eyre et al 2002 in addition the assumptions of ipt nielsen 1992 were verified with concentration series incubations 25 75 250 and 400 μmol l of 15no3 one core per concentration per sampling point at both lake sites in 2014 11 feb 6 may and 14 oct 2014 in keuruu and 8 may 9 jun 11 aug 2014 in petäjävesi in addition one core was used as an unlabeled control and one as a time zero control per each sampling point at the end of the incubations cores were efficiently mixed and slurry samples were collected for process measurements 2 4 isotope analysis 2 4 1 complete denitrification rates n2 production three slurry samples per one core were collected to glass vials 12 ml labco 100 μl of 30 formaldehyde was added to stop the microbial activities and samples were stored in cold and in dark until isotope analysis before irms analysis a helium headspace 5 5 ml was added to each sample following tiirola et al 2011 the isotope mass areas m z 28 29 and 30 and n2 concentration of the samples were analyzed with isoprime irms connected to tracegas preconcentrator unit using a modified n2o project with no cryotrapping and valves in co2 mode actual d14 and potential d15 150 μmol l of 15no3 denitrification rates the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification dn and the proportion of denitrification of the no3 in the water above the sediment dw were calculated as in rissanen et al 2013 2 4 2 truncated denitrification rates n2o production a slurry sample of 30 ml was collected to a syringe 60 ml and n2o was extracted to helium gas stored in the prevacuumed glass vial 12 ml and subsequently analyzed with isoprime irms connected to tracegas preconcentrator unit n2o production was calculated as in dong et al 2006 2 4 3 dnra rates dnra rates were measured from the three main sampling points and from the two additional points 50 and 100 m downstream from wastewater discharge point in keuruu for the analysis 100 ml of slurried sediment was collected and filtered gf c and nh4 was isolated by alkaline acid trap diffusion holmes et al 1998 where 40 ml of slurry water together with 2 g of nacl and 0 12 g of mgo and acid traps triple 1 cm diameter gf c filters acidified with 20 μl of 2 5 m khso4 was added to 250 ml glass bottles and incubated for four days in 35 c in shaker after the incubation trapped samples were dried for two days in a desiccator with sulfuric acid and atm 15 the proportion of 15n of total n of samples was analyzed with thermo finnigan flash ea1112 elemental analyzer connected to a thermo finnigan deltaplus advantage irms dnra rate was calculated as in christensen et al 2000 2 5 laboratory analysis samples for din species nh4 nox were filtered through glass fibre filters whatman gf f and measured as in rissanen et al 2011 furthermore the porosity and the proportion of organic matter of the sediment loi were determined for each sampling point as in rissanen et al 2011 2 6 lake keurusselkä 3 d flow model to estimate the contact time between wastewater effluent and lake bottom in the dynamic real world conditions we used a hydrodynamic simulation a 3 d model and a simulation model of lake keurusselkä with the wastewater effluent as a conservative tracer was built using the open source european union public license eupl coherens code luyten 2013 coherens solves the three dimensional hydrodynamic equations using the finite difference method assumes hydrostatic balance and uses the boussinesq approximation when solving buoyancy the modelled area is depicted in supplemental fig 2 the model input data included lake bathymetry wastewater discharge volume and concentrations lake inflows and outflows and weather temperature precipitation wind speed and direction humidity air pressure the bathymetry inflow and outflow data was provided by finnish environment institute wastewater data by keuruu wwtp and weather data by finnish meteorological institute fmi additional verification data of water currents was obtained using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp device at 15 min intervals over a period of 1 apr 22 jun 2015 we used version 2 9 of the coherens code to develop a nested lake keurusselkä high resolution model first the entire lake was modelled using a coarse 250 m horizontal resolution the results of this simulation were used as boundary conditions for a high resolution 10 m model around and including the wastewater outlet both resolution models used eleven terrain following vertical layers vertical mixing was based on the k ε turbulence scheme k turbulent energy ε the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy tvd total variation diminishing advection scheme was used for momentum and tracers and explicit horizontal diffusion was disabled in the coarse simulation model we used time dependant flows as open boundary data using the high resolution model we simulated a total of eight 48 h long situations four different seasons winter spring summer autumn and two wastewater discharge pipe configurations original pipe and diffuser pipe system for each season the original wastewater pipe releases the effluent into a single calculation cell 10m 10m at 1 m from the bottom while the sediment diffuser pipe system spreads the effluent into three cells at the bottom of the water column the simulation periods were chosen to coincide with field sampling occasions relevant input data was used for each season and the winter scenario also included the effect ice and snow cover the background concentration of wastewater effluent in the lake was set to zero at the beginning of each modelling scenario which enabled us to determine how the effluent behaves during the first few hours after the release see supplemental video supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 03 068 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video the simulation data was saved at 10 min intervals for post process calculation of the contact time of wastewater and the sediment surface we defined the contact time to be an arbitrary time interval multiplied by the fraction of wastewater effluent in the bottom layer of the water column vs the total effluent in the water column during the same time interval for example if 20 of all effluent in the model is found in the layer closest to bottom during some 10 min interval the contact time would be 0 2 600 s 120 s this means that in a stable system when time approaches infinity the contact time will approach time interval number of layers because the effluent will be nearly fully mixed in the water column in this method the only varying parameter is the wastewater discharge pipe configuration thus we could calculate how much the sediment diffuser pipe system altered the contact time area and concentration of wastewater as compared to the original wastewater pipe during the 48h simulation period 2 7 data analysis data from keuruu and petäjävesi was analyzed separately the concentration series sediment core data from the three main sampling points upstream wastewater discharge point and downstream was reported as the average of two or as the average standard error se of three to five cores per sampling occasion otherwise no replicate cores were taken supplemental table 1 the relative dnra rate dnra was calculated as the contribution of dnra on total nitrate reduction d14 n2o dnra and the relative n2o production n2o as the ratio between the n2o production and total denitrification i e n2 n2o using averaged values per each sampling date and site the interactions between transformation rates d14 d15 n2o n2o dnra dnra and environmental factors temperature oxygen concentration nox nh4 loi were studied using spearmann rank correlation separately before and after installing the sediment diffusor for this samples from 13 aug 2014 16 oct 2014 31 aug 2016 and 25 oct 2016 were used in petäjävesi data supplemental table 1 in keuruu data all sampling dates were included the differences in n transformation rates and environmental factors before and after the sediment diffusion method experiment were studied with wilcoxon signed rank test supplemental table 1 all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 the areal potential denitrification capacity was calculated for keuruu data by multiplying mean d15 for each sampling date with the estimated wastewater influenced lake area 33 3 ha for this only d15 measured using the same 15no3 concentration 150 μmol l was used by comparing the calculated areal denitrification potential mg nox d 1 to the long term data on nitrate input mg nox d 1 coming from the wwtp we could estimate how much sediment denitrification could potentially remove incoming wastewater nitrate per day proportion of nox potentially removed through denitrification we calculated the estimate for each sampling date season before and after sediment diffusion experiment and compared those to finally estimate how much sediment diffusion method can promote areal n removal through denitrification similar calculations were conducted using d14 to demonstrate the true areal denitrification capacity proportion of nox removed through denitrification and the improvement in the latter one 3 results both study sites had strong seasonal variation in the physico chemical characteristics e g temperature oxygen at wastewater influenced and control sampling points table 1 supplemental table 2 in petäjävesi loi was generally higher and oxygen concentration lower than in keuruu at the wastewater influenced sampling points in both keuruu and petäjävesi nox concentrations were always higher than nh4 except in winter 2015 in keuruu when the nitrification process collapsed in wwtp table 1 3 1 nitrate reduction processes along wastewater gradient in general the underlaying ipt assumptions on independence of d14 of and d15 increasing with labeled nitrate were met at the three main sampling points in keuruu and petäjävesi supplemental fig 3 however on 6 may 2014 there was no positive trend between d15 and labeled nitrate at the downstream sampling site in keuruu which was most likely due to the missing data from the cores incubated with the two lowest concentrations of 15no3 furthermore on 11 feb 2014 d14 was increasing with labeled nitrate at the wastewater influenced sampling points in keuruu nitrate reduction rates were highest at the wastewater influenced sampling points figs 2 3 at both study sites the complete n2 production d14 and potential d15 denitrification rates tended to decrease when moving downstream from the discharge point figs 2 3 dnra rates measured in keuruu had a similar decreasing pattern fig 2 truncated denitrification n2o production or relative n2o production rates n2o did not show any clear pattern between the wastewater influenced sampling points figs 2 3 in keuruu where all three nitrate reduction processes were measured denitrification was the main nitrate reduction process 86 12 of all nitrate reduction there was no difference in the contribution of dnra in nitrate reduction dnra between the wastewater influenced sampling points 9 2 and the control point 11 5 3 2 the influence of the sediment diffusion method on nitrate reduction processes based on 3d modelling the diffuser pipe system increased the contact time of wastewater with the sediment surface during the first few hours after release when compared to the original configuration supplemental fig 4 this was observed especially in spring and in autumn in winter ice covered time the effect was lowest but still positive in lake scale the wastewater concentration near the sediment increased with the sediment diffusion method in all seasons however no changes in total contact area were seen fig 4 nitrate concentrations did not increase after the sediment diffusion at the study sites wilcoxon p 0 05 table 1 at both study sites oxygen concentration at the bottom was higher after the sediment diffusion and loi was lower in keuruu but higher in petäjävesi wilcoxon p 0 05 table 1 sediment diffusion method did not increase d14 keuruu before 881 230 after 767 163 petäjävesi before 451 80 after 2689 2088 wilcoxon p 0 05 but the overall potential denitrification rates d15 increased at both sites keuruu before 1056 184 after 2048 408 z 2 20 p 0 028 petäjävesi before 820 91 after 2087 469 wilcoxon z 2 22 p 0 026 there was no difference in n2o n2o or dnra before and during the diffuser pipe system p 0 05 but dnra rates decreased significantly in keuruu before 218 82 after 70 28 z 2 10 p 0 036 the correlation patterns between the nitrate reduction rates and environmental factors before and after the sediment diffusion varied between the two study sites table 2 in petäjävesi d14 did not correlate with inorganic n concentrations but increased with oxygen and loi before the sediment diffusion after the optimization it correlated positively with nitrate and ammonium before the optimization d15 correlated positively with d14 oxygen and loi and negatively with temperature but after that the correlation to loi remained but d15 was higher when temperature was high and oxygen concentration low before the optimization n2o production and n2o increased with temperature and decreased with oxygen and n2o decreased with loi after the wastewater discharge was spatially optimized both actual n2o production and n2o decreased with loi in keuruu d14 was always related to nitrate concentration and after the diffuser pipe system also to ammonium table 2 before the sediment diffusion method d15 was higher in higher temperatures and in lower oxygen concentrations after the optimization it correlated with d14 but not with any environmental factors before the optimization n2o increased with oxygen but after that only with decreasing loi the dnra rates always followed nitrate and oxygen concentrations and were higher when temperature was low but they also followed ammonium after the sediment diffusion a similar relationship was found between dnra and temperature and oxygen in 2014 but not after the sediment diffusion in both years dnra was higher when loi was low 3 3 the influence of sediment diffusion method on areal nitrate removal capacity we estimated that denitrification could potentially remove 3 10 of wwtp nox load mg d 1 coming to the area in keuruu table 3 after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method the removal was improved in winter spring and autumn whereas it declined slightly in summer however when the removal estimate was based on true denitrification values measured d14 denitrification could remove 1 15 of wwtp nox load and sediment diffusion method improved removal only in spring and autumn table 3 4 discussion as expected highest nitrate reduction rates were observed close to the wastewater discharge points the measured n2 production rates d14 150 3500 μmol n m 2 d 1 in keuruu and 80 23500 μmol n m 2 d 1 in petäjävesi at these points were comparable to or even exceeded the previous reports from eutrophic hypertrophic lakes 900 1200 μmol n m 2 d 1 mengis et al 1997 290 1700 μmol n m 2 d 1 risgaard petersen et al 1999 and wastewater influenced estuarine sediments 40 370 μmol n m 2 d 1 bonaglia et al 2014 and denitrification was the main nitrate reduction pathway at all wastewater influenced sampling points both denitrification and dnra rates followed the wastewater gradient decreasing downstream as mixing and dilution decreased the wastewater and nitrate concentration there was also some seasonal variation as in keuruu complete denitrification and dnra were highest in winter contradicting with the previous studies from boreal lakes in which highest rates have been found in summer when nitrate and organic matter concentrations as well as temperature are high ahlgren et al 1994 rissanen et al 2011 this is probably due to the contact rate between wastewater and sediment being naturally high during the winter as also the highest nitrate concentrations were observed then in keuruu then we also saw d14 increasing with labeled nitrate which suggest that anammox could contribute to n2 production risgaard petersen et al 2003 however high nitrate and organic matter concentrations at wastewater influenced sampling points should not favor anammox as has been demonstrated earlier in wastewater influenced estuary sediments bonaglia et al 2014 it is possible that the amount of labeled nitrate was not high enough as compared to the natural nitrate concentrations or too short preincubation period eyre et al 2002 leading to inhomogeneous mixing of label with natural nitrate this was observed only in winter 2014 in keuruu when the nitrate concentration was the highest at the wastewater influenced sites agreeing with previous results on genetic nitrous oxide reduction potential in keuruu saarenheimo et al 2017 n2o production was not following wastewater nitrate gradient but was possibly related to seasonal factors and organic matter availability although the absolute dnra rates were occasionally high at the wastewater influenced sampling sites the average contribution of dnra in nitrate reduction was similar between wastewater and control points in general observed dnra was comparable to the ones recorded in eutrophic lake during high c availability 15 nizzoli et al 2010 but not as high as in aquaculture influenced sediments 300 christensen et al 2000 or in wastewater contaminated estuary sediments 50 1700 bonaglia et al 2014 although wastewater influenced sampling points seem to have higher amount of organic matter loi the organic matter quality could be less favorable for the fermentative dnra bacteria akunna et al 1993 in addition the amount of nitrate was always significantly higher at the wastewater sampling points lowering c n which should favor denitrifying bacteria kraft et al 2014 the habitat characteristics may also be more dynamic and turbid following the wastewater discharge volume and this could suppress the growth of dnra bacteria nogaro and burgin 2014 the 3d modelling results confirmed that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time between wastewater effluent and sediment in keuruu this was seen especially in spring and in autumn which are the mixing periods in the boreal lakes we did not expect any enhancement in winter when wastewater is naturally at the lake bottom and the water residence time is long also in summer heavy wastewater having high conductivity is supposed to stay at the bottom although sediment diffusion method increased near bottom wastewater concentration it did not increase the total wastewater influenced area indicating that the diffuser pipe system was probably not long enough in our sampling data we did not see a significant increase in the nitrate concentration in the bottom water after the diffuser pipe system it seems that process rates and modelling results are more reliable estimates of the effect of sediment diffusion method on n dynamics than only nitrate concentration interestingly we saw higher oxygen concentration at both study sites after the sediment diffusion method while organic matter concentration increased in petäjävesi and decreased in keuruu both factors being important in controlling nitrate reduction increased oxygen was most likely reflecting the higher concentration of fully oxygen saturated wastewater effluent near the sediment surface the lower loi in keuruu is in agreement with previous study from wastewater influenced river sediments lofton et al 2007 and could be due to more turbid conditions after the sediment diffusion in petäjävesi the wastewater discharge point has naturally lower water velocity and lower wastewater effluent volume suggesting that after the sediment diffusion wwtp derived organic matter could be sedimentated more efficiently to the bottom resulting in higher loi however the composition and quality of organic matter probably changed at both study sites after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method potential denitrification rates d15 were higher after the diffuser pipe system at both study sites and this was observed especially at the wastewater discharge sampling point where d15 were on average three times higher since d15 was not related to the environmental nitrate concentrations wastewater promoted it through some other mechanism we have previously shown that wastewater shapes the sediment microbial community composition significantly by bringing in wwtp microbes and modifying habitat characteristics saarenheimo et al 2017 so it is likely that by altering oxygen and organic matter concentrations and quality wastewater favored certain microbes which directly or indirectly contributed to denitrification the connection between wastewater and d15 is further corroborated with the found correlations between d15 and d14 in keuruu and d15 and loi in petäjävesi the connection between d15 and d14 was found in petäjävesi even before the sediment diffusion and our recent study showed that wastewater has indeed stronger impact on microbial community there than in keuruu saarenheimo et al 2017 complete denitrification d14 and dw data not shown followed inorganic n concentrations at both study sites and did not significantly increase after the sediment diffusion but the method successfully decreased seasonal effects e g oxygen or temperature on n2 production suggesting that the conditions were more favorable to denitrification microbes throughout the year furthermore although higher oxygen concentration could have supported nitrification and coupled nitrification denitrification bonaglia et al 2013 we did not find a significant increase in the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification dn after the sediment diffusion data not shown one reason for d14 not increasing after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method could be inhomogenous mixing of labeled and natural nitrate during ipt incubations due to inadequate pre incubation period and higher opd at cold temperatures eyre et al 2002 however within season temperatures remained similar in keuruu so possible underestimation of d14 happened at both study years in petäjävesi there was a slight decrease in temperatures after the sediment filtration system but since only summer and autumn samples were included in the data the temperature driven d14 underestimation was probably rather small we think that best explanation for d14 not increasing is that inorganic nitrogen concentration remained similar and there was no increase in the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method the increased oxygen concentration can explain the decrease in dnra observed in keuruu as re oxygenation of sediments favors denitrification over dnra de brabandere et al 2015 as the oxygen concentration increased after the sediment diffusion obligate anaerobic dnra bacteria were possibly suppressed nogaro and burgin 2014 decrease in dnra rate coincided also with decreased loi implying that lower carbon availability suppressed dnra kraft et al 2014 we did not analyze dnra in petäjävesi where loi increased however it was rather unlikely that dnra would have been promoted there as we saw no significant decrease in d14 and d15 even increased and conditions were probably too oxygen rich and turbid for dnra bacteria furthermore the quality of sediment organic matter can be even more important in governing the end product of nitrate reduction than the carbon content wwtp derived organic matter is considered to be more biodegradable and protein rich than natural organic matter nam and amy 2008 which should favor especially denitrifying microbes barnes et al 2012 sediment diffusion method did not affect n2o production or n2o it is possible that in addition to denitrification some proportion of n2o was derived from nitrification for example the negative correlation see goreau et al 1980 found between n2o and oxygen in keuruu after the sediment diffusion suggests that nitrification could be the main source of n2o this correlation was also observed in petäjävesi before the sediment diffusion organic matter concentration seems to be the main factor controlling n2o production and n2o especially after the sediment diffusion when nitrate levels were probably not limiting zhao et al 2014 in general higher carbon availability facilitates complete denitrification weymann et al 2010 the interaction between n2o and loi more likely reflects spatial distribution of n2o production rather than the effect of sediment diffusion as loi decreased but n2o did not increase in keuruu after the sediment diffusion since after the sediment diffusion n2o was constantly higher at downstream sampling points where loi was lower interestingly both n2o and n2o were higher in petäjävesi than in keuruu although loi was higher there even before the sediment diffusion in petäjävesi the loading of allochthonous carbon from the surrounding catchment area is substantial and lake color is darker than in keuruu this suggests that a significant proportion of sediment organic matter might be recalcitrant and less favorable for denitrifiers although seems to support the denitrification process until n2o agreeing with previous studies on carbon amended denitrification rates at the baltic sea oxic anoxic interface bonaglia et al 2016 and in boreal lakes sediments myrstener et al 2016 however further studies are needed to understand the importance of wastewater organic matter quantity and quality in governing these different nitrate reduction processes areal denitrification calculations based on d15 revealed that natural sediment denitrification could potentially remove 3 10 of wastewater nitrate input at keuruu site and sediment diffusion can increase the rate by 17 120 when using true denitrification values d14 the proportion of wastewater nitrate removed was 1 15 and sediment diffusion increased the rate by 22 61 although these calculations are based on process rates measurements from sampling points and calculated only on the 33 ha study area we can expect that they are rather realistic as our field observations have shown that wastewater can be detected during the first 400 m downstream from the discharge site and is after that efficiently diluted we did not take the improvement in the wastewater contact time or concentration into account in the calculations so in reality the improvement in the total areal nitrate removal capacity was probably higher previous estimates on denitrification nitrate removal potentials have been 2 of incoming nitrate from river sites lofton et al 2007 and 60 70 from constructed wetlands lee et al 2009 sediment diffusion method enhanced areal nitrate removal in spring and in autumn which followed the pattern in contact time however potential nitrate removal was increased also in winter although wastewater is then naturally near the sediment surface and thus no improvement in contact time was expected furthermore no change in contact time was observed in winter based on 3d modelling what makes it especially interesting is that in winter after installing the sediment diffusor pipe nitrification process in wwtp collapsed for several months and wastewater effluent consisted mainly of ammonium nitrogen possibly nitrification benefitted from the better oxygenation compensating the problems observed in the function of the wwtp and feeding efficiently denitrification community increasing the areal nitrate removal potential when using d14 based estimate in the calculations no improvement in the wastewater nitrate removal was seen in winter which can be explained with low nitrate concentration after the sediment diffusion as nitrification collapsed in wwtp here d15 based estimate is probably more realistic since it is always based on the same amount of label which corresponds the wintertime nitrate concentrations in keuruu when wwtp nitrification is functional 5 conclusions the full scale experiments showed that sediment diffusion method can create more favorable conditions for the sediment microbes and thus increase the denitrification potential furthermore they showed that in general wastewater promotes nitrate reduction supporting especially n2 production through complete denitrification as the nitrate rich wastewater had a longer contact time with the sediment sediment diffusion method enhanced the total areal wastewater nitrate removal especially in spring and autumn when wastewater would have otherwise been mixed with the lake water however in order to utilize sediment microbes more efficiently in wastewater n removal diffuser pipe system should be further modified to increase the effluent contact time and area with the sediment through this methodology nitrate removal can be enhanced with low costs in treatment plants where nitrification is part of the process as the implementation of the sediment diffusion method is easy and inexpensive it would be especially recommended for supplementing nitrate removal in small and medium sized

19611,sediment microbes have a great potential to transform reactive n to harmless n2 thus decreasing wastewater nitrogen load into aquatic ecosystems here we examined if spatial allocation of the wastewater discharge by a specially constructed sediment diffuser pipe system enhanced the microbial nitrate reduction processes full scale experiments were set on two finnish lake sites keuruu and petäjävesi and effects on the nitrate removal processes were studied using the stable isotope pairing technique all nitrate reduction rates followed nitrate concentrations being highest at the wastewater influenced sampling points complete denitrification with n2 as an end product was the main nitrate reduction process indicating that the high nitrate and organic matter concentrations of wastewater did not promote nitrous oxide n2o production truncated denitrification or ammonification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra using 3d simulation we demonstrated that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time and amount of wastewater near the sediment surface especially in spring and in autumn altering organic matter concentration and oxygen levels and increasing the denitrification capacity of the sediment we estimated that natural denitrification potentially removed 3 10 of discharged wastewater nitrate in the 33 ha study area of keuruu and the sediment diffusion method increased this areal denitrification capacity on average 45 overall our results indicate that sediment diffusion method can supplement wastewater treatment plant wwtp nitrate removal without enhancing alternative harmful processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification dnra nitrate reduction nitrous oxide nitrogen removal wastewater 1 introduction wastewater

oxide n2o hauck et al 2016 lakes wetlands and other freshwater ecosystems are large global sinks for reactive n removing incoming n through denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 finlay et al 2013 during denitrification no3 is sequentially converted into nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and n2o and in optimal conditions into biologically inert nitrogen gas n2 seitzinger et al 2006 as increasing nitrogen loading enhances nitrogen removal finlay et al 2013 and denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 denitrification can potentially diminish the detrimental effect of wastewater on the receiving ecosystem and act as a supplemental n removal for treated wastewater however high no3 concentrations together with a lack of carbon c can enhance higher production of greenhouse gas n2o relative to n2 through incomplete denitrification zhao et al 2014 thus wastewater induced denitrification although removing reactive n could also be an ecosystem disservice burgin et al 2013 however wastewater typically contains high amounts of organic c as compared to receiving waterbodies debruyn and rasmussen 2002 which may facilitate complete heterotrophic denitrification with the n2 as the end product in the receiving sediments weymann et al 2010 moreover high c n and high c loading have been demonstrated to promote another ecosystem disservice dnra dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium over denitrification kraft et al 2014 hardison et al 2015 dnra converts wastewater no3 into biologically more reactive ammonium nh4 retaining n in the ecosystem previous results from sediments influenced by aquaculture waste christensen et al 2000 suggest that wastewater effluent with both high c and n concentrations could support dnra or even favor it over denitrification in the receiving sediments currently the knowledge on the influence of wastewater on nitrate reduction processes in natural systems is still rather poor since previous studies have focused mainly on changes in the genetic n transformation potential e g rahm et al 2016 saarenheimo et al 2017 they suggest that wastewater supports genetic denitrification potential by bringing more substrate and electron donors to the sediment microbes but also by bringing new wwtp microbes and shaping the natural microbial community in an urban stream study lofton et al 2007 measured higher potential denitrification rates at the wastewater influenced sites than at the pristine upstream sites but there is no information on wastewater driven changes in n2o production furthermore the effect of wastewater on dnra rates has only been measured in baltic sea estuary where it was found to increase dnra bonaglia et al 2014 this means that at the moment it is impossible to estimate the ultimate fate of wastewater nitrate and the true n removal potential of sediment microbes at least in lakes and other freshwater ecosystems in this study we used stable isotope approach ipt nielsen 1992 to measure denitrification truncated denitrification and dnra process rates in boreal lake sediments along a wastewater gradient wastewater could have a significant impact on n transformation processes especially in boreal lakes where denitrification rates are lower as compared to temperate lakes rissanen et al 2013 one important factor regulating denitrification of wastewater effluents in water bodies is the water residence time seitzinger et al 2006 which affects the contact time between water column nitrate and sediment wastewaters are commonly discharged several meters above the sediment surface into lake water columns meaning that in boreal area the seasonal variation in stratification patterns could control the contact times between wastewater and sediment e g wastewater would be near the sediment surface only in winter this would further lead to seasonal differences in sediment denitrification capacity in this study we increased the wastewater contact time throughout the year by discharging the water on the lake sediment surface through a special diffuser pipe system by this we aimed to increase concentration of wastewater near the sediment surface to support natural denitrification by using a full scale experimental approach we aimed to 1 compare how spatial allocation of wastewater affects seasonal n transforming processes and 2 estimate the applicability of the sediment diffuser method in wastewater n removal we hypothesized that wastewater increases denitrification rate but potentially also unfavorable n2o production or dnra in addition we hypothesized that sediment diffusion method reduces seasonal variation leading to higher overall n removal capacity 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the two wwtps keuruu 8200 population equivalent pe and petäjävesi 1800 pe are located in central finland fig 1 both wwtps have primary clarification and secondary treatment activated sludge with nitrification and discharge their treated effluents from a one point outlet to the lake under the normal conditions in keuruu wwtp nitrification process collapsed in winter 2015 due to cold weather in keuruu the recipient lake lake keurusselkä is a large humic lake 117 km2 belonging to kokemäenjoki drainage area with average depth of 6 4 m and a maximum depth of 40 m during the experimental study the diffuser pipe system having 50 holes 30 mm wide on both sides of the 30 m long and 60 cm diameter pe pipe suppl fig 1 was attached to the end of the original wwtp discharge pipe at the depth of 9 m for one year october 2014 november 2015 in petäjävesi the treated wwtp effluent is discharged to lake jämsänvesi which is a medium sized humic lake 0 9 km2 fig 1 belonging to kymijoki drainage area with average depth of 4 2 m and maximum depth of 27 m in august 2016 the original wwtp discharge pipe was extended with a similar diffuser pipe system as in keuruu except it had 100 holes 30 mm wide and the total length was 10 and the diameter 20 cm which directed the wastewater effluent to the sediment surface the costs of the diffuser systems were 35 000 in keuruu including technical design environmental permits construction and installation conducted by private companies and 3000 in petäjävesi conducted by the local authorities see saarenheimo et al 2017 for further description of the study sites 2 2 sampling intact sediment cores for process measurements were collected using the kajak sediment core sampler kc denmark a s in keuruu there were eight sampling trips between years 2014 and 2015 11 feb 2014 6 may 2014 4 aug 2014 14 oct 2014 20 jan 2015 19 may

fifteen sediment cores sediment height 25 cm and diameter 4 cm were collected per each lake site on both lake areas three main sampling points were sampled each time one located 0 8 km upstream from the wastewater discharge point one at the discharge point and one at approximately 200 300 m downstream from the discharge point except in 11 aug 2014 in petäjävesi see supplemental table 1 to study the effect of sediment diffusion system additional 2 4 points were sampled between discharge and downstream sampling points supplemental table 1 temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column were measured and bottom water collected for measuring concentration of dissolved inorganic ammonium nh4 and nitrate nitrite nox as in saarenheimo et al 2017 2 3 sediment core incubations after sampling intact sediment cores were transported to the university of jyväskylä laboratory and stored at in situ temperature in dark until next day after that the water above the sediment was replaced with water collected from the sampling sites without disturbing sediment surface 15no3 label k15no3 cambridge isotope laboratories was added to give an initial concentration of 150 μmol l and the cores one core per sampling point were capped with rubber stoppers and incubated at in situ temperature and in dark for 4 h with constant stirring 90 rpm pre incubation time of 5 min was used nielsen 1992 which could have led to appr 20 underestimation of d14 in lower temperatures due to inhomogeneous mixing of the endogenous 14no3 with the exogenous 15no3 eyre et al 2002 in addition the assumptions of ipt nielsen 1992 were verified with concentration series incubations 25 75 250 and 400 μmol l of 15no3 one core per concentration per sampling point at both lake sites in 2014 11 feb 6 may and 14 oct 2014 in keuruu and 8 may 9 jun 11 aug 2014 in petäjävesi in addition one core was used as an unlabeled control and one as a time zero control per each sampling point at the end of the incubations cores were efficiently mixed and slurry samples were collected for process measurements 2 4 isotope analysis 2 4 1 complete denitrification rates n2 production three slurry samples per one core were collected to glass vials 12 ml labco 100 μl of 30 formaldehyde was added to stop the microbial activities and samples were stored in cold and in dark until isotope analysis before irms analysis a helium headspace 5 5 ml was added to each sample following tiirola et al 2011 the isotope mass areas m z 28 29 and 30 and n2 concentration of the samples were analyzed with isoprime irms connected to tracegas preconcentrator unit using a modified n2o project with no cryotrapping and valves in co2 mode actual d14 and potential d15 150 μmol l of 15no3 denitrification rates the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification dn and the proportion of denitrification of the no3 in the water above the sediment dw were calculated as in rissanen et al 2013 2 4 2 truncated denitrification rates n2o production a slurry sample of 30 ml was collected to a syringe 60 ml and n2o was extracted to helium gas stored in the prevacuumed glass vial 12 ml and subsequently analyzed with isoprime irms connected to tracegas preconcentrator unit n2o production was calculated as in dong et al 2006 2 4 3 dnra rates dnra rates were measured from the three main sampling points and from the two additional points 50 and 100 m downstream from wastewater discharge point in keuruu for the analysis 100 ml of slurried sediment was collected and filtered gf c and nh4 was isolated by alkaline acid trap diffusion holmes et al 1998 where 40 ml of slurry water together with 2 g of nacl and 0 12 g of mgo and acid traps triple 1 cm diameter gf c filters acidified with 20 μl of 2 5 m khso4 was added to 250 ml glass bottles and incubated for four days in 35 c in shaker after the incubation trapped samples were dried for two days in a desiccator with sulfuric acid and atm 15 the proportion of 15n of total n of samples was analyzed with thermo finnigan flash ea1112 elemental analyzer connected to a thermo finnigan deltaplus advantage irms dnra rate was calculated as in christensen et al 2000 2 5 laboratory analysis samples for din species nh4 nox were filtered through glass fibre filters whatman gf f and measured as in rissanen et al 2011 furthermore the porosity and the proportion of organic matter of the sediment loi were determined for each sampling point as in rissanen et al 2011 2 6 lake keurusselkä 3 d flow model to estimate the contact time between wastewater effluent and lake bottom in the dynamic real world conditions we used a hydrodynamic simulation a 3 d model and a simulation model of lake keurusselkä with the wastewater effluent as a conservative tracer was built using the open source european union public license eupl coherens code luyten 2013 coherens solves the three dimensional hydrodynamic equations using the finite difference method assumes hydrostatic balance and uses the boussinesq approximation when solving buoyancy the modelled area is depicted in supplemental fig 2 the model input data included lake bathymetry wastewater discharge volume and concentrations lake inflows and outflows and weather temperature precipitation wind speed and direction humidity air pressure the bathymetry inflow and outflow data was provided by finnish environment institute wastewater data by keuruu wwtp and weather data by finnish meteorological institute fmi additional verification data of water currents was obtained using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp device at 15 min intervals over a period of 1 apr 22 jun 2015 we used version 2 9 of the coherens code to develop a nested lake keurusselkä high resolution model first the entire lake was modelled using a coarse 250 m horizontal resolution the results of this simulation were used as boundary conditions for a high resolution 10 m model around and including the wastewater outlet both resolution models used eleven terrain following vertical layers vertical mixing was based on the k ε turbulence scheme k turbulent energy ε the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy tvd total variation diminishing advection scheme was used for momentum and tracers and explicit horizontal diffusion was disabled in the coarse simulation model we used time dependant flows as open boundary data using the high resolution model we simulated a total of eight 48 h long situations four different seasons winter spring summer autumn and two wastewater discharge pipe configurations original pipe and diffuser pipe system for each season the original wastewater pipe releases the effluent into a single calculation cell 10m 10m at 1 m from the bottom while the sediment diffuser pipe system spreads the effluent into three cells at the bottom of the water column the simulation periods were chosen to coincide with field sampling occasions relevant input data was used for each season and the winter scenario also included the effect ice and snow cover the background concentration of wastewater effluent in the lake was set to zero at the beginning of each modelling scenario which enabled us to determine how the effluent behaves during the first few hours after the release see supplemental video supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 03 068 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video the simulation data was saved at 10 min intervals for post process calculation of the contact time of wastewater and the sediment surface we defined the contact time to be an arbitrary time interval multiplied by the fraction of wastewater effluent in the bottom layer of the water column vs the total effluent in the water column during the same time interval for example if 20 of all effluent in the model is found in the layer closest to bottom during some 10 min interval the contact time would be 0 2 600 s 120 s this means that in a stable system when time approaches infinity the contact time will approach time interval number of layers because the effluent will be nearly fully mixed in the water column in this method the only varying parameter is the wastewater discharge pipe configuration thus we could calculate how much the sediment diffuser pipe system altered the contact time area and concentration of wastewater as compared to the original wastewater pipe during the 48h simulation period 2 7 data analysis data from keuruu and petäjävesi was analyzed separately the concentration series sediment core data from the three main sampling points upstream wastewater discharge point and downstream was reported as the average of two or as the average standard error se of three to five cores per sampling occasion otherwise no replicate cores were taken supplemental table 1 the relative dnra rate dnra was calculated as the contribution of dnra on total nitrate reduction d14 n2o dnra and the relative n2o production n2o as the ratio between the n2o production and total denitrification i e n2 n2o using averaged values per each sampling date and site the interactions between transformation rates d14 d15 n2o n2o dnra dnra and environmental factors temperature oxygen concentration nox nh4 loi were studied using spearmann rank correlation separately before and after installing the sediment diffusor for this samples from 13 aug 2014 16 oct 2014 31 aug 2016 and 25 oct 2016 were used in petäjävesi data supplemental table 1 in keuruu data all sampling dates were included the differences in n transformation rates and environmental factors before and after the sediment diffusion method experiment were studied with wilcoxon signed rank test supplemental table 1 all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 the areal potential denitrification capacity was calculated for keuruu data by multiplying mean d15 for each sampling date with the estimated wastewater influenced lake area 33 3 ha for this only d15 measured using the same 15no3 concentration 150 μmol l was used by comparing the calculated areal denitrification potential mg nox d 1 to the long term data on nitrate input mg nox d 1 coming from the wwtp we could estimate how much sediment denitrification could potentially remove incoming wastewater nitrate per day proportion of nox potentially removed through denitrification we calculated the estimate for each sampling date season before and after sediment diffusion experiment and compared those to finally estimate how much sediment diffusion method can promote areal n removal through denitrification similar calculations were conducted using d14 to demonstrate the true areal denitrification capacity proportion of nox removed through denitrification and the improvement in the latter one 3 results both study sites had strong seasonal variation in the physico chemical characteristics e g temperature oxygen at wastewater influenced and control sampling points table 1 supplemental table 2 in petäjävesi loi was generally higher and oxygen concentration lower than in keuruu at the wastewater influenced sampling points in both keuruu and petäjävesi nox concentrations were always higher than nh4 except in winter 2015 in keuruu when the nitrification process collapsed in wwtp table 1 3 1 nitrate reduction processes along wastewater gradient in general the underlaying ipt assumptions on independence of d14 of and d15 increasing with labeled nitrate were met at the three main sampling points in keuruu and petäjävesi supplemental fig 3 however on 6 may 2014 there was no positive trend between d15 and labeled nitrate at the downstream sampling site in keuruu which was most likely due to the missing data from the cores incubated with the two lowest concentrations of 15no3 furthermore on 11 feb 2014 d14 was increasing with labeled nitrate at the wastewater influenced sampling points in keuruu nitrate reduction rates were highest at the wastewater influenced sampling points figs 2 3 at both study sites the complete n2 production d14 and potential d15 denitrification rates tended to decrease when moving downstream from the discharge point figs 2 3 dnra rates measured in keuruu had a similar decreasing pattern fig 2 truncated denitrification n2o production or relative n2o production rates n2o did not show any clear pattern between the wastewater influenced sampling points figs 2 3 in keuruu where all three nitrate reduction processes were measured denitrification was the main nitrate reduction process 86 12 of all nitrate reduction there was no difference in the contribution of dnra in nitrate reduction dnra between the wastewater influenced sampling points 9 2 and the control point 11 5 3 2 the influence of the sediment diffusion method on nitrate reduction processes based on 3d modelling the diffuser pipe system increased the contact time of wastewater with the sediment surface during the first few hours after release when compared to the original configuration supplemental fig 4 this was observed especially in spring and in autumn in winter ice covered time the effect was lowest but still positive in lake scale the wastewater concentration near the sediment increased with the sediment diffusion method in all seasons however no changes in total contact area were seen fig 4 nitrate concentrations did not increase after the sediment diffusion at the study sites wilcoxon p 0 05 table 1 at both study sites oxygen concentration at the bottom was higher after the sediment diffusion and loi was lower in keuruu but higher in petäjävesi wilcoxon p 0 05 table 1 sediment diffusion method did not increase d14 keuruu before 881 230 after 767 163 petäjävesi before 451 80 after 2689 2088 wilcoxon p 0 05 but the overall potential denitrification rates d15 increased at both sites keuruu before 1056 184 after 2048 408 z 2 20 p 0 028 petäjävesi before 820 91 after 2087 469 wilcoxon z 2 22 p 0 026 there was no difference in n2o n2o or dnra before and during the diffuser pipe system p 0 05 but dnra rates decreased significantly in keuruu before 218 82 after 70 28 z 2 10 p 0 036 the correlation patterns between the nitrate reduction rates and environmental factors before and after the sediment diffusion varied between the two study sites table 2 in petäjävesi d14 did not correlate with inorganic n concentrations but increased with oxygen and loi before the sediment diffusion after the optimization it correlated positively with nitrate and ammonium before the optimization d15 correlated positively with d14 oxygen and loi and negatively with temperature but after that the correlation to loi remained but d15 was higher when temperature was high and oxygen concentration low before the optimization n2o production and n2o increased with temperature and decreased with oxygen and n2o decreased with loi after the wastewater discharge was spatially optimized both actual n2o production and n2o decreased with loi in keuruu d14 was always related to nitrate concentration and after the diffuser pipe system also to ammonium table 2 before the sediment diffusion method d15 was higher in higher temperatures and in lower oxygen concentrations after the optimization it correlated with d14 but not with any environmental factors before the optimization n2o increased with oxygen but after that only with decreasing loi the dnra rates always followed nitrate and oxygen concentrations and were higher when temperature was low but they also followed ammonium after the sediment diffusion a similar relationship was found between dnra and temperature and oxygen in 2014 but not after the sediment diffusion in both years dnra was higher when loi was low 3 3 the influence of sediment diffusion method on areal nitrate removal capacity we estimated that denitrification could potentially remove 3 10 of wwtp nox load mg d 1 coming to the area in keuruu table 3 after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method the removal was improved in winter spring and autumn whereas it declined slightly in summer however when the removal estimate was based on true denitrification values measured d14 denitrification could remove 1 15 of wwtp nox load and sediment diffusion method improved removal only in spring and autumn table 3 4 discussion as expected highest nitrate reduction rates were observed close to the wastewater discharge points the measured n2 production rates d14 150 3500 μmol n m 2 d 1 in keuruu and 80 23500 μmol n m 2 d 1 in petäjävesi at these points were comparable to or even exceeded the previous reports from eutrophic hypertrophic lakes 900 1200 μmol n m 2 d 1 mengis et al 1997 290 1700 μmol n m 2 d 1 risgaard petersen et al 1999 and wastewater influenced estuarine sediments 40 370 μmol n m 2 d 1 bonaglia et al 2014 and denitrification was the main nitrate reduction pathway at all wastewater influenced sampling points both denitrification and dnra rates followed the wastewater gradient decreasing downstream as mixing and dilution decreased the wastewater and nitrate concentration there was also some seasonal variation as in keuruu complete denitrification and dnra were highest in winter contradicting with the previous studies from boreal lakes in which highest rates have been found in summer when nitrate and organic matter concentrations as well as temperature are high ahlgren et al 1994 rissanen et al 2011 this is probably due to the contact rate between wastewater and sediment being naturally high during the winter as also the highest nitrate concentrations were observed then in keuruu then we also saw d14 increasing with labeled nitrate which suggest that anammox could contribute to n2 production risgaard petersen et al 2003 however high nitrate and organic matter concentrations at wastewater influenced sampling points should not favor anammox as has been demonstrated earlier in wastewater influenced estuary sediments bonaglia et al 2014 it is possible that the amount of labeled nitrate was not high enough as compared to the natural nitrate concentrations or too short preincubation period eyre et al 2002 leading to inhomogeneous mixing of label with natural nitrate this was observed only in winter 2014 in keuruu when the nitrate concentration was the highest at the wastewater influenced sites agreeing with previous results on genetic nitrous oxide reduction potential in keuruu saarenheimo et al 2017 n2o production was not following wastewater nitrate gradient but was possibly related to seasonal factors and organic matter availability although the absolute dnra rates were occasionally high at the wastewater influenced sampling sites the average contribution of dnra in nitrate reduction was similar between wastewater and control points in general observed dnra was comparable to the ones recorded in eutrophic lake during high c availability 15 nizzoli et al 2010 but not as high as in aquaculture influenced sediments 300 christensen et al 2000 or in wastewater contaminated estuary sediments 50 1700 bonaglia et al 2014 although wastewater influenced sampling points seem to have higher amount of organic matter loi the organic matter quality could be less favorable for the fermentative dnra bacteria akunna et al 1993 in addition the amount of nitrate was always significantly higher at the wastewater sampling points lowering c n which should favor denitrifying bacteria kraft et al 2014 the habitat characteristics may also be more dynamic and turbid following the wastewater discharge volume and this could suppress the growth of dnra bacteria nogaro and burgin 2014 the 3d modelling results confirmed that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time between wastewater effluent and sediment in keuruu this was seen especially in spring and in autumn which are the mixing periods in the boreal lakes we did not expect any enhancement in winter when wastewater is naturally at the lake bottom and the water residence time is long also in summer heavy wastewater having high conductivity is supposed to stay at the bottom although sediment diffusion method increased near bottom wastewater concentration it did not increase the total wastewater influenced area indicating that the diffuser pipe system was probably not long enough in our sampling data we did not see a significant increase in the nitrate concentration in the bottom water after the diffuser pipe system it seems that process rates and modelling results are more reliable estimates of the effect of sediment diffusion method on n dynamics than only nitrate concentration interestingly we saw higher oxygen concentration at both study sites after the sediment diffusion method while organic matter concentration increased in petäjävesi and decreased in keuruu both factors being important in controlling nitrate reduction increased oxygen was most likely reflecting the higher concentration of fully oxygen saturated wastewater effluent near the sediment surface the lower loi in keuruu is in agreement with previous study from wastewater influenced river sediments lofton et al 2007 and could be due to more turbid conditions after the sediment diffusion in petäjävesi the wastewater discharge point has naturally lower water velocity and lower wastewater effluent volume suggesting that after the sediment diffusion wwtp derived organic matter could be sedimentated more efficiently to the bottom resulting in higher loi however the composition and quality of organic matter probably changed at both study sites after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method potential denitrification rates d15 were higher after the diffuser pipe system at both study sites and this was observed especially at the wastewater discharge sampling point where d15 were on average three times higher since d15 was not related to the environmental nitrate concentrations wastewater promoted it through some other mechanism we have previously shown that wastewater shapes the sediment microbial community composition significantly by bringing in wwtp microbes and modifying habitat characteristics saarenheimo et al 2017 so it is likely that by altering oxygen and organic matter concentrations and quality wastewater favored certain microbes which directly or indirectly contributed to denitrification the connection between wastewater and d15 is further corroborated with the found correlations between d15 and d14 in keuruu and d15 and loi in petäjävesi the connection between d15 and d14 was found in petäjävesi even before the sediment diffusion and our recent study showed that wastewater has indeed stronger impact on microbial community there than in keuruu saarenheimo et al 2017 complete denitrification d14 and dw data not shown followed inorganic n concentrations at both study sites and did not significantly increase after the sediment diffusion but the method successfully decreased seasonal effects e g oxygen or temperature on n2 production suggesting that the conditions were more favorable to denitrification microbes throughout the year furthermore although higher oxygen concentration could have supported nitrification and coupled nitrification denitrification bonaglia et al 2013 we did not find a significant increase in the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification dn after the sediment diffusion data not shown one reason for d14 not increasing after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method could be inhomogenous mixing of labeled and natural nitrate during ipt incubations due to inadequate pre incubation period and higher opd at cold temperatures eyre et al 2002 however within season temperatures remained similar in keuruu so possible underestimation of d14 happened at both study years in petäjävesi there was a slight decrease in temperatures after the sediment filtration system but since only summer and autumn samples were included in the data the temperature driven d14 underestimation was probably rather small we think that best explanation for d14 not increasing is that inorganic nitrogen concentration remained similar and there was no increase in the proportion of coupled nitrification denitrification after the implementation of the sediment diffusion method the increased oxygen concentration can explain the decrease in dnra observed in keuruu as re oxygenation of sediments favors denitrification over dnra de brabandere et al 2015 as the oxygen concentration increased after the sediment diffusion obligate anaerobic dnra bacteria were possibly suppressed nogaro and burgin 2014 decrease in dnra rate coincided also with decreased loi implying that lower carbon availability suppressed dnra kraft et al 2014 we did not analyze dnra in petäjävesi where loi increased however it was rather unlikely that dnra would have been promoted there as we saw no significant decrease in d14 and d15 even increased and conditions were probably too oxygen rich and turbid for dnra bacteria furthermore the quality of sediment organic matter can be even more important in governing the end product of nitrate reduction than the carbon content wwtp derived organic matter is considered to be more biodegradable and protein rich than natural organic matter nam and amy 2008 which should favor especially denitrifying microbes barnes et al 2012 sediment diffusion method did not affect n2o production or n2o it is possible that in addition to denitrification some proportion of n2o was derived from nitrification for example the negative correlation see goreau et al 1980 found between n2o and oxygen in keuruu after the sediment diffusion suggests that nitrification could be the main source of n2o this correlation was also observed in petäjävesi before the sediment diffusion organic matter concentration seems to be the main factor controlling n2o production and n2o especially after the sediment diffusion when nitrate levels were probably not limiting zhao et al 2014 in general higher carbon availability facilitates complete denitrification weymann et al 2010 the interaction between n2o and loi more likely reflects spatial distribution of n2o production rather than the effect of sediment diffusion as loi decreased but n2o did not increase in keuruu after the sediment diffusion since after the sediment diffusion n2o was constantly higher at downstream sampling points where loi was lower interestingly both n2o and n2o were higher in petäjävesi than in keuruu although loi was higher there even before the sediment diffusion in petäjävesi the loading of allochthonous carbon from the surrounding catchment area is substantial and lake color is darker than in keuruu this suggests that a significant proportion of sediment organic matter might be recalcitrant and less favorable for denitrifiers although seems to support the denitrification process until n2o agreeing with previous studies on carbon amended denitrification rates at the baltic sea oxic anoxic interface bonaglia et al 2016 and in boreal lakes sediments myrstener et al 2016 however further studies are needed to understand the importance of wastewater organic matter quantity and quality in governing these different nitrate reduction processes areal denitrification calculations based on d15 revealed that natural sediment denitrification could potentially remove 3 10 of wastewater nitrate input at keuruu site and sediment diffusion can increase the rate by 17 120 when using true denitrification values d14 the proportion of wastewater nitrate removed was 1 15 and sediment diffusion increased the rate by 22 61 although these calculations are based on process rates measurements from sampling points and calculated only on the 33 ha study area we can expect that they are rather realistic as our field observations have shown that wastewater can be detected during the first 400 m downstream from the discharge site and is after that efficiently diluted we did not take the improvement in the wastewater contact time or concentration into account in the calculations so in reality the improvement in the total areal nitrate removal capacity was probably higher previous estimates on denitrification nitrate removal potentials have been 2 of incoming nitrate from river sites lofton et al 2007 and 60 70 from constructed wetlands lee et al 2009 sediment diffusion method enhanced areal nitrate removal in spring and in autumn which followed the pattern in contact time however potential nitrate removal was increased also in winter although wastewater is then naturally near the sediment surface and thus no improvement in contact time was expected furthermore no change in contact time was observed in winter based on 3d modelling what makes it especially interesting is that in winter after installing the sediment diffusor pipe nitrification process in wwtp collapsed for several months and wastewater effluent consisted mainly of ammonium nitrogen possibly nitrification benefitted from the better oxygenation compensating the problems observed in the function of the wwtp and feeding efficiently denitrification community increasing the areal nitrate removal potential when using d14 based estimate in the calculations no improvement in the wastewater nitrate removal was seen in winter which can be explained with low nitrate concentration after the sediment diffusion as nitrification collapsed in wwtp here d15 based estimate is probably more realistic since it is always based on the same amount of label which corresponds the wintertime nitrate concentrations in keuruu when wwtp nitrification is functional 5 conclusions the full scale experiments showed that sediment diffusion method can create more favorable conditions for the sediment microbes and thus increase the denitrification potential furthermore they showed that in general wastewater promotes nitrate reduction supporting especially n2 production through complete denitrification as the nitrate rich wastewater had a longer contact time with the sediment sediment diffusion method enhanced the total areal wastewater nitrate removal especially in spring and autumn when wastewater would have otherwise been mixed with the lake water however in order to utilize sediment microbes more efficiently in wastewater n removal diffuser pipe system should be further modified to increase the effluent contact time and area with the sediment through this methodology nitrate removal can be enhanced with low costs in treatment plants where nitrification is part of the process as the implementation of the sediment diffusion method is easy and inexpensive it would be especially recommended for supplementing nitrate removal in small and medium sized

accelerate in the first 10 min of reaction the increasing concentration of s iv inhibited smx removal after since the high s iv concentration quenched reactive oxidative species ros then smx removal rate was accelerated with the increase of s iv concentration after s iv were consumed up the optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system was 1 1 with smx concentrations increasing from 1 to 50 μm smx removal rate was inhibited for the limitation of ros yields although the presence of so4 and oh was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance

prevent bacterial diseases such as coccidiosis diarrhea and gastroenteritis since 1930s guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 generally smx also can be released into the environment through effluent

various advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton activating persulfate and photo catalysis as alternative strategies for industrial and domestic wastewater treatment have been widely

acidic environment xiong et al 2014 the use of fe0 as a source of fe2 du et al 2017a might overcome the disadvantages of ros consumption by excessive fe2 and has been successfully coupled with hydrogen peroxide du et al 2017b xiong et al 2015 and persulfate xiong et al 2014 to degrade aquatic organics thus fe0 can be selected as a new activator of bisulfite instead of fe ii iron salts most recently li et al 2015 have reported the advanced performance of the fe0 s iv process on heavy metal cations removal meanwhile xiong et al 2016 have investigated the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol by the fe0 s iv process in aerobic and anaerobic conditions later xie et al 2017 have studied removal performance of organic pollutants in the fe0 s iv process purged with oxygen although so4 are considered as dominated ros in the fe0 s iv process on the basis of the theoretical activation of bisulfite by the released of fe ii shown in eqs 1 10 zhou et al 2014 the dominated ros has not been directly identified and generation pathways of ros were still not clarified in the fe0 s iv system moreover the corrosion of fe0 in the presence of o2 might also produce oxidative species such as hydroxyl radical and ferrate via reactions of eqs 11 14 lee et al 2008 which contributed to the removal of organic contaminants in previous studies the role of fe0 in the fe0 s iv o2 system was not clear and the contribution of radicals generated by fe0 o2 to target organics removal was ignored 11 fe0 o2 2h fe ii h2o2 12 fe0 h2o2 2h fe ii 2h2o 13 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 14 fe ii h2o2 fe iv h2o therefore in the present study smx was chosen as the target contaminant to investigate kinetics mechanisms and degradation pathway of smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 the objectives of this study are to

d p basis set including a single set of diffuse functions a single set of diffuse functions and a set of d functions on nonhydrogenic atoms and a set of p functions on hydrogen atoms du et al 2012 was employed to calculate nbo charges of the atom in smx molecule meanwhile hirshfeld charges hirshfeld 1977 were calculated by multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 iefpcm solvent model with uff atom radii was carried out for aqueous solution calculations condensed fukui function f k 0 based on atom charges hirshfeld and nbo charges of smx molecule were obtained by eq 15 guo et al 2016 15 f k 0 q k n 1 q k n 1 2 where k q f and n represent the atom in smx molecule the charge of the atom k the value of condensed fukui function and the number of electrons of smx respectively some intermediates were

and product and the single point energy calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of initial fe0 concentration on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 comparing experiments of smx degradation kinetics by fe0 o2 s iv o2 and fe0 s iv o2 were conducted as shown in fig s3 s iv quickly remove about 11 2 smx in the first 5 min of reactions and no more smx is degraded till the end of reactions at 60 min the extremely slight degradation of smx by s iv might be ascribed to the contribution of so3 e0 0 73 v das et al 1999 or other secondary ros including so5 so4 and hso5 produced by reactions between so3 and o2 via eqs 4 8 besides fe0 also showed lower reactivity to smx removal which was ascribed to the surface adsorption of fe0 and quickly achieved the stable removal rate in 5 min but the combination of fe0 and s iv could significantly enhance the degradation of smx as shown in fig 1 kinetics of smx degradation total dissolved iron release and the consumption of s iv by fe0 s iv o2 at different initial fe0 concentration were firstly studied measured reaction timecourses of smx degradation kinetics total dissolved iron release kinetics and s iv consumption kinetics are fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model eq 16 and a first order kinetic model eqs 17 and 18 with short dash lines in fig 1 a c respectively with the increase of fe0 loading from 0 25 to 5 mm the k obs of smx removal linearly increased from 0 008 to 0 076 min 1 as shown in the inset of fig 1 c the consumption rate of s iv and the release rate of dissolved iron linearly increased with the increase of fe0 loading according to eqs 1 10 the consumption of s iv by dissolved iron generated various ros which contributed to the degradation of smx although the activation of s iv via eqs 1 3 was blocked since s iv was almost consumed up in 20 min at different initial fe0 concentrations reactions of eqs 4 8 could produce more ros to supply the continuous degradation of smx moreover increased fe0 loading could induced more oh via eqs 11 13 in acid solution after s iv was full consumption thus increasing fe0 loading could enhance the activation of s iv and fe0 corrosion which both were positive to the removal of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system 16 d smx dt kobs smx 17 d fetotal dt ktotal iron release 18 d s iv dt ks iv consumption s iv where k obs k total iorn release and k s iv consumption represent the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 of smx removal the zero order rate constant of total iron release mg l 1 min 1 and the pseudo first order rate constant of s iv consumption min 1 in the fe0 s iv o2 system respectively smx fetotal and s iv stand for the concentration of smx total dissolved iron and s iv respectively 3 2 effects of initial s iv concentration on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 as shown in fig 2 effects of initial s iv concentration on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 are investigated the degradation rate of smx does not decreased in the first 5 min of reactions with the increase of s iv concentration which might be ascribed to the individual contribution of fe0 surface absorption and so3 or other secondary ros via direct reactions of s iv and o2 in this phase in the second phase of reactions between 5 and 10 min the activation of s iv by releasing fe ii fe iii produced more ros to remove smx but increasing s iv concentration showed a negative effect on smx removal since the high s iv concentration could quench ros and decrease smx removal to confirm this smx degradation kinetics by fe ii s iv o2 at different s iv concentration are studied in fig s4 and the result of comparing experiments proved the higher s iv depressed the degradation of smx by fe ii s iv o2 xiong et al 2016 also reported that the removal of 4 nitrophenol by fe0 s iv o2 in the initial phase of reactions was depressed at the high s iv concentration moreover most s iv was quickly consumed up after 10 15 min of reactions smx degradation was considered as the generation of so4 via eqs 4 10 and oh via eqs 11 13 as shown in fig 2 c k obs of smx removal increased with the increasing s iv concentration from 0 25 to 1 0 mm and was stable at higher s iv concentrations of 1 5 and 2 0 mm for the limitation of fe0 loading and k total iorn release also increased with the increase of initial s iv concentrations for one thing the addition of s iv decreased the system ph which was beneficial to the corrosion of fe0 for another s iv rapidly complexed with dissolved iron and blocked the formation of iron oxides on the surface of fe0 but increasing initial s iv concentration did not obtain higher removal rate of smx when s iv concentration reached 1 mm thus an optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal was 1 1 and the s iv concentration was set to 1 mm in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 3 effects of initial smx concentration on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 fig 3 shows the effect of initial smx concentration on smx removal kinetics at the optimal concentration of fe0 and s iv when smx increased to 10 μm smx removal kinetics exhibited two phases at smx concentrations of 10 20 and 50 μm the first phase also was contributed to the fast removal of smx by so3 and fe0 alone in the first 5 min of reactions smx removal kinetics was well fitted by eq 16 with smx concentration increasing from 1 to 50 μm the calculated k obs of smx removal kinetics decreased for the limitation of ros generation 3 4 identification of ros by chemical quenchers as mentioned above so4 and oh were considered as main ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system respectively thus the identification of main ros are very important to clear mechanisms of smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system the second order constants for meth towards oh and so4 are 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and for tert butyl alcohol tba are 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 respectively so quenching experiments in the presence of meth or tba were conducted to verify the contribution of oh or so4 to smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 fig 4 shows effects of meth and tba at different concentrations on the degradation of smx in fe0 s iv o2 process and smx degradation in s iv solution is also presented smx removal rates at 5 and 60 min are listed in detail in table s1 in the supplementary material only 31 8 and 37 3 smx were degraded by fe0 s iv o2 at 60 min in the presence of 2 5 mm meth and tba respectively similar smx removal rate in the presence of 2 5 mm meth an tba during reactions implied that the generation of oh in the fe0 s iv o2 process was dominant but the difference of smx removal rate by fe0 s iv o2 between with meth and tba indicated the presence of so4 which could not be ignored in addition the removal rate of smx decreased from 31 8 to 19 5 with the increase of meth concentration from 2 5 to 200 mm which was much closed to that of 23 8 in the presence of 200 mm tba the shrink difference on smx removal rate in the presence of meth and tba at higher concentrations might be ascribed to the quenching of so4 by tba at higher concentrations thus the quenching experiments with meth and tba proved the presence of oh and so4 and oh was the dominated ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 5 chemical detection of various ros to further confirm ros generated in the fe0 s iv o2 system dmpo was employed to trap oh so4 and so3 by epr spectrum li et al 2004 as shown in fig 5 a no signals of the dmpo oh adduct and dmpox the oxidative products of dmpo by oh are detected by epr in the fe0 alone system thus the slight removal of smx by fe0 alone was mainly ascribed to the surface absorption of fe0 meanwhile a typical signal of the dmpo so3 adduct was detected in the s iv solution at 2 min the generation of so3 could induce slight generation of secondary ros without dissolved iron and leaded to the minor removal of smx by s iv alone in the presence of o2 to obtain typical signals of dmpo oh dmpo so4 and hdmpo oh the oxidative products of hdmpo by oh adducts the classical fe0 persulfate system was employed to identified specific signals of various ros in fig 5 a as shown in fig 5 b so3 is well confirmed in the fe0 s iv o2 system at 5 min with the extension of reaction time so3 adducts disappear and strong identical signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts are detected in the fe0 s iv o2 system at 15 min in fig 5 c besides intensity of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were still strong enough in the fe0 s iv o2 solution at 30 min in fig 5 d so the degradation of smx were ascribed to oh and so4 after s iv was consumed up by combining results of chemical quenching experiments oh was the dominated ros which was responsible for the degradation of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 6 radicals generation pathways in the fe0 s iv o2 system the key role of fe0 in the fe0 s iv o2 process should be studied to clear the mechanisms of ros generation 1 10 phenanthroline which could coordinate with fe ii and fe iii in solution was employed to investigate effects of fe ii or fe iii on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 as shown in fig 6 the serious inhibition of smx removal is observed in the presence of 1 mm 1 10 phenanthroline although 1 10 phenanthroline could extensively decrease the concentration of dissolved fe ii but the direct reaction between fe0 and s iv was not restrained thus the strong negative effect of 1 10 phenanthroline on smx removal indicated that ros were produced by indirect reactions between fe0 and s iv the generation of so4 could be well explained by reactions between s iv and dissolved iron eqs 1 10 according to the detection of epr and chemical quenching experiments the contribution of so4 to smx was still existence after s iv and so3 were both consumed up thus so4 might be generated via other reaction pathways in eqs 4 and 5 hso5 was produced and so4 was easily produced by reactions between fe ii and hso5 as shown in fig s5 a generation kinetics of hso5 were determined in the fe0 s iv o2 system without smx with the decrease of s iv within 10 min increased hso5 was determined then hso5 decreased in the solution after 10 min of reactions with the release of dissolved fe ii which indicated the generation of so4 thus generation pathways of so4 might be via the activation of s iv by fe ii fe iii recycling and the activation of hso5 by fe ii the generation of oh might be ascribed to two different reactions fenton like reactions between fe0 and o2 via eqs 11 13 and transformation form so4 via eq 19 chen et al 2012 hence hydroxyl radical generation pathway should be clarified to understand activation mechanisms of s iv by fe0 although edta coordinated with fe ii and fe iii edta was considered as a common promoter in fenton like reactions especially in fe0 o2 reactions keenan and sedlak 2008 as illustrated in fig 6 the addition of 1 mm edta at the start of the reaction shows a critical inhibition on smx removal by fe0 s iv o2 dissolved fe ii was not employed to activate s iv since edta showed strong complexing ability towards fe ii see fig s5 though fe0 o2 reactions were accelerated by edta ros generated in the fe0 o2 system was quickly quenched by residual s iv which was not consumed by edta fe ii curiously the degradation of smx was not depressed when 1 mm edta was added into the solution at 10 min meanwhile removal efficiency of smx in the fe ii hso5 system are seriously inhibited by edta see fig s5 b so oh as dominated ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system might not be all transformed from so4 produced by fe ii hso5 and oh might be produced via the fe0 o2 system eq 11 13 which generally accelerated oh generation by edta after s iv was consumed up to further confirm the occurrence of fe0 o2 reactions the concentration of h2o2 was determined in the fe0 s iv o2 system as shown in fig s5 a the production of h2o2 increases with the decrease of s iv and then decreases after s iv was consumed up which is consistent with the variation of hso5 in the fe0 s iv o2 system consequently oh was produced via fe0 o2 reactions in the fe0 s iv o2 system overall the transformation from so4 via eq 19 and fe0 o2 reactions via eqs 11 13 both produced oh in the acid solution 19 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 3 7 geometries optimization of smx by dft fukui function calculations of f k 0 was generally employed to assign the most vulnerable sites of smx in the presence of radicals thus hirshfeld and nbo charges distribution of the optimized smx molecule n 1 and n 1 by two functional methods are shown in table s2 and values of condensed fukui function f k 0 calculated from hirshfeld charges obtained using m06 functional method are listed in table 1 for f k 0 the most positive values occurred at c2 c4 c6 s7 n8 o9 o10 and n11 suggesting that they were the most favorable sites for radical attack resulting in the cleavage of sn and sc bond adjacent to the s atom besides the analysis of favorable sites for radicals attack were employed to deduce the degradation intermediates and elucidate possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 the calculated results of f k 0 are checked with nbo charges and b3lyp functional method see tables s3 and s4 and similar favorable sites for radicals attack are obtained in table s4 3 8 possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 many studies have identified the degradation intermediates of smx by various oxidation processes including ozonation guo et al 2015 chlorination gao et al 2014 permanganate oxidation gao et al 2014 and various aops hu et al 2007 trovo et al 2009 the species of reaction intermediates and degradation pathways of smx removal even in different aops identified by gc ms lc ms and hplc were different but no studies revealed the mechanisms of smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 thus uhplc ms ms was employed to detect the reaction intermediates of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system analytic results of degradative products in smx degradation chromatogram positive and negative ion mode at different time intervals are shown in figs s6 s23 and listed in table s5 based on condensed fukui functions f k 0 of smx molecule and analytic results of uplc ms possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 are proposed in fig 7 in pathway a electrophilic replacement of c2 or c6 on the aromatic ring by oh forming pa 1 as the ortho hydroxylated smx then oh attacking on s7n11 bond resulted in the generation of p 1 and pa 2 the amino group of pa 2 was continuously attacked by oh at n8 and pa 2 was oxidized to pa 3 and pa 4 pathway a was considered as the classical smx degradation pathway via oh attacking which was proposed in solar photo fenton and tio2 photocatalysis reactions hu et al 2007 in pathway b in particular electrophilic addition on c14 and c13 of the isoxazole ring by oh forming pb 1 as dihydroxylated smx was frequently detected in many aops including fenton trovo et al 2009 fenton like du et al 2017b tio2 photocatalysis hu et al 2007 and electrochemical processes de amorim et al 2013 besides so4 might also attack the olefinic double bond between c14 and c13 and generate pb 1 yang et al 2017 on the one hand oh attacking on s7n11 resulted in the generation of pb 2 and 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid although 4 aminobenzenesulfonic was not detected the formation of p1 which was considered the product of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic via oh substitution might indicate that p1 was involved in pathway b in addition the p 2 was subsequently formed through coupling of the n centered radical derived from nh2 group of pa 2 and pb 2 in the meantime the opening of the isoxazole ring was assessed by identifying compound pb 6 the dehydrogenation reaction on alcohol group and the loss of one carbonyl group formed the intermediate pb 7 afterwards the loss of h2o in pb 7 induced the generation of pb 8 similar pathway of opening isoxazole ring was reported in the degradation of smx by solar photo fenton trovo et al 2009 in pathway c reactive site n8 of smx was attacked by oh and formed pc 1 no2 smx pc 1 was easily detected in aops based on so4 direct attacking on n8 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the presence of so4 was proved in previous sections on the contrary pc 1 was rarely reported in the degradation of smx by oh the formation of pc 1 on n8 was simply concluded by the analysis of condensed fukui functions f k 0 to confirm the oh attacking on n8 in smx the reaction pathway for smx with oh on c18 is calculated by dft methods the formation of pc 1 was the classical oxidative product of amino group in smx and h abstraction by oh radical attack on amino group was the necessary reaction pathway the profile of the potential energy surface for n8 attacking by oh shown in fig s24 the reaction energy barrier of the n8 h abstraction channel was 1 6 kcal mol 1 which proved that the oxidation of smx on n8 via oh was easily realized in theory moreover the formation of pc 1 also included the contribution of so4 in the fe0 s iv o2 system with the production of pc 1 pc 2 considered as a hydroxyl substitution of pc 1 was easily formed by the attack of oh the attack of oh on c14 might form pd 1 in pathway d but this processes was not usually observed either the reaction pathway for smx with oh on c14 was calculated by dft methods and profiles of the potential energy surface were shown in fig s25 although the huge value of reaction energy barrier 37 97 kcal mol 1 might indicate that the attacking on c14 via oh was difficult to be occurred in theory the catalysis reaction might easily overcome the reaction energy barrier and completed the reaction on c4 wang et al 2011 reported that the formation of pd 1 via the substitution of the methyl group by oh radical attack on the isoxazole ring of smx in the photoelectro fenton catalysis process therefore the detection of pd 1 in the fe0 s iv o2 process was possible for the catalysis process between fe ii and s iv 4 conclusions smx degradative kinetics mechanisms and degradation pathways were studied in novel aops based on fe0 s iv o2 effects of solution factors on smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 were optimized increasing fe0 from 0 25 mm to 5 mm enhanced the activation of s iv and fe0 corrosion in the fe0 s iv o2 system in the first 10 min of reaction the increasing concentration of s iv inhibited smx removal after since the high s iv concentration quenched ros and decrease smx removal and smx removal rate was accelerated by the increasing concentration of s iv after s iv were consumed up the optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system was 1 1 with the increase of smx concentrations from 1 to 50 μm smx removal rate decreased for the limitation of ros in this study the dominating ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system was firstly confirmed by the combination of chemical quenchers and epr spectrum although the presence of so4 and oh was confirmed oh was considered as the dominating ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system besides strong inhibition effects of 1 10 phenanthroline on smx degradation in the fe0 s iv o2 process proved that ros was generated by the indirect reactions between dissolved fe ii and situ generated oxidants such as hso5 and h2o2 the generation of so4 was ascribed to the activation of s iv by fe ii fe iii recycling and the activation of hso5 by fe ii meanwhile the transformation of so4 might also form oh besides comparing experiments with edta at 0 and 10 min proved that fe0 o2 reactions could contribute the production of oh in conclusion the transformation from so4 and fe0 o2 reactions both provide oh furthermore geometries optimization of smx by dft confirmed the reactive sites that were more vulnerable for radicals attacking finally four possible degradation pathways of smx degradation were firstly proposed in the fe0 s iv o2 system based on reactive sites attacking by radicals and intermediate products determined by uhplc ms acknowledgements this work was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china 51678188

19612,in this study batch experiments were carried out to investigate the key factors on sulfamethoxazole smx removal kinetics in a new aops based on the combination of zero valent iron fe0 and bisulfite s iv with the increase of fe0 from 0 25 mm to 5 mm the removal rate of smx was linearly increased in the fe0 s iv o2 system by accelerating the activation of s iv and fe0 corrosion to accelerate in the first 10 min of reaction the increasing concentration of s iv inhibited smx removal after since the high s iv concentration quenched reactive oxidative species ros then smx removal rate was accelerated with the increase of s iv concentration after s iv were consumed up the optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system was 1 1 with smx concentrations increasing from 1 to 50 μm smx removal rate was inhibited for the limitation of ros yields although the presence of so4 and oh was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum oh was identified as the dominant ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system by chemical quenching experiments besides strong inhibitive effects of 1 10 phenanthroline on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 proved that the generation of ros was rely on the release of fe ii and fe iii the generation of so4 was ascribed to the activation of s iv by fe ii fe iii recycling and the activation of hso5 by fe ii and oh was simultaneously transformed from so4 and generated by fe0 o2 density functional theory dft calculation was conducted to reveal special reactive sites on smx for radicals attacking and predicted intermediates finally four possible smx degradation pathways were accordingly proposed in the fe0 s iv o2 system based on experimental methods and dft calculation graphical

contaminants in drinking water and wastewater xu et al 2007 recently in china zhang et al 2015 have reported that about 53 800 tons of the antibiotics has been entered into the receiving environment which even constitute 33 of all antibiotics usage in 2013 sulfamethoxazole smx as one of the common sulfonamides accounting for 5 of chinese antibiotics consumption has been widely used to treat and prevent bacterial diseases such as coccidiosis diarrhea and gastroenteritis since 1930s guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 generally smx also can be released into the environment through effluent discharge from pharmaceutical manufacturing plants larsson et al 2007 and conventional wastewater treatment plants usually exhibit a low removal rate of smx between 20 and 30 for its antibacterial nature liu et al 2012 in china the measured concentration of smx in different aquatic environments usually maintains at the ng l 1 to μg l 1 level which cannot directly show toxicity or side effects on human health zhang et al 2015 besides increasing bacterial resistance and resistant genes generated by residual smx have raised serious concerns from the general public and bring new challenges for traditional water treatment technologies zhang et al 2015 thereby it is essential to control the concentration of smx like antibiotics in aquatic environments by developing efficient technologies various advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton activating persulfate and photo catalysis as alternative strategies for industrial and domestic wastewater treatment have been widely investigated in the degradation of aquatic emergency organic pollutants including smx fenton 1894 pignatello et al 2006 aops can effectively destroy organic pollutants by generating hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 generally so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v processing a higher redox potential than oh e0 1 9 2 7 v have shown higher oxidative ability towards most organics by hydrogen abstraction and addition in a wide ph range zou et al 2013 over the past decades aops based on the activation of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate by various methods have been widely investigated most recently a new aop based

coupled with bisulfite activating bisulfite by iron recycling showed several advantages comparing to other aops for the relatively cheap cost easy handling and harmless oxidative product of bisulfite qi et al 2017 chen et al 2012 have reported that a fe ii s iv system showed effective decolorizing rates towards many dyes in aqueous solution at ph 1 to 10 which was compared with fe ii persulfate and fenton fe ii h2o2 systems in addition the fe ii s iv process coupled with uv vis irradiation also showed much higher acid orange 7 removal rate zhou et al 2014 according to chen et al 2012 and zhou et al 2014 reactions in the fe ii s iv complex system are summarized in eqs 1 10 moreover xu et al 2016 also reported that arsenite could be easily oxidized to arsenate in an fe iii s iv system under visible light among the proposed mechanisms transformations of so3 to so5 and so5 to so4 are completed and so4 has been considered as the main reactive oxidative species ros that response to the

of other anions cl or so4 2 guan et al 2015 as an alternative zero valent iron fe0 is used as a source of fe ii through the corrosion of fe0 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions especially in acidic environment xiong et al 2014 the use of fe0 as a source of fe2 du et al 2017a might overcome the disadvantages of ros consumption by excessive fe2 and has been successfully coupled with hydrogen peroxide du et al 2017b xiong et al 2015 and persulfate xiong et al 2014 to degrade aquatic organics thus fe0 can be selected as a new activator of bisulfite instead of fe ii iron salts most recently li et al 2015 have reported the advanced performance of the fe0 s iv process on heavy metal cations removal meanwhile xiong et al 2016 have investigated the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol by the fe0 s iv process in aerobic and anaerobic conditions later xie et al 2017 have studied removal performance of organic pollutants in the fe0 s iv process purged with oxygen although so4 are considered as dominated ros in the fe0 s iv process on the basis of the theoretical activation of bisulfite by the released of fe ii shown in eqs 1 10 zhou et al 2014 the dominated ros has not been directly identified and generation pathways of ros were still not clarified in the fe0 s iv system moreover the corrosion of fe0 in the presence of o2 might also produce oxidative species such as hydroxyl radical and ferrate via reactions of eqs 11 14 lee et al 2008 which contributed to the removal of organic contaminants in previous studies the role of fe0 in the fe0 s iv o2 system was not clear and the contribution of radicals generated by fe0 o2 to target organics removal was ignored 11 fe0 o2 2h fe ii h2o2 12 fe0 h2o2 2h fe ii 2h2o 13 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 14 fe ii h2o2 fe iv h2o therefore in the present study smx was chosen as the target contaminant to investigate kinetics mechanisms and degradation pathway of smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 the objectives of this study are to 1 assess effects of solution factors including fe0 concentrations s iv concentration and smx concentration on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 2 identify the dominant ros and elucidate the generating mechanism of the dominated ros in the fe0 s iv o2 process and 3 clarify smx degradation pathways in the fe0 s iv o2 system by experimental methods and theoretical calculation 2 materials

methodology of chemical calculations all theoretical calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package revision d 01 frisch et al 2013 the density functional theory m06 and b3lyp with the 6 31g d p basis set including a single set of diffuse functions a single set of diffuse functions and a set of d functions on nonhydrogenic atoms and a set of p functions on hydrogen atoms du et al 2012 was employed to calculate nbo charges of the atom in smx molecule meanwhile hirshfeld charges hirshfeld 1977 were calculated by multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 iefpcm solvent model with uff atom radii was carried out for aqueous solution calculations condensed fukui function f k 0 based on atom charges hirshfeld and nbo charges of smx molecule were obtained by eq 15 guo et al 2016 15 f k 0 q k n 1 q k n 1 2 where k q f and n represent the atom in smx molecule the charge of the atom k the value of condensed fukui function and the number of electrons of smx respectively some intermediates were

and product and the single point energy calculations were performed at the m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of initial fe0 concentration on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 comparing experiments of smx degradation kinetics by fe0 o2 s iv o2 and fe0 s iv o2 were conducted as shown in fig s3 s iv quickly remove about 11 2 smx in the first 5 min of reactions and no more smx is degraded till the end of reactions at 60 min the extremely slight degradation of smx by s iv might be ascribed to the contribution of so3 e0 0 73 v das et al 1999 or other secondary ros including so5 so4 and hso5 produced by reactions between so3 and o2 via eqs 4 8 besides fe0 also showed lower reactivity to smx removal which was ascribed to the surface adsorption of fe0 and quickly achieved the stable removal rate in 5 min but the combination of fe0 and s iv could significantly enhance the degradation of smx as shown in fig 1 kinetics of smx degradation total dissolved iron release and the consumption of s iv by fe0 s iv o2 at different initial fe0 concentration were firstly studied measured reaction timecourses of smx degradation kinetics total dissolved iron release kinetics and s iv consumption kinetics are fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model eq 16 and a first order kinetic model eqs 17 and 18 with short dash lines in fig 1 a c respectively with the increase of fe0 loading from 0 25 to 5 mm the k obs of smx removal linearly increased from 0 008 to 0 076 min 1 as shown in the inset of fig 1 c the consumption rate of s iv and the release rate of dissolved iron linearly increased with the increase of fe0 loading according to eqs 1 10 the consumption of s iv by dissolved iron generated various ros which contributed to the degradation of smx although the activation of s iv via eqs 1 3 was blocked since s iv was almost consumed up in 20 min at different initial fe0 concentrations reactions of eqs 4 8 could produce more ros to supply the continuous degradation of smx moreover increased fe0 loading could induced more oh via eqs 11 13 in acid solution after s iv was full consumption thus increasing fe0 loading could enhance the activation of s iv and fe0 corrosion which both were positive to the removal of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system 16 d smx dt kobs smx 17 d fetotal dt ktotal iron release 18 d s iv dt ks iv consumption s iv where k obs k total iorn release and k s iv consumption represent the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 of smx removal the zero order rate constant of total iron release mg l 1 min 1 and the pseudo first order rate constant of s iv consumption min 1 in the fe0 s iv o2 system respectively smx fetotal and s iv stand for the concentration of smx total dissolved iron and s iv respectively 3 2 effects of initial s iv concentration on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 as shown in fig 2 effects of initial s iv concentration on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 are investigated the degradation rate of smx does not decreased in the first 5 min of reactions with the increase of s iv concentration which might be ascribed to the individual contribution of fe0 surface absorption and so3 or other secondary ros via direct reactions of s iv and o2 in this phase in the second phase of reactions between 5 and 10 min the activation of s iv by releasing fe ii fe iii produced more ros to remove smx but increasing s iv concentration showed a negative effect on smx removal since the high s iv concentration could quench ros and decrease smx removal to confirm this smx degradation kinetics by fe ii s iv o2 at different s iv concentration are studied in fig s4 and the result of comparing experiments proved the higher s iv depressed the degradation of smx by fe ii s iv o2 xiong et al 2016 also reported that the removal of 4 nitrophenol by fe0 s iv o2 in the initial phase of reactions was depressed at the high s iv concentration moreover most s iv was quickly consumed up after 10 15 min of reactions smx degradation was considered as the generation of so4 via eqs 4 10 and oh via eqs 11 13 as shown in fig 2 c k obs of smx removal increased with the increasing s iv concentration from 0 25 to 1 0 mm and was stable at higher s iv concentrations of 1 5 and 2 0 mm for the limitation of fe0 loading and k total iorn release also increased with the increase of initial s iv concentrations for one thing the addition of s iv decreased the system ph which was beneficial to the corrosion of fe0 for another s iv rapidly complexed with dissolved iron and blocked the formation of iron oxides on the surface of fe0 but increasing initial s iv concentration did not obtain higher removal rate of smx when s iv concentration reached 1 mm thus an optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal was 1 1 and the s iv concentration was set to 1 mm in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 3 effects of initial smx concentration on smx degradation kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 fig 3 shows the effect of initial smx concentration on smx removal kinetics at the optimal concentration of fe0 and s iv when smx increased to 10 μm smx removal kinetics exhibited two phases at smx concentrations of 10 20 and 50 μm the first phase also was contributed to the fast removal of smx by so3 and fe0 alone in the first 5 min of reactions smx removal kinetics was well fitted by eq 16 with smx concentration increasing from 1 to 50 μm the calculated k obs of smx removal kinetics decreased for the limitation of ros generation 3 4 identification of ros by chemical quenchers as mentioned above so4 and oh were considered as main ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system respectively thus the identification of main ros are very important to clear mechanisms of smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system the second order constants for meth towards oh and so4 are 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and for tert butyl alcohol tba are 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 respectively so quenching experiments in the presence of meth or tba were conducted to verify the contribution of oh or so4 to smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 fig 4 shows effects of meth and tba at different concentrations on the degradation of smx in fe0 s iv o2 process and smx degradation in s iv solution is also presented smx removal rates at 5 and 60 min are listed in detail in table s1 in the supplementary material only 31 8 and 37 3 smx were degraded by fe0 s iv o2 at 60 min in the presence of 2 5 mm meth and tba respectively similar smx removal rate in the presence of 2 5 mm meth an tba during reactions implied that the generation of oh in the fe0 s iv o2 process was dominant but the difference of smx removal rate by fe0 s iv o2 between with meth and tba indicated the presence of so4 which could not be ignored in addition the removal rate of smx decreased from 31 8 to 19 5 with the increase of meth concentration from 2 5 to 200 mm which was much closed to that of 23 8 in the presence of 200 mm tba the shrink difference on smx removal rate in the presence of meth and tba at higher concentrations might be ascribed to the quenching of so4 by tba at higher concentrations thus the quenching experiments with meth and tba proved the presence of oh and so4 and oh was the dominated ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 5 chemical detection of various ros to further confirm ros generated in the fe0 s iv o2 system dmpo was employed to trap oh so4 and so3 by epr spectrum li et al 2004 as shown in fig 5 a no signals of the dmpo oh adduct and dmpox the oxidative products of dmpo by oh are detected by epr in the fe0 alone system thus the slight removal of smx by fe0 alone was mainly ascribed to the surface absorption of fe0 meanwhile a typical signal of the dmpo so3 adduct was detected in the s iv solution at 2 min the generation of so3 could induce slight generation of secondary ros without dissolved iron and leaded to the minor removal of smx by s iv alone in the presence of o2 to obtain typical signals of dmpo oh dmpo so4 and hdmpo oh the oxidative products of hdmpo by oh adducts the classical fe0 persulfate system was employed to identified specific signals of various ros in fig 5 a as shown in fig 5 b so3 is well confirmed in the fe0 s iv o2 system at 5 min with the extension of reaction time so3 adducts disappear and strong identical signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts are detected in the fe0 s iv o2 system at 15 min in fig 5 c besides intensity of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were still strong enough in the fe0 s iv o2 solution at 30 min in fig 5 d so the degradation of smx were ascribed to oh and so4 after s iv was consumed up by combining results of chemical quenching experiments oh was the dominated ros which was responsible for the degradation of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system 3 6 radicals generation pathways in the fe0 s iv o2 system the key role of fe0 in the fe0 s iv o2 process should be studied to clear the mechanisms of ros generation 1 10 phenanthroline which could coordinate with fe ii and fe iii in solution was employed to investigate effects of fe ii or fe iii on smx degradative kinetics by fe0 s iv o2 as shown in fig 6 the serious inhibition of smx removal is observed in the presence of 1 mm 1 10 phenanthroline although 1 10 phenanthroline could extensively decrease the concentration of dissolved fe ii but the direct reaction between fe0 and s iv was not restrained thus the strong negative effect of 1 10 phenanthroline on smx removal indicated that ros were produced by indirect reactions between fe0 and s iv the generation of so4 could be well explained by reactions between s iv and dissolved iron eqs 1 10 according to the detection of epr and chemical quenching experiments the contribution of so4 to smx was still existence after s iv and so3 were both consumed up thus so4 might be generated via other reaction pathways in eqs 4 and 5 hso5 was produced and so4 was easily produced by reactions between fe ii and hso5 as shown in fig s5 a generation kinetics of hso5 were determined in the fe0 s iv o2 system without smx with the decrease of s iv within 10 min increased hso5 was determined then hso5 decreased in the solution after 10 min of reactions with the release of dissolved fe ii which indicated the generation of so4 thus generation pathways of so4 might be via the activation of s iv by fe ii fe iii recycling and the activation of hso5 by fe ii the generation of oh might be ascribed to two different reactions fenton like reactions between fe0 and o2 via eqs 11 13 and transformation form so4 via eq 19 chen et al 2012 hence hydroxyl radical generation pathway should be clarified to understand activation mechanisms of s iv by fe0 although edta coordinated with fe ii and fe iii edta was considered as a common promoter in fenton like reactions especially in fe0 o2 reactions keenan and sedlak 2008 as illustrated in fig 6 the addition of 1 mm edta at the start of the reaction shows a critical inhibition on smx removal by fe0 s iv o2 dissolved fe ii was not employed to activate s iv since edta showed strong complexing ability towards fe ii see fig s5 though fe0 o2 reactions were accelerated by edta ros generated in the fe0 o2 system was quickly quenched by residual s iv which was not consumed by edta fe ii curiously the degradation of smx was not depressed when 1 mm edta was added into the solution at 10 min meanwhile removal efficiency of smx in the fe ii hso5 system are seriously inhibited by edta see fig s5 b so oh as dominated ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system might not be all transformed from so4 produced by fe ii hso5 and oh might be produced via the fe0 o2 system eq 11 13 which generally accelerated oh generation by edta after s iv was consumed up to further confirm the occurrence of fe0 o2 reactions the concentration of h2o2 was determined in the fe0 s iv o2 system as shown in fig s5 a the production of h2o2 increases with the decrease of s iv and then decreases after s iv was consumed up which is consistent with the variation of hso5 in the fe0 s iv o2 system consequently oh was produced via fe0 o2 reactions in the fe0 s iv o2 system overall the transformation from so4 via eq 19 and fe0 o2 reactions via eqs 11 13 both produced oh in the acid solution 19 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 3 7 geometries optimization of smx by dft fukui function calculations of f k 0 was generally employed to assign the most vulnerable sites of smx in the presence of radicals thus hirshfeld and nbo charges distribution of the optimized smx molecule n 1 and n 1 by two functional methods are shown in table s2 and values of condensed fukui function f k 0 calculated from hirshfeld charges obtained using m06 functional method are listed in table 1 for f k 0 the most positive values occurred at c2 c4 c6 s7 n8 o9 o10 and n11 suggesting that they were the most favorable sites for radical attack resulting in the cleavage of sn and sc bond adjacent to the s atom besides the analysis of favorable sites for radicals attack were employed to deduce the degradation intermediates and elucidate possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 the calculated results of f k 0 are checked with nbo charges and b3lyp functional method see tables s3 and s4 and similar favorable sites for radicals attack are obtained in table s4 3 8 possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 many studies have identified the degradation intermediates of smx by various oxidation processes including ozonation guo et al 2015 chlorination gao et al 2014 permanganate oxidation gao et al 2014 and various aops hu et al 2007 trovo et al 2009 the species of reaction intermediates and degradation pathways of smx removal even in different aops identified by gc ms lc ms and hplc were different but no studies revealed the mechanisms of smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 thus uhplc ms ms was employed to detect the reaction intermediates of smx in the fe0 s iv o2 system analytic results of degradative products in smx degradation chromatogram positive and negative ion mode at different time intervals are shown in figs s6 s23 and listed in table s5 based on condensed fukui functions f k 0 of smx molecule and analytic results of uplc ms possible degradation pathways of smx by fe0 s iv o2 are proposed in fig 7 in pathway a electrophilic replacement of c2 or c6 on the aromatic ring by oh forming pa 1 as the ortho hydroxylated smx then oh attacking on s7n11 bond resulted in the generation of p 1 and pa 2 the amino group of pa 2 was continuously attacked by oh at n8 and pa 2 was oxidized to pa 3 and pa 4 pathway a was considered as the classical smx degradation pathway via oh attacking which was proposed in solar photo fenton and tio2 photocatalysis reactions hu et al 2007 in pathway b in particular electrophilic addition on c14 and c13 of the isoxazole ring by oh forming pb 1 as dihydroxylated smx was frequently detected in many aops including fenton trovo et al 2009 fenton like du et al 2017b tio2 photocatalysis hu et al 2007 and electrochemical processes de amorim et al 2013 besides so4 might also attack the olefinic double bond between c14 and c13 and generate pb 1 yang et al 2017 on the one hand oh attacking on s7n11 resulted in the generation of pb 2 and 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid although 4 aminobenzenesulfonic was not detected the formation of p1 which was considered the product of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic via oh substitution might indicate that p1 was involved in pathway b in addition the p 2 was subsequently formed through coupling of the n centered radical derived from nh2 group of pa 2 and pb 2 in the meantime the opening of the isoxazole ring was assessed by identifying compound pb 6 the dehydrogenation reaction on alcohol group and the loss of one carbonyl group formed the intermediate pb 7 afterwards the loss of h2o in pb 7 induced the generation of pb 8 similar pathway of opening isoxazole ring was reported in the degradation of smx by solar photo fenton trovo et al 2009 in pathway c reactive site n8 of smx was attacked by oh and formed pc 1 no2 smx pc 1 was easily detected in aops based on so4 direct attacking on n8 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the presence of so4 was proved in previous sections on the contrary pc 1 was rarely reported in the degradation of smx by oh the formation of pc 1 on n8 was simply concluded by the analysis of condensed fukui functions f k 0 to confirm the oh attacking on n8 in smx the reaction pathway for smx with oh on c18 is calculated by dft methods the formation of pc 1 was the classical oxidative product of amino group in smx and h abstraction by oh radical attack on amino group was the necessary reaction pathway the profile of the potential energy surface for n8 attacking by oh shown in fig s24 the reaction energy barrier of the n8 h abstraction channel was 1 6 kcal mol 1 which proved that the oxidation of smx on n8 via oh was easily realized in theory moreover the formation of pc 1 also included the contribution of so4 in the fe0 s iv o2 system with the production of pc 1 pc 2 considered as a hydroxyl substitution of pc 1 was easily formed by the attack of oh the attack of oh on c14 might form pd 1 in pathway d but this processes was not usually observed either the reaction pathway for smx with oh on c14 was calculated by dft methods and profiles of the potential energy surface were shown in fig s25 although the huge value of reaction energy barrier 37 97 kcal mol 1 might indicate that the attacking on c14 via oh was difficult to be occurred in theory the catalysis reaction might easily overcome the reaction energy barrier and completed the reaction on c4 wang et al 2011 reported that the formation of pd 1 via the substitution of the methyl group by oh radical attack on the isoxazole ring of smx in the photoelectro fenton catalysis process therefore the detection of pd 1 in the fe0 s iv o2 process was possible for the catalysis process between fe ii and s iv 4 conclusions smx degradative kinetics mechanisms and degradation pathways were studied in novel aops based on fe0 s iv o2 effects of solution factors on smx degradation by fe0 s iv o2 were optimized increasing fe0 from 0 25 mm to 5 mm enhanced the activation of s iv and fe0 corrosion in the fe0 s iv o2 system in the first 10 min of reaction the increasing concentration of s iv inhibited smx removal after since the high s iv concentration quenched ros and decrease smx removal and smx removal rate was accelerated by the increasing concentration of s iv after s iv were consumed up the optimal ratio of s iv concentrations to fe0 concentration for smx removal in the fe0 s iv o2 system was 1 1 with the increase of smx concentrations from 1 to 50 μm smx removal rate decreased for the limitation of ros in this study the dominating ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system was firstly confirmed by the combination of chemical quenchers and epr spectrum although the presence of so4 and oh was confirmed oh was considered as the dominating ros in the fe0 s iv o2 system besides strong inhibition effects of 1 10 phenanthroline on smx degradation in the fe0 s iv o2 process proved that ros was generated by the indirect reactions between dissolved fe ii and situ generated oxidants such as hso5 and h2o2 the generation of so4 was ascribed to the activation of s iv by fe ii fe iii recycling and the activation of hso5 by fe ii meanwhile the transformation of so4 might also form oh besides comparing experiments with edta at 0 and 10 min proved that fe0 o2 reactions could contribute the production of oh in conclusion the transformation from so4 and fe0 o2 reactions both provide oh furthermore geometries optimization of smx by dft confirmed the reactive sites that were more vulnerable for radicals attacking finally four possible degradation pathways of smx degradation were firstly proposed in the fe0 s iv o2 system based on reactive sites attacking by radicals and intermediate products determined by uhplc ms acknowledgements this work was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china 51678188

19613,with the increased concentrations and kinds of refractory organic contaminants rocs in aquatic environments many previous reviews systematically summarized the applications of carbon based materials in the adsorption and catalytic degradation of rocs for their economically viable and environmentally friendly behavior interestingly recent studies indicated that carbon based materials in natural environment can also mediate the transformation of rocs directly or indirectly due to their abundant persistent free radicals pfrs understanding the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbo based materials and their interactions with rocs is essential to develop their further applications in environment remediation however there is no comprehensive review so far about the direct and indirect removal of rocs mediated by pfrs in amorphous porous and crystalline carbon based materials the review aims to evaluate the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials synthesized through pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization processes the influence of synthesis conditions temperature and time and carbon sources on the types as well as the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials are also discussed in particular the effects of metals on the concentrations and types of pfrs in carbon based materials are highlighted because they are considered as the catalysts for the formation of pfrs the formation mechanisms of reactive species and the further transformation mechanisms of rocs are briefly summarized and the surface properties of carbon based materials including surface area types and number of functional groups etc are found to be the key parameters controlling their activities however due to diversity and complexity of carbon based materials the exact relationships between the activities of carbon based materials and pfrs are still uncertain finally the existing problems and current challenges for the rocs transformation with carbon based materials are also pointed out graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon based materials hydrochar black carbon refractory organic contaminants persistent free radicals pollution control mechanism 1 introduction environmentally persistent free radicals pfrs in airborne fine and ultrafine particulate matter have received considerable attentions during the last two decades assaf et al 2016 because they cause pulmonary disease cardiopulmonary dysfunction and cancer cormier et al 2006 pope et al 2002 xia et al 2004 different from traditional free radicals pfrs are relatively stable their half lives in the atmosphere are on the order of hours and days the adverse health impacts are attributed to oxidative stress induced by environmentally pfrs through the formation of reactive oxygen species ros including superoxide anion radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 etc chung et al 2006 gehling et al 2014 squadrito et al 2001 recent studies indicated that environmentally pfrs could also induce the formation of ros in aqueous solutions khachatryan and dellinger 2011 khachatryan et al 2011 2014 dellinger and coworkers systematically investigated the formation of ros in aqueous solutions with cuo silica particles and confirmed environmentally pfrs in cuo silica particles could induce the formation of o2 h2o2 and oh although failing to trap superoxide radicals in aqueous solutions khachatryan et al 2011 multiple studies have been established that environmentally pfrs were formed in the post flame and cool zone regions of combustion systems as well as other thermal processes gehling and dellinger 2013 vejerano et al 2011 2012 the environmentally pfrs have been ubiquitously detected in the environment such as in aqueous solution soils and sediments in addition to airborne particulate matter dela cruz et al 2014 dela cruz et al 2011 kiruri et al 2013 likewise carbon based materials produced by thermal processes such as biochar and hydrochar also contained numerous pfrs chen et al 2017 mohan et al 2014 xiong et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 these radicals may promote the formation of ros and thus influence the transformation of organic and inorganic contaminants in water fang et al extensively studied the applications of biochar in the water remediation and found that biochar could activate o2 h2o2 and persulfate to produce reactive species such as oh and sulfate radical so4 to degrade organic contaminants fang et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b lian and xing 2017 zhu et al 2017 moreover the abundant redox active moieties on the surface of carbon based materials like quinone hydroquinone and phenolic moieties conjugated π electron systems would provide plentiful redox sites for them because these moieties could act as electron donor and acceptor simultaneously kappler et al 2014 klupfel et al 2014 sanroman et al 2017 yu et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that both biochar and hydrochar can directly mediate the reduction of inorganic metal ions such as fe3 or cr6 dong et al 2011 fang et al 2018 hsu et al 2009 qin et al 2017 biochar can even induce the degradation of organic contaminants p nitrophenol in water yang et al 2016 2017a as well known carbon based materials have extensively been utilized in the elimination of various organic contaminants in soil and water due to their low cost high sorption capacity geological abundance and environmental benignity gao et al 2016 he et al 2014 lian et al 2016 liu et al 2015 mohan et al 2006 sarkar et al 2018 titirici et al 2012 numerous previous studies have been demonstrated that carbon based materials possessing high surface areas and abundant functional groups exhibited promising adsorption capacity han et al 2016 shimabuku et al 2016 suhas et al 2007 tan et al 2016 vikrant et al 2018 for example qiu et al reported that straw biochar was an effective adsorbent for both cationic and anionic dyes qiu et al 2009 pine needles derived biochar could adsorb nonpolar and polar organic contaminants including naphthalene nitrobenzene m dinitrobenzene and trichloroethylene ahmad et al 2013 chen et al 2008 fernandez et al also indicated that orange peels derived hydrochar was effective absorbent for the removal of diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen fernandez et al 2015 however the adsorption alone cannot fully destroy these organic contaminants and the used carbon based materials containing these adsorbed organic contaminants have to be treated as hazardous waste because these organic contaminants may cause serious threat to the health of humans and wildlife and many of them are considered as toxicants endocrine disruptors and carcinogens even at very low concentrations ahmad et al 2013 an et al 2015 watanabe et al 2005 for these reasons considerable attention has been recently paid to investigate the catalytic ability of carbon based materials gao et al 2014 2015 kimura and miyamoto 1994 moreno castilla et al 2010 during the last two decades numerous studies have demonstrated the excellent ability of carbon based materials to activate various oxidants such as h2o2 o3 and persulfate including peroxymonosulfate and peroxodisulfate to form ros for the degradation of refractory organic contaminants rocs georgi and kopinke 2005 santos et al 2009 saputra et al 2013 since activated carbon carbon nanotubes cnts including multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and single walled carbon nanotubes swnts and graphene have been well studied sarkar et al 2018 yang et al 2017b this review would not present these in details carbon based materials synthesized through the pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization of biomass are only emphasized in this review and naturally occurring carbon based materials are discussed the first part focuses on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in the carbon based materials with either hydrothermal or pyrolysis carbon based materials the second part provides a system view of the transformation mechanisms of rocs in water mediating by in situ produced pfrs from carbon based materials the overarching objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on the recent advances in the formation mechanisms and applications of pfrs in carbon materials and a better understanding of the potential roles of carbon based materials in organic contaminants transformation mechanism as well as environmental remediation of rocs in waters 2 the pfrs formation in carbon based materials 2 1 the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials currently numerous carbon based materials with different morphologies and structures including crystalline porous and amorphous carbon have been synthesized with different kinds of techniques and precursors depending on operating conditions precursors undergo different reactions to produce carbon based materials with different properties the formation mechanism of pfrs in different carbon based materials could thus be different from each other although pfrs have been found in cigarette smoke and coals date back to the 1950s ingram et al 1954 lyons et al 1958 the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials are still not fully understood because of the variety of synthesis methods and the high complexity of reaction processes therefore this review will mainly focus on the hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes to illustrate the possible formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials based on the limited documents 2 1 1 the formation mechanism of pfrs during the hydrothermal process hydrothermal process is a thermochemical conversion process performed in hot water under elevated temperature and pressure depending on the reaction conditions the main products of hydrothermal process include solid hydrochar liquid bio oil and gases with different percentage distributions fang et al 2018 yan et al 2009 2010 therefore hydrothermal process could be classified into three main parts according to the final main products fig s1 pavlovic et al 2013 1 hydrothermal carbonization htc performed at the relatively low temperature ranges of 160 260 c under autogenic pressure 2 6 mpa corresponding the reaction temperature in water for hydrochar production liu and balasubramanian 2014 2 hydrothermal liquefaction htl carried out at about 200 370 c with pressures between 4 and 20 mpa for heavy oil production he et al 2014 and 3 hydrothermal gasification htg occurred at a near critical temperatures for hydrogen rich gas production peterson et al 2008 though the main desired products in htl and htg processes are liquid and gaseous fuels instead of hydrochar these processes htl and htg are also frequently utilized to synthesize mwcnts carbon films carbon microspheres and so on gogotsi and yoshimura 1994 hu et al 2010 moreno and yoshimura 2001 zheng et al 2009 as shown in fig s1 htc and htl processes are carried out in subcritical conditions and htg process is performed in supercritical conditions hence htc and htg processes are both taken as examples to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of hydrothermal processes htc process which is proposed to describe the natural coalification process by friedrich bergius in 1913 bach and skreiberg 2016 ennis et al 2012 has been widely applied in the synthesis of hydrochar funke and ziegler 2010 kruse et al 2013 qin et al 2017 as well known htc process is dominated by ionic reactions at high concentration of hydronium ions h3o and hydroxide ions oh generated by water autoionization in subcritical condition fang et al 2018 guo et al 2010 kalinichev and churakov 1999 tekin et al 2014 the h3o and oh catalyze the hydrolysis of high molecular weight organic compounds to form oligomers then to monomers fig s2 kang et al 2013 sevilla and fuertes 2009 wang et al 2016b due to the complexity of biomass components and their properties the hydrolysis degree and products are very different from each other for example the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose occurs at 180 c and 200 c respectively while only a small fraction of lignin could be decomposed during the htc process table s1 some weak linkage bonds such as c c and c x x represents heteroatomic in the biomass and their hydrolysis products will cleave to form reactive monomeric radicals fig 1 hu et al 2014 sabio et al 2016 these radicals can abstract hydrogen to generate aromatic compounds or undergo dehydration and fragmentation reactions to generate other intermediate products and radicals then polymerization condensation or aromatization take place to produce hydrochar as the final products jain et al 2016 kambo and dutta 2015 meanwhile some of the unpaired electrons in the radicals are stabilized by cyclic carbon π system resulting in the formation of pfrs in hydrochar demir cakan et al 2009 on the other hand water is easily dissociated to yield reactive oh and h in supercritical condition due to the decrease of water density akiya and savage 2002 and thus free radical reactions dominate in the htg process firstly h produced by the dissociation of water reacts with oxygen to form peroxy radicals eq 1 resulting in the relatively high concentration of oh which could react with various kind of biomass due to its strong oxidizability ding et al 1996 then radical chain reactions take place by breaking some weak linkage bonds and abstracting hydrogen eqs 2 and 3 finally homolytic hydroxylation eq 4 and condensation eq 5 reactions terminate the radical chain reactions phenol and quinone radicals namely pfrs formed during the reactions are not reactive enough to start a free radical chain reaction but can interact with reactive free radicals to reduce the number of free radicals and inhibit free radical reaction chain moreover the replacement of hydroxyl groups decreases the stability of benzene ring because π electrons become delocalized guo et al 2010 therefore further substitution and attack result in the ring cleavage reactions and the formation of relatively low molecular weight compounds the free radical scavenger is a stable free radical which is not reactive enough to start a free radical chain reaction however it can interact with reactive free radicals thereby reducing the numbers of free radical and inhibiting the overall free radical reaction chain he et al 2014 1 o 2 h ho 2 2 r h h r h 2 3 r o 2 roo 4 r oh roh 5 r r r r although the hydrothermal process has been widely investigated most of previous works have been focused on the formation mechanism of final products rather than the formation mechanism of pfrs the generation process of pfrs in hydrochar is still not fully understood due to the variety of precursors the complexity of underlying reactions and the serious lack of efficient characterization techniques for the in situ detection of pfrs formation process it is therefore of great significance to improve experimental and theoretical methods to investigate the pfrs formation mechanism 2 1 2 the formation mechanism of pfrs during the pyrolysis process pyrolysis is one of main formation processes of black carbon in natural environment which is an important natural constituent keiluweit et al 2010 pignatello et al 2006 and significantly influences the migration and transformation of rocs in natural environment cornelissen et al 2005 black carbon such as activated carbon graphite cnts graphene oxide go soot and biochar produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel biofuel and biomass has been found in oceanic and lacustrine sediments soil organic matter particulate matter in rivers and atmospheric particulates accounting for about 4 of total soil carbon and 9 of organic carbon in aquatic sediments cornelissen et al 2005 koelmans et al 2006 kramer et al 2004 at present carbon based materials produced from pyrolysis process have been recently utilized as catalysts in environment remediation due to their remarkable electron accepting capacities saquing et al 2016 xu et al 2010 although pfrs in carbon based materials produced by pyrolysis have been found more than sixty years ago cormier et al 2006 uebersfeld et al 1954 and play an important role in the catalytic processes they have not received much attention until two decades ago assaf et al 2016 depending upon the reaction temperature time and heating rate pyrolysis process could be divided into slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis and gasification onay and kockar 2003 in general increasing reaction temperature leads to decrease of product yields nassini et al 2016 onay 2007 with increase of carbon in carbon based materials shen 2015 slow pyrolysis is regarded as a main process for the transformation of biomass to carbon based materials due to the relatively high solid yields 25 35 as compared with other pyrolysis processes liu et al 2015 mohan et al 2006 slow pyrolysis around 300 c is believed to initiate a free radical process by the homolytic cleavage of bonds with further increase of reaction temperature i e above 300 c and below 500 c the decomposition of biomass mainly yields anhydrosugars anhydroglucose which are less reactive than the free radicals produced during bond cleavage le brech et al 2016 during the pyrolysis process the main components of biomass i e cellulose hemicellulose and lignin undergo their own reaction pathways and the destructive pyrolysis temperatures of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin are corresponding to 300 c 300 400 c and 350 450 c respectively di blasi 2009 nzihou et al 2013 the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose initiates by the depolymerization to produce oligosaccharides figs s3 and s4 patwardhan et al 2011 shen and gu 2009 shen et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and is followed by the formation of their own monomers and monomeric radicals for the cleavage of glucosidic bond the decomposition mechanism of lignin involving a series of free radical reactions kibet et al 2012 is more complex than cellulose and hemicellulose due to its more complex structure jakab et al 1997 radicals are also formed in the first step of lignin pyrolysis by the homolytic cleavage of the α and β alkyl aryl ether bonds c c and c o linkage which have lower bond dissociation energies to form the corresponding radical fig 2 kotake et al 2014 these radical species can further generate the radical coupling products or abstract hydrogens from other molecules finally a series of reactions such as dehydration decarboxylation aromatization and intramolecular condensation are performed sequentially to form so called biochar collard and blin 2014 during the pyrolysis process at high temperature abundant phenol or quinone moieties are also produced from the phenolic lignin in biomass and then could further transfer the electron to transition metals to form surface bound pfrs in biochar fig 3 fang et al 2014a according to these works the break of chemical bonds in precursors is likely the prime reason for the generation of pfrs in biochar and hydrochar but the formation processes of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by other methods such as chemical vapor deposition laser ablation and arc discharge method have been reported moreover early studies have demonstrated that the pfrs in carbon based materials could be classified into three types according to the different central atom of pfrs carbon centered pfrs without connected with other heteroatoms carbon centered pfrs connected with an adjacent oxygen atom and oxygen centered pfrs parshetti et al 2013 qin et al 2017 however the formation mechanisms of these different types of pfrs in carbon based materials are still not attempted in this regard much efforts are needed to systemically investigate the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by different technologies 2 2 the effects of different influence factors on pfrs formation in carbon based materials due to the variety of precursors and synthesis conditions the factors affecting the concentrations and types of pfrs are extremely complex and have not been clearly elucidated however the relevant studies are very limited at this moment and most are focused on the optimization of different factors affecting the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar thus the detail advances on the influence of synthesis parameters and metal precursors selection on the formation concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar are summarized in this section based on the limited available publications 2 2 1 the analysis of pfrs in carbon materials previous studies have been demonstrated that the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar were easy to detect due to their excellent resonance stabilities there was a positive correlation between the esr signal intensity and the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials moreover the spectral splitting factor of esr spectra g factors can be used to identify the types of carbon materials for carbon centered pfrs without connected to other heteroatoms these g factors were less than 2 0030 g factors of carbon centered pfrs connected with an adjacent oxygen atom were in the range of 2 0030 2 0040 while oxygen centered pfrs have g factors larger than 2 0040 hales and case 1981 2 2 2 the influence of synthesized parameters on pfrs formation as mentioned above the cleavage of chemical bonds in precursors may be one of the critical step of pfrs formation process therefore pyrolysis temperature and time which determine the break of chemical bonds will significantly affect the types and concentration of pfrs in biochar dela cruz et al 2012 fang et al 2015a vejerano et al 2011 typically the g factors decreased clearly along with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and time table s1 fig 4 c and d fang et al 2014a 2015a liao et al 2014 suggesting that the initially generated oxygen centered pfrs were then mixed with carbon centered free radicals however a sudden increase in the g factor was observed by liao et al during the cooling process 120 150 min in concert with the increase of esr signal intensity liao et al 2014 this is because the shrink of macromolecule structures at different directions and the breakdown of chemical bonds during the cooling process can result in the generation of additional free radicals sakaguchi et al 2010 for example the cleavage of c o bonds or oxygen incorporation into broken c c bonds may lead to the formation of oxygen centered pfrs thus resulting resulted in the sharp increase of pfrs concentrations maskos et al 2005 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 300 c to 600 c the concentrations of pfrs in biochar increased rapidly fang et al 2015a liao et al 2014 yang et al 2016 but then decreased markedly when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 c figs 4 and 5 and table s1 fang et al 2014a 2015a yang et al 2016 this may be attributed to the breakdown and reorganization of organic structures which results in the disappearing of free radicals unfortunately the limited numbers of publications could not provide more detailed information about the influences of pyrolysis temperature on the concentrations of pfrs in biochar fang et al 2014a 2015a yang et al 2016 the pyrolysis time is another complex parameter to influence the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials a recent study by liao et al indicated that the generation of free radicals in biochars contained several stages fig 4a and b liao et al 2014 in the initial stage the cleavage of some weak linkage bonds resulted in the formation of pfrs in biochar then the outer surface free radicals would rapidly react and dissipate resulting in the decrease of pfrs concentration subsequently the pfrs concentration further change with the increase of pyrolysis time plenty of free radicals may accumulate on the limited surface area of biochar leading to the apparent decrease of esr signals in addition the shrinkage of macromolecule structures at different directions and the cleavage of chemical bonds during the cooling process of biochars can also result in the dominant formation of additional free radicals sakaguchi et al 2010 however the different stages of biochar produced by numerous precursors may require different times under different pyrolysis temperature therefore the pfrs concentration in different kinds of biochar present different trends with the increase of pyrolysis time for example fang et al synthesized biochar with needles at 300 c 400 c 500 c and 600 c denoted as p300 p400 p500 and p600 respectively and found that the pfrs concentrations in p300 and p400 increased significantly with the pyrolysis time prolonged from 1 to 12 h while decreased dramatically in p500 and p600 table s1 fang et al 2015a in fact the pfrs concentrations in latter two carbon based materials were even below the detection limit during the pyrolysis time at 2 or 12 h respectively due to the complex synthesis conditions and structures of biochar it is still difficult to completely clarify the dependence of the pfrs concentrations on the pyrolysis temperature and time 2 2 3 the influence of precursors on pfrs in carbon based materials according to present research on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials organic compounds in precursors experience different reactions and then produce different free radical intermediates in the same pyrolysis condition so precursors are also important factors affecting the pfrs formation in carbon based materials although some researchers have reported that biochar produced by different precursors at the same conditions exhibited the same type of pfrs with different g factors and concentrations fig 4 and table s1 fang et al 2014a liao et al 2014 it was still difficult to thoroughly elucidate the influence mechanism of precursors on the types and concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials liao et al compared the types and concentrations of biochar synthesized with lignin and cellulose at 200 c liao et al 2014 and found that the pfrs concentration in biochar produced from lignin were 5 times higher than that of cellulose fig 4 even though lignin is more stable than cellulose fang et al reported that loading organic compounds also affected the concentrations of pfrs in biochar fang et al 2015a as shown in fig 6 a and b the pfr concentration rapidly increased when the hydroquinone phenol or catechol concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mmol l 1 but decreased with further increase of the concentration of organic compounds from 5 0 to 50 mmol l 1 meanwhile the g factors of pfrs in biochar increased from 2 0042 to 2 0052 2 0048 and 2 0048 when 1 0 mmol l 1 ct ph or hq was loaded suggesting that the type of pfrs in biochar were still oxygen centered pfrs although the type of pfrs in biochar kept unchanged loading organic compounds of the biomass may also be an alternative to change types of pfrs in biochar because of their significant influence on the g factors of pfrs in fact many studies indicated that the addition of acid and base also can act as catalysts to accelerate the hydrothermal conversion of biomass to hydrochar jain et al 2016 jin and enomoto 2011 small amounts of acids and base could catalyze the dehydration of biomass unfortunately the concentrations and types changes of pfrs in hydrochar have not yet been attempted now further research is needed to investigate the roles of acids and base catalysts on the formation of pfrs in carbon based materials synthesized with different methods 2 2 4 the influence of external metals on the pfrs in carbon based materials it has been also reported that the phenol or quinone moieties formed during the pyrolysis processes of biomass can transfer electron to transition metals to produce surface bound pfrs in biochar fang et al 2014a therefore it is of great importance to investigate the influences of metals in precursors on the pfrs in biochar however the kinds and concentrations of transition metals in precursors are still difficult to identify fang et al investigated the effect of loaded transition metal ions i e fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 on pine needles to elucidate their effects on the formation pfrs in biochar fang et al 2015a they found that the pfr concentration increased sharply when 0 1 mmol l 1 of transition metal ions was loaded but decreased rapidly with further increase of the concentration from 0 1 to 2 mmol l 1 fig 6c and d this is because of the double effect of transition metal ions on the formation of pfrs during the pyrolysis processes at relatively low concentration transition metal ions can accept electrons from phenol or quinone moieties and favor the formation of pfrs in biochar on the other hand excess amount of transition metal ions can also consume pfrs because pfrs can mediate electron transfer process to accelerate the reduction of transition metals such as fe3 and cr6 hsu et al 2009 xu et al 2014 then resulting in the consumption of pfrs with the loading of fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 at a concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 the g factors of pfrs in biochar decreased from 2 0042 to 2 0032 2 0039 2 0036 and 2 0040 indicating that the types of pfrs in biochar converted form oxygen centered pfrs to carbon centered pfrs with an adjacent oxygen atom this study indicated that metals can significantly influence the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar but the affecting mechanisms are still not so clear the influence of metals on the concentrations and types of pfrs in hydrothermal processes to form hydrochar has not been reported but one work confirmed that metals can promote the dehydration condensation and carbonization step of biomass during the htc process cui et al 2006 moreover heavy metals in biochar significantly influence its qualities eg the heavy metals in biochar may release to environment and cause environmental pollution when they are used as fertilizers to provide nutrients for plants liu et al 2017 major et al 2010 many studies also confirmed that biochar made from biomass with trace heavy metals may cause significant environmental risks because they can increase the leaching of metals reduce the bioavailability or mobility of metals decrease the microbial activity and affect the microbial community dynamics beauchemin et al 2015 jones and quilliam 2014 therefore more detailed work should be established to evaluate the role of metals in the formation of pfrs in carbon based materials in summary previous studies suggested that the types and concentrations of pfrs in biochar are influenced by many factors including synthesis conditions precursors and so on however the underling mechanisms of these factors are still not fully understood moreover the influence factors of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by other methods have not been reported therefore more research is needed to better understand the role of various studies on the pfrs formation in carbon based materials 3 the transformation mechanism of rocs mediated by pfrs in carbon based materials with the rapid growth of population and economy numerous kinds of rocs are continuously released to natural aquatic environment from their manufacture and application processes and result in adverse effects on the public health as well as the aquatic ecosystems even at trace level carbon based materials with abundant surface functional groups and high specific surface area have been frequently utilized as adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants in water for a long time upadhyayula et al 2009 the adsorption mechanisms of inorganic and organic contaminants onto various kinds of carbon based materials including hydrogen bond π π interactions electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction ahmad et al 2014 upadhyay et al 2014 have been well studied and already been summarized by many previous studies dabrowski et al 2005 inyang and dickenson 2015 mohan et al 2014 thus in this section the degradation mechanisms of rocs by ros generated from carbon based materials as well as the pfrs in carbon based materials are reviewed in details hereafter furthermore due to the high complexity of structure and components the factor affecting the activity of carbon based materials are also discussed 3 1 the catalytic oxidation of rocs by reactive free radicals from carbon based materials as well known carbon based materials such as c3n4 gu et al 2014 mamba and mishra 2016 zheng et al 2016 c60 arbogast et al 1991 lee et al 2008 2009 yamakoshi et al 2003 and c70 arbogast and foote 1991 moor et al 2015 have been highly regarded as effective heterogeneous photocatalysts for pollution abatement as they are more environmental friendly and avoid metal leaching problems compared with metal based catalysts li et al 2015 2016 shi et al 2013 2014 wang et al 2017 since the photocatalytic mechanisms have been well studied and already been summarized in many studies this review would not present these in details however little knowledge has been reported on the photocatalytic properties of biochar and hydrochar chen et al 2017 fang et al 2017 which widely exist in natural environment a recent study by chen at al systematically compared the sulfadimidine removal performances of biochar with hydrochar in the dark as well as under solar light irradiation chen et al 2017 the authors suggested that the formation of ros in the dark was dependent on the pfrs while the oxygenated functional groups were responsible for the ros generation under daylight irradiation the pfrs concentration in biochar was much higher than that of hydrochar because hydrochar contained more oxygenated functional groups therefore the sulfadimidine removal efficiency of biochar was obviously higher than that of hydrochar in the dark but the yields of h2o2 and oh as well as the sulfadimidine degradation efficiency of biochar were significantly lower than that of hydrochar under daylight irradiation carbon based materials also exhibited excellent catalytic ability to activate oxidants including o3 beltrán et al 2005 gonçalves et al 2012 2013 kasprzyk hordern 2003 h2o2 huang et al 2003a b ribeiro et al 2013 and persulfate duan et al 2015a liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 through the direct electron transfer process to produce ros such as oh and so4 for the degradation of rocs fig 7 figs s5 and s6 for example huang et al prepared six kinds of biochar under different temperatures and evaluated their activation ability toward h2o2 for the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine huang et al 2016 the results indicated that all biochar exhibited excellent ability for the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for sulfamethazine degradation with the increase pyrolysis temperature from 300 c to 800 c the degradation efficiency increased from 93 4 to 100 and the degradation rate constant increased from 0 0211 to 0 427 min 1 sun et al performed a series studies on the persulfate activation with numerous kinds of carbon based materials including activated carbon saputra et al 2013 mesoporous carbon tian et al 2016 hydrochar wang et al 2016c graphene duan et al 2016d indrawirawan et al 2015a kang et al 2016 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016a cnts duan et al 2015b 2015c 2015d 2016b sun et al 2014 and nanodiamonds duan et al 2016a 2016c indrawirawan et al 2015b and demonstrated that these carbon based materials can play promising roles in the catalytic degradation processes of rocs even though the catalytic decomposition of oxidants by carbon based materials for the degradation of rocs have been investigated and reviewed by few researchers the activation mechanisms are still controversial at present one of the commonly accepted oxidant activation mechanisms by carbon based materials was similar to the fenton reaction and haber weiss mechanism kimura and miyamoto 1994 take the h2o2 activation by activated carbon as an example the delocalized π electrons on graphene layers transferred via electron donors acceptors onto activated carbon surface to h2o2 then to produce oh as following eqs 6 and 7 kimura and miyamoto 1994 moreno castilla et al 2010 6 activated carbon h 2 o 2 activated carbon oh oh 7 activated carbon h 2 o 2 activated carbon h 2 o h however there was no direct evidence to prove the formation of activated carbon even though the generation of ros can be demonstrated by esr moreover two different reaction mechanisms including radical and nonradical reactions have been proposed to explain the persulfate activation process with carbon based materials fig 7 oh et al 2016 but the exact activation mechanisms are still unclear due to the lack of direct evidence to clarify the reaction processes although esr has proved the generation of oh so4 and other kinds of reactive species moreover recent studies by fang et al has been demonstrated that pfrs in carbon based materials play key roles in affecting their catalytic activity fang et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b which have not been involved in most of previous studies they suggested that carbon based materials such as activated carbon and several kinds of biochar could effectively activate oxidants including o2 h2o2 or persulfate via a single electron transfer process from pfrs on carbon based materials to oxidants to produce ros for the degradation of rocs figs s5 and s6 the yields of ros were positively linearly correlated with the pfrs concentrations in biochar and increased with the increase of pfrs concentrations indicating that pfrs were the main contributor to ros formation they also indicated that the oxygen centered pfrs are more reactive than carbon centered pfrs with adjacent oxygen toward persulfate for the generation of so4 fang et al 2015a after the activation processes the pfrs concentration in carbon based materials decreased significantly and thus inhibited the activity of carbon based materials to improve the catalytic activity of carbon based materials surface modification including physical and chemical activation duan et al 2016d liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 and heteroatom doping duan et al 2015a indrawirawan et al 2015a kang et al 2016 li et al 2017 liang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2016a were also utilized because they can i increase the specific area and surface functional of carbon based materials ii improve π electron mobility through the conjugation iii introduce new active sites and functional groups iv alter the electron density in the local carbon atom and thus enhance the activity of carbon based materials for example although go could not activate peroxymonosulfate or peroxodisulfate to degrade rocs the sulfachloropyridazine degradation efficiency still reached 65 and 100 within 3 h in the system of reduced graphene oxide rgo and n rgo respectively kang et al 2016 the degradation rate in the system with n rgo was 6 7 times higher than that of rgo and even 2 times higher than that of the popular metal based catalyst of co3o4 similar results were also observed by wang et al during the peroxodisulfate activation process both go and rgo could not activate peroxodisulfate to degrade endocrine disrupting compounds bisphenol a and bisphenol f but more than 97 of degradation efficiencies of bisphenols was obtained within 17 min wang et al 2015 the apparent degradation rate constant of bisphenol a in the system of n rgo even reached about 700 times higher than that of the system with n free rgo according to recent studies the surface modification may also influence the types and concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials and thus affected the catalytic activity of carbon based materials fang et al investigated the influence of hno3 treatment on the h2o2 activation ability of three kinds of activated carbon fang et al 2014b with the increasing treatment time of hno3 the h2o2 decomposition rates decreased obviously but the yields of oh and the degradation rates of diethyl phthalate increased significantly this is because hno3 treatment resulted in the decreas of acidic functional groups and the increase of pfrs concentrations in activated carbon pfrs could transform h2o2 into oh while acidic functional groups can only catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 these studies provided new insights into the environmental implications of carbon based materials but the knowledge on their catalytic activities are still relatively limited according to current researches both surface properties and the types and concentrations of carbon based materials would influence the catalytic activities however the influence mechanisms of these factors are not fully understood moreover there is little study on the relationships between the structures and pfrs amounts in carbon based materials the transformation of pfrs in biochar was not monitored even though some researches indicated that the concentration of pfrs in carbon based materials decreased sharply fang et al 2014a 2014b furthermore particular attention is also needed regarding the application of carbon based materials in activating o2 for oh generation to realize the degradation of rocs not only because of the strong oxidizability of oh but also due to the widespread of carbon based materials and o2 in natural environment 3 2 the catalytic reduction of rocs by ros from carbon based materials as mentioned above the pfrs in carbon based materials are believed to exhibit semiquinone type character which could take up and release electrons through the conjugated π electron systems montes morán et al 2004 the quantitative analysis of biochar to reversibly donate and accept electrons was measured by klu pfel et al with electrochemical method and confirmed that biochar can accept or donate several hundred micromoles of electrons per gram depending on the precursors and the pyrolysis temperature klupfel et al 2014 in fact many previous studies have demonstrated that carbon based materials can also act as a redox catalyst to promote the reduction of heterocyclic nitramines such as hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx kemper et al 2008 oh and chiu 2009 oh et al 2013a xu et al 2010 nitroaromatic compounds such as 2 4 dinitrotoluene and 3 bromonitrobenzene fu and zhu 2013 gong et al 2016 oh et al 2013b xu et al 2015 yu et al 2012 dinitroaniline herbicides such as pendimethalin and trifluralin gong et al 2016 oh et al 2014 chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexachloroethane and 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane chen et al 2014 fu et al 2014 etc by accelerating the transfer of electrons from the reductants such as dithiothreitol or h2s to target contaminants fig 8 for example fu et al reported that in the presence of go the reduction rate constant of nitrobenzene was raised by nearly 2 orders of magnitude fu and zhu 2013 however the electron transfer mechanism from carbon based materials to target contaminants was still controversial some researchers have reported that the electron transfer ability of biochar was responsible for the promotion of rdx reduction rather than the surface functional groups xu et al 2013 2015 but many others studies suggested that the surface functional groups played important roles in the electron transfer processes amezquita garcia et al 2013 gong et al 2014 oh et al even stated that the electron transfer ability surface functional groups and metals including fe cu and mn in biochar were all found to be involved in the enhanced reduction of nitro compounds oh et al 2013a it is needed to clarify the dependence of the electron accepting and donating capacities on the structures and components of carbon based materials in fact rocs can react directly with pfrs even though their reactivity are lower than ros unfortunately relevant reports are relatively limited even though some researchers observed a slow removal of rocs in the presence of carbon based materials without addition of other reductants recently yang et al found that pfrs in biochar particles can directly degrade p nitrophenol adsorbed onto the surface of biochar through the denitration process yang et al 2016 2017a and the p nitrophenol degradation rate was also found to be positively correlated with the pfrs concentration although biochar submerged in water the produced ros only resulted in about 20 of p nitrophenol degradation while 80 of p nitrophenol directly reacted with the nonradical reactive sites of biochar unfortunately due to the lack of literature it is difficult to get a confirmed conclusion on the selectivity and reactivity of pfrs in carbon based materials 4 conclusions and outlook carbon based materials with different types and concentrations of pfrs have already been successfully synthesized and used in degradation of various rocs due to the abundant precursors and environmental friendliness carbon based materials undoubtedly represent one of the most promising candidates to mediate the degradation of rocs in this review the recent progress on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials and the further applications in the degradation of various rocs were summarized in detail compared with the traditional metal catalysts carbon based materials have many advantages such as low cost the wide availability of the necessary feedstock and so on although there are still few concern about the biotoxicity of carbon nanoparticles as well as the release of absorbed organic compounds and heavy metals from carbon based materials despite these shortcomings there still remain many challenges and problem in application in the degradation of various rocs first although many researchers have demonstrated that carbon based materials possess the ability to medicate the transformation of rocs still only very little is known about the specific surface structure which determines the reactivity of carbon based materials hence further in depth studies on the relationships between the structures and activities of carbon based materials are urgently needed second most studies are focused on the formation of ros for the degradation of organic contaminants but the transformation of pfrs in carbon based materials has received only little attention it is the pfrs in carbon based materials which is widespread in environments that would interact with metal ions minerals inorganic and organic compounds and microorganism and thus influence the migration and transformation of different organic and inorganic contaminants in this regard much effort is still needed to investigate the transformation of pfrs within carbon based materials third at present most carbon based materials applied in environment remediation are synthesized in the laboratory little research has been done in the activity of naturally occurring carbon based materials which may be the most promising candidates to mediate degradation of various organic contaminants due to their earth abundance extremely low cost and environmental friendliness meanwhile understanding the transformation mechanism of rocs mediated by natural occurring carbon based materials will be helpful in the applications of carbon based materials in environment remediation acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

19613,with the increased concentrations and kinds of refractory organic contaminants rocs in aquatic environments many previous reviews systematically summarized the applications of carbon based materials in the adsorption and catalytic degradation of rocs for their economically viable and environmentally friendly behavior interestingly recent studies indicated that carbon based materials in natural environment can also mediate the transformation of rocs directly or indirectly due to their abundant persistent free radicals pfrs understanding the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbo based materials and their interactions with rocs is essential to develop their further applications in environment remediation however there is no comprehensive review so far about the direct and indirect removal of rocs mediated by pfrs in amorphous porous and crystalline carbon based materials the review aims to evaluate the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials synthesized through pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization processes the influence of synthesis conditions temperature and time and carbon sources on the types as well as the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials are also discussed in particular the effects of metals on the concentrations and types of pfrs in carbon based materials are highlighted because they are considered as the catalysts for the formation of pfrs the formation mechanisms of reactive species and the further transformation mechanisms of rocs are briefly summarized and the surface properties of carbon based materials including surface area types and number of functional groups etc are found to be the key parameters controlling their activities however due to diversity and complexity of carbon based materials the exact relationships between the activities of carbon based materials and pfrs are still uncertain finally the existing problems and current challenges for the rocs transformation with carbon based materials are also pointed out graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon based materials hydrochar black carbon refractory organic contaminants persistent free radicals pollution control mechanism 1 introduction environmentally persistent free radicals pfrs in airborne fine and ultrafine particulate matter have received considerable attentions during the last two decades assaf et al 2016 because they cause pulmonary disease cardiopulmonary dysfunction and cancer cormier et al 2006 pope et al 2002 xia et al 2004 different from traditional free radicals pfrs are relatively stable their half lives in the atmosphere are on the order of hours and days the adverse health impacts are attributed to oxidative stress induced by environmentally pfrs through the formation of reactive oxygen species ros including superoxide anion radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 etc chung et al 2006 gehling et al 2014 squadrito et al 2001 recent studies indicated that environmentally pfrs could also induce the formation of ros in aqueous solutions khachatryan and dellinger 2011 khachatryan et al 2011 2014 dellinger and coworkers systematically investigated the formation of ros in aqueous solutions with cuo silica particles and confirmed environmentally pfrs in cuo silica particles could induce the formation of o2 h2o2 and oh although failing to trap superoxide radicals in aqueous solutions khachatryan et al 2011 multiple studies have been established that environmentally pfrs were formed in the post flame and cool zone regions of combustion systems as well as other thermal processes gehling and dellinger 2013 vejerano et al 2011 2012 the environmentally pfrs have been ubiquitously detected in the environment such as in aqueous solution soils and sediments in addition to airborne particulate matter dela cruz et al 2014 dela cruz et al 2011 kiruri et al 2013 likewise carbon based materials produced by thermal processes such as biochar and hydrochar also contained numerous pfrs chen et al 2017 mohan et al 2014 xiong et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 these radicals may promote the formation of ros and thus influence the transformation of organic and inorganic contaminants in water fang et al extensively studied the applications of biochar in the water remediation and found that biochar could activate o2 h2o2 and persulfate to produce reactive species such as oh and sulfate radical so4 to degrade organic contaminants fang et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b lian and xing 2017 zhu et al 2017 moreover the abundant redox active moieties on the surface of carbon based materials like quinone hydroquinone and phenolic moieties conjugated π electron systems would provide plentiful redox sites for them because these moieties could act as electron donor and acceptor simultaneously kappler et al 2014 klupfel et al 2014 sanroman et al 2017 yu et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that both biochar and hydrochar can directly mediate the reduction of inorganic metal ions such as fe3 or cr6 dong et al 2011 fang et al 2018 hsu et al 2009 qin et al 2017 biochar can even induce the degradation of organic contaminants p nitrophenol in water yang et al 2016 2017a as well known carbon based materials have extensively been utilized in the elimination of various organic contaminants in soil and water due to their low cost high sorption capacity geological abundance and environmental benignity gao et al 2016 he et al 2014 lian et al 2016 liu et al 2015 mohan et al 2006 sarkar et al 2018 titirici et al 2012 numerous previous studies have been demonstrated that carbon based materials possessing high surface areas and abundant functional groups exhibited promising adsorption capacity han et al 2016 shimabuku et al 2016 suhas et al 2007 tan et al 2016 vikrant et al 2018 for example qiu et al reported that straw biochar was an effective adsorbent for both cationic and anionic dyes qiu et al 2009 pine needles derived biochar could adsorb nonpolar and polar organic contaminants including naphthalene nitrobenzene m dinitrobenzene and trichloroethylene ahmad et al 2013 chen et al 2008 fernandez et al also indicated that orange peels derived hydrochar was effective absorbent for the removal of diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen fernandez et al 2015 however the adsorption alone cannot fully destroy these organic contaminants and the used carbon based materials containing these adsorbed organic contaminants have to be treated as hazardous waste because these organic contaminants may cause serious threat to the health of humans and wildlife and many of them are considered as toxicants endocrine disruptors and carcinogens even at very low concentrations ahmad et al 2013 an et al 2015 watanabe et al 2005 for these reasons considerable attention has been recently paid to investigate the catalytic ability of carbon based materials gao et al 2014 2015 kimura and miyamoto 1994 moreno castilla et al 2010 during the last two decades numerous studies have demonstrated the excellent ability of carbon based materials to activate various oxidants such as h2o2 o3 and persulfate including peroxymonosulfate and peroxodisulfate to form ros for the degradation of refractory organic contaminants rocs georgi and kopinke 2005 santos et al 2009 saputra et al 2013 since activated carbon carbon nanotubes cnts including multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and single walled carbon nanotubes swnts and graphene have been well studied sarkar et al 2018 yang et al 2017b this review would not present these in details carbon based materials synthesized through the pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization of biomass are only emphasized in this review and naturally occurring carbon based materials are discussed the first part focuses on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in the carbon based materials with either hydrothermal or pyrolysis carbon based materials the second part provides a system view of the transformation mechanisms of rocs in water mediating by in situ produced pfrs from carbon based materials the overarching objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on the recent advances in the formation mechanisms and applications of pfrs in carbon materials and a better understanding of the potential roles of carbon based materials in organic contaminants transformation mechanism as well as environmental remediation of rocs in waters 2 the pfrs formation in carbon based materials 2 1 the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials currently numerous carbon based materials with different morphologies and structures including crystalline porous and amorphous carbon have been synthesized with different kinds of techniques and precursors depending on operating conditions precursors undergo different reactions to produce carbon based materials with different properties the formation mechanism of pfrs in different carbon based materials could thus be different from each other although pfrs have been found in cigarette smoke and coals date back to the 1950s ingram et al 1954 lyons et al 1958 the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials are still not fully understood because of the variety of synthesis methods and the high complexity of reaction processes therefore this review will mainly focus on the hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes to illustrate the possible formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials based on the limited documents 2 1 1 the formation mechanism of pfrs during the hydrothermal process hydrothermal process is a thermochemical conversion process performed in hot water under elevated temperature and pressure depending on the reaction conditions the main products of hydrothermal process include solid hydrochar liquid bio oil and gases with different percentage distributions fang et al 2018 yan et al 2009 2010 therefore hydrothermal process could be classified into three main parts according to the final main products fig s1 pavlovic et al 2013 1 hydrothermal carbonization htc performed at the relatively low temperature ranges of 160 260 c under autogenic pressure 2 6 mpa corresponding the reaction temperature in water for hydrochar production liu and balasubramanian 2014 2 hydrothermal liquefaction htl carried out at about 200 370 c with pressures between 4 and 20 mpa for heavy oil production he et al 2014 and 3 hydrothermal gasification htg occurred at a near critical temperatures for hydrogen rich gas production peterson et al 2008 though the main desired products in htl and htg processes are liquid and gaseous fuels instead of hydrochar these processes htl and htg are also frequently utilized to synthesize mwcnts carbon films carbon microspheres and so on gogotsi and yoshimura 1994 hu et al 2010 moreno and yoshimura 2001 zheng et al 2009 as shown in fig s1 htc and htl processes are carried out in subcritical conditions and htg process is performed in supercritical conditions hence htc and htg processes are both taken as examples to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of hydrothermal processes htc process which is proposed to describe the natural coalification process by friedrich bergius in 1913 bach and skreiberg 2016 ennis et al 2012 has been widely applied in the synthesis of hydrochar funke and ziegler 2010 kruse et al 2013 qin et al 2017 as well known htc process is dominated by ionic reactions at high concentration of hydronium ions h3o and hydroxide ions oh generated by water autoionization in subcritical condition fang et al 2018 guo et al 2010 kalinichev and churakov 1999 tekin et al 2014 the h3o and oh catalyze the hydrolysis of high molecular weight organic compounds to form oligomers then to monomers fig s2 kang et al 2013 sevilla and fuertes 2009 wang et al 2016b due to the complexity of biomass components and their properties the hydrolysis degree and products are very different from each other for example the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose occurs at 180 c and 200 c respectively while only a small fraction of lignin could be decomposed during the htc process table s1 some weak linkage bonds such as c c and c x x represents heteroatomic in the biomass and their hydrolysis products will cleave to form reactive monomeric radicals fig 1 hu et al 2014 sabio et al 2016 these radicals can abstract hydrogen to generate aromatic compounds or undergo dehydration and fragmentation reactions to generate other intermediate products and radicals then polymerization condensation or aromatization take place to produce hydrochar as the final products jain et al 2016 kambo and dutta 2015 meanwhile some of the unpaired electrons in the radicals are stabilized by cyclic carbon π system resulting in the formation of pfrs in hydrochar demir cakan et al 2009 on the other hand water is easily dissociated to yield reactive oh and h in supercritical condition due to the decrease of water density akiya and savage 2002 and thus free radical reactions dominate in the htg process firstly h produced by the dissociation of water reacts with oxygen to form peroxy radicals eq 1 resulting in the relatively high concentration of oh which could react with various kind of biomass due to its strong oxidizability ding et al 1996 then radical chain reactions take place by breaking some weak linkage bonds and abstracting hydrogen eqs 2 and 3 finally homolytic hydroxylation eq 4 and condensation eq 5 reactions terminate the radical chain reactions phenol and quinone radicals namely pfrs formed during the reactions are not reactive enough to start a free radical chain reaction but can interact with reactive free radicals to reduce the number of free radicals and inhibit free radical reaction chain moreover the replacement of hydroxyl groups decreases the stability of benzene ring because π electrons become delocalized guo et al 2010 therefore further substitution and attack result in the ring cleavage reactions and the formation of relatively low molecular weight compounds the free radical scavenger is a stable free radical which is not reactive enough to start a free radical chain reaction however it can interact with reactive free radicals thereby reducing the numbers of free radical and inhibiting the overall free radical reaction chain he et al 2014 1 o 2 h ho 2 2 r h h r h 2 3 r o 2 roo 4 r oh roh 5 r r r r although the hydrothermal process has been widely investigated most of previous works have been focused on the formation mechanism of final products rather than the formation mechanism of pfrs the generation process of pfrs in hydrochar is still not fully understood due to the variety of precursors the complexity of underlying reactions and the serious lack of efficient characterization techniques for the in situ detection of pfrs formation process it is therefore of great significance to improve experimental and theoretical methods to investigate the pfrs formation mechanism 2 1 2 the formation mechanism of pfrs during the pyrolysis process pyrolysis is one of main formation processes of black carbon in natural environment which is an important natural constituent keiluweit et al 2010 pignatello et al 2006 and significantly influences the migration and transformation of rocs in natural environment cornelissen et al 2005 black carbon such as activated carbon graphite cnts graphene oxide go soot and biochar produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel biofuel and biomass has been found in oceanic and lacustrine sediments soil organic matter particulate matter in rivers and atmospheric particulates accounting for about 4 of total soil carbon and 9 of organic carbon in aquatic sediments cornelissen et al 2005 koelmans et al 2006 kramer et al 2004 at present carbon based materials produced from pyrolysis process have been recently utilized as catalysts in environment remediation due to their remarkable electron accepting capacities saquing et al 2016 xu et al 2010 although pfrs in carbon based materials produced by pyrolysis have been found more than sixty years ago cormier et al 2006 uebersfeld et al 1954 and play an important role in the catalytic processes they have not received much attention until two decades ago assaf et al 2016 depending upon the reaction temperature time and heating rate pyrolysis process could be divided into slow pyrolysis fast pyrolysis and gasification onay and kockar 2003 in general increasing reaction temperature leads to decrease of product yields nassini et al 2016 onay 2007 with increase of carbon in carbon based materials shen 2015 slow pyrolysis is regarded as a main process for the transformation of biomass to carbon based materials due to the relatively high solid yields 25 35 as compared with other pyrolysis processes liu et al 2015 mohan et al 2006 slow pyrolysis around 300 c is believed to initiate a free radical process by the homolytic cleavage of bonds with further increase of reaction temperature i e above 300 c and below 500 c the decomposition of biomass mainly yields anhydrosugars anhydroglucose which are less reactive than the free radicals produced during bond cleavage le brech et al 2016 during the pyrolysis process the main components of biomass i e cellulose hemicellulose and lignin undergo their own reaction pathways and the destructive pyrolysis temperatures of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin are corresponding to 300 c 300 400 c and 350 450 c respectively di blasi 2009 nzihou et al 2013 the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose initiates by the depolymerization to produce oligosaccharides figs s3 and s4 patwardhan et al 2011 shen and gu 2009 shen et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and is followed by the formation of their own monomers and monomeric radicals for the cleavage of glucosidic bond the decomposition mechanism of lignin involving a series of free radical reactions kibet et al 2012 is more complex than cellulose and hemicellulose due to its more complex structure jakab et al 1997 radicals are also formed in the first step of lignin pyrolysis by the homolytic cleavage of the α and β alkyl aryl ether bonds c c and c o linkage which have lower bond dissociation energies to form the corresponding radical fig 2 kotake et al 2014 these radical species can further generate the radical coupling products or abstract hydrogens from other molecules finally a series of reactions such as dehydration decarboxylation aromatization and intramolecular condensation are performed sequentially to form so called biochar collard and blin 2014 during the pyrolysis process at high temperature abundant phenol or quinone moieties are also produced from the phenolic lignin in biomass and then could further transfer the electron to transition metals to form surface bound pfrs in biochar fig 3 fang et al 2014a according to these works the break of chemical bonds in precursors is likely the prime reason for the generation of pfrs in biochar and hydrochar but the formation processes of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by other methods such as chemical vapor deposition laser ablation and arc discharge method have been reported moreover early studies have demonstrated that the pfrs in carbon based materials could be classified into three types according to the different central atom of pfrs carbon centered pfrs without connected with other heteroatoms carbon centered pfrs connected with an adjacent oxygen atom and oxygen centered pfrs parshetti et al 2013 qin et al 2017 however the formation mechanisms of these different types of pfrs in carbon based materials are still not attempted in this regard much efforts are needed to systemically investigate the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by different technologies 2 2 the effects of different influence factors on pfrs formation in carbon based materials due to the variety of precursors and synthesis conditions the factors affecting the concentrations and types of pfrs are extremely complex and have not been clearly elucidated however the relevant studies are very limited at this moment and most are focused on the optimization of different factors affecting the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar thus the detail advances on the influence of synthesis parameters and metal precursors selection on the formation concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar are summarized in this section based on the limited available publications 2 2 1 the analysis of pfrs in carbon materials previous studies have been demonstrated that the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar were easy to detect due to their excellent resonance stabilities there was a positive correlation between the esr signal intensity and the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials moreover the spectral splitting factor of esr spectra g factors can be used to identify the types of carbon materials for carbon centered pfrs without connected to other heteroatoms these g factors were less than 2 0030 g factors of carbon centered pfrs connected with an adjacent oxygen atom were in the range of 2 0030 2 0040 while oxygen centered pfrs have g factors larger than 2 0040 hales and case 1981 2 2 2 the influence of synthesized parameters on pfrs formation as mentioned above the cleavage of chemical bonds in precursors may be one of the critical step of pfrs formation process therefore pyrolysis temperature and time which determine the break of chemical bonds will significantly affect the types and concentration of pfrs in biochar dela cruz et al 2012 fang et al 2015a vejerano et al 2011 typically the g factors decreased clearly along with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and time table s1 fig 4 c and d fang et al 2014a 2015a liao et al 2014 suggesting that the initially generated oxygen centered pfrs were then mixed with carbon centered free radicals however a sudden increase in the g factor was observed by liao et al during the cooling process 120 150 min in concert with the increase of esr signal intensity liao et al 2014 this is because the shrink of macromolecule structures at different directions and the breakdown of chemical bonds during the cooling process can result in the generation of additional free radicals sakaguchi et al 2010 for example the cleavage of c o bonds or oxygen incorporation into broken c c bonds may lead to the formation of oxygen centered pfrs thus resulting resulted in the sharp increase of pfrs concentrations maskos et al 2005 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 300 c to 600 c the concentrations of pfrs in biochar increased rapidly fang et al 2015a liao et al 2014 yang et al 2016 but then decreased markedly when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 c figs 4 and 5 and table s1 fang et al 2014a 2015a yang et al 2016 this may be attributed to the breakdown and reorganization of organic structures which results in the disappearing of free radicals unfortunately the limited numbers of publications could not provide more detailed information about the influences of pyrolysis temperature on the concentrations of pfrs in biochar fang et al 2014a 2015a yang et al 2016 the pyrolysis time is another complex parameter to influence the concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials a recent study by liao et al indicated that the generation of free radicals in biochars contained several stages fig 4a and b liao et al 2014 in the initial stage the cleavage of some weak linkage bonds resulted in the formation of pfrs in biochar then the outer surface free radicals would rapidly react and dissipate resulting in the decrease of pfrs concentration subsequently the pfrs concentration further change with the increase of pyrolysis time plenty of free radicals may accumulate on the limited surface area of biochar leading to the apparent decrease of esr signals in addition the shrinkage of macromolecule structures at different directions and the cleavage of chemical bonds during the cooling process of biochars can also result in the dominant formation of additional free radicals sakaguchi et al 2010 however the different stages of biochar produced by numerous precursors may require different times under different pyrolysis temperature therefore the pfrs concentration in different kinds of biochar present different trends with the increase of pyrolysis time for example fang et al synthesized biochar with needles at 300 c 400 c 500 c and 600 c denoted as p300 p400 p500 and p600 respectively and found that the pfrs concentrations in p300 and p400 increased significantly with the pyrolysis time prolonged from 1 to 12 h while decreased dramatically in p500 and p600 table s1 fang et al 2015a in fact the pfrs concentrations in latter two carbon based materials were even below the detection limit during the pyrolysis time at 2 or 12 h respectively due to the complex synthesis conditions and structures of biochar it is still difficult to completely clarify the dependence of the pfrs concentrations on the pyrolysis temperature and time 2 2 3 the influence of precursors on pfrs in carbon based materials according to present research on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials organic compounds in precursors experience different reactions and then produce different free radical intermediates in the same pyrolysis condition so precursors are also important factors affecting the pfrs formation in carbon based materials although some researchers have reported that biochar produced by different precursors at the same conditions exhibited the same type of pfrs with different g factors and concentrations fig 4 and table s1 fang et al 2014a liao et al 2014 it was still difficult to thoroughly elucidate the influence mechanism of precursors on the types and concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials liao et al compared the types and concentrations of biochar synthesized with lignin and cellulose at 200 c liao et al 2014 and found that the pfrs concentration in biochar produced from lignin were 5 times higher than that of cellulose fig 4 even though lignin is more stable than cellulose fang et al reported that loading organic compounds also affected the concentrations of pfrs in biochar fang et al 2015a as shown in fig 6 a and b the pfr concentration rapidly increased when the hydroquinone phenol or catechol concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mmol l 1 but decreased with further increase of the concentration of organic compounds from 5 0 to 50 mmol l 1 meanwhile the g factors of pfrs in biochar increased from 2 0042 to 2 0052 2 0048 and 2 0048 when 1 0 mmol l 1 ct ph or hq was loaded suggesting that the type of pfrs in biochar were still oxygen centered pfrs although the type of pfrs in biochar kept unchanged loading organic compounds of the biomass may also be an alternative to change types of pfrs in biochar because of their significant influence on the g factors of pfrs in fact many studies indicated that the addition of acid and base also can act as catalysts to accelerate the hydrothermal conversion of biomass to hydrochar jain et al 2016 jin and enomoto 2011 small amounts of acids and base could catalyze the dehydration of biomass unfortunately the concentrations and types changes of pfrs in hydrochar have not yet been attempted now further research is needed to investigate the roles of acids and base catalysts on the formation of pfrs in carbon based materials synthesized with different methods 2 2 4 the influence of external metals on the pfrs in carbon based materials it has been also reported that the phenol or quinone moieties formed during the pyrolysis processes of biomass can transfer electron to transition metals to produce surface bound pfrs in biochar fang et al 2014a therefore it is of great importance to investigate the influences of metals in precursors on the pfrs in biochar however the kinds and concentrations of transition metals in precursors are still difficult to identify fang et al investigated the effect of loaded transition metal ions i e fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 on pine needles to elucidate their effects on the formation pfrs in biochar fang et al 2015a they found that the pfr concentration increased sharply when 0 1 mmol l 1 of transition metal ions was loaded but decreased rapidly with further increase of the concentration from 0 1 to 2 mmol l 1 fig 6c and d this is because of the double effect of transition metal ions on the formation of pfrs during the pyrolysis processes at relatively low concentration transition metal ions can accept electrons from phenol or quinone moieties and favor the formation of pfrs in biochar on the other hand excess amount of transition metal ions can also consume pfrs because pfrs can mediate electron transfer process to accelerate the reduction of transition metals such as fe3 and cr6 hsu et al 2009 xu et al 2014 then resulting in the consumption of pfrs with the loading of fe3 ni2 cu2 or zn2 at a concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 the g factors of pfrs in biochar decreased from 2 0042 to 2 0032 2 0039 2 0036 and 2 0040 indicating that the types of pfrs in biochar converted form oxygen centered pfrs to carbon centered pfrs with an adjacent oxygen atom this study indicated that metals can significantly influence the concentrations and types of pfrs in biochar but the affecting mechanisms are still not so clear the influence of metals on the concentrations and types of pfrs in hydrothermal processes to form hydrochar has not been reported but one work confirmed that metals can promote the dehydration condensation and carbonization step of biomass during the htc process cui et al 2006 moreover heavy metals in biochar significantly influence its qualities eg the heavy metals in biochar may release to environment and cause environmental pollution when they are used as fertilizers to provide nutrients for plants liu et al 2017 major et al 2010 many studies also confirmed that biochar made from biomass with trace heavy metals may cause significant environmental risks because they can increase the leaching of metals reduce the bioavailability or mobility of metals decrease the microbial activity and affect the microbial community dynamics beauchemin et al 2015 jones and quilliam 2014 therefore more detailed work should be established to evaluate the role of metals in the formation of pfrs in carbon based materials in summary previous studies suggested that the types and concentrations of pfrs in biochar are influenced by many factors including synthesis conditions precursors and so on however the underling mechanisms of these factors are still not fully understood moreover the influence factors of pfrs in carbon based materials produced by other methods have not been reported therefore more research is needed to better understand the role of various studies on the pfrs formation in carbon based materials 3 the transformation mechanism of rocs mediated by pfrs in carbon based materials with the rapid growth of population and economy numerous kinds of rocs are continuously released to natural aquatic environment from their manufacture and application processes and result in adverse effects on the public health as well as the aquatic ecosystems even at trace level carbon based materials with abundant surface functional groups and high specific surface area have been frequently utilized as adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants in water for a long time upadhyayula et al 2009 the adsorption mechanisms of inorganic and organic contaminants onto various kinds of carbon based materials including hydrogen bond π π interactions electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction ahmad et al 2014 upadhyay et al 2014 have been well studied and already been summarized by many previous studies dabrowski et al 2005 inyang and dickenson 2015 mohan et al 2014 thus in this section the degradation mechanisms of rocs by ros generated from carbon based materials as well as the pfrs in carbon based materials are reviewed in details hereafter furthermore due to the high complexity of structure and components the factor affecting the activity of carbon based materials are also discussed 3 1 the catalytic oxidation of rocs by reactive free radicals from carbon based materials as well known carbon based materials such as c3n4 gu et al 2014 mamba and mishra 2016 zheng et al 2016 c60 arbogast et al 1991 lee et al 2008 2009 yamakoshi et al 2003 and c70 arbogast and foote 1991 moor et al 2015 have been highly regarded as effective heterogeneous photocatalysts for pollution abatement as they are more environmental friendly and avoid metal leaching problems compared with metal based catalysts li et al 2015 2016 shi et al 2013 2014 wang et al 2017 since the photocatalytic mechanisms have been well studied and already been summarized in many studies this review would not present these in details however little knowledge has been reported on the photocatalytic properties of biochar and hydrochar chen et al 2017 fang et al 2017 which widely exist in natural environment a recent study by chen at al systematically compared the sulfadimidine removal performances of biochar with hydrochar in the dark as well as under solar light irradiation chen et al 2017 the authors suggested that the formation of ros in the dark was dependent on the pfrs while the oxygenated functional groups were responsible for the ros generation under daylight irradiation the pfrs concentration in biochar was much higher than that of hydrochar because hydrochar contained more oxygenated functional groups therefore the sulfadimidine removal efficiency of biochar was obviously higher than that of hydrochar in the dark but the yields of h2o2 and oh as well as the sulfadimidine degradation efficiency of biochar were significantly lower than that of hydrochar under daylight irradiation carbon based materials also exhibited excellent catalytic ability to activate oxidants including o3 beltrán et al 2005 gonçalves et al 2012 2013 kasprzyk hordern 2003 h2o2 huang et al 2003a b ribeiro et al 2013 and persulfate duan et al 2015a liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 through the direct electron transfer process to produce ros such as oh and so4 for the degradation of rocs fig 7 figs s5 and s6 for example huang et al prepared six kinds of biochar under different temperatures and evaluated their activation ability toward h2o2 for the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine huang et al 2016 the results indicated that all biochar exhibited excellent ability for the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for sulfamethazine degradation with the increase pyrolysis temperature from 300 c to 800 c the degradation efficiency increased from 93 4 to 100 and the degradation rate constant increased from 0 0211 to 0 427 min 1 sun et al performed a series studies on the persulfate activation with numerous kinds of carbon based materials including activated carbon saputra et al 2013 mesoporous carbon tian et al 2016 hydrochar wang et al 2016c graphene duan et al 2016d indrawirawan et al 2015a kang et al 2016 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016a cnts duan et al 2015b 2015c 2015d 2016b sun et al 2014 and nanodiamonds duan et al 2016a 2016c indrawirawan et al 2015b and demonstrated that these carbon based materials can play promising roles in the catalytic degradation processes of rocs even though the catalytic decomposition of oxidants by carbon based materials for the degradation of rocs have been investigated and reviewed by few researchers the activation mechanisms are still controversial at present one of the commonly accepted oxidant activation mechanisms by carbon based materials was similar to the fenton reaction and haber weiss mechanism kimura and miyamoto 1994 take the h2o2 activation by activated carbon as an example the delocalized π electrons on graphene layers transferred via electron donors acceptors onto activated carbon surface to h2o2 then to produce oh as following eqs 6 and 7 kimura and miyamoto 1994 moreno castilla et al 2010 6 activated carbon h 2 o 2 activated carbon oh oh 7 activated carbon h 2 o 2 activated carbon h 2 o h however there was no direct evidence to prove the formation of activated carbon even though the generation of ros can be demonstrated by esr moreover two different reaction mechanisms including radical and nonradical reactions have been proposed to explain the persulfate activation process with carbon based materials fig 7 oh et al 2016 but the exact activation mechanisms are still unclear due to the lack of direct evidence to clarify the reaction processes although esr has proved the generation of oh so4 and other kinds of reactive species moreover recent studies by fang et al has been demonstrated that pfrs in carbon based materials play key roles in affecting their catalytic activity fang et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b which have not been involved in most of previous studies they suggested that carbon based materials such as activated carbon and several kinds of biochar could effectively activate oxidants including o2 h2o2 or persulfate via a single electron transfer process from pfrs on carbon based materials to oxidants to produce ros for the degradation of rocs figs s5 and s6 the yields of ros were positively linearly correlated with the pfrs concentrations in biochar and increased with the increase of pfrs concentrations indicating that pfrs were the main contributor to ros formation they also indicated that the oxygen centered pfrs are more reactive than carbon centered pfrs with adjacent oxygen toward persulfate for the generation of so4 fang et al 2015a after the activation processes the pfrs concentration in carbon based materials decreased significantly and thus inhibited the activity of carbon based materials to improve the catalytic activity of carbon based materials surface modification including physical and chemical activation duan et al 2016d liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 and heteroatom doping duan et al 2015a indrawirawan et al 2015a kang et al 2016 li et al 2017 liang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2016a were also utilized because they can i increase the specific area and surface functional of carbon based materials ii improve π electron mobility through the conjugation iii introduce new active sites and functional groups iv alter the electron density in the local carbon atom and thus enhance the activity of carbon based materials for example although go could not activate peroxymonosulfate or peroxodisulfate to degrade rocs the sulfachloropyridazine degradation efficiency still reached 65 and 100 within 3 h in the system of reduced graphene oxide rgo and n rgo respectively kang et al 2016 the degradation rate in the system with n rgo was 6 7 times higher than that of rgo and even 2 times higher than that of the popular metal based catalyst of co3o4 similar results were also observed by wang et al during the peroxodisulfate activation process both go and rgo could not activate peroxodisulfate to degrade endocrine disrupting compounds bisphenol a and bisphenol f but more than 97 of degradation efficiencies of bisphenols was obtained within 17 min wang et al 2015 the apparent degradation rate constant of bisphenol a in the system of n rgo even reached about 700 times higher than that of the system with n free rgo according to recent studies the surface modification may also influence the types and concentrations of pfrs in carbon based materials and thus affected the catalytic activity of carbon based materials fang et al investigated the influence of hno3 treatment on the h2o2 activation ability of three kinds of activated carbon fang et al 2014b with the increasing treatment time of hno3 the h2o2 decomposition rates decreased obviously but the yields of oh and the degradation rates of diethyl phthalate increased significantly this is because hno3 treatment resulted in the decreas of acidic functional groups and the increase of pfrs concentrations in activated carbon pfrs could transform h2o2 into oh while acidic functional groups can only catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 these studies provided new insights into the environmental implications of carbon based materials but the knowledge on their catalytic activities are still relatively limited according to current researches both surface properties and the types and concentrations of carbon based materials would influence the catalytic activities however the influence mechanisms of these factors are not fully understood moreover there is little study on the relationships between the structures and pfrs amounts in carbon based materials the transformation of pfrs in biochar was not monitored even though some researches indicated that the concentration of pfrs in carbon based materials decreased sharply fang et al 2014a 2014b furthermore particular attention is also needed regarding the application of carbon based materials in activating o2 for oh generation to realize the degradation of rocs not only because of the strong oxidizability of oh but also due to the widespread of carbon based materials and o2 in natural environment 3 2 the catalytic reduction of rocs by ros from carbon based materials as mentioned above the pfrs in carbon based materials are believed to exhibit semiquinone type character which could take up and release electrons through the conjugated π electron systems montes morán et al 2004 the quantitative analysis of biochar to reversibly donate and accept electrons was measured by klu pfel et al with electrochemical method and confirmed that biochar can accept or donate several hundred micromoles of electrons per gram depending on the precursors and the pyrolysis temperature klupfel et al 2014 in fact many previous studies have demonstrated that carbon based materials can also act as a redox catalyst to promote the reduction of heterocyclic nitramines such as hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx kemper et al 2008 oh and chiu 2009 oh et al 2013a xu et al 2010 nitroaromatic compounds such as 2 4 dinitrotoluene and 3 bromonitrobenzene fu and zhu 2013 gong et al 2016 oh et al 2013b xu et al 2015 yu et al 2012 dinitroaniline herbicides such as pendimethalin and trifluralin gong et al 2016 oh et al 2014 chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexachloroethane and 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane chen et al 2014 fu et al 2014 etc by accelerating the transfer of electrons from the reductants such as dithiothreitol or h2s to target contaminants fig 8 for example fu et al reported that in the presence of go the reduction rate constant of nitrobenzene was raised by nearly 2 orders of magnitude fu and zhu 2013 however the electron transfer mechanism from carbon based materials to target contaminants was still controversial some researchers have reported that the electron transfer ability of biochar was responsible for the promotion of rdx reduction rather than the surface functional groups xu et al 2013 2015 but many others studies suggested that the surface functional groups played important roles in the electron transfer processes amezquita garcia et al 2013 gong et al 2014 oh et al even stated that the electron transfer ability surface functional groups and metals including fe cu and mn in biochar were all found to be involved in the enhanced reduction of nitro compounds oh et al 2013a it is needed to clarify the dependence of the electron accepting and donating capacities on the structures and components of carbon based materials in fact rocs can react directly with pfrs even though their reactivity are lower than ros unfortunately relevant reports are relatively limited even though some researchers observed a slow removal of rocs in the presence of carbon based materials without addition of other reductants recently yang et al found that pfrs in biochar particles can directly degrade p nitrophenol adsorbed onto the surface of biochar through the denitration process yang et al 2016 2017a and the p nitrophenol degradation rate was also found to be positively correlated with the pfrs concentration although biochar submerged in water the produced ros only resulted in about 20 of p nitrophenol degradation while 80 of p nitrophenol directly reacted with the nonradical reactive sites of biochar unfortunately due to the lack of literature it is difficult to get a confirmed conclusion on the selectivity and reactivity of pfrs in carbon based materials 4 conclusions and outlook carbon based materials with different types and concentrations of pfrs have already been successfully synthesized and used in degradation of various rocs due to the abundant precursors and environmental friendliness carbon based materials undoubtedly represent one of the most promising candidates to mediate the degradation of rocs in this review the recent progress on the formation mechanisms of pfrs in carbon based materials and the further applications in the degradation of various rocs were summarized in detail compared with the traditional metal catalysts carbon based materials have many advantages such as low cost the wide availability of the necessary feedstock and so on although there are still few concern about the biotoxicity of carbon nanoparticles as well as the release of absorbed organic compounds and heavy metals from carbon based materials despite these shortcomings there still remain many challenges and problem in application in the degradation of various rocs first although many researchers have demonstrated that carbon based materials possess the ability to medicate the transformation of rocs still only very little is known about the specific surface structure which determines the reactivity of carbon based materials hence further in depth studies on the relationships between the structures and activities of carbon based materials are urgently needed second most studies are focused on the formation of ros for the degradation of organic contaminants but the transformation of pfrs in carbon based materials has received only little attention it is the pfrs in carbon based materials which is widespread in environments that would interact with metal ions minerals inorganic and organic compounds and microorganism and thus influence the migration and transformation of different organic and inorganic contaminants in this regard much effort is still needed to investigate the transformation of pfrs within carbon based materials third at present most carbon based materials applied in environment remediation are synthesized in the laboratory little research has been done in the activity of naturally occurring carbon based materials which may be the most promising candidates to mediate degradation of various organic contaminants due to their earth abundance extremely low cost and environmental friendliness meanwhile understanding the transformation mechanism of rocs mediated by natural occurring carbon based materials will be helpful in the applications of carbon based materials in environment remediation acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

19614,the continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment consequently microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment the presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities the sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants the abundance of microplastics varies with the location from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion the microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters those toxins may cause great health problems to humans a few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles in studies of microplastics fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330 μm for collection of microplastics after the volume reducing process the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes the sequence of these two processes namely purification and digestion is dependent on the sample type the purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods the commonly used methods for the qualification studies are ftir spectroscopy raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gc ms and liquid chromatography a tagging method can be used in the quantification study our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters more work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk keywords analytical methods freshwaters microplastics occurrence 1 introduction plastic products have such outstanding features as light weight being durable and versatile and production with low cost hammer et al 2012 ivleva et al 2017 however plastic debris has raised global concerns over its wide distribution and associated environmental consequences the annual global production of plastic product in 2016 alone was around 322 million tonnes europe 2016 an estimation of up to 10 of plastic fragments would end up in marine environment as per suggested by cole et al 2011 due to extensive usage and increasing production in plastic product and poor management rochman 2015 while diminishing aesthetic value of water environment plastic debris is likely to pose threats to public health and cause biodiversity loss thompson et al 2009 gall and thompson 2015 microplastics are widely defined as synthetic polymers with an upper size limit of 5 mm and without specified lower limit thompson et al 2009 they can be categorized into primary microplastics and secondary microplastics the definition of primary microplastics is the microplastics which are originally manufactured to have a size less than 5 mm and mainly found in textiles medicines and such personal care products as facial and body scrubs cole et al 2011 browne 2015 these primary microplastics can be transported by rivers discharge from water treatment plants wind and surface run off into either fresh water and seawater environments gall and thompson 2015 secondary microplastics are derived from fragmentation or large plastic debris due to such processes as photo degradation physical chemical and biological interactions thompson et al 2009 galgani et al 2013 the origins of secondary microplastics include fishing nets industrial resin pellets household items and other discarded plastic debris eerkes medrano et al 2015 notably it was found that the majority of microplastics are secondary microplastics eriksen et al 2013 and that the abundance in waters would increase along with the increase in input of plastic debris from different origins leading to continuous transformation of secondary microplastics cole et al 2011 when microplastics are exposed in the environment there is a higher possibility of break down of microplastics to nanoplastics that may have higher environmental risks due to the nature of nano sizes microplastics can originate from both land and ocean based sources hammer et al 2012 the ocean based sources due to commercial fishing vessels and other activities in marine environment only contribute 20 of total plastic debris in marine environment andrady 2011 the microplastics from terrestrial sources contribute the remaining 80 terrestrial sources include different origins that mainly are personal care products air blasting process improperly disposed plastics and leachates from landfill cole et al 2011 once terrestrial microplastics are released into the natural water systems most of them would be transported to oceans by rivers while the remaining would reside in fresh water environment including such isolated water systems as remote mountain lakes browne et al 2010 free et al 2014 microplastics are of great public concerns for the ubiquitous presence and persistence in the aquatic environment the global presence of microplastics has been found in recent years from horizontal perspective microplastics were reportedly found in tropical areas ng and obbard 2006 nor and obbard 2014 they were even seen in the polar waters of antarctica and arctic barnes et al 2010 bergmann et al 2015 when one looks at vertical distribution microplastics exist in benthic zone of water bodies water columns surface waters and beaches some reports have shown the concentrations in surface water vary from 10 5 to 105 pieces m3 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 desforges et al 2014 frias et al 2014 lima et al 2014 auta et al 2017 and 40 to 400 pieces l in sediments zurcher 2009 browne et al 2011 antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2014 nor and obbard 2014 most recently china central television website cctv com reported a group of chinese scientists have discovered the presence of microplastics in antarctic waters china org cn 2018 furthermore the distribution shows clear geographical variations fossi et al 2012 collignon et al 2014 de lucia et al 2014 desforges et al 2014 the factors affecting the distribution include such large scale forces as currents driven by wind and geostrophic circulation law et al 2010 turbulence and oceanographic effects ballent et al 2012 turra et al 2014 as key factors the inherent properties of microplastics such as density shape and size of microplastics can affect transportation and distribution patterns eerkes medrano et al 2015 the aforementioned factors are more likely to play important roles in a large freshwater environment like riverine systems however they become limited on smaller isolated fresh water systems where natural factors and long water residence time dominantly affect quantity of microplastics free et al 2014 hence microplastics in open and dynamic fresh waters would eventually end up in marine environment while microplastics in isolated and static waters bodies would remain and accumulate in the waters fresh waters may accumulate numerous microplastic particles and fibers however less efforts have been made to monitor the microplastics in fresh waters than those in seawaters such fresh waters can be the sources like waste water plants transferring media like rivers and sink like isolated lakes of microplastics which may differ from those in seawaters because large variations in quantity can be expected klein et al 2018 meanwhile the properties of microplastics can be quite heterogeneous for instance microplastics in sewage are heavily contaminated by organic contents and exist as relatively large pieces on the other hand in clean fresh waters are nearly free of organic contents and hardly seen by naked eyes orb 2017 in addition some lakes or rivers with fresh water are close to the areas with high population where higher microplastics abundance was detected eriksen et al 2013 another significant characteristic of microplastics studies in freshwater systems is that the sample sizes are small however large sampling areas are necessary to adequately reduce the large variations due to spatial and temporal changes ryan et al 2009 as a result we found that there was an urgent need to review the current research work and methodologies on microplastics in fresh waters in order that appropriate sampling quantification and identification approaches can be developed for the study in freshwater samples the objective of this review paper is to reveal the current knowledge about microplastics in fresh waters for a better understanding of microplastics contamination and potential risks summaries of sampling methods and comparisons of different quantification and identification approaches are presented several key challenges are discussed and suggestions are provided for further research work 2 microplastics in freshwater systems 2 1 occurrence most of efforts on the research of microplastics have been placed on seawater environment less than 4 of microplastics related studies are reportedly associated with freshwaters lambert and wagner 2018 the limited information however revealed that the abundance of microplastics in freshwaters is comparable to that of marine environment peng et al 2017 and the distribution is highly heterogeneous klein et al 2018 table 1 summarizes some of the relevant studies on the microplastics abundance in freshwater matrices the mean averaged values of microplastics abundance in fresh water systems varied greatly from almost none to several million pieces per cubic meter this significant difference results from such key factors as sampling locations human activities inherent natural conditions and sampling approaches eerkes medrano et al 2015 many terrestrial sources contribute the microplastics among them wastewater treatment is one of the dominant sources of microplastics magnusson and norén 2014 talvitie 2014 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 murphy et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 mintenig et al 2017 table 2 lists the key results from the microplastics studies on several wastewater treatment plants wwtps though wwtps can remove up to 95 of microplastics talvitie 2014 talvitie et al 2017 and tertiary treatment can have a 90 removal efficiency of fine particles of size larger than 10 μm wardrop et al 2016 there is substantial amount of microplastics being discharged into natural waters via wwtps rochman et al 2015 used the published data by magnusson and norén 2014 and martin and eizhvertina 2014 to estimate the amount of microbeads discharged into the waterways in the usa they came to a conservative conclusion that 8 billion microbeads pieces released from the municipal wwtps per day mason et al 2016 studied the effluent samples of 17 wwtps and predicted that the average discharge of microbeads from us municipal wwtps was 13 billion pieces per day similar to that from rochman et al 2015 given the fact that high volume of treated and untreated wastewater is released globally and only 60 of municipal wastewater is treated mateo sagasta et al 2015 a huge amount of microplastics would enter the environment via the discharges from wwtps in addition other sources such as surface run off atmospheric fallout dris et al 2016 and direct waste disposal contribute the increase in the microplastics flow into aqueous environment in september 2017 orb media a nonprofit journalism organization published a report that claims the presence of microplastics in drinking water this cross border research tested 159 drinking water samples from five continents found out that 83 of them were contaminated with tiny plastic debris orb 2017 since microplastics can directly enter human bodies it may be a long term exposure if people drink microplastics containing water these findings would trigger public concerns over the safety of drinking water and food 2 2 environmental impacts the concerns over microplastics are about the potential harms that can impose on organisms and humans the environmental impacts can be catalogued to physical chemical and biological impacts as described below the findings on the impacts are mainly based on marine environment but can be used for fresh water environment physical impacts mainly include entanglement and ingestion based on the work on the microplastics in sweater the study conducted by laist 1997 has shown over 200 marine species suffered from the entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris though to what extent of physical effects would affect organisms remain uncertain entanglement effect that is often associated with comparatively large animals is visible when we compare it with ingestion entanglement could cause severe impacts on aquatic species they can even be fatal by the means of drowning suffocating strangulating or starving allsopp et al 2006 the vulnerable species include sea turtles mammals seabirds and crustaceans gilardi et al 2010 when these animals drown in ghost nets they may suffer suffocation and starvation when their predators appear they are bound to die derraik 2002 however there is no report on entanglement incidence in freshwater bodies nevertheless the occurrence of entanglement in marine organisms has provided a clear indication to the situation in freshwater environment ingestion does not directly impose fatal effects on organisms even though it has well been observed the chronic effects however become a key issue wright et al 2013a ryan 1987 conducted a survey on the potential effects of plastic ingestion on domestic chicks in order to simulate the biological behavior of ingested plastics on seabirds it was found that there was a positive relationship between reduced food consumption and feed of plastics a research team suggested that a negative correlation between the fitness of seabirds and the ingested plastic debris spear et al 1995 the negative correlation was also observed on the fish lusher et al 2014 the pathways of microplastics entering the tract include direct and indirect ingestion fish mainly ingests microplastics via predation activities the accumulation effects can be observed in higher trophic levels such as seabirds seals and sea lions mcmahon et al 1999 eriksson and burton 2003 romeo et al 2015 the concentration factor of microplastics from surrounding waters to seals was reported to be as high as 160 times eriksson and burton 2003 wright et al 2013b eerkes medrano et al 2015 it was found that entanglement happened more frequently than ingestion 55 of marine organisms incidences are associated with entanglement ingestion contributes to 31 of incidences gall and thompson 2015 other solid matters contribute the rest 14 entanglement of microplastics mainly happens to comparatively large marine organism on the other hand ingestion of microplastics can be found throughout almost all the trophic levels such as zooplankton taxa cole et al 2013 marine lugworm wright et al 2013a mussel von moos et al 2012 oyster sussarellu et al 2016 fish rochman et al 2013 sea turtles bugoni et al 2001 dolphins denuncio et al 2011 whales walker and coe 1989 and seabirds derraik 2002 the chemical and biological impacts play key roles after ingestion microplastics cause toxicity effects to humans and living organisms through several pathways and mechanisms the polymeric compounds used in production of plastics the additives such as coper ions used during production of plastics are toxic more importantly various toxins in waters that are initially sorbed onto microplastics may subsequently be desorbed inside of human and animal bodies microplastics are made of polymeric compounds that can cause certain health effects for example polystyrene ps resistant to biodegradation can accumulate in the stomach of fish carpenter et al 1972 and can translocate through blood circulation chen et al 2006 for oysters after being experienced a two month exposure to ps microplastics the decreases in oocyte number diameter and sperm velocity were reported reproductive disruption for marine filter feeders was expected sussarellu et al 2016 a variety of additives are added during plastics production to improve physical properties such as color flame resistance and hardness they can be low molecular or polymeric inorganic or organic substances the most common additive is plasticizer that is for improvement of plasticity or viscosity for example polyvinyl chloride pvc must have plasticizers like phthalates and bisphenol a in order that thermal and photo degradation can be minimized hammer et al 2012 other additives include colorants and flame retardants it is anticipated that these chemicals would accumulate in human bodies through bioaccumulation process some of which are well known as endocrine disrupting compounds some studies confirmed that such additives as bisphenol a polybrominated diphenyl ethers tetrabromobisphenol a and phthalates are present in humans talsness et al 2009 in addition some compounds with heavy metals such as chromium cadmium and lead are often used in production of colorants stabilizers and plasticizers ernst et al 2000 murphy 2001 they can be released from plastic debris into water systems and further enter the food chain to cause bioaccumulation of toxins in organisms microplastics can be a vector for water borne hydrophobic pollutants teuten et al 2009 lee et al 2014 bakir et al 2016 o connor et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 examples include polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs velzeboer et al 2014 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt rios et al 2010 which are well known for their high toxicity and persistence in the environment due to the large specific surface areas and intrinsic hydrophobicity the potential of hydrophobic chemical adsorption onto the surface of microplastics has caused great concerns over microplastics horton et al 2017 pcbs are well known to be carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic hammer et al 2012 ddt can lead to adverse neurological effects and immunodeficiency mansouri et al 2017 the partition studies show the large partitioning coefficients for organic compounds in the range of 104 106 andrady 2011 a few studies suggested that microplastics could sorb high amounts of pcbs form the surrounding seawater in coastal areas of usa and japan hammer et al 2012 microplastics can sorb lubrication oils and heavy metals angiolillo et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the aforementioned pollutants initially sorbed on the surface of microplastics can be released when microplastics are ingested and stay inside of human body where ph is rather low temperature is comparatively high and digestive liquids are present a few studies confirmed that the desorption rate of sorbed contaminants in organisms was accelerated substantially faster than that in seawater teuten et al 2007 bakir et al 2014 however very limited information is available about the real sorption behavior for water borne pollutants in fresh water on the microplastics the toxicity of microplastics in fresh waters is not well understood a few lab scale studies have provided some implications on the potential biological hazards from microplastics a research conducted by ma et al 2016 selected daphnia magna as a model fresh water organism to study the toxicity of microplastics together with sorbed phenanthrene they concluded that nano sized ps exhibit high toxicity and physical damage to daphnia magna and toxicity was enhanced by sorbed phenanthrene a recent study demonstrated that the mixture of antimicrobial florfenicol and microplastics caused higher inhibition level of cholinesterase activity on freshwater bivalve corbicula fluninea than that of florfenicol or microplastics guilhermino et al 2018 it was found that microplastics caused certain levels of biological effects on corbicula flumineaand and their predator acipenser transmontanus rochman et al 2017 a few studies on larval and adult zebrafish showed that microplastics were first ingested became accumulated and consequently caused alternations in locomotion intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles lu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 sleight et al 2017 lei et al 2018 with regards to other fresh water organisms the toxicity studies on marine organisms may provide suggestive information hence it is of importance to investigate the interaction between microplastics and key compounds in lab scale experiments which will be helpful in the risk assessment of microplastics the biological effects include the potential to geographically transfer microorganisms oberbeckmann et al 2015 microorganisms can quickly colonize the surface of microplastics and be transported with the movement of microplastics as plastics are usually durable and persistent than other media thiel and gutow 2005 while this interaction is commonly known and possible consequences are raised such as the introduction of pathogens to a clean environment limited literatures are available to reveal the diverse biofilms communities and even less for freshwater environment mccormick et al 2014 conducted high throughput sequencing analysis on the microplastics collected in an urban river in chicago illinois they found out some attached taxa were plastic decomposing organisms and pathogens the findings suggest that microplastics can transport bacterial assemblages in freshwater ecosystems their study also emphasized that pathogenic wastewater associated organisms could be discharged into waterways by means of the microplastics with the attachment of the organisms a study on microplastics associated bacteria in yangtze estuary also confirmed the presence of potential pathogens on microplastics jiang et al 2018 another biological effect is the change in the plastic physical properties because of biofilms that attach onto surface of microplastics firstly the density of microplastics can be increased carr et al 2016 enabling light microplastics to sink in the water column and benthic zones furthermore the biofilms can alter the surface nature of microplastics and make the surface less hydrophobic lobelle and cunliffe 2011 zettler et al 2013 the findings may provide some insights on studies associated with sorption of persistent organic pollutants whether the attached biofilms can enhance or weaken the interactions between microplastics and water borne pollutants remains unknown to us 3 microplastics sampling methods despite the fact that studies on microplastics have been performed for years the methodologies on sample collection sample pre treatment quantification and identification are not standardized the findings from reported studies vary significantly and cannot be easily compared the sampling methods can be volume reduced and bulk sampling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 in the volume reduced sampling the volume of sample is reduced during the sampling period in the bulk sampling no water volume is reduced in the volume reduced sampling neuston plankton net and manta trawl are two commonly adopted approaches which aim at collecting surface water samples only a few studies used the water collected by the bulk sampling approach because of its lower density than water microplastics tend to float on the surface of water therefore a trawl along a transect can be applied to collect surface water samples rocha santos and duarte 2015 during sampling a flow meter is used to calculate the entire volume filtered through the mesh by which the total volume of water can be determined free et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the researchers typically use net with 330 μm mesh to concentrate top water samples ryan et al 2009 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 eriksen et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 baldwin et al 2016 su et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 such a selection is mainly due to the lower size boundary of microplastics of 333 μm suggested by national oceanic and atmospheric administration of usa arthur et al 2009 the advantages of using the trawl are that it can cover large sampling areas and reduce sample volume only one study adopts 500 μm mesh in austrian leading to a much smaller content of microplastics lechner et al 2014 however as the mesh size is comparatively large it may neglect small particles which may be more important in fresh waters due to the environmental impacts eerkes medrano et al 2015 additionally when the mesh of different sizes is selected greater difference in abundance of microplastics can always be observed lozano and mouat 2009 dris et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 lozano and mouat 2009 found out that when an 80 μm mesh was used the results were 100 000 times higher than that by a 450 μm mesh the similar observation was reported in a study of the waters in great paris dris et al 2015 therefore the concern over comparability and data credibility from studies is being raised in addition to common trawl methods other approaches are used they include surface microlayer method hand net collection and bulk water sampling surface microlayer method enables researchers to collect upper layer water this process is performed manually by using a 2 mm sieve to get top 1 mm seawater song et al 2014 while rotating glass drum can automatically collect surface water at upper level of 50 60 μm ng and obbard 2006 hand net sampling is another common method to collect microplastics samples when one uses the method hand bucket is required to collect certain volume of surface water at top 20 cm level followed by the hand net filtration moore et al 2011 song et al 2014 for bulk water samples the volume varies among studies song et al 2014 reportedly collected as high as 100 l water samples while the volume of 100 ml and 2 l was only collected for the studies by dubaish and liebezeit 2013 and leslie et al 2017 respectively the results by different sampling approaches were compared by song et al 2014 it was concluded that the mean abundance of microplastics present in surface seawater was in the order of surface microlayer hand net bulk water and manta trawl the size distribution and particle compositions were also dependent on sampling methods for instance while the ps particles showed 96 of total particles in manta trawl samples they seldom appeared in surface microlayer samples and only accounted for 0 2 of total particles the size of microplastics can be as small as 1 6 μm to the upper boundary of 5 mm cole et al 2011 a study has shown plastic fragments of size less than 50 μm were underestimated song et al 2015 additionally for dynamic freshwater bodies like rivers the microplastics can quickly transfer to the aquatic environment however in isolated and remote freshwater bodies due to the low human activity microplastics are trapped in the water and would gradually fragment into tiny microplastics which have the sizes of sub micro meters hence underestimation can be expected in the results when a 330 μm mesh is used to collect samples it is inappropriate to apply the marine microplastics sampling methods for the work in fresh water environment it is therefore an urgent need to develop optimized and standardized methods for water sampling 4 sample extraction and purification the microplastics analysis mainly consists of two steps 1 extraction purification and 2 quantification and or identification the microplastics must first be separated from the initial matrix in order to improve and simplify the subsequent process for the quantification and or identification for the initial separation density separation is the most often used approach which involves the mixing of the sample with a liquid that has the defined density normally a saturated salt solution the suspension was then shaken and stirred for a defined time followed by the settling of the mixture this process can enable the low density particles such as the microplastics to float to the upper layer of water and the high density particles such as inorganic clay to sink to the bottom thus microplastics could be recovered from the supernatant the saturated nacl solution with a density of 1 2 kg l is the most commonly used to achieve this separating process due to its low cost and no toxicity to humans browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 filtered seawater and distilled water are also used as separating solutions hanvey et al 2017 however for those denser microplastics that contain polyvinyl chloride or polyoxymethylene with densities of 1 16 1 58 kg l and 1 41 1 61 kg l they cannot be recovered by this approach other salt solutions were also reportedly used they are sodium polytungstate spt solution with a density of 1 4 1 5 kg l corcoran et al 2009 corcoran 2015 calcium chloride cacl2 with a density of 1 3 kg l stolte et al 2015 and sodium iodide nai solutions with a density of 1 8 kg l nuelle et al 2014 the selection is based on the separation efficiency and the cost of materials as a non toxic separating salt the spt was applied for liquid separation for years munsterman and kerstholt 1996 however it is rather expensive when it is compared with other salts a study by stolte 2015 demonstrated that cacl2 was not suitable as it caused interference in the measurement nai was used for the microplastics separation in several studies although the density of nai solution is as high as 1 8 kg l it is expensive and must be handled with care nuelle et al 2014 zinc chloride zncl2 solution with a dentistry of 1 6 kg l was also used for the microplastics separation imhof et al 2012 2016 most types of microplastics can be recovered however it is hazardous compared to other substances reported thus the subsequent recycling and reuse of zncl2 with care are necessary in order to minimize environmental pollution the extraction separation methods are based on the density separation through the combination of fluidization with floatation ivleva et al 2017 80 100 of microplastics particles could be obtained by saturated nacl solution following the plain stirring extraction fries et al 2013 however the drawback is that smaller plastic particles of size 1 mm can only be separated to a small degree of 40 mass several strategies were proposed and adapted it was reported that the combination of fluidization in a nacl solution and floatation in nai solution gave a very good recovery rate of 99 nuelle et al 2014 the newly developed instrument munich plastic sediment separator in combination with the use of zncl2 solution can yield a particle number recovery of up to 96 100 for larger microplastics and 96 for smaller microplastics which was mainly used for the microplastics separation for the sediment samples imhof et al 2012 another alternative is through the pressurized fluid extraction pfe by optimizing the pfe conditions plastics can physically be separated from waste and soil samples fuller and gautam 2016 although the plastic particles as small as 30 μm can efficiently be extracted the challenges of using the method are that 1 size distribution cannot well be determined 2 morphology of microplastics after extraction is changed in addition to the density separation alternative separation techniques are reportedly used for example elutriation can effectively isolate microplastics from marine sediments claessens et al 2013 the light microplastics can be retained through the upward water flow and aeration in a self designed elutriation and floatation apparatus and then be collected on a 35 μm sieve an extraction efficiency of 94 98 can be obtained its limitation is that it is less applicable for wastewater which contains a high concentration of organic matter this is due to the negligible density difference between the microplastics and the naturally occurring particles within these matrices making the elutriation method difficult to achieve to improve the efficiency of the extraction for samples taken from sediment and sewage density separation to separate the lighter microplastics is always the first step followed by the purification this becomes especially important for bulk samples however the sequence in the operations is less important for water samples the purification process can be divided into two main different categories of chemical degradation and enzymatic degradation in order that the interfering matters such as organic tissues and inorganic dusts can be removed in the first approach the microplastics samples are treated with different chemicals mainly 10 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution zettler et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 or peroxide mixed with mineral acids such as sulfuric acid imhof et al 2013 cole et al 2014 studied the efficiency of different acid alkaline and enzymatic digestion methods for digestion of biological materials including organisms microorganisms and attached biofilms from marine surface trawls the damage of microplastics may be less the non oxidizing acids such as hydrochloric acid at low concentrations at room temperature are insufficient yielding large amount of organic residues after the digestion whereas the strong oxidizing acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid would destroy or damage the microplastics made by polymers with less tolerance at low ph a study on digestion of the microplastics containing samples taken from marine environment by 1 m sodium hydroxide showed a higher effectiveness of 90 cole et al 2014 the digestion efficiency would increase with the increase in the molarity and the temperature the plankton were digested by 10 m naoh at 60 c however such a harsh condition would damage the microplastics as the damage to the microplastics is negligible the h2o2 based method is still the most popular for the sample digestion other chemical approaches such as ultrasonication can be combined with the deionized water or sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solutions for the digestion cooper and corcoran 2010 enders et al 2015 however some concerns had been raised as tiny microplastics could be generated from the brittle plastic samples löder and gerdts 2015 another emerging approach to remove the organic matters is the enzymatic degradation during the degradation process microplastics samples are incubated with a mixture of technical enzymes such as lipase amylase proteinase chitinase and cellulose cole et al 2014 löder et al 2015 such organic matters as proteins lipids and carbohydrates can be specifically removed cole et al 2014 reported the application of the proteolytic enzyme proteinase k in the treatment of the marine samples more than 97 by weight of the materials present in plankton rich seawater samples were removed within a few hours whereas the microplastic debris present was unaffected this method should further be optimized as the molecular biological enzyme is costly the basic enzymatic purification protocol bepp was used to purify samples for subsequent spectroscopic analyses löder et al 2017 combined with the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate sds technical grade enzymes e g protease cellulase and chitinase in phosphate buffer saline solutions and h2o2 with the density separation by zncl2 the purification efficiency can reach 98 3 for plankton samples a universal enzymatic purification protocol uepp different from the aforementioned bepp was further developed löder et al 2017 in the uepp another two more enzymes lipase and amylase were added and digestion was processed in tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris and sodium acetate buffer the modified protocol can be implemented on samples from different environmental matrices although these two protocols can reduce operation time of microscopy and have more reliable spectroscopic results it requires long digestion time up to 15 days therefore the new enzymatic purification approach should still be optimized and the flexibility in the large scale routine field sample purification still needs to be further investigation 5 microplastics identification and quantification after the microplastics containing water is treated visual sorting is conducted this is commonly used by the majority of the research groups to select the suspected microplastics for further analysis and identification derraik 2002 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 rochman 2015 qiu et al 2016 however visual sorting may not provide accurate information on microplastics abundance due to presence of such particles as clay and algae if the aftermentioned treatment is not conducted it is very difficult to visually differentiate the microplastics from other extracted organic and inorganic particles of similar size and shape especially for the samples that are not pre treated as aforementioned additional approaches such as the spectroscopic approaches are required they can serve as a more reliable technical tool for the identification of the plastic particles instead of relying on visual observation that would introduce large variations in the results the current techniques for quantitative and qualitative research of microplastics include pyrolysis gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry fabbri et al 2000 fabbri 2001 fries et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 raman spectroscopy cole et al 2013 collard et al 2015 imhof et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 wiesheu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy song et al 2014 besseling et al 2015 qiu et al 2016 liquid chromatography hintersteiner et al 2015 elert et al 2017 and the most recently reported tagging method shim et al 2016 table 3 summarizes most of the analytical techniques and provides their advantages and limitations among them manual counting under a stereomicroscope is the most straightforward and thus widely used noren 2007 proposed several standardized criteria on a strict and conservative examination of microplastics with the key points as follows 1 the particles or fibers that have structure of biological organisms should not be included as microplastics 2 the fibers can be counted as microplastics if they have three dimensional structure 3 the particles can be counted as microplastics if they can be homogeneously colored 4 the microplastics must be transparent or whitish in color and be studied under high magnification with the help of fluorescence microscopy there are a few drawbacks to the aforementioned criteria the results from the visual sorting are strongly affected by several factors including 1 personal factors e g carelessness 2 microscopy quality and 3 sample matrix furthermore visual counting suffers the drawback of size limitation due to the resolution of the microscopy up to 70 error rates can be observed the number of error increases with a decrease in particle size hidalgo ruz et al 2012 a study was conducted on the microplastics abundance in the sediment samples collected from the north sea the results by the visual counting approach seemed overestimated based on the additional study by the focal plane array fpa based micro ftir spectroscopy it was found that only 1 4 of the particles visually observed were the synthetic polymer by the micro ftir spectroscopy the other particles visually found were of other origins such as organic matters and dusts löder et al 2015 among the commonly reported techniques fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy are most commonly used to identify microplastics besseling et al 2015 ivleva et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in the testing the microplastic samples are excited by which the structure specific vibrations can be detected the produced characteristic spectra with the fingerprint range allow the identification of nature of materials namely plastics and non plastics the polymer identification was achieved by comparing the obtained spectra with the known reference spectra for ftir spectroscopy the sample is irradiated with ir light with a defined wavelength range and the ir radiation absorbance collected by the equipment is structure specific the prerequisite for the ir absorption is the change of the permanent dipole moment of a chemical bond thus this technique is mainly used to analyze the molecules with the polar functional groups such as carbonyl groups raman spectroscopy is a scattering method the laser with the single wavelength is applied to excite the molecule the radiation interaction with the sample is detected the prerequisite of the raman spectroscopy is the change in the polarizability of a chemical bond and thus this technique is mainly for compounds with aromatic bonds c h and c c double bonds ftir and raman spectroscopy are complementary vibrational techniques to each other both would provide complementary information on microplastic samples ftir spectroscopy is a non destructive technique with well established polymer database there are three different operating modes available for ftir namely transmission reflection and attenuated total reflectance atr mode larger plastic samples 500 μm can be analyzed using atr ftir for smaller particles the micro ft ir spectroscopy is a good tool for simultaneous visualization mapping and collection of spectra the micro ftir is particularly useful as the membrane filter can be directly used for the visualization with little sample preparation the micro ftir analyses of plastics can be performed in either transmission or reflectance mode the transmission mode gives high quality spectra but requires substrates to be infrared transparent the analyses in reflectance mode can be done for thick samples meanwhile irregularly shaped microplastics would produce non interpretable spectra due to refractive error harrison et al 2012 thus only transparent microplastics with certain thickness with regular shape can be analyzed otherwise the signal will be disturbed distorted by reflection error caused by light scattering these drawbacks can hardly be avoided the micro ftir requires tremendous time and efforts to find the suitable microplastics particles for the analytical work the contact of the crystal with the inorganic particles could impose great damage to the expensive instrumentation levin and bhargava 2005 used the approach of micro ftir mapping with the sequential measurement of ir spectra at spatially separated and manually selected points on the sample surface however only small areas of the filter paper could be analyzed and the process is very time consuming a fpa based ftir imaging with several detectors placed in a grid pattern was applied for microplastics analysis tagg et al 2015 this method allows for detailed and unbiased high throughput screening of total microplastics on the whole filter paper it can enable the simultaneous recording of several thousand spectra in a targeted area within a single measurement run and thus generate chemical images for the whole filter paper the screening and analysis for the whole sample filter paper may become possible this technique this method has several limitations as follows the lateral resolution of micro ftir spectroscopy is always limited to certain diffraction range e g 10 μm at 1000 cm 1 the smaller particles with irregular shape are less applicable the samples down to 20 μm cannot be analyzed löder and gerdts 2015 as water is strongly ir active which produces broad peaks over 3000 cm 1 the sample preparation is required prior to measurement raman spectroscopy as a surface analytical technique allows for the study of large and visually sorted particles the micro raman microscopy combined with raman spectra imaging technique theoretically allows for the spectra analysis of whole filters at a spatial resolution below 1 μm imhof et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 however as raman spectroscopy is based on the methodology that the fluorescent samples are excited by the laser the contaminants by biological residual and others would interfere with the spectra leading to the difficulty in producing the interpretable spectra the thermoanalytical methods such as pyrolysis gc ms and tga ms have been used for the microplastic analysis samples are firstly thermally degraded and the resultant products are subsequently sent to the mass spectrometer for analysis the collected data are compared with reference to obtain such sample information as identity and concentration however the techniques have a limitation on size of plastic matters it is difficult to handle samples 500 μm as the tiny small samples cannot be put into the tube in addition the method is less applicable for mixtures with high concentration of impurities ivleva et al 2017 another thermoanalytical method was used by duemichen et al 2014 it allows the direct microplastics assessment from the field environmental samples with ease in sample preparation the thermogravimetric analysis is combined with the solid phase extraction tga spe and thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometer tds gc ms the environmental field sample with certain impurities such as the organics and microplastics particles up to 20 mg was placed in a tga crucible followed by a heating process under inert conditions such as n2 up to 800 c the resultant products that are sorbed on the extraction substrate can be tested by gc ms for the determination of the composition only the results of polyethylene pe were published in addition to gas chromatography liquid chromatography was applied in quantification of microplastics hintersteiner et al 2015 elert et al 2017 the method takes advantage of the different solubility of plastics appropriate solvents are used to dissolve different polymers for instance tetrahydrofurane and hexafluoroisopropanol could dissolve ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet respectively elert et al 2017 after the preparation of polymer extracts the samples can be analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with size exclusion systems though unable to determine the sizes of plastic particles this method reportedly has high recoveries and can quantify the microplastics however this method has yet to be applied to real environmental water samples more studies are required to verify this method for the microplastics samples in fresh waters in addition a simple staining method was reported developed shim et al 2016 commercially available nile red nr was applied to stain highly hydrophobic microplastics the nr molecule is only fluorescent in the presence of a hydrophobic environment the molecule specifically binds to the microplastics as a result the nr stained microplastic particles are visible under a fluorescent microscope which can easily be counted the nr staining could be useful to determine the microplastics abundance the main drawback is that the nr also can stain the natural organic matters hence pre purification is required the staining method cannot be used alone unless the interfering organic matters are fully removed 6 challenges and recommendations microplastics polymers in nature collected from freshwater environment have undergone long time exposed to variation degradation processes including uv induced photo degradation thermal degradation mechanical action and biological interactions e g biodegradation the surface morphology and properties such as hydrophobicity would be greatly altered from original polymer compositions hidalgo ruz et al 2012 organisms and microorganisms can colonize microplastics forming successional biofilms such processes in combination with polymer additives would further complicate spectroscopic analysis because spectral changes result from biofilm additives and reference spectra are less sufficient for degradation products it becomes more challenging for smaller particles where the higher surface to volume ratio makes the signals from the surface material more significant thus it is rather difficult to differentiate the microplastics from natural polymers such as chitosan cellulose and chitin it is difficult to quantify and qualify microplastics from the complex environmental samples using a single analytical method thus combination of multiple methods is preferred which strongly depends on the sizes of microplastics when the sizes of microplastics fall in the range of 1 mm and the minimal cut off size is tens of microns the combination of the microscopic analysis with the spectroscopic analysis is highly recommended if the minimal cut off size is in a range of a few microns raman spectroscopy is preferred as it is the only technique for such sizes if the samples after digestion pretreatment have less impurity thermal methods and liquid chromatography are recommended standardized and robust methods for quantification and identification of microplastics should be first developed and verified so that data from different researches can be more comparable and reliable key issues such as environmental risk assessment can then be conducted scientifically subsequently rules and regulations can be formulated and enforced 7 conclusions microplastics have become one of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment the presence has been reported in many places around the world and has caused great public concerns however there is still a lack of sufficient knowledge about microplastics in freshwaters such as their health effects and fast monitoring this review article summarized the current status of microplastics contamination in freshwaters including rivers lakes water treatment plants and drinking water the potential environmental consequences including entanglement ingestion vector of water born pollutants and possible toxicity were addressed the sampling methods of volume reduced method and bulk sample method were described to provide researchers with suitable one s to use detailed illustration on sample purification and separation was given ftir spectroscopy raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gc ms liquid chromatography and tagging method for counting were described and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed through the literature research we found that it was difficult to use a single method for quantitation and quantification of microplastics from freshwater samples the combination of different techniques can greatly improve our understanding of this new environmental problem and more reliable data for environmental risk assessment and preparation enforcement of rules and regulations in the future acknowledgements a phd scholarship from the national university of

19614,the continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment consequently microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment the presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities the sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants the abundance of microplastics varies with the location from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion the microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters those toxins may cause great health problems to humans a few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles in studies of microplastics fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330 μm for collection of microplastics after the volume reducing process the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes the sequence of these two processes namely purification and digestion is dependent on the sample type the purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods the commonly used methods for the qualification studies are ftir spectroscopy raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gc ms and liquid chromatography a tagging method can be used in the quantification study our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters more work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk keywords analytical methods freshwaters microplastics occurrence 1 introduction plastic products have such outstanding features as light weight being durable and versatile and production with low cost hammer et al 2012 ivleva et al 2017 however plastic debris has raised global concerns over its wide distribution and associated environmental consequences the annual global production of plastic product in 2016 alone was around 322 million tonnes europe 2016 an estimation of up to 10 of plastic fragments would end up in marine environment as per suggested by cole et al 2011 due to extensive usage and increasing production in plastic product and poor management rochman 2015 while diminishing aesthetic value of water environment plastic debris is likely to pose threats to public health and cause biodiversity loss thompson et al 2009 gall and thompson 2015 microplastics are widely defined as synthetic polymers with an upper size limit of 5 mm and without specified lower limit thompson et al 2009 they can be categorized into primary microplastics and secondary microplastics the definition of primary microplastics is the microplastics which are originally manufactured to have a size less than 5 mm and mainly found in textiles medicines and such personal care products as facial and body scrubs cole et al 2011 browne 2015 these primary microplastics can be transported by rivers discharge from water treatment plants wind and surface run off into either fresh water and seawater environments gall and thompson 2015 secondary microplastics are derived from fragmentation or large plastic debris due to such processes as photo degradation physical chemical and biological interactions thompson et al 2009 galgani et al 2013 the origins of secondary microplastics include fishing nets industrial resin pellets household items and other discarded plastic debris eerkes medrano et al 2015 notably it was found that the majority of microplastics are secondary microplastics eriksen et al 2013 and that the abundance in waters would increase along with the increase in input of plastic debris from different origins leading to continuous transformation of secondary microplastics cole et al 2011 when microplastics are exposed in the environment there is a higher possibility of break down of microplastics to nanoplastics that may have higher environmental risks due to the nature of nano sizes microplastics can originate from both land and ocean based sources hammer et al 2012 the ocean based sources due to commercial fishing vessels and other activities in marine environment only contribute 20 of total plastic debris in marine environment andrady 2011 the microplastics from terrestrial sources contribute the remaining 80 terrestrial sources include different origins that mainly are personal care products air blasting process improperly disposed plastics and leachates from landfill cole et al 2011 once terrestrial microplastics are released into the natural water systems most of them would be transported to oceans by rivers while the remaining would reside in fresh water environment including such isolated water systems as remote mountain lakes browne et al 2010 free et al 2014 microplastics are of great public concerns for the ubiquitous presence and persistence in the aquatic environment the global presence of microplastics has been found in recent years from horizontal perspective microplastics were reportedly found in tropical areas ng and obbard 2006 nor and obbard 2014 they were even seen in the polar waters of antarctica and arctic barnes et al 2010 bergmann et al 2015 when one looks at vertical distribution microplastics exist in benthic zone of water bodies water columns surface waters and beaches some reports have shown the concentrations in surface water vary from 10 5 to 105 pieces m3 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 desforges et al 2014 frias et al 2014 lima et al 2014 auta et al 2017 and 40 to 400 pieces l in sediments zurcher 2009 browne et al 2011 antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2014 nor and obbard 2014 most recently china central television website cctv com reported a group of chinese scientists have discovered the presence of microplastics in antarctic waters china org cn 2018 furthermore the distribution shows clear geographical variations fossi et al 2012 collignon et al 2014 de lucia et al 2014 desforges et al 2014 the factors affecting the distribution include such large scale forces as currents driven by wind and geostrophic circulation law et al 2010 turbulence and oceanographic effects ballent et al 2012 turra et al 2014 as key factors the inherent properties of microplastics such as density shape and size of microplastics can affect transportation and distribution patterns eerkes medrano et al 2015 the aforementioned factors are more likely to play important roles in a large freshwater environment like riverine systems however they become limited on smaller isolated fresh water systems where natural factors and long water residence time dominantly affect quantity of microplastics free et al 2014 hence microplastics in open and dynamic fresh waters would eventually end up in marine environment while microplastics in isolated and static waters bodies would remain and accumulate in the waters fresh waters may accumulate numerous microplastic particles and fibers however less efforts have been made to monitor the microplastics in fresh waters than those in seawaters such fresh waters can be the sources like waste water plants transferring media like rivers and sink like isolated lakes of microplastics which may differ from those in seawaters because large variations in quantity can be expected klein et al 2018 meanwhile the properties of microplastics can be quite heterogeneous for instance microplastics in sewage are heavily contaminated by organic contents and exist as relatively large pieces on the other hand in clean fresh waters are nearly free of organic contents and hardly seen by naked eyes orb 2017 in addition some lakes or rivers with fresh water are close to the areas with high population where higher microplastics abundance was detected eriksen et al 2013 another significant characteristic of microplastics studies in freshwater systems is that the sample sizes are small however large sampling areas are necessary to adequately reduce the large variations due to spatial and temporal changes ryan et al 2009 as a result we found that there was an urgent need to review the current research work and methodologies on microplastics in fresh waters in order that appropriate sampling quantification and identification approaches can be developed for the study in freshwater samples the objective of this review paper is to reveal the current knowledge about microplastics in fresh waters for a better understanding of microplastics contamination and potential risks summaries of sampling methods and comparisons of different quantification and identification approaches are presented several key challenges are discussed and suggestions are provided for further research work 2 microplastics in freshwater systems 2 1 occurrence most of efforts on the research of microplastics have been placed on seawater environment less than 4 of microplastics related studies are reportedly associated with freshwaters lambert and wagner 2018 the limited information however revealed that the abundance of microplastics in freshwaters is comparable to that of marine environment peng et al 2017 and the distribution is highly heterogeneous klein et al 2018 table 1 summarizes some of the relevant studies on the microplastics abundance in freshwater matrices the mean averaged values of microplastics abundance in fresh water systems varied greatly from almost none to several million pieces per cubic meter this significant difference results from such key factors as sampling locations human activities inherent natural conditions and sampling approaches eerkes medrano et al 2015 many terrestrial sources contribute the microplastics among them wastewater treatment is one of the dominant sources of microplastics magnusson and norén 2014 talvitie 2014 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 murphy et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 mintenig et al 2017 table 2 lists the key results from the microplastics studies on several wastewater treatment plants wwtps though wwtps can remove up to 95 of microplastics talvitie 2014 talvitie et al 2017 and tertiary treatment can have a 90 removal efficiency of fine particles of size larger than 10 μm wardrop et al 2016 there is substantial amount of microplastics being discharged into natural waters via wwtps rochman et al 2015 used the published data by magnusson and norén 2014 and martin and eizhvertina 2014 to estimate the amount of microbeads discharged into the waterways in the usa they came to a conservative conclusion that 8 billion microbeads pieces released from the municipal wwtps per day mason et al 2016 studied the effluent samples of 17 wwtps and predicted that the average discharge of microbeads from us municipal wwtps was 13 billion pieces per day similar to that from rochman et al 2015 given the fact that high volume of treated and untreated wastewater is released globally and only 60 of municipal wastewater is treated mateo sagasta et al 2015 a huge amount of microplastics would enter the environment via the discharges from wwtps in addition other sources such as surface run off atmospheric fallout dris et al 2016 and direct waste disposal contribute the increase in the microplastics flow into aqueous environment in september 2017 orb media a nonprofit journalism organization published a report that claims the presence of microplastics in drinking water this cross border research tested 159 drinking water samples from five continents found out that 83 of them were contaminated with tiny plastic debris orb 2017 since microplastics can directly enter human bodies it may be a long term exposure if people drink microplastics containing water these findings would trigger public concerns over the safety of drinking water and food 2 2 environmental impacts the concerns over microplastics are about the potential harms that can impose on organisms and humans the environmental impacts can be catalogued to physical chemical and biological impacts as described below the findings on the impacts are mainly based on marine environment but can be used for fresh water environment physical impacts mainly include entanglement and ingestion based on the work on the microplastics in sweater the study conducted by laist 1997 has shown over 200 marine species suffered from the entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris though to what extent of physical effects would affect organisms remain uncertain entanglement effect that is often associated with comparatively large animals is visible when we compare it with ingestion entanglement could cause severe impacts on aquatic species they can even be fatal by the means of drowning suffocating strangulating or starving allsopp et al 2006 the vulnerable species include sea turtles mammals seabirds and crustaceans gilardi et al 2010 when these animals drown in ghost nets they may suffer suffocation and starvation when their predators appear they are bound to die derraik 2002 however there is no report on entanglement incidence in freshwater bodies nevertheless the occurrence of entanglement in marine organisms has provided a clear indication to the situation in freshwater environment ingestion does not directly impose fatal effects on organisms even though it has well been observed the chronic effects however become a key issue wright et al 2013a ryan 1987 conducted a survey on the potential effects of plastic ingestion on domestic chicks in order to simulate the biological behavior of ingested plastics on seabirds it was found that there was a positive relationship between reduced food consumption and feed of plastics a research team suggested that a negative correlation between the fitness of seabirds and the ingested plastic debris spear et al 1995 the negative correlation was also observed on the fish lusher et al 2014 the pathways of microplastics entering the tract include direct and indirect ingestion fish mainly ingests microplastics via predation activities the accumulation effects can be observed in higher trophic levels such as seabirds seals and sea lions mcmahon et al 1999 eriksson and burton 2003 romeo et al 2015 the concentration factor of microplastics from surrounding waters to seals was reported to be as high as 160 times eriksson and burton 2003 wright et al 2013b eerkes medrano et al 2015 it was found that entanglement happened more frequently than ingestion 55 of marine organisms incidences are associated with entanglement ingestion contributes to 31 of incidences gall and thompson 2015 other solid matters contribute the rest 14 entanglement of microplastics mainly happens to comparatively large marine organism on the other hand ingestion of microplastics can be found throughout almost all the trophic levels such as zooplankton taxa cole et al 2013 marine lugworm wright et al 2013a mussel von moos et al 2012 oyster sussarellu et al 2016 fish rochman et al 2013 sea turtles bugoni et al 2001 dolphins denuncio et al 2011 whales walker and coe 1989 and seabirds derraik 2002 the chemical and biological impacts play key roles after ingestion microplastics cause toxicity effects to humans and living organisms through several pathways and mechanisms the polymeric compounds used in production of plastics the additives such as coper ions used during production of plastics are toxic more importantly various toxins in waters that are initially sorbed onto microplastics may subsequently be desorbed inside of human and animal bodies microplastics are made of polymeric compounds that can cause certain health effects for example polystyrene ps resistant to biodegradation can accumulate in the stomach of fish carpenter et al 1972 and can translocate through blood circulation chen et al 2006 for oysters after being experienced a two month exposure to ps microplastics the decreases in oocyte number diameter and sperm velocity were reported reproductive disruption for marine filter feeders was expected sussarellu et al 2016 a variety of additives are added during plastics production to improve physical properties such as color flame resistance and hardness they can be low molecular or polymeric inorganic or organic substances the most common additive is plasticizer that is for improvement of plasticity or viscosity for example polyvinyl chloride pvc must have plasticizers like phthalates and bisphenol a in order that thermal and photo degradation can be minimized hammer et al 2012 other additives include colorants and flame retardants it is anticipated that these chemicals would accumulate in human bodies through bioaccumulation process some of which are well known as endocrine disrupting compounds some studies confirmed that such additives as bisphenol a polybrominated diphenyl ethers tetrabromobisphenol a and phthalates are present in humans talsness et al 2009 in addition some compounds with heavy metals such as chromium cadmium and lead are often used in production of colorants stabilizers and plasticizers ernst et al 2000 murphy 2001 they can be released from plastic debris into water systems and further enter the food chain to cause bioaccumulation of toxins in organisms microplastics can be a vector for water borne hydrophobic pollutants teuten et al 2009 lee et al 2014 bakir et al 2016 o connor et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 examples include polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs velzeboer et al 2014 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt rios et al 2010 which are well known for their high toxicity and persistence in the environment due to the large specific surface areas and intrinsic hydrophobicity the potential of hydrophobic chemical adsorption onto the surface of microplastics has caused great concerns over microplastics horton et al 2017 pcbs are well known to be carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic hammer et al 2012 ddt can lead to adverse neurological effects and immunodeficiency mansouri et al 2017 the partition studies show the large partitioning coefficients for organic compounds in the range of 104 106 andrady 2011 a few studies suggested that microplastics could sorb high amounts of pcbs form the surrounding seawater in coastal areas of usa and japan hammer et al 2012 microplastics can sorb lubrication oils and heavy metals angiolillo et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the aforementioned pollutants initially sorbed on the surface of microplastics can be released when microplastics are ingested and stay inside of human body where ph is rather low temperature is comparatively high and digestive liquids are present a few studies confirmed that the desorption rate of sorbed contaminants in organisms was accelerated substantially faster than that in seawater teuten et al 2007 bakir et al 2014 however very limited information is available about the real sorption behavior for water borne pollutants in fresh water on the microplastics the toxicity of microplastics in fresh waters is not well understood a few lab scale studies have provided some implications on the potential biological hazards from microplastics a research conducted by ma et al 2016 selected daphnia magna as a model fresh water organism to study the toxicity of microplastics together with sorbed phenanthrene they concluded that nano sized ps exhibit high toxicity and physical damage to daphnia magna and toxicity was enhanced by sorbed phenanthrene a recent study demonstrated that the mixture of antimicrobial florfenicol and microplastics caused higher inhibition level of cholinesterase activity on freshwater bivalve corbicula fluninea than that of florfenicol or microplastics guilhermino et al 2018 it was found that microplastics caused certain levels of biological effects on corbicula flumineaand and their predator acipenser transmontanus rochman et al 2017 a few studies on larval and adult zebrafish showed that microplastics were first ingested became accumulated and consequently caused alternations in locomotion intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles lu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 sleight et al 2017 lei et al 2018 with regards to other fresh water organisms the toxicity studies on marine organisms may provide suggestive information hence it is of importance to investigate the interaction between microplastics and key compounds in lab scale experiments which will be helpful in the risk assessment of microplastics the biological effects include the potential to geographically transfer microorganisms oberbeckmann et al 2015 microorganisms can quickly colonize the surface of microplastics and be transported with the movement of microplastics as plastics are usually durable and persistent than other media thiel and gutow 2005 while this interaction is commonly known and possible consequences are raised such as the introduction of pathogens to a clean environment limited literatures are available to reveal the diverse biofilms communities and even less for freshwater environment mccormick et al 2014 conducted high throughput sequencing analysis on the microplastics collected in an urban river in chicago illinois they found out some attached taxa were plastic decomposing organisms and pathogens the findings suggest that microplastics can transport bacterial assemblages in freshwater ecosystems their study also emphasized that pathogenic wastewater associated organisms could be discharged into waterways by means of the microplastics with the attachment of the organisms a study on microplastics associated bacteria in yangtze estuary also confirmed the presence of potential pathogens on microplastics jiang et al 2018 another biological effect is the change in the plastic physical properties because of biofilms that attach onto surface of microplastics firstly the density of microplastics can be increased carr et al 2016 enabling light microplastics to sink in the water column and benthic zones furthermore the biofilms can alter the surface nature of microplastics and make the surface less hydrophobic lobelle and cunliffe 2011 zettler et al 2013 the findings may provide some insights on studies associated with sorption of persistent organic pollutants whether the attached biofilms can enhance or weaken the interactions between microplastics and water borne pollutants remains unknown to us 3 microplastics sampling methods despite the fact that studies on microplastics have been performed for years the methodologies on sample collection sample pre treatment quantification and identification are not standardized the findings from reported studies vary significantly and cannot be easily compared the sampling methods can be volume reduced and bulk sampling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 in the volume reduced sampling the volume of sample is reduced during the sampling period in the bulk sampling no water volume is reduced in the volume reduced sampling neuston plankton net and manta trawl are two commonly adopted approaches which aim at collecting surface water samples only a few studies used the water collected by the bulk sampling approach because of its lower density than water microplastics tend to float on the surface of water therefore a trawl along a transect can be applied to collect surface water samples rocha santos and duarte 2015 during sampling a flow meter is used to calculate the entire volume filtered through the mesh by which the total volume of water can be determined free et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the researchers typically use net with 330 μm mesh to concentrate top water samples ryan et al 2009 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 eriksen et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 baldwin et al 2016 su et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 such a selection is mainly due to the lower size boundary of microplastics of 333 μm suggested by national oceanic and atmospheric administration of usa arthur et al 2009 the advantages of using the trawl are that it can cover large sampling areas and reduce sample volume only one study adopts 500 μm mesh in austrian leading to a much smaller content of microplastics lechner et al 2014 however as the mesh size is comparatively large it may neglect small particles which may be more important in fresh waters due to the environmental impacts eerkes medrano et al 2015 additionally when the mesh of different sizes is selected greater difference in abundance of microplastics can always be observed lozano and mouat 2009 dris et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 lozano and mouat 2009 found out that when an 80 μm mesh was used the results were 100 000 times higher than that by a 450 μm mesh the similar observation was reported in a study of the waters in great paris dris et al 2015 therefore the concern over comparability and data credibility from studies is being raised in addition to common trawl methods other approaches are used they include surface microlayer method hand net collection and bulk water sampling surface microlayer method enables researchers to collect upper layer water this process is performed manually by using a 2 mm sieve to get top 1 mm seawater song et al 2014 while rotating glass drum can automatically collect surface water at upper level of 50 60 μm ng and obbard 2006 hand net sampling is another common method to collect microplastics samples when one uses the method hand bucket is required to collect certain volume of surface water at top 20 cm level followed by the hand net filtration moore et al 2011 song et al 2014 for bulk water samples the volume varies among studies song et al 2014 reportedly collected as high as 100 l water samples while the volume of 100 ml and 2 l was only collected for the studies by dubaish and liebezeit 2013 and leslie et al 2017 respectively the results by different sampling approaches were compared by song et al 2014 it was concluded that the mean abundance of microplastics present in surface seawater was in the order of surface microlayer hand net bulk water and manta trawl the size distribution and particle compositions were also dependent on sampling methods for instance while the ps particles showed 96 of total particles in manta trawl samples they seldom appeared in surface microlayer samples and only accounted for 0 2 of total particles the size of microplastics can be as small as 1 6 μm to the upper boundary of 5 mm cole et al 2011 a study has shown plastic fragments of size less than 50 μm were underestimated song et al 2015 additionally for dynamic freshwater bodies like rivers the microplastics can quickly transfer to the aquatic environment however in isolated and remote freshwater bodies due to the low human activity microplastics are trapped in the water and would gradually fragment into tiny microplastics which have the sizes of sub micro meters hence underestimation can be expected in the results when a 330 μm mesh is used to collect samples it is inappropriate to apply the marine microplastics sampling methods for the work in fresh water environment it is therefore an urgent need to develop optimized and standardized methods for water sampling 4 sample extraction and purification the microplastics analysis mainly consists of two steps 1 extraction purification and 2 quantification and or identification the microplastics must first be separated from the initial matrix in order to improve and simplify the subsequent process for the quantification and or identification for the initial separation density separation is the most often used approach which involves the mixing of the sample with a liquid that has the defined density normally a saturated salt solution the suspension was then shaken and stirred for a defined time followed by the settling of the mixture this process can enable the low density particles such as the microplastics to float to the upper layer of water and the high density particles such as inorganic clay to sink to the bottom thus microplastics could be recovered from the supernatant the saturated nacl solution with a density of 1 2 kg l is the most commonly used to achieve this separating process due to its low cost and no toxicity to humans browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 filtered seawater and distilled water are also used as separating solutions hanvey et al 2017 however for those denser microplastics that contain polyvinyl chloride or polyoxymethylene with densities of 1 16 1 58 kg l and 1 41 1 61 kg l they cannot be recovered by this approach other salt solutions were also reportedly used they are sodium polytungstate spt solution with a density of 1 4 1 5 kg l corcoran et al 2009 corcoran 2015 calcium chloride cacl2 with a density of 1 3 kg l stolte et al 2015 and sodium iodide nai solutions with a density of 1 8 kg l nuelle et al 2014 the selection is based on the separation efficiency and the cost of materials as a non toxic separating salt the spt was applied for liquid separation for years munsterman and kerstholt 1996 however it is rather expensive when it is compared with other salts a study by stolte 2015 demonstrated that cacl2 was not suitable as it caused interference in the measurement nai was used for the microplastics separation in several studies although the density of nai solution is as high as 1 8 kg l it is expensive and must be handled with care nuelle et al 2014 zinc chloride zncl2 solution with a dentistry of 1 6 kg l was also used for the microplastics separation imhof et al 2012 2016 most types of microplastics can be recovered however it is hazardous compared to other substances reported thus the subsequent recycling and reuse of zncl2 with care are necessary in order to minimize environmental pollution the extraction separation methods are based on the density separation through the combination of fluidization with floatation ivleva et al 2017 80 100 of microplastics particles could be obtained by saturated nacl solution following the plain stirring extraction fries et al 2013 however the drawback is that smaller plastic particles of size 1 mm can only be separated to a small degree of 40 mass several strategies were proposed and adapted it was reported that the combination of fluidization in a nacl solution and floatation in nai solution gave a very good recovery rate of 99 nuelle et al 2014 the newly developed instrument munich plastic sediment separator in combination with the use of zncl2 solution can yield a particle number recovery of up to 96 100 for larger microplastics and 96 for smaller microplastics which was mainly used for the microplastics separation for the sediment samples imhof et al 2012 another alternative is through the pressurized fluid extraction pfe by optimizing the pfe conditions plastics can physically be separated from waste and soil samples fuller and gautam 2016 although the plastic particles as small as 30 μm can efficiently be extracted the challenges of using the method are that 1 size distribution cannot well be determined 2 morphology of microplastics after extraction is changed in addition to the density separation alternative separation techniques are reportedly used for example elutriation can effectively isolate microplastics from marine sediments claessens et al 2013 the light microplastics can be retained through the upward water flow and aeration in a self designed elutriation and floatation apparatus and then be collected on a 35 μm sieve an extraction efficiency of 94 98 can be obtained its limitation is that it is less applicable for wastewater which contains a high concentration of organic matter this is due to the negligible density difference between the microplastics and the naturally occurring particles within these matrices making the elutriation method difficult to achieve to improve the efficiency of the extraction for samples taken from sediment and sewage density separation to separate the lighter microplastics is always the first step followed by the purification this becomes especially important for bulk samples however the sequence in the operations is less important for water samples the purification process can be divided into two main different categories of chemical degradation and enzymatic degradation in order that the interfering matters such as organic tissues and inorganic dusts can be removed in the first approach the microplastics samples are treated with different chemicals mainly 10 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution zettler et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 or peroxide mixed with mineral acids such as sulfuric acid imhof et al 2013 cole et al 2014 studied the efficiency of different acid alkaline and enzymatic digestion methods for digestion of biological materials including organisms microorganisms and attached biofilms from marine surface trawls the damage of microplastics may be less the non oxidizing acids such as hydrochloric acid at low concentrations at room temperature are insufficient yielding large amount of organic residues after the digestion whereas the strong oxidizing acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid would destroy or damage the microplastics made by polymers with less tolerance at low ph a study on digestion of the microplastics containing samples taken from marine environment by 1 m sodium hydroxide showed a higher effectiveness of 90 cole et al 2014 the digestion efficiency would increase with the increase in the molarity and the temperature the plankton were digested by 10 m naoh at 60 c however such a harsh condition would damage the microplastics as the damage to the microplastics is negligible the h2o2 based method is still the most popular for the sample digestion other chemical approaches such as ultrasonication can be combined with the deionized water or sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solutions for the digestion cooper and corcoran 2010 enders et al 2015 however some concerns had been raised as tiny microplastics could be generated from the brittle plastic samples löder and gerdts 2015 another emerging approach to remove the organic matters is the enzymatic degradation during the degradation process microplastics samples are incubated with a mixture of technical enzymes such as lipase amylase proteinase chitinase and cellulose cole et al 2014 löder et al 2015 such organic matters as proteins lipids and carbohydrates can be specifically removed cole et al 2014 reported the application of the proteolytic enzyme proteinase k in the treatment of the marine samples more than 97 by weight of the materials present in plankton rich seawater samples were removed within a few hours whereas the microplastic debris present was unaffected this method should further be optimized as the molecular biological enzyme is costly the basic enzymatic purification protocol bepp was used to purify samples for subsequent spectroscopic analyses löder et al 2017 combined with the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate sds technical grade enzymes e g protease cellulase and chitinase in phosphate buffer saline solutions and h2o2 with the density separation by zncl2 the purification efficiency can reach 98 3 for plankton samples a universal enzymatic purification protocol uepp different from the aforementioned bepp was further developed löder et al 2017 in the uepp another two more enzymes lipase and amylase were added and digestion was processed in tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris and sodium acetate buffer the modified protocol can be implemented on samples from different environmental matrices although these two protocols can reduce operation time of microscopy and have more reliable spectroscopic results it requires long digestion time up to 15 days therefore the new enzymatic purification approach should still be optimized and the flexibility in the large scale routine field sample purification still needs to be further investigation 5 microplastics identification and quantification after the microplastics containing water is treated visual sorting is conducted this is commonly used by the majority of the research groups to select the suspected microplastics for further analysis and identification derraik 2002 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 rochman 2015 qiu et al 2016 however visual sorting may not provide accurate information on microplastics abundance due to presence of such particles as clay and algae if the aftermentioned treatment is not conducted it is very difficult to visually differentiate the microplastics from other extracted organic and inorganic particles of similar size and shape especially for the samples that are not pre treated as aforementioned additional approaches such as the spectroscopic approaches are required they can serve as a more reliable technical tool for the identification of the plastic particles instead of relying on visual observation that would introduce large variations in the results the current techniques for quantitative and qualitative research of microplastics include pyrolysis gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry fabbri et al 2000 fabbri 2001 fries et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 raman spectroscopy cole et al 2013 collard et al 2015 imhof et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 wiesheu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy song et al 2014 besseling et al 2015 qiu et al 2016 liquid chromatography hintersteiner et al 2015 elert et al 2017 and the most recently reported tagging method shim et al 2016 table 3 summarizes most of the analytical techniques and provides their advantages and limitations among them manual counting under a stereomicroscope is the most straightforward and thus widely used noren 2007 proposed several standardized criteria on a strict and conservative examination of microplastics with the key points as follows 1 the particles or fibers that have structure of biological organisms should not be included as microplastics 2 the fibers can be counted as microplastics if they have three dimensional structure 3 the particles can be counted as microplastics if they can be homogeneously colored 4 the microplastics must be transparent or whitish in color and be studied under high magnification with the help of fluorescence microscopy there are a few drawbacks to the aforementioned criteria the results from the visual sorting are strongly affected by several factors including 1 personal factors e g carelessness 2 microscopy quality and 3 sample matrix furthermore visual counting suffers the drawback of size limitation due to the resolution of the microscopy up to 70 error rates can be observed the number of error increases with a decrease in particle size hidalgo ruz et al 2012 a study was conducted on the microplastics abundance in the sediment samples collected from the north sea the results by the visual counting approach seemed overestimated based on the additional study by the focal plane array fpa based micro ftir spectroscopy it was found that only 1 4 of the particles visually observed were the synthetic polymer by the micro ftir spectroscopy the other particles visually found were of other origins such as organic matters and dusts löder et al 2015 among the commonly reported techniques fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy are most commonly used to identify microplastics besseling et al 2015 ivleva et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in the testing the microplastic samples are excited by which the structure specific vibrations can be detected the produced characteristic spectra with the fingerprint range allow the identification of nature of materials namely plastics and non plastics the polymer identification was achieved by comparing the obtained spectra with the known reference spectra for ftir spectroscopy the sample is irradiated with ir light with a defined wavelength range and the ir radiation absorbance collected by the equipment is structure specific the prerequisite for the ir absorption is the change of the permanent dipole moment of a chemical bond thus this technique is mainly used to analyze the molecules with the polar functional groups such as carbonyl groups raman spectroscopy is a scattering method the laser with the single wavelength is applied to excite the molecule the radiation interaction with the sample is detected the prerequisite of the raman spectroscopy is the change in the polarizability of a chemical bond and thus this technique is mainly for compounds with aromatic bonds c h and c c double bonds ftir and raman spectroscopy are complementary vibrational techniques to each other both would provide complementary information on microplastic samples ftir spectroscopy is a non destructive technique with well established polymer database there are three different operating modes available for ftir namely transmission reflection and attenuated total reflectance atr mode larger plastic samples 500 μm can be analyzed using atr ftir for smaller particles the micro ft ir spectroscopy is a good tool for simultaneous visualization mapping and collection of spectra the micro ftir is particularly useful as the membrane filter can be directly used for the visualization with little sample preparation the micro ftir analyses of plastics can be performed in either transmission or reflectance mode the transmission mode gives high quality spectra but requires substrates to be infrared transparent the analyses in reflectance mode can be done for thick samples meanwhile irregularly shaped microplastics would produce non interpretable spectra due to refractive error harrison et al 2012 thus only transparent microplastics with certain thickness with regular shape can be analyzed otherwise the signal will be disturbed distorted by reflection error caused by light scattering these drawbacks can hardly be avoided the micro ftir requires tremendous time and efforts to find the suitable microplastics particles for the analytical work the contact of the crystal with the inorganic particles could impose great damage to the expensive instrumentation levin and bhargava 2005 used the approach of micro ftir mapping with the sequential measurement of ir spectra at spatially separated and manually selected points on the sample surface however only small areas of the filter paper could be analyzed and the process is very time consuming a fpa based ftir imaging with several detectors placed in a grid pattern was applied for microplastics analysis tagg et al 2015 this method allows for detailed and unbiased high throughput screening of total microplastics on the whole filter paper it can enable the simultaneous recording of several thousand spectra in a targeted area within a single measurement run and thus generate chemical images for the whole filter paper the screening and analysis for the whole sample filter paper may become possible this technique this method has several limitations as follows the lateral resolution of micro ftir spectroscopy is always limited to certain diffraction range e g 10 μm at 1000 cm 1 the smaller particles with irregular shape are less applicable the samples down to 20 μm cannot be analyzed löder and gerdts 2015 as water is strongly ir active which produces broad peaks over 3000 cm 1 the sample preparation is required prior to measurement raman spectroscopy as a surface analytical technique allows for the study of large and visually sorted particles the micro raman microscopy combined with raman spectra imaging technique theoretically allows for the spectra analysis of whole filters at a spatial resolution below 1 μm imhof et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 however as raman spectroscopy is based on the methodology that the fluorescent samples are excited by the laser the contaminants by biological residual and others would interfere with the spectra leading to the difficulty in producing the interpretable spectra the thermoanalytical methods such as pyrolysis gc ms and tga ms have been used for the microplastic analysis samples are firstly thermally degraded and the resultant products are subsequently sent to the mass spectrometer for analysis the collected data are compared with reference to obtain such sample information as identity and concentration however the techniques have a limitation on size of plastic matters it is difficult to handle samples 500 μm as the tiny small samples cannot be put into the tube in addition the method is less applicable for mixtures with high concentration of impurities ivleva et al 2017 another thermoanalytical method was used by duemichen et al 2014 it allows the direct microplastics assessment from the field environmental samples with ease in sample preparation the thermogravimetric analysis is combined with the solid phase extraction tga spe and thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometer tds gc ms the environmental field sample with certain impurities such as the organics and microplastics particles up to 20 mg was placed in a tga crucible followed by a heating process under inert conditions such as n2 up to 800 c the resultant products that are sorbed on the extraction substrate can be tested by gc ms for the determination of the composition only the results of polyethylene pe were published in addition to gas chromatography liquid chromatography was applied in quantification of microplastics hintersteiner et al 2015 elert et al 2017 the method takes advantage of the different solubility of plastics appropriate solvents are used to dissolve different polymers for instance tetrahydrofurane and hexafluoroisopropanol could dissolve ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet respectively elert et al 2017 after the preparation of polymer extracts the samples can be analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with size exclusion systems though unable to determine the sizes of plastic particles this method reportedly has high recoveries and can quantify the microplastics however this method has yet to be applied to real environmental water samples more studies are required to verify this method for the microplastics samples in fresh waters in addition a simple staining method was reported developed shim et al 2016 commercially available nile red nr was applied to stain highly hydrophobic microplastics the nr molecule is only fluorescent in the presence of a hydrophobic environment the molecule specifically binds to the microplastics as a result the nr stained microplastic particles are visible under a fluorescent microscope which can easily be counted the nr staining could be useful to determine the microplastics abundance the main drawback is that the nr also can stain the natural organic matters hence pre purification is required the staining method cannot be used alone unless the interfering organic matters are fully removed 6 challenges and recommendations microplastics polymers in nature collected from freshwater environment have undergone long time exposed to variation degradation processes including uv induced photo degradation thermal degradation mechanical action and biological interactions e g biodegradation the surface morphology and properties such as hydrophobicity would be greatly altered from original polymer compositions hidalgo ruz et al 2012 organisms and microorganisms can colonize microplastics forming successional biofilms such processes in combination with polymer additives would further complicate spectroscopic analysis because spectral changes result from biofilm additives and reference spectra are less sufficient for degradation products it becomes more challenging for smaller particles where the higher surface to volume ratio makes the signals from the surface material more significant thus it is rather difficult to differentiate the microplastics from natural polymers such as chitosan cellulose and chitin it is difficult to quantify and qualify microplastics from the complex environmental samples using a single analytical method thus combination of multiple methods is preferred which strongly depends on the sizes of microplastics when the sizes of microplastics fall in the range of 1 mm and the minimal cut off size is tens of microns the combination of the microscopic analysis with the spectroscopic analysis is highly recommended if the minimal cut off size is in a range of a few microns raman spectroscopy is preferred as it is the only technique for such sizes if the samples after digestion pretreatment have less impurity thermal methods and liquid chromatography are recommended standardized and robust methods for quantification and identification of microplastics should be first developed and verified so that data from different researches can be more comparable and reliable key issues such as environmental risk assessment can then be conducted scientifically subsequently rules and regulations can be formulated and enforced 7 conclusions microplastics have become one of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment the presence has been reported in many places around the world and has caused great public concerns however there is still a lack of sufficient knowledge about microplastics in freshwaters such as their health effects and fast monitoring this review article summarized the current status of microplastics contamination in freshwaters including rivers lakes water treatment plants and drinking water the potential environmental consequences including entanglement ingestion vector of water born pollutants and possible toxicity were addressed the sampling methods of volume reduced method and bulk sample method were described to provide researchers with suitable one s to use detailed illustration on sample purification and separation was given ftir spectroscopy raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gc ms liquid chromatography and tagging method for counting were described and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed through the literature research we found that it was difficult to use a single method for quantitation and quantification of microplastics from freshwater samples the combination of different techniques can greatly improve our understanding of this new environmental problem and more reliable data for environmental risk assessment and preparation enforcement of rules and regulations in the future acknowledgements a phd scholarship from the national university of
