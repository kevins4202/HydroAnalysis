18580,strategies to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are widely discussed especially the evaluation of the potential benefit of further advanced treatment steps such as an additional tertiary treatment based on ozonation or activated carbon have come into focus such evaluation strategies are often based on the removal behavior of known micropollutants via target or suspected analysis the utilization of nontarget analysis is considered to lead to a more comprehensive picture as also unknown or not expected micropollutants are analyzed here the results of an evaluation via target and nontarget analysis were compared for biological treatment bt processes of eleven full scale wwtps and three different post treatments pts one sand filter sf and two granular activated carbon gac filters the similarity of the determined removals from target and nontarget analysis of the bts increased significantly by excluding easily degradable features from the nontarget evaluation a similar ranking of the removal trends for the bts could also be achieved by comparing this new subset of nontarget features with a set of nine readily to moderately biodegradable micropollutants this observation suggests that a performance ranking of bts based either on target or nontarget analysis is plausible in contrast to the bts the evaluation of the three pts revealed that the difference of feature removal between sf and the two gacs was small but large for the target analytes with substantially higher removal effciencies for the gacs compared to the sf in addition to the removal behavior the nontarget analysis provided further information about the number and quantity of transformation products tps in the effluent from the bts for all bts more than half 55 67 of the features detected in the effluent were not found in the influent a comparable proportion of tps was also detected after gac and sand filtration due to their microbial activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords qtof hrms process evaluation micropollutants activated carbon filtration 1 introduction to improve the chemical and ecological status of surface water bodies the possibilities to mitigate the discharge of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants wwtps into the aquatic environment are being discussed noguera oviedo and aga 2016 qiu et al 2016 particular attention has been directed towards the activated sludge process where the removal of organic matter tends to exceed 90 as expressed by parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod and dissolved organic carbon doc roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 wan et al 2016 polar organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals biocides artificial sweeteners or ingredients of personal care products can also be partly transformed in the activated sludge process but many micropollutants are not effectively removed resulting in elevated concentrations of these micropollutants in the receiving waters dévier et al 2011 eggen et al 2014 hughes et al 2012 rivera utrilla et al 2013 the main removal pathway in contact with activated sludge is biodegradation by the bacterial community but also abiotic processes such as sorption or redox reactions can occur one option to reduce the discharge of organic micropollutants from wwtps that has been discussed and also has been partially implemented is the installation of a post treatment pt eggen et al 2014 these pts are mostly based on ozonation and or activated carbon altmann et al 2016 zou 2015 for the monitoring of both conventional treatments and additional pts a set of selected organic micropollutants is usually quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry systems lc ms ms target analysis bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 petrie et al 2016 however this technique has certain limitations i only a small subset of pre selected compounds is measured and ii transformation products tps formed during the wastewater treatment are often neglected since many are not commercially available as standards or even unknown some of the inherent limitations of the target analysis could be circumvented by the use of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms agüera et al 2013 chiaia hernandez et al 2014 diaz et al 2013 this technique enables both i quantification of selected target compounds and ii detection of compounds based on full scan data without an a priori analyte selection the hrms technique has different applications the suspected analysis screens for known post selected micropollutants by the extraction of ion chromatograms xics from the full scan data montes et al 2017 moschet et al 2017 singer et al 2016 vergeynst et al 2015 this extraction of xics can extend the restricted number of analytes of the target analysis if the identity of the compound can be confirmed by a fragment spectrum ms ms via a database comparison online or local instead of via measurements of reference standards hannemann et al 2016 another application of the hrms technique is the identification of unknown compounds i e tps using different prioritization strategies ballesteros gómez et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2015 gallampois et al 2015 luek et al 2017 samanipour et al 2017 schlüsener et al 2015 zonja et al 2015 a third application of the hrms technique is the use of the hrms data without a mandatory identification process in this application the focus is on a fingerprint comparison as known from metabolomics katayama et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ogura et al 2013 in this case the quality of a generic peak extraction and further data processing procedure defines the meaningfulness of the conclusions in the following the signals identified by a generic peak extraction nontarget analysis result are named features a feature is characterized by its exact mass and its retention time therefore a validated workflow focused on a correct peak recognition minimizing false positive and false negative results is required bader et al 2016a 2017 nürenberg et al 2015 prominent examples of the environmental use of the nontarget analysis are the identification and localization of contamination sources in water systems müller et al 2011 noah et al 2015 wagner et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the effects of water treatments on the feature distributions e g investigation of uv h2o2 using different conditions parry and young 2016 however up to now the suitability of different hrms techniques to assess the performance of wastewater treatment processes has only rarely been explored one example is the evaluation of a wwtp with ozonation and subsequent sand sf and granular activated carbon gac filters which were compared with respect to their removal efficiencies of ozone tps schollée et al 2018 our work takes the next step and focuses on the evaluation of the removal of micropollutants during biological treatment bt in eleven different full scale wwtps as well as during different pt processes sf and two gac filters using lc hrms the results of the process evaluation based on nontarget analysis are compared to the common assessment via target analysis the effects of different numbers of target compound lists on the evaluation results are also discussed furthermore potential benefits and or limitations of the nontarget approach compared to target analysis are presented in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plants and sampling six 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent effluent of the primary clarifier and effluent of the bt at eleven wwtps in germany and switzerland always three of these six 24 h composite samples were collected on consecutive days for sampling dates see table s1 in the si the sampling was done by the automatic procedure of the wwtp operators all wwtps are equipped with an activated sludge treatment for denitrification and nitrification sludge retention time srt 10 d information on cod removal and other operating parameters of the wwtps are provided in table 1 one of the wwtps w11 was equipped with three different pts which were implemented in parallel the effluent of the activated sludge process at w11 was directed to i a sf w11sf with a filtration velocity of 7 9 m h ii a gac filter w11gac high with 7 1 m h totally 27 000 bed volumes treated and iii a second gac filter w11gac low with only 4 4 m h totally 18 000 bed volumes treated six 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent and effluent of each pt 2 2 chemicals acetonitrile acn and methanol meoh both lichrosolv hypergrade for lc ms were purchased from merck darmstadt germany and formic acid fa lc ms grade from sigma aldrich seelze germany ultra pure water was obtained from a milli q system millipore billerica ma u s a standards of all used analytes were prepared separately in meoh at a concentration of 1 g l and stored at 25 c 2 3 sample processing all samples were filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose spartan whatman u s a and stored in polypropylene tubes at 25 c until further analysis while this filtration step removes sludge particles and thus also micropollutants sorbed to sludge our focus was on rather polar micropollutants and in the following the results and discussions are valid for micropollutants that are predominately present in the water phase for the target analysis the samples were spiked with the target internal standard is mixture see table s3 in the si to obtain a final concentration of 200 ng l of each is is of x ray contrast media were spiked with ten fold concentrations and is for acesulfame with a twenty fold concentration the influent samples were diluted with ultrapure water ratio 1 1 for the target analysis for the hrms measurements the 24 h composite samples day 1 to day 3 and from day 4 to day 6 were mixed to 72 h composite samples see table s1 in the si nt mix 1 and nt mix 2 this was done to reduce the total number of injections since all hrms measurements were performed in triplicates composite samples were spiked with the nontarget internal standard nt is mixture nürenberg et al 2015 to obtain a final concentration for each nt is of 1 μg l x ray contrast media and acesulfame again 10 or 20 fold higher concentrations the nt is mixture contained 19 isotopic labelled substances which were selected to cover the selected mass and polarity ranges retention time in both ionization modes more details are presented in nürenberg et al 2015 for target and nontarget measurements blank corrections were made with a filtered ultrapure water sample which was frozen in a polypropylene tube in case of the target analysis the blank concentrations were subtracted and for the nontarget analysis the features resulted from the measurement of the blank measurement were completely excluded as described in nürenberg et al 2015 2 4 target measurements target analysis was performed on a lc qq lit ms sciex api 5500 qtrap darmstadt germany using an electrospray ionization interface esi the separation was achieved using an agilent 1260 series lc system agilent technologies waldbronn germany equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm agilent which was protected by a zorbax eclipse xdb c8 security guard column 2 1 12 5 mm 5 μm agilent the gradient consisted of upw a and meoh b each containing 0 1 fa the injection volume was set to 80 μl and the analysis was conducted in positive and negative ion mode within one run using schedule multiple reaction monitoring smrm more details on the lc ms ms measurements are described in rühmland et al 2015 and in the si tables s2 and s3 2 5 hrms nontarget measurement triplicate measurements of each sample for the nontarget analysis were carried out by direct injection of 100 μl of the sample into an agilent 1260 series lc system coupled to a hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization esi qtof sciex tripletof 5600 the chromatographic separation was also achieved on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column protected by a security guard 2 0 4 mm aq c18 phenomenex aschaffenburg germany lc conditions and specific information on hrms measurements were described in detail in nürenberg et al 2015 the extraction and the alignment of the features from the full scan experiment for the nontarget analysis and the subsequent blank corrections were done using the markerview software v1 2 1 1 sciex afterwards the detected features were integrated automatically by multiquant 3 0 2 triplicate measurements were used to reduce the statistical spread of the extraction meaning the percentages of false positive and of false negative results by using only the common features of all three measurements further details of this procedure are described in nürenberg et al 2015 2 6 calculation of removal efficiencies removal efficiencies of the target compounds and features from nontarget analysis were calculated using the concentrations peak areas for nontarget analysis in the influent and effluent of the bt rbt equation 1 or the effluent of the pt removal bt plus pt rpt equation 2 arithmetic means of the measured concentrations of the analytes in the target analysis and of the peak areas in nontarget analysis were used in these calculations thus for target analysis six 24 h composite samples day 1 6 were averaged whereas for the nontarget analysis two 72 h composite samples days 1 3 and days 4 6 of the samples for target analysis were analyzed 1 r bt 1 concentration peak area effluent bt concentration peak area influent wwtp 2 r pt 1 concentration peak area effluent pt concentration peak area influent wwtp the average intensity concentration or area across the replicates was calculated for the target and nontarget analysis if the intensity of a certain compound feature was above zero or loq in each replicate for all other compounds features the averages were set to zero even for target analysis where the loqs were known in order to process the data analogously to the nontarget analysis 2 7 selection of different sets of target compounds for process evaluation environmentally relevant compounds selected for target analysis cover a wide mass range 119 836 da a wide retention time range from 2 5 to 16 5 min and a broad range of physicochemical properties e g polarity log kow 4 16 to 7 75 in total 38 compounds were selected target mixture table 2 during target analysis the concentrations of the six 24 h composite samples were averaged as described in section 2 6 four subsets of these 38 compounds were formed for specific evaluation purposes for the evaluation of the bts only analytes that fulfilled the following three criteria were selected a the average concentrations in the influent of each wwtp were 10 times the loq this was done to avoid elevated uncertainties in the removal calculation see chapter 2 6 b removal efficiencies less than 25 for calculation see chapter 2 6 and for results see tables s4 and s6 since formation was not considered at this stage some of the selected micropollutants were known metabolites which also might be formed as tp during the treatments in addition some human metabolites like conjugates can be cleaved back to original micropollutants this might lead to negative removal values less than 25 c the standard deviations of the removal efficiencies were 80 for at least five of bts such relatively high uncertainties were allowed due to rainfall events during the sampling campaign e g observable increase of the daily inflow rate in the catchment of w1 w3 w5 w7 and w10 from 21 to 23 09 2015 fig s1 leading to an elevated variation of the wwtp influent concentrations of certain compounds only 17 of the 38 analytes t17 fulfilled the three criteria a b and c at all eleven bts as shown in table s5 stage i a set of nine compounds t9 were formed fulfilling an additional selection criterion d table s5 stage ii d the removal of a compound ranged between 25 95 during the biological process this additional subset of nine readily to moderately removable target compounds t9 included acesulfame trimethoprim benzotriazole atenolol clarithromycin climbazole dihydro dihydroxy carbamazepine licarbazepine and acyclovir for the evaluation of the different pts 24 of the 38 compounds t24 were compiled based on the same selection criteria a b c table s6 stage i the reason for the higher number of compounds fulfilling the selection criteria for the pts than for the bts is that all pts are installed at a single wwtp and thus there is no need to consider the concentration variations of compounds among the eleven different wwtps finally a subset of six analytes from the swiss list for process monitoring of pts tch foen 2014 2016 was separately grouped to compare the removal of the swiss list compounds with the approach developed in the current study 2 8 matrix effects during lc hrms measurements a normalization strategy for compensating matrix effects has been performed for target analysis using the spiked internal standards however previous work revealed that this approach might not be successful for nontarget analysis of wwtp samples nürenberg et al 2015 nevertheless the peak areas of the nt is spiked to all wwtp influent and effluent samples used for nontarget analysis illustrate that i the matrix effects are around 20 higher in the wwtp influents than in the wwtp effluents and ii the bts of the eleven wwtps and the pts revealed similar matrix effects fig s2 leading in average to a signal suppression of 20 thus the matrix effects did not hamper the comparison of the wwtps this was further confirmed by a direct comparison of removal efficiencies between the target and the nontarget analysis which revealed that removal efficiencies which were determined with the nontarget analysis were in most cases in a similar range rt rnt 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological treatments bts 3 1 1 comparison of removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of the bt rbt determined from the target compounds t17 and the nontarget analysis nt are shown in fig 1 for w1 and in fig s3 for the other ten wwtps w2 w11 monitored an overview of the calculated rbt of the target analysis is presented in table s4 further details on the detection frequencies of target compounds and features are provided in table s7 a much higher removal was observed for the features in comparison to the target compounds more than 90 of the features were removed to 99 99 while the average removal of the target compounds t17 was less than 55 in all eleven biological treatments monitored see fig 1 and fig s3 the main reason for this difference is most likely the pre selection of the target analytes which was based on their occurrence in wwtp effluents as anthropogenic compounds and thus being rather persistent in biological processes features on the other hand include both biologically persistent compounds as well as a multitude of biomolecules such as amino acids peptides carbohydrate fats and fatty acids davies 2005 which can be efficiently eliminated during biological wastewater treatment the average removal of the features was roughly in a same range as the cod removal fig 1 right and table 1 suggesting that features on average are being removed similarly to the bulk organics while the 17 target compounds are representatives of anthropogenic compounds being less biodegradable in wwtps to enable a better comparison of the results of target compounds and features without over emphasizing the large share of very easily removable features rbt 99 99 the focus of the nontarget analysis was shifted towards a subset of more persistent features the number of features with rbt 99 99 was foreseen to be below 50 of the subset this was achieved by considering the top 7 most persistent features for the subsequent comparison of the eleven bts fig 2 and fig s4 similarly the selected target compounds t17 were further reduced filter stage i and ii criteria a d see section 2 7 to nine target compounds t9 to focus on those target compounds which were removed in a range between 25 and 95 when comparing the target compounds t9 and t17 and the features at 7 cut off level for wwtp w1 and w7 fig 2 and fig s4 it is apparent that the features nt w1 52 and w7 63 and the readily to moderately degradable target compounds t9 w1 44 and w7 63 showed similar average removal efficiencies while the removal efficiencies for all 17 selected target compounds t17 w1 27 and w7 45 were significantly lower a further comparison of the average removal efficiencies of the t9 compounds and the features across all eleven wwtps led to a similar ranking of the wwtps with respect to the average removal fig 3 hence this finding suggests that the average removal of a small subset of readily to moderately degradable target compounds provides a good estimate of the overall reduction of a much broader array of contaminants in the bt 3 1 2 transformation products a major benefit of nontarget analysis is its ability to identify newly formed transformation products tps and include tp formation in the evaluation of the micropollutant removal efficiency of a wwtp thus the relevance of features that were present in the wwtp effluent but absent in the influent was calculated however it cannot be excluded that a few compounds were not detected in the wwtp influent due to a lower limit of detection caused by matrix effects signal suppression during lc hrms measurements and thus are counted as tp although they are only passing the biological processes and are not formed the relative fraction of features exclusively present in the secondary effluents of all eleven wwtps ranged from 55 to 67 based on the number of analytes detected fig 4 and table s9 in addition the cumulative area of these features accounted for 36 54 total area of all features in the biologically treated wastewater areatotal fig s5 and table s10 these results strongly suggest that tps contribute significantly to the dissolved organic matter in the effluent of biological wastewater treatment processes thus for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of a wwtp to remove micropollutants tps are essential to be considered it has to be noted that not all tps derive from micropollutants but can be also formed from biological molecules however biomolecules are often easily biodegradable compounds which should be mostly excluded from further analysis due to the focus on features that showed a lower removal in addition many biomolecules are not covered by the lc hrms method applied as e g extreme polar compounds such as sugars as well higher molecular compounds such as lipids or proteins cannot be detected since our ms method was restricted to a mass range of 100 1200 da in any case these compounds are obviously formed in biological processes discharged into rivers and should be included in the evaluation of different wastewater treatment options the different nontarget parameters the average removals and the relative proportion of formed tps were compared to each other see fig 5 the average removal of three different feature fractions showed a very good correlation r2 0 9 see fig 5a c and 5e the average biological removal received from nontarget analysis rbt nt containing all features indicated a very high correlation with the removal efficiencies obtained via nontarget analysis at 7 cut off level rbt nt7 as well as with the numbers and the features found only in the influent no r of 100 no total influent with r2 1 and r2 0 94 respectively thus it can be concluded that the usage of the 7 cut off level only shifted systematically each average removal to lower values but had no or very limited effects on the trends concerning the eleven bts investigated a ranking of the eleven wwtps which can be visually derived from the three comparisons fig 5a c and 5e led to three groups with similar removal behaviors group i w11 group ii w5 w10 and group iii w1 w4 the average removal calculated from nontarget analysis rbt nt and rbt nt7 were compared with seven standard operating parameters srt hrt tss and cod nh4 n total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal see table 1 the results are shown in the si for the average removal of all features fig s6 and the features at a 7 cut off level fig s7 none of the nontarget parameters revealed a good correlation with any of the standard operating parameters which might be due to the different composition of the incoming water at the eleven wwtps where the total number of recorded features varied between 10 700 and 17 100 table s9 so this information from the standard operation parameters could not explain the grouping in contrast no strong correlation r2 0 5 was observed for the removal of features present in the influent of the eleven wwtps with the relative proportion of formed tps see fig 5b d and 5f this is true if all features nt the features at 7 cut off level nt7 or only the features which were only found in the influent samples no r of 100 no total influent were considered obviously the percentage of tps is independent from the removal efficiency of a treatment one reason for this might be that the removal efficiency is calculated on the primary removal of the features in the influent whereas tps may result from different levels of the degradation pathway of the corresponding parent compound the removal in a biological treatment is not restricted to biodegradation since sorption is another removal process which formes no tps the selected polarity window of the generic lc hrms method limited especially the detection of small and very polar tps therefore the percentage of tps cannot be derived from the overall removal efficiency but the tp percentage provides further information of the removal behavior of substances during waste water treatment a high fraction of tps indicates that degradation processes results in compounds with similar polarity and mass range as micropollutants in contrast a low fraction of tps suggests that mineralization sorption or formation of tps out of the analytical window have to be discussed and distinguished to explain the removal efficiency thus the percentage of newly detected features such as tps in the wwtp effluent could be an additional criterion for the evaluation of the overall removal performance 3 2 post treatments as for the bts the main portion of the very easily removable compounds was excluded from evaluation of the pts of w11 the cut off level for nontarget analysis was chosen in the same manner as for the eleven bts in chapter 3 1 1 however the cut off level was decreased from 7 to 3 5 fig 6 for the pts of w11 to ensure that the group of very easily removable compounds does not comprise more than 50 of the total detected analytes fig s8 in the si evaluation of the different pt options fig 6 and tables s6 and s8 in si by target analysis was performed with a subset of 24 permanently present compounds selected according to criteria a c filter stage i see 2 8 moreover a further subset of six compounds tch were defined as these compounds are already used on a legal level for the evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment in switzerland foen 2014 2016 by applying the target approach t24 the average removal achieved by the bt 36 was only slightly increased to 41 by the subsequent sf a considerable increase of the removal efficiency was however observed when using the two gac filters in the complete treatment train the average removal reached 78 with the highly loaded gac filter bt gachigh and 95 with the lowly loaded gac filter bt gaclow this is presumably attributed to main removal process of gac the sorption of organic substances as reported by boehler et al 2012 eggen et al 2014 and margot et al 2013 the lower removal efficiency of the w11gac high indicated the lower sorption capacity and a higher level of breakthrough due the higher loading 27 000 bed volumes bv treated and 13 min empty bed contact time ebct as compared to w11gac low 18 000 bv and 20 min ebct similar conclusions regarding the removal efficiencies of the pts were achieved by using the subset tch fig 6 although the average removal was slightly lower using the tch the removal efficiencies of the whole treatment trains including the gac filters were slightly lower the average removal of 80 the goal for the removal of target micropollutants as set by switzerland for the entire wastewater treatment processes boehler et al 2012 foen 2014 margot et al 2013 was only achieved with the pt w11gac low the comparison based on the nontarget evaluation showed a similar ranking for the removal efficiency of the three pts however the removal efficiencies in the sf were slightly smaller compared to those in the gac filters nontarget analysis revealed only minor differences amongst the various post treatment options obviously the selected target compounds are more persistent than the features covered by nontarget analysis with a 3 5 cut off level the number of detectable compounds revealed the same trends concerning the different treatments w11bt 1619 w11sf 1210 w11gac high 1102 w11gac low 840 fig 6 as seen for the calculated average removals regardless which subset of analytes features tch t24 or nt fig 6 was used for the calculation moreover the nontarget analysis allowed distinguishing the removal of features already present in the wwtp influent from the removal of the tps formed during bt activated sludge thus not only the primary removal behavior of the micropollutants found in the influent during different process stages can be considered but also the formation and removal of tps more than half of the features which were not removed during the bt were also detected after the pts fig 7 the tps formed in the biological treatment were removed to a higher degree by the pts w11gac low 63 w11gac high 47 w11sf 45 than the residual features already present in the influent of the wwtp and the biological effluent w11gac low 47 w11gac high 29 w11sf 22 fig 7 hence nontarget analysis indicated that gac filters as well as sf reduce the discharge of detectable and often unknown tps which resulted from the biological treatment step to the aquatic environment in addition to the tps formed during the activated sludge treatment 118 w11gac high and 156 w11sf tps features were exclusively detected after the individual pt gac filters also exhibit a microbial activity by biofilms formed during a long term operation which lead to the formation of new biological tps huggins et al 2016 ma et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 the effective life time of gac filters is often prolonged due to surface regeneration by desorption of biologically formed tps scharf et al 2010 leaching of compounds from gac filter media as well as the desorption of compounds not present in the influent samples could result in features falsely identified as tps although these processes could occur they are probably of limited importance for the outcome of this study as the filters had been in long term operation and the sampling campaigns were performed over three consecutive days the parent compounds and or the tps formed during activated sludge treatment were transformed to further tps these tps and leached or desorbed compounds accounted for more than 10 of the total numbers of features w11sf 13 w11gac high 11 and w11gac low 15 similar ratio of newly formed tps 20 during a gac purification were described in bader et al 2016b even the effluents of different pts sf and gac filters in a process cascade with an ozonation step between the biological and the post treatments contained small amounts of exclusively formed tps 3 schollée et al 2018 the formation of tps confirms that biological transformation processes contributes to the removal in both sfs and gac filters even though the total number of tps decreased in the pts the proportion of tps tpsbt tpspt in effluents of the pts w11gac low 54 w11gac high 53 w11sf 53 were in the same range as in the biologically treated effluent w11bt 55 4 conclusions nontarget analysis allows determining the reduction of the chemical complexity along treatment schemes in a semi quantitative way a consistent decrease in the number of nontarget features is seen in biological treatments which indicates that not only the total amount of organics expressed as cod or doc but also the number of chemical constituents in the water decreases from the influent to effluent advanced treatment allows reducing the chemical complexity of wastewater further even if tps are considered about half of the features found in the effluent of bt units consist of newly formed tps interestingly also pt units such as sf and gac filtration formed about 10 15 new tps thus clearly confirming the biological activity of these types of pts the average removal determined by the developed nontarget approach does not correlate with standard operating parameters normally being monitored during routine operation of wwtps such as srt hrt n removal sludge concentration cod removal thus nontarget analysis measurement does supply complementary information in addition to simple proxy measurements such as cod or doc furthermore this finding implicates that a direct or causal correlation of the degree of reduction in chemical complexity of treated wastewater with standard operating parameters is unlikely e g it has formerly been inferred that nitrifying organisms may play a major role in micropollutant removal given that occasionally correlation has been observed plausible ranking of bt efficiencies are possible based on nontarget analysis the observed removal of the chemical constituents in the biological treatments with nutrient elimination exceeds 90 even when the total number of recorded features in the incoming waters varies between 10 700 and 17 100 a good correlation is observed between the biological removal found with nontarget analysis and the removal of nine micropollutants featuring partial removal in bt i e between 25 and 95 removal fig 3 this observation underlines the possibility of using nontarget analysis to assess the removal of a broad array of readily to moderately degradable micropollutants in wwtps in pts nontarget analysis conveys complementary information to target analysis while target analysis indicates substantially higher removal by gac filtration compared to sfs the nontarget analysis reveals only minor differences amongst the various post treatment options fig 5 which type of analysis i e target or nontarget analysis is more pertinent for a specific site is expected to depend on the scope of treatment in cases where the primary focus is on avoiding specific anthropogenic compounds in water reuse schemes target analysis will likely be the method of choice for sites where environmental impact of complex mixtures including biological and chemical tps formed during wastewater treatment is of concern the nontarget analysis may provide additional information on the wastewater composition since it targets a high number of chemicals that are difficult to capture with target analysis based on the comparison of the nontarget and the target analysis in this study it also appears possible to focus the nontarget analysis towards organic micropollutants without knowing their identity nevertheless considering the behavior of micropollutants features is only one part for evaluation of the environmental impact and i e ecotoxicological evaluations are equally important nontarget analysis is a suitable tool for the evaluation of wastewater treatment processes the outcomes of this work highlights the complementary information which can be received from nontarget analysis compared to standard operating parameters or target analysis therefore the possibilities of lc hrms for the process monitoring

18580,strategies to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are widely discussed especially the evaluation of the potential benefit of further advanced treatment steps such as an additional tertiary treatment based on ozonation or activated carbon have come into focus such evaluation strategies are often based on the removal behavior of known micropollutants via target or suspected analysis the utilization of nontarget analysis is considered to lead to a more comprehensive picture as also unknown or not expected micropollutants are analyzed here the results of an evaluation via target and nontarget analysis were compared for biological treatment bt processes of eleven full scale wwtps and three different post treatments pts one sand filter sf and two granular activated carbon gac filters the similarity of the determined removals from target and nontarget analysis of the bts increased significantly by excluding easily degradable features from the nontarget evaluation a similar ranking of the removal trends for the bts could also be achieved by comparing this new subset of nontarget features with a set of nine readily to moderately biodegradable micropollutants this observation suggests that a performance ranking of bts based either on target or nontarget analysis is plausible in contrast to the bts the evaluation of the three pts revealed that the difference of feature removal between sf and the two gacs was small but large for the target analytes with substantially higher removal effciencies for the gacs compared to the sf in addition to the removal behavior the nontarget analysis provided further information about the number and quantity of transformation products tps in the effluent from the bts for all bts more than half 55 67 of the features detected in the effluent were not found in the influent a comparable proportion of tps was also detected after gac and sand filtration due to their microbial activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords qtof hrms process evaluation micropollutants activated carbon filtration 1 introduction to improve the chemical and ecological status of surface water bodies the possibilities to mitigate the discharge of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants wwtps into the aquatic environment are being discussed noguera oviedo and aga 2016 qiu et al 2016 particular attention has been directed towards the activated sludge process where the removal of organic matter tends to exceed 90 as expressed by parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod and dissolved organic carbon doc roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 wan et al 2016 polar organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals biocides artificial sweeteners or ingredients of personal care products can also be partly transformed in the activated sludge process but many micropollutants are not effectively removed resulting in elevated concentrations of these micropollutants in the receiving waters dévier et al 2011 eggen et al 2014 hughes et al 2012 rivera utrilla et al 2013 the main removal pathway in contact with activated sludge is biodegradation by the bacterial community but also abiotic processes such as sorption or redox reactions can occur one option to reduce the discharge of organic micropollutants from wwtps that has been discussed and also has been partially implemented is the installation of a post treatment pt eggen et al 2014 these pts are mostly based on ozonation and or activated carbon altmann et al 2016 zou 2015 for the monitoring of both conventional treatments and additional pts a set of selected organic micropollutants is usually quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry systems lc ms ms target analysis bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 petrie et al 2016 however this technique has certain limitations i only a small subset of pre selected compounds is measured and ii transformation products tps formed during the wastewater treatment are often neglected since many are not commercially available as standards or even unknown some of the inherent limitations of the target analysis could be circumvented by the use of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms agüera et al 2013 chiaia hernandez et al 2014 diaz et al 2013 this technique enables both i quantification of selected target compounds and ii detection of compounds based on full scan data without an a priori analyte selection the hrms technique has different applications the suspected analysis screens for known post selected micropollutants by the extraction of ion chromatograms xics from the full scan data montes et al 2017 moschet et al 2017 singer et al 2016 vergeynst et al 2015 this extraction of xics can extend the restricted number of analytes of the target analysis if the identity of the compound can be confirmed by a fragment spectrum ms ms via a database comparison online or local instead of via measurements of reference standards hannemann et al 2016 another application of the hrms technique is the identification of unknown compounds i e tps using different prioritization strategies ballesteros gómez et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2015 gallampois et al 2015 luek et al 2017 samanipour et al 2017 schlüsener et al 2015 zonja et al 2015 a third application of the hrms technique is the use of the hrms data without a mandatory identification process in this application the focus is on a fingerprint comparison as known from metabolomics katayama et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ogura et al 2013 in this case the quality of a generic peak extraction and further data processing procedure defines the meaningfulness of the conclusions in the following the signals identified by a generic peak extraction nontarget analysis result are named features a feature is characterized by its exact mass and its retention time therefore a validated workflow focused on a correct peak recognition minimizing false positive and false negative results is required bader et al 2016a 2017 nürenberg et al 2015 prominent examples of the environmental use of the nontarget analysis are the identification and localization of contamination sources in water systems müller et al 2011 noah et al 2015 wagner et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the effects of water treatments on the feature distributions e g investigation of uv h2o2 using different conditions parry and young 2016 however up to now the suitability of different hrms techniques to assess the performance of wastewater treatment processes has only rarely been explored one example is the evaluation of a wwtp with ozonation and subsequent sand sf and granular activated carbon gac filters which were compared with respect to their removal efficiencies of ozone tps schollée et al 2018 our work takes the next step and focuses on the evaluation of the removal of micropollutants during biological treatment bt in eleven different full scale wwtps as well as during different pt processes sf and two gac filters using lc hrms the results of the process evaluation based on nontarget analysis are compared to the common assessment via target analysis the effects of different numbers of target compound lists on the evaluation results are also discussed furthermore potential benefits and or limitations of the nontarget approach compared to target analysis are presented in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plants and sampling six 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent effluent of the primary clarifier and effluent of the bt at eleven wwtps in germany and switzerland always three of these six 24 h composite samples were collected on consecutive days for sampling dates see table s1 in the si the sampling was done by the automatic procedure of the wwtp operators all wwtps are equipped with an activated sludge treatment for denitrification and nitrification sludge retention time srt 10 d information on cod removal and other operating parameters of the wwtps are provided in table 1 one of the wwtps w11 was equipped with three different pts which were implemented in parallel the effluent of the activated sludge process at w11 was directed to i a sf w11sf with a filtration velocity of 7 9 m h ii a gac filter w11gac high with 7 1 m h totally 27 000 bed volumes treated and iii a second gac filter w11gac low with only 4 4 m h totally 18 000 bed volumes treated six 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent and effluent of each pt 2 2 chemicals acetonitrile acn and methanol meoh both lichrosolv hypergrade for lc ms were purchased from merck darmstadt germany and formic acid fa lc ms grade from sigma aldrich seelze germany ultra pure water was obtained from a milli q system millipore billerica ma u s a standards of all used analytes were prepared separately in meoh at a concentration of 1 g l and stored at 25 c 2 3 sample processing all samples were filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose spartan whatman u s a and stored in polypropylene tubes at 25 c until further analysis while this filtration step removes sludge particles and thus also micropollutants sorbed to sludge our focus was on rather polar micropollutants and in the following the results and discussions are valid for micropollutants that are predominately present in the water phase for the target analysis the samples were spiked with the target internal standard is mixture see table s3 in the si to obtain a final concentration of 200 ng l of each is is of x ray contrast media were spiked with ten fold concentrations and is for acesulfame with a twenty fold concentration the influent samples were diluted with ultrapure water ratio 1 1 for the target analysis for the hrms measurements the 24 h composite samples day 1 to day 3 and from day 4 to day 6 were mixed to 72 h composite samples see table s1 in the si nt mix 1 and nt mix 2 this was done to reduce the total number of injections since all hrms measurements were performed in triplicates composite samples were spiked with the nontarget internal standard nt is mixture nürenberg et al 2015 to obtain a final concentration for each nt is of 1 μg l x ray contrast media and acesulfame again 10 or 20 fold higher concentrations the nt is mixture contained 19 isotopic labelled substances which were selected to cover the selected mass and polarity ranges retention time in both ionization modes more details are presented in nürenberg et al 2015 for target and nontarget measurements blank corrections were made with a filtered ultrapure water sample which was frozen in a polypropylene tube in case of the target analysis the blank concentrations were subtracted and for the nontarget analysis the features resulted from the measurement of the blank measurement were completely excluded as described in nürenberg et al 2015 2 4 target measurements target analysis was performed on a lc qq lit ms sciex api 5500 qtrap darmstadt germany using an electrospray ionization interface esi the separation was achieved using an agilent 1260 series lc system agilent technologies waldbronn germany equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm agilent which was protected by a zorbax eclipse xdb c8 security guard column 2 1 12 5 mm 5 μm agilent the gradient consisted of upw a and meoh b each containing 0 1 fa the injection volume was set to 80 μl and the analysis was conducted in positive and negative ion mode within one run using schedule multiple reaction monitoring smrm more details on the lc ms ms measurements are described in rühmland et al 2015 and in the si tables s2 and s3 2 5 hrms nontarget measurement triplicate measurements of each sample for the nontarget analysis were carried out by direct injection of 100 μl of the sample into an agilent 1260 series lc system coupled to a hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization esi qtof sciex tripletof 5600 the chromatographic separation was also achieved on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column protected by a security guard 2 0 4 mm aq c18 phenomenex aschaffenburg germany lc conditions and specific information on hrms measurements were described in detail in nürenberg et al 2015 the extraction and the alignment of the features from the full scan experiment for the nontarget analysis and the subsequent blank corrections were done using the markerview software v1 2 1 1 sciex afterwards the detected features were integrated automatically by multiquant 3 0 2 triplicate measurements were used to reduce the statistical spread of the extraction meaning the percentages of false positive and of false negative results by using only the common features of all three measurements further details of this procedure are described in nürenberg et al 2015 2 6 calculation of removal efficiencies removal efficiencies of the target compounds and features from nontarget analysis were calculated using the concentrations peak areas for nontarget analysis in the influent and effluent of the bt rbt equation 1 or the effluent of the pt removal bt plus pt rpt equation 2 arithmetic means of the measured concentrations of the analytes in the target analysis and of the peak areas in nontarget analysis were used in these calculations thus for target analysis six 24 h composite samples day 1 6 were averaged whereas for the nontarget analysis two 72 h composite samples days 1 3 and days 4 6 of the samples for target analysis were analyzed 1 r bt 1 concentration peak area effluent bt concentration peak area influent wwtp 2 r pt 1 concentration peak area effluent pt concentration peak area influent wwtp the average intensity concentration or area across the replicates was calculated for the target and nontarget analysis if the intensity of a certain compound feature was above zero or loq in each replicate for all other compounds features the averages were set to zero even for target analysis where the loqs were known in order to process the data analogously to the nontarget analysis 2 7 selection of different sets of target compounds for process evaluation environmentally relevant compounds selected for target analysis cover a wide mass range 119 836 da a wide retention time range from 2 5 to 16 5 min and a broad range of physicochemical properties e g polarity log kow 4 16 to 7 75 in total 38 compounds were selected target mixture table 2 during target analysis the concentrations of the six 24 h composite samples were averaged as described in section 2 6 four subsets of these 38 compounds were formed for specific evaluation purposes for the evaluation of the bts only analytes that fulfilled the following three criteria were selected a the average concentrations in the influent of each wwtp were 10 times the loq this was done to avoid elevated uncertainties in the removal calculation see chapter 2 6 b removal efficiencies less than 25 for calculation see chapter 2 6 and for results see tables s4 and s6 since formation was not considered at this stage some of the selected micropollutants were known metabolites which also might be formed as tp during the treatments in addition some human metabolites like conjugates can be cleaved back to original micropollutants this might lead to negative removal values less than 25 c the standard deviations of the removal efficiencies were 80 for at least five of bts such relatively high uncertainties were allowed due to rainfall events during the sampling campaign e g observable increase of the daily inflow rate in the catchment of w1 w3 w5 w7 and w10 from 21 to 23 09 2015 fig s1 leading to an elevated variation of the wwtp influent concentrations of certain compounds only 17 of the 38 analytes t17 fulfilled the three criteria a b and c at all eleven bts as shown in table s5 stage i a set of nine compounds t9 were formed fulfilling an additional selection criterion d table s5 stage ii d the removal of a compound ranged between 25 95 during the biological process this additional subset of nine readily to moderately removable target compounds t9 included acesulfame trimethoprim benzotriazole atenolol clarithromycin climbazole dihydro dihydroxy carbamazepine licarbazepine and acyclovir for the evaluation of the different pts 24 of the 38 compounds t24 were compiled based on the same selection criteria a b c table s6 stage i the reason for the higher number of compounds fulfilling the selection criteria for the pts than for the bts is that all pts are installed at a single wwtp and thus there is no need to consider the concentration variations of compounds among the eleven different wwtps finally a subset of six analytes from the swiss list for process monitoring of pts tch foen 2014 2016 was separately grouped to compare the removal of the swiss list compounds with the approach developed in the current study 2 8 matrix effects during lc hrms measurements a normalization strategy for compensating matrix effects has been performed for target analysis using the spiked internal standards however previous work revealed that this approach might not be successful for nontarget analysis of wwtp samples nürenberg et al 2015 nevertheless the peak areas of the nt is spiked to all wwtp influent and effluent samples used for nontarget analysis illustrate that i the matrix effects are around 20 higher in the wwtp influents than in the wwtp effluents and ii the bts of the eleven wwtps and the pts revealed similar matrix effects fig s2 leading in average to a signal suppression of 20 thus the matrix effects did not hamper the comparison of the wwtps this was further confirmed by a direct comparison of removal efficiencies between the target and the nontarget analysis which revealed that removal efficiencies which were determined with the nontarget analysis were in most cases in a similar range rt rnt 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological treatments bts 3 1 1 comparison of removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of the bt rbt determined from the target compounds t17 and the nontarget analysis nt are shown in fig 1 for w1 and in fig s3 for the other ten wwtps w2 w11 monitored an overview of the calculated rbt of the target analysis is presented in table s4 further details on the detection frequencies of target compounds and features are provided in table s7 a much higher removal was observed for the features in comparison to the target compounds more than 90 of the features were removed to 99 99 while the average removal of the target compounds t17 was less than 55 in all eleven biological treatments monitored see fig 1 and fig s3 the main reason for this difference is most likely the pre selection of the target analytes which was based on their occurrence in wwtp effluents as anthropogenic compounds and thus being rather persistent in biological processes features on the other hand include both biologically persistent compounds as well as a multitude of biomolecules such as amino acids peptides carbohydrate fats and fatty acids davies 2005 which can be efficiently eliminated during biological wastewater treatment the average removal of the features was roughly in a same range as the cod removal fig 1 right and table 1 suggesting that features on average are being removed similarly to the bulk organics while the 17 target compounds are representatives of anthropogenic compounds being less biodegradable in wwtps to enable a better comparison of the results of target compounds and features without over emphasizing the large share of very easily removable features rbt 99 99 the focus of the nontarget analysis was shifted towards a subset of more persistent features the number of features with rbt 99 99 was foreseen to be below 50 of the subset this was achieved by considering the top 7 most persistent features for the subsequent comparison of the eleven bts fig 2 and fig s4 similarly the selected target compounds t17 were further reduced filter stage i and ii criteria a d see section 2 7 to nine target compounds t9 to focus on those target compounds which were removed in a range between 25 and 95 when comparing the target compounds t9 and t17 and the features at 7 cut off level for wwtp w1 and w7 fig 2 and fig s4 it is apparent that the features nt w1 52 and w7 63 and the readily to moderately degradable target compounds t9 w1 44 and w7 63 showed similar average removal efficiencies while the removal efficiencies for all 17 selected target compounds t17 w1 27 and w7 45 were significantly lower a further comparison of the average removal efficiencies of the t9 compounds and the features across all eleven wwtps led to a similar ranking of the wwtps with respect to the average removal fig 3 hence this finding suggests that the average removal of a small subset of readily to moderately degradable target compounds provides a good estimate of the overall reduction of a much broader array of contaminants in the bt 3 1 2 transformation products a major benefit of nontarget analysis is its ability to identify newly formed transformation products tps and include tp formation in the evaluation of the micropollutant removal efficiency of a wwtp thus the relevance of features that were present in the wwtp effluent but absent in the influent was calculated however it cannot be excluded that a few compounds were not detected in the wwtp influent due to a lower limit of detection caused by matrix effects signal suppression during lc hrms measurements and thus are counted as tp although they are only passing the biological processes and are not formed the relative fraction of features exclusively present in the secondary effluents of all eleven wwtps ranged from 55 to 67 based on the number of analytes detected fig 4 and table s9 in addition the cumulative area of these features accounted for 36 54 total area of all features in the biologically treated wastewater areatotal fig s5 and table s10 these results strongly suggest that tps contribute significantly to the dissolved organic matter in the effluent of biological wastewater treatment processes thus for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of a wwtp to remove micropollutants tps are essential to be considered it has to be noted that not all tps derive from micropollutants but can be also formed from biological molecules however biomolecules are often easily biodegradable compounds which should be mostly excluded from further analysis due to the focus on features that showed a lower removal in addition many biomolecules are not covered by the lc hrms method applied as e g extreme polar compounds such as sugars as well higher molecular compounds such as lipids or proteins cannot be detected since our ms method was restricted to a mass range of 100 1200 da in any case these compounds are obviously formed in biological processes discharged into rivers and should be included in the evaluation of different wastewater treatment options the different nontarget parameters the average removals and the relative proportion of formed tps were compared to each other see fig 5 the average removal of three different feature fractions showed a very good correlation r2 0 9 see fig 5a c and 5e the average biological removal received from nontarget analysis rbt nt containing all features indicated a very high correlation with the removal efficiencies obtained via nontarget analysis at 7 cut off level rbt nt7 as well as with the numbers and the features found only in the influent no r of 100 no total influent with r2 1 and r2 0 94 respectively thus it can be concluded that the usage of the 7 cut off level only shifted systematically each average removal to lower values but had no or very limited effects on the trends concerning the eleven bts investigated a ranking of the eleven wwtps which can be visually derived from the three comparisons fig 5a c and 5e led to three groups with similar removal behaviors group i w11 group ii w5 w10 and group iii w1 w4 the average removal calculated from nontarget analysis rbt nt and rbt nt7 were compared with seven standard operating parameters srt hrt tss and cod nh4 n total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal see table 1 the results are shown in the si for the average removal of all features fig s6 and the features at a 7 cut off level fig s7 none of the nontarget parameters revealed a good correlation with any of the standard operating parameters which might be due to the different composition of the incoming water at the eleven wwtps where the total number of recorded features varied between 10 700 and 17 100 table s9 so this information from the standard operation parameters could not explain the grouping in contrast no strong correlation r2 0 5 was observed for the removal of features present in the influent of the eleven wwtps with the relative proportion of formed tps see fig 5b d and 5f this is true if all features nt the features at 7 cut off level nt7 or only the features which were only found in the influent samples no r of 100 no total influent were considered obviously the percentage of tps is independent from the removal efficiency of a treatment one reason for this might be that the removal efficiency is calculated on the primary removal of the features in the influent whereas tps may result from different levels of the degradation pathway of the corresponding parent compound the removal in a biological treatment is not restricted to biodegradation since sorption is another removal process which formes no tps the selected polarity window of the generic lc hrms method limited especially the detection of small and very polar tps therefore the percentage of tps cannot be derived from the overall removal efficiency but the tp percentage provides further information of the removal behavior of substances during waste water treatment a high fraction of tps indicates that degradation processes results in compounds with similar polarity and mass range as micropollutants in contrast a low fraction of tps suggests that mineralization sorption or formation of tps out of the analytical window have to be discussed and distinguished to explain the removal efficiency thus the percentage of newly detected features such as tps in the wwtp effluent could be an additional criterion for the evaluation of the overall removal performance 3 2 post treatments as for the bts the main portion of the very easily removable compounds was excluded from evaluation of the pts of w11 the cut off level for nontarget analysis was chosen in the same manner as for the eleven bts in chapter 3 1 1 however the cut off level was decreased from 7 to 3 5 fig 6 for the pts of w11 to ensure that the group of very easily removable compounds does not comprise more than 50 of the total detected analytes fig s8 in the si evaluation of the different pt options fig 6 and tables s6 and s8 in si by target analysis was performed with a subset of 24 permanently present compounds selected according to criteria a c filter stage i see 2 8 moreover a further subset of six compounds tch were defined as these compounds are already used on a legal level for the evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment in switzerland foen 2014 2016 by applying the target approach t24 the average removal achieved by the bt 36 was only slightly increased to 41 by the subsequent sf a considerable increase of the removal efficiency was however observed when using the two gac filters in the complete treatment train the average removal reached 78 with the highly loaded gac filter bt gachigh and 95 with the lowly loaded gac filter bt gaclow this is presumably attributed to main removal process of gac the sorption of organic substances as reported by boehler et al 2012 eggen et al 2014 and margot et al 2013 the lower removal efficiency of the w11gac high indicated the lower sorption capacity and a higher level of breakthrough due the higher loading 27 000 bed volumes bv treated and 13 min empty bed contact time ebct as compared to w11gac low 18 000 bv and 20 min ebct similar conclusions regarding the removal efficiencies of the pts were achieved by using the subset tch fig 6 although the average removal was slightly lower using the tch the removal efficiencies of the whole treatment trains including the gac filters were slightly lower the average removal of 80 the goal for the removal of target micropollutants as set by switzerland for the entire wastewater treatment processes boehler et al 2012 foen 2014 margot et al 2013 was only achieved with the pt w11gac low the comparison based on the nontarget evaluation showed a similar ranking for the removal efficiency of the three pts however the removal efficiencies in the sf were slightly smaller compared to those in the gac filters nontarget analysis revealed only minor differences amongst the various post treatment options obviously the selected target compounds are more persistent than the features covered by nontarget analysis with a 3 5 cut off level the number of detectable compounds revealed the same trends concerning the different treatments w11bt 1619 w11sf 1210 w11gac high 1102 w11gac low 840 fig 6 as seen for the calculated average removals regardless which subset of analytes features tch t24 or nt fig 6 was used for the calculation moreover the nontarget analysis allowed distinguishing the removal of features already present in the wwtp influent from the removal of the tps formed during bt activated sludge thus not only the primary removal behavior of the micropollutants found in the influent during different process stages can be considered but also the formation and removal of tps more than half of the features which were not removed during the bt were also detected after the pts fig 7 the tps formed in the biological treatment were removed to a higher degree by the pts w11gac low 63 w11gac high 47 w11sf 45 than the residual features already present in the influent of the wwtp and the biological effluent w11gac low 47 w11gac high 29 w11sf 22 fig 7 hence nontarget analysis indicated that gac filters as well as sf reduce the discharge of detectable and often unknown tps which resulted from the biological treatment step to the aquatic environment in addition to the tps formed during the activated sludge treatment 118 w11gac high and 156 w11sf tps features were exclusively detected after the individual pt gac filters also exhibit a microbial activity by biofilms formed during a long term operation which lead to the formation of new biological tps huggins et al 2016 ma et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 the effective life time of gac filters is often prolonged due to surface regeneration by desorption of biologically formed tps scharf et al 2010 leaching of compounds from gac filter media as well as the desorption of compounds not present in the influent samples could result in features falsely identified as tps although these processes could occur they are probably of limited importance for the outcome of this study as the filters had been in long term operation and the sampling campaigns were performed over three consecutive days the parent compounds and or the tps formed during activated sludge treatment were transformed to further tps these tps and leached or desorbed compounds accounted for more than 10 of the total numbers of features w11sf 13 w11gac high 11 and w11gac low 15 similar ratio of newly formed tps 20 during a gac purification were described in bader et al 2016b even the effluents of different pts sf and gac filters in a process cascade with an ozonation step between the biological and the post treatments contained small amounts of exclusively formed tps 3 schollée et al 2018 the formation of tps confirms that biological transformation processes contributes to the removal in both sfs and gac filters even though the total number of tps decreased in the pts the proportion of tps tpsbt tpspt in effluents of the pts w11gac low 54 w11gac high 53 w11sf 53 were in the same range as in the biologically treated effluent w11bt 55 4 conclusions nontarget analysis allows determining the reduction of the chemical complexity along treatment schemes in a semi quantitative way a consistent decrease in the number of nontarget features is seen in biological treatments which indicates that not only the total amount of organics expressed as cod or doc but also the number of chemical constituents in the water decreases from the influent to effluent advanced treatment allows reducing the chemical complexity of wastewater further even if tps are considered about half of the features found in the effluent of bt units consist of newly formed tps interestingly also pt units such as sf and gac filtration formed about 10 15 new tps thus clearly confirming the biological activity of these types of pts the average removal determined by the developed nontarget approach does not correlate with standard operating parameters normally being monitored during routine operation of wwtps such as srt hrt n removal sludge concentration cod removal thus nontarget analysis measurement does supply complementary information in addition to simple proxy measurements such as cod or doc furthermore this finding implicates that a direct or causal correlation of the degree of reduction in chemical complexity of treated wastewater with standard operating parameters is unlikely e g it has formerly been inferred that nitrifying organisms may play a major role in micropollutant removal given that occasionally correlation has been observed plausible ranking of bt efficiencies are possible based on nontarget analysis the observed removal of the chemical constituents in the biological treatments with nutrient elimination exceeds 90 even when the total number of recorded features in the incoming waters varies between 10 700 and 17 100 a good correlation is observed between the biological removal found with nontarget analysis and the removal of nine micropollutants featuring partial removal in bt i e between 25 and 95 removal fig 3 this observation underlines the possibility of using nontarget analysis to assess the removal of a broad array of readily to moderately degradable micropollutants in wwtps in pts nontarget analysis conveys complementary information to target analysis while target analysis indicates substantially higher removal by gac filtration compared to sfs the nontarget analysis reveals only minor differences amongst the various post treatment options fig 5 which type of analysis i e target or nontarget analysis is more pertinent for a specific site is expected to depend on the scope of treatment in cases where the primary focus is on avoiding specific anthropogenic compounds in water reuse schemes target analysis will likely be the method of choice for sites where environmental impact of complex mixtures including biological and chemical tps formed during wastewater treatment is of concern the nontarget analysis may provide additional information on the wastewater composition since it targets a high number of chemicals that are difficult to capture with target analysis based on the comparison of the nontarget and the target analysis in this study it also appears possible to focus the nontarget analysis towards organic micropollutants without knowing their identity nevertheless considering the behavior of micropollutants features is only one part for evaluation of the environmental impact and i e ecotoxicological evaluations are equally important nontarget analysis is a suitable tool for the evaluation of wastewater treatment processes the outcomes of this work highlights the complementary information which can be received from nontarget analysis compared to standard operating parameters or target analysis therefore the possibilities of lc hrms for the process monitoring

18581,oil contaminated wastewaters are generally treated by a combination of physico chemical and biological methods interest in the anaerobic treatment of oily wastewaters has increased since it complements aerobic treatment and produces energy in the form of methane the objectives of this study were to characterise the anaerobic process spontaneously occurring in a full scale storage tank at a facility treating waste oil and oil contaminated effluents and to evaluate the applicability of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr and an anaerobic contact reactor acr for treating the oil contaminated wastewater feeding the storage tank three lab scale reactors were operated in parallel over 465 days one mesophilic and one thermophilic anmbbr and one thermophilic acr the wastewater had a high strength with an average chemical oxygen demand cod of 36 g l with a soluble fraction of 80 the bod7 cod ratios varied between 0 1 and 0 5 indicating low aerobic degradability however biomethane potential tests indicated some level of anaerobic degradability with methane yields between 150 and 200 nml gcod the full scale storage tank operated at low organic loading rates 0 35 0 43 kgcod m3d and long hydraulic retention times hrt 83 104 d in comparison the anmbbrs achieved similar cod reductions 60 as the full scale tank but at a much shorter hrt of 30 d similar efficiency could only be reached at longer hrts 43 d in the acr due to low biomass levels resulting from poor sludge settleability the methane yield was higher 210 nmlch4 cod removed in the anmbbr operated at 37 c compared to the other reactors working at 50 c 180 nmlch4 cod removed this reactor also maintained a higher cod removal 67 at an increased olr of 1 1 kgcod m3d than the anmbbr at 50 c the microbial composition of the biomass from the full scale tank and the laboratory reactors provided evidence for the conversion of oil contaminated wastewater into methane with a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic mbbr contact reactor oily wastewater toxic compound thermophilic biogas 1 introduction wastewaters contaminated with crude oil petroleum are associated with the petro chemical industry with activities in petroleum extraction transportation and refining natural gas processing production of liquid fuels motor oils and lubricants and handling and storage of petroleum based derivatives wastes and residues demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 petroleum or oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and phenols ahdamun et al 2009 crude oil contaminated or oily wastewaters are toxic and they may present varied characteristics and compositions depending on their origin the oil fraction in water can be composed of fats hydrocarbons and petroleum fractions diesel oil gasoline and kerosene jamaly et al 2015 oily contaminants may comprise floating emulsified e g pahs and heavier alkyl phenols and dissolved e g aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with low molecular weight oil compounds some levels of extra heavy oil suspended solids e g asphaltenes waxes and microorganisms and a broad spectrum of organic and inorganic compounds demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 precise estimates of oil contaminated wastewaters may be rare but the production and handling of petroleum oils generate million tons of hazardous waste worldwide unep 2012 for example 5 09 mtons of hazardous oil wastes were generated in the european union in 2014 eurostat 2017 wastewaters from petroleum refineries have been estimated to be above 5 mm3 d 30 million barrels per day worldwide diya uddeen et al 2011 one swedish example where wastewaters contaminated with oil and toxic chemicals are treated is the oil recovery facility of stena recycling ab halmstad sweden this facility produces converted heating and lubrication oils from waste oil oil emulsions oily sludge and oil contaminated wastewaters the wastewater streams generated in the facility are treated chemically and biologically the biological treatment process includes an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr an activated sludge process followed by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes and activated carbon adsorption filtration section 1 supplementary material upstream the aerobic biological treatment the spontaneous production of biogas was discovered in a tank storing the oil contaminated effluents although the storage tank had not been optimised for biogas production with associated risks of green house gas emissions the methane produced is currently utilised for heat recovery that is used in the oil recovery process on site consequently the question arose of whether an increased production of methane could be achieved in a more efficient anaerobic treatment process that could lead to less energy intensive wastewater treatment and oil recovery it is foreseen that an optimised anaerobic reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod can decrease the aeration requirements for the following aerobic treatment step due to decreased organic loads and generate stably methane to be used as renewable energy in the oil recovery process oil contaminated wastewaters are generally treated by a combination of physico chemical and biological methods as reviewed elsewhere demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 yu et al 2017 diya uddeen et al 2011 generally a treatment process for oily wastewaters comprise pre treatment stages for the separation of oil and suspended solids followed by a more advanced treatment that can include chemical or biological oxidation solids particle separation and adsorption diya uddeen et al 2011 ahmadun et al 2009 physico chemical methods have been historically preferred for the treatment of wastewaters from oil and gas production likely due to their small footprint and operational simplicity despite their high capital costs and production of hazardous side streams camarillo and stringfellow 2018 however the role of biological methods for treating oily wastewater is being reconsidered under more stringent environmental regulations and resource recovery opportunities camarillo and stringfellow 2018 biological methods are applied in the advanced treatment of oily wastewaters for removing the biodegradable fraction of the dissolved or soluble cod no complete cod degradation is achieved by biological methods alone due to the presence of refractory or recalcitrant compounds notwithstanding that both aerobic and anaerobic processes have been tested and applied for oily wastewater treatment aerobic processes with biomass in suspension or as biofilms have been preferentially used ahdamdun et al 2009 camarillo and stringfellow 2018 aerobic processes for the treatment of oil contaminated wastewater include activated sludge in different configurations classic sequencing batch reactors completely stirred tank reactors cstr and with membrane based solid separation biological aerated filters rotating biological contactors fluidised bed reactors moving bed bioreactors mbbrs lagoons and wetlands interest in the utilization of anaerobic processes for the treatment of oily wastewaters has recently increased table 1 due likely to advantages of anaerobic systems complementing aerobic ones in comparison to aerobic processes that oxidise organic matter into co2 with the use of oxygen as electron acceptor anaerobic processes mainly reduce organic matter into methane which is an energy carrier or fuel with a potential for electricity heat generation anaerobic processes provide for an opportunity for energy recovery in tandem with cod removal beside energy generation using an anaerobic treatment step prior to the aerobic one will save additional energy due to the reduced organic load entering into the following aerobic treatment step and hence reducing the need of aeration if applied as a pretreatment anaerobic processes can be used for hydrolysing and fermenting organic matter before further biological treatment camarillo and stringfellow 2018 furthermore anaerobic processes have the potential to improve the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds lu et al 2013 and to decrease aeration requirements and biomass production due to the prevailing anaerobic conditions and lower biomass yields respectively anaerobic biofilm reactors with biomass as granules upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor or attached to carriers packed bed reactor mbbr have been favoured for evaluating the treatability of oil contaminated wastewaters as from petroleum refinery effluents table 1 compared to reactors with flocculent biomass in suspension biofilm systems allow for i higher biomass concentrations in a continuously operated reactor that leads to higher specific reaction rates ii enhanced sorption and entrapment capabilities of contaminants in the biomass wang et al 2016 and iii some resistance to loading and or toxic shocks lu et al 2013 in this study we faced the question of whether the oil contaminated wastewater from stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility could be treated more efficiently in a compact anaerobic system that could also provide stable biogas production and be adapted and implemented easily at the plant location an anaerobic mbbr anmbbr is a biofilm reactor in which biomass growth occurs upon free floating carrier media that are mechanically mixed and kept in the reactor by means of sieves the principles and main features of aerobic and anoxic mbbr processes have been reviewed elsewhere bassin and dezotti 2018 mcquarrie and boltz 2011 an anmbbr is not sensitive to high levels of solids in the influent and can be implemented at a wide range of volumetric scales without the need of water recirculation although requiring carrier media for biofilm development an anmbbr could be applicable to the treatment of wastewaters containing toxic and difficult to degrade compounds that may challenge the operation of high rate anaerobic reactors therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a compact anmbbr for the anaerobic treatment of stena recycling ab s oil contaminated wastewater with the specific objectives of removing cod and producing methane and of comparing the performance of the anmbbr against that of the full scale storage tank at the oil recovery plant and of an anaerobic contact reactor acr that could also be easily implemented on site the study was developed under the hypothesis that the efficiency of the anaerobic process occurring in the full scale storage tank could be improved by using a more compact anmbbr or an acr at higher loads this work adds to the still limited number of studies originating mainly from china and the usa that report the applicability of anaerobic biological treatment to oily wastewaters camarillo and stringfellow 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall approach this study comprised two parts 1 the characterisation of the anaerobic digestion process occurring in the full scale storage tank at stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility and 2 the operation of three lab scale anaerobic reactors treating the oil contaminated effluent feeding the storage tank the results of the evaluation of the full scale process were used for specifying the operating conditions of the lab scale reactors and as benchmark for comparing their performance efficiency overall three lab scale reactors were operated for a total of 456 days two anoxthane anmbbrs and one acr first two anoxthane anmbbrs were started up based on two different inoculation approaches and operated in parallel under mesophilic conditions 37 c for 156 days later one anmbbr at 37 c one anmbbr at 50 c and one acr at 50 c were operated in parallel for 300 days the initial start up and operation of the anmbbrs at 37 c considered that the full scale storage tank operated at this temperature which was shown to be 50 c after the assessment 2 2 evaluation of the spontaneous anaerobic process in the full scale storage tank the full scale storage tank evaluated at stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility halmstad sweden has a volume of 20 000 m3 and it is not mechanically mixed the storage tank receives oil contaminated effluents from the oil recovery process other oily wastewaters and water contaminated with other types of chemicals the feeding mode varies between continuous and batch but the influent flow to the tank is estimated to be between 8 and 10 m3 h the evaluation of the tank s anaerobic process was based on the characterisation of weekly composite samples of the water influent and effluent during 19 months january 2016 to july 2017 gas was sampled at three occasions and biomass at six occasions during this period daily influent and effluent samples 1 l d were collected during a week 7 days and mixed together in a weekly composite sample the weekly composite samples aimed to cover the variations in different batches of process waters being fed into the storage tank the influent effluent composite samples were characterised for ph conductivity total and soluble cod cod and codsol total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc biochemical oxygen demand bod7 total and soluble total nitrogen tn and tnsol orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 p ammonium n nh4 n hydrocarbons hydrocarbon oil index hoi and phenols influent and effluent grab samples for volatile fatty acids vfas analysis were taken once per week were filtered and either sent immediately for external analysis or frozen until analysis gas samples 0 5 l were collected in triplicates at four occasions from the headspace of the storage tank these samples were analysed for methane composition on site using a glass einhorn s saccharometer filled with a sodium hydroxide solution as follows a gas sample of 5 ml was injected rising to the top of the closed tube and forcing the level of liquid down since the co2 was captured in the solution the volume of biomethane in the biogas sample corresponding to the change in the level of the liquid could be directly measured biogas samples 0 5 1 l from three further occasions were taken in tedlar bags and sent to an external laboratory for analysis influent and effluent grab samples were tested once during the evaluation period for aerobic biological degradability and aerobic inhibition of respiration the anaerobic biodegradability and biogas production potential of the influent water was assessed based on biomethane potential bmp tests bmp tests were also used to evaluate the microbial activity of the biomass from the storage tank in comparison to that of mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic biomass from anaerobic digesters treating municipal waste activated sludge biomass samples 2 10 l were collected from the storage tank at several occasions sedimented sludge from the bottom of the tank february 9 may 17 june 22 2016 and suspended sludge from the top of the reactor or from the tank s effluent march 8 2016 february 22 and march 1 2017 2 3 start up and operation of two lab scale anmbbrs under mesophilic conditions initially two anmbbrs were started up in parallel at 37 c each anmbbr consisted of a glass reactor with double walls holding a water jacket connected to a recirculating temperature controlled water bath fig 1 the anmbbrs were gas tight with top mounted mechanical 4 blade mixers 20 50 hz and were each connected to a wastewater feeding pump watson marlow 520s and a gas flowmeter μflow bioprocess control sweden wastewater was kept under refrigeration 4 8 c and continuously fed the effluent from the anmbbr was discharged by overflow into a water trap in order to keep the system gastight one reactor with an operating volume of 3 85 l cleancarrierr1 was filled with clean anoxk 5 carriers at a filling degree of 50 volume the second reactor with an operating volume of 3 6 l inoccarrierr2 was filled with clean anoxk 5 carriers at 30 volume filling degree and anoxk 5 carriers seeded with an anaerobic biofilm at 20 volume filling degree the inoculated anoxk 5 carriers originated from a pilot scale anmbbr that operated at 12 c treating municipal wastewater the anoxk 5 carriers are made of high density polyethylene and have a specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 for start up the reactors were filled with tap water and the carriers were placed in the reactors both reactors were inoculated by frequently adding a sludge mixture composed of sedimented sludge from the bottom of the full scale stena storage tank and anaerobic sludge from a municipal mesophilic 37 c digester treating primary and excess waste activated sludge källby wwtp vasyd lund sweden the composition was made so that each sludge contributed with 50 to the total vs of the sludge mixture the sludge mixture was added daily 400 g d from monday to friday during one month the wastewater fed into the reactors corresponded to weekly composite samples of the influent to the full scale storage tank from 4 weeks in july august 2016 the reactors were started up and operated for 156 days at a target organic loading rate olr of 0 6 kgcodsol m3d during the first 110 days the wastewater feed was diluted to about 10 000 mgcodsol l with tap water and afterwards to about 20 000 mgcodsol l until day 191 when a raw batch of wastewater was used see section 2 4 wastewater dilution helped target constant olrs at desired hrts and after day 110 it also helped homogenised cod levels from variations in the batches of raw wastewater used on day 63 after the ph in the reactors dropped to 6 2 and 6 5 respectively nahco3 was added to maintain an alkalinity of about 3000 mgcaco3 l and a ph above 7 in the reactors throughout the entire experimental period trace elements were added to the wastewater feed via a trace elements solution one ml l feed section 2 supplementary material n and p were not added to the wastewater feed due to nutrient availability in excess based on effluent measurements on n 15 167 41 and 165 43 mgnh4 n l and 27 6 and 27 5 mgpo4 3 p l in cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively samples from the influent and the contents of the reactors 100 ml syringe were analysed regularly for ph alkalinity codsol vfas nh4 n po4 3 p total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss furthermore biogas samples were also taken regularly and analysed for ch4 and co2 2 4 comparative operation of two lab scale anmbbrs and one lab scale acr two lab scale anmbbrs and one lab scale acr were tested for the treatment of oily wastewater in parallel during 300 days the two anmbbr systems used were the same ones described above fig 1 and operated initially at 37 c for 156 days the acr consisted of a cstr working volume of 4 6 l connected to a conical settler from which the settled biomass at the bottom was recirculated to the cstr fig 1 before starting up the anmbbrs the available anox k 5 carriers from both reactors from the initial 156 days of operation at 37 c were combined and then divided equally between the two reactors with a resulting filling degree of 50 volume each then the reactors were filled with tap water and were started up at 37 c the temperature in one anmbbr was maintained at 37 c during the 300 days of operation anmbbr37 3 85 l while the temperature in the other anmbbr anmbbr50 3 60 l was gradually increased from 37 to 50 c during a six week period starting on day 113 the anmbbr50 was thereafter from day 149 operated at 50 c for 187 days the acr was started up 68 days later than the anmbbrs and it was inoculated with thermophilic 55 c sludge from a municipal digester treating primary and excess waste activated sludge kävlinge wwtp kävlinge sweden the acr was operated at 50 c acr50 acr50 was re inoculated with more digester sludge on day 125 settled sludge was initially recirculated with a pump and later manually due to tubing clogging from day 188 100 ml week weekly composite samples of the influent to the full scale storage tank 16 weeks in 2016 and 3 weeks in 2017 were used as feed to the reactors and the wastewater was diluted to about 20 000 mgcodsol l however from day 191 a single large batch of undiluted influent wastewater was used for the rest of the operation period the codsol of the diluted day 110 191 and undiluted 191 300 wastewater averaged 22 gcodsol l table 2 the use of this single batch of wastewater ensured that the performance of the three reactors was assessed without influences of variations of the sources of wastewater at stena recycling ab the wastewater feed was stored under refrigeration 5 8 c and pumped continuously to the reactors fig 1 from day one nahco3 was added to the wastewater feed 2 g l to regulate the ph in the reactors close to neutrality thereafter the nahco3 concentration was decreased successively until no addition day 156 due to decreasing alkalinity in the reactors day 191 nahco3 continued to be added at a lower concentration of 0 5 g l in the feed even after day 191 in the single wastewater batch trace elements were added to the feed in the same way as for the two anmbbrs operated at 37 c section 2 3 n and p were not added to the wastewater feed since effluent levels indicated nutrient availability in excess anmbbr37 was started up and operated with an average olr of 0 8 0 2 kgcod m3d for 238 days after day 238 anmbbr37 was operated with an average olr of 1 1 0 2 kgcod m3d anmbbr50 was started up and operated with an average olr of 0 9 0 2 kgcod m3d for 252 days and afterwards with a lower average olr of 0 7 0 1 kgcod m3d acr50 was operated with an average olr of 0 6 0 1 kgcod m3d since startup the same sampling approach and analyses described for the operation of the anmbbrs at 37 c above section 2 3 were performed here in addition influent and effluent analyses for total cod and phenols were conducted at the end of the operation day 300 the biofilm biomass on the carriers was quantified as ts vs the settleability of the biomass from acr50 at the end of the operation period was tested by following the interface sludge clarified water in a 1 l graduated cylinder for 1 h 2 5

biomass samples from the reactors and biomass samples from the carriers taken on day 300 were analysed all the samples were kept frozen at 20 c before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the oil contaminated wastewater the influent wastewater to the full scale storage tank table 2 presented a high strength with average cod contents of 36 g l and was characterised by a high fraction of dissolved components and organics 80 codsol of cod and 89 doc of toc wastewater contents variations were related to daily variations in the incoming oil contaminated waste streams treated at the plant the ph of the wastewater was relatively constant around 6 6 the specific composition of the wastewater cod was not determined however around 15 of it was vfas and the rest likely corresponded to other hydrocarbons as suggested by the levels of hoi and aliphatics and aromatics measured table 2 and fig 2c vfas can be directly utilised for methane production in the tank and their concentrations ranged between 2 and 8 gcod l with an average of 5 2 2 2 gcod l table 2 the hoi measures compounds that are extractable into an apolar hydrocarbon solvent hoffmann et al 2006 a ratio of cod n p of 1000 23 1 400 9 0 5 was calculated based on the tn and po4 3 p levels in the wastewater table 2 cod n p ratios necessary for adequate anaerobic wastewater treatment or anaerobic digestion have been suggested to be 300 5 1 400 6 7 0 75 he 1998 and 400 7 1 or 1000 7 1 for high and low olrs respectively pohland 1992 based on a comparison of these ratios and given the low olr in the storage tank the wastewater contained enough nutrients for the establishment of a spontaneous anaerobic digestion process in the tank the bod7 cod ratios of the oil contaminated wastewater were variable between 0 1 and 0 5 fig 2 a which corresponds to a wastewater with low aerobic biodegradability wastewaters with a bod7 cod ratio below 0 43 are considered difficult to be treated by biological processes svenskt vatten 2012 in terms of anaerobic biodegradability the bmp tests indicated that this oil contaminated wastewater was degradable to a certain extent a methane yield of 150 200 nml gcod was obtained when using anaerobic sludge from mesophilic or thermophilic municipal digesters which corresponds to 40 60 of the theoretical yield of 350 nml gcod data not shown 3 2 anaerobic process occurring in the storage tank the full scale storage tank hosted a thermophilic anaerobic process operating at about 50 c without mixing the flow rate into the tank varied between 190 and 240 m3 d with associated long hydraulic retention times hrts and low olrs table 2 the codsol reduction in the tank was between 50 and 80 during the assessment period fig 2b the variations in cod removal over time were likely a consequence of the changing characteristics of the influent wastewater and the lack of stable performance due to lack of mixing the lack of stirring in the tank may have led to unevenly distributed biomass hence microorganisms might have had different substrate availabilities both in terms of amounts and types of substrates depending on their location in the tank the bod7 cod in the effluent from the tank was lower than in the influent wastewater fig 2a indicating that some removal of biodegradable compounds occurred in the tank nevertheless in some instances the influent compounds could not be utilised effectively by the microorganisms since the bod7 cod ratios of the influent and effluent were similar the different groups of hydrocarbons were degraded to varying degrees depending on their chemical structure based on the analyses of the influent and effluent fig 2c the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with 12 or less carbons were removed to a larger extent 50 74 removal for aliphatics c12 28 79 for aromatics c10 than aliphatics and aromatics with more than 12 carbons 8 10 removal for aliphatics c12 0 3 for aromatics c10 the anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons has been coupled to sulphate reducing or denitrifying conditions holliger and zehnder 1996 rabus et al 2016 denitrifying bacteria have been reported to degrade alkanes with up to 20 carbons holliger and zehnder 1996 in biomass samples from the tank the genus paracoccus was among the five most abundant genera of bacteria identified section 3 5 paracoccus species are known to utilise nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxides as electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions midas database macilroy et al 2017 the degradation of aromatics is more complex since these first have to be transformed into central intermediates that will be subsequently reductively attacked and cleaved by hydrolysis to be able to enter central metabolic pathways holliger and zehnder 1996 in the storage tank the amount of phenols appeared to remain unchanged however the levels of phenols were below 100 mg l these levels of phenols are very low in comparison to the soluble cod levels of around 30 g l in the tank table 2 the average vfa levels in the effluent of the tank were as expected lower than in the influent the concentration of propionic acid increased slightly towards the end of the evaluation period data not shown but it never exceeded 800 mg propionic acid l i e it remained below what could be considered toxic levels to methanogens the accumulation of propionic acid is indicative of instability in anaerobic digestion and for example concentrations higher than 3000 mg propionate l have been reported to affect negatively the activity of methanogens li et al 2012 the gas production rate from the full scale storage tank could not be measured continuously nevertheless four gas samples taken from the gas outlet showed that the methane content in the produced gas was between 65 and 70 3 3 start up and operation of two laboratory scale anmbbrs under mesophilic conditions the start up of the two mesophilic anmbbrs cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 involved the repeated addition during one month of a mixture of biomass from a mesophilic anaerobic digester and biomass collected from the full scale storage tank this regular inoculation aimed at facilitating the attachment of anaerobic biomass to the carriers the addition of not only biomass from the storage tank but also from a digester was deemed necessary based on bmp test results indicating that the collected biomass from the storage tank was less active in converting cod from the oil contaminated wastewater into methane compared to the digester biomass data not shown the first 86 days of operation were used to troubleshoot the experimental setup and promote inoculation of the carriers this period was thus characterised by variations in hrt and olr fig 3 with instances of relatively low flow rates and hrts 30 d data not shown the dilution effect of the initial volume of tap water in the reactors and the characteristics of the added anaerobic biomass dominated the effluent characteristics during the first 65 days fig 3 the reactors were started up without extra alkalinity addition and the ph remained between 6 5 and 7 4 during the first 56 days however after biomass addition was stopped day 30 and the alkalinity in the reactors was washed out or consumed a sharp decrease in ph to 6 2 on day 63 forced the addition of sodium bicarbonate in the feed for the rest of the operation of the reactors to buffer ph values close to neutrality 7 1 7 6 after day 86 a more controlled hrt operation ensued fig 3 17 7 d n 27 and 13 6 d n 26 during days 86 117 and hrt 30 1 d n 15 and 27 1 d n 12 during days 118 156 for cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively this ensured relatively more constant olrs until day 156 cleancarrierr1 olr 0 57 0 10 kgcodsol m3d n 42 and inoccarrierr2 olr 0 61 0 14 kgcodsol m3d n 39 inoculation favoured the anaerobiosis in the reactors and already on day 30 when biomass addition was stopped a codsol removal of about 30 was measured in both reactors up until day 119 the codsol removal ranged within 30 and 54 fig 3 on day 119 the hrt was increased and the wastewater cod levels were almost doubled to maintain a similar olr and thereafter codsol removals of up to 70 were achieved in both reactors the vfa levels as ch3cooh equivalents in both reactors decreased from 1500 mg l days 86 95 to 500 1000 mg l for the rest of the operating period despite an increase in the incoming wastewater s vfa concentrations from 500 to 1000 to 2000 3000 mg l day 119 due to wastewater batch variations biogas production with average 80 ch4 increased over time more significantly after day 86 reaching methane yields per codsol removed of about 270 nmlch4 gcodsol and 230 nmlch4 gcodsol in cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively during the last 20 days although inoccarrierr2 was started up with a 20 filling degree of carriers seeded with an anaerobic biofilm no difference in performance was observed between the two anmbbrs this similarity in performance suggested that the seeded carriers used in inoccarrierr2 may have played a lesser role than the continuous addition of anaerobic biomass as inoculum in establishing a biofilm on the carriers the experience gained with this specific oil contaminated wastewater suggests that an estimated startup time could be optimised to be within one or two months targeting hrts of 30d and olrs of 0 6 kgcodsol m3d under mesophilic conditions the start up approach of an anmbbr process will be strongly dependent on the ability to colonise the carriers with anaerobic biofilm in association with the biodegradability of the wastewater 3 4 comparative performance of laboratory scale anmbbrs acr and of the full scale process the startup and initial operation of both anmbbrs at 37 c with a target hrt of around 30d determined the slow increase in effluent levels of codsol fig 4 nh4 n po4 3 p phenols and caco3 alkalinity since carriers with developed biofilm from the previous operation of the anmbbrs cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 were put in tap water and wastewater was fed into the reactors data not shown the temperature was increased gradually in one of these anmbbrs up to 50 c anmbbr50 after confirming that the temperature in the full scale storage tank was thermophilic and not mesophilic as initially believed the acr at 50 c arc50 was only started up on day 68 with a target hrt of around 40d fig 4 due to delays in its manufacturing therefore the data reported and analysed here correspond to the period of parallel operation from day 111 300 when the reactors were operational at the target temperatures table 2 both anmbbrs performed similarly in terms of cod removal since startup at 37 c and even during the increase in temperature in anmbbr50 from 37 to 50 c from day 113 149 fig 4 nevertheless the anmbbr50 displayed more sensitivity to increases in influent cod levels fig 4 with increases 1000 mgcod l in the anmbbr50 than anmbbr37 with increases 200 mgcod l in the reactor with also higher associated vfa levels consequently whereas the olr was increased in anmbbr37 from 0 8 to 1 1 kgcod m3d day 238 the olr was decreased in anmmbr50 from 0 9 to 0 7 kgcod m3d day 253 table 2 the decrease in olr in anmbbr50 was deemed necessary to operate the reactor more stably the mesophilic anmbbr37 operated more stably and was able to maintain a higher cod removal at increased olrs than the thermophilic anmbbr50 fig 4 and table 2 the codsol removals were higher at 37 c 67 than at 50 c 58 table 2 this difference in performance could be explained by differences in microbial communities resulting from the different temperatures in the anmbbrs section 3 5 however the specific microbial community composition in anmbbr50 determining its performance may have been influenced by the development of the thermophilic biofilm from an original mesophilic biofilm at 37 c and by the operation of the anmbbr50 at 50 c for 147d in contrast anmbbr37 was started up with biofilm carriers already acclimated at 37 c and was operated for a longer period at this constant temperature table 2 although the maximum manageable olr by the anmbbr at 37 c was not determined in this study an increase in olr from 0 6 during the initial startup to 0 8 and then to 1 1 kgcod m3d was feasible higher olrs at 37 c may be feasible with this wastewater both thermophilic acr50 and anmbbr50 operated with similar codsol reductions fig 4 and table 2 however acr50 operated with a lower olr of around 0 6 kgcod m3d and longer hrt the load in acr50 could not be increased due to poor biomass settleability which forced the biomass levels in the reactor to be between 1 5 and 3 0 gvss l without reaching the target of 5 gvss l in contrast to anmbbr50 acr50 was inoculated with thermophilic 55 c sludge from a full scale municipal digester which was shown to degrade the oil contaminated wastewater nevertheless the initial thermophilic biomass did not appear to have given any advantage to the contact reactor over the mbbr furthermore the inoculation biomass contained fibres that remained in the system and masked the measurement of actual microbial biomass as vss in the reactor the poor sludge settleability in the acr50 made it impossible to quantify total cod removals in this reactor the ph in the three laboratory scale reactors was close to neutral i e between 6 9 and 7 5 table 2 the methane content of the biogas from the three reactors was close to 80 and similar among the reactors which could have been influenced by a high solubility of co2 in water nevertheless the cod conversion to methane based on the measured methane yields per cod removed table 2 was higher at 37 c 60 than at 50 c 52 the anmbbrs were able to handle double to triple the olrs at lower hrts than the full scale tank with similar cod removals table 2 these results point to the opportunity to decrease the size of the full scale tank if to operate it as an anmbbr maintaining biogas production and cod removals although direct comparisons with other oil contaminated wastewaters may be challenging due to the variety of types of oily wastewaters the cod removal of 62 at an olr of 1 1 kgcod m3d achieved here is higher or within the range reported elsewhere with other types of reactors or even an anmbbr lu et al 2013 under mesophilic conditions for oily wastewater table 1 the current study further indicated the advantage of retaining active biomass by growing a biofilm on carriers in an anmbbr rather than relying on biomass settle ability in an acr which in this case was unachievable the cod removal up to 62 measured in the lab scale reactors agreed with the maximum conversion yield of 60 of the theoretical value of 350 nmlch4 gcod obtained in the bmp tests when using the oil contaminated wastewater as substrate 3 5 microbial biomass and community analysis in the reactors and storage tank the bacterial and archaeal communities in the sedimented and suspended biomass from the full scale storage tank six samples from feb march may june 2016 and march 2017 were similar the most abundant operational taxonomic units otus of bacteria were the genera of anaerobaculum and aquamicrobium accounting both for 39 up to 74 of otu relative abundance in all the samples followed by syntrophaceticus coprothermobacter and paracoccus these five genera comprised 44 90 of the bacterial otu relative abundance thermovirga and tepidanaerobacter were also detected in sedimented and suspended biomass respectively with about 5 abundance the most abundant archaeal genus in the biomass samples was methanosphaera 39 58 followed by methanobrevibacter and otus from the methanobacteriaceae family these five archaeal genera comprised 82 98 of the relative abundance of the archaeal otus the bacterial communities in the biofilm and suspended biomass from the laboratory scale reactors at the end of the operation period displayed some differences in otu relative abundance but were consistently dominated by five bacterial otus from the genera anaerobaculum coprothermobacter tepidiphilus and syntrophaceticus and tepidanaerobacter these genera comprised 66 89 of the otu relative abundance in all samples disregarding the type of biomass and temperature anaerobaculum was consistently abundant in biomass samples at 37 and 50 c in contrast different archaeal otus were the most abundant in the biomass samples the genera of methanosphaera methanosaeta methanothermobacter and a methanomicrobiales otu presented relative abundances higher than 37 each the acr50 unsettleable biomass presented a high methanosaeta abundance 74 5 methanosaeta was also present in the anmbbr37 biofilm 13 2 methanothermobacter was only present 44 8 in the anmbbr50 biofilm along with methanosarcina 23 8 methanobrevibacter appeared in all the samples with a relative abundance of 4 8 the different archaeal communities in both reactors at 50 c could have been determined by the different sources of biomass inocula thermophilic ad biomass for acr50 and mesophilic biofilm at 37 c for anmbbr50 evidence for the conversion of the oil contaminated wastewater into methane was also provided by the microbial composition of the biomass both biomass samples from the full scale tank and the laboratory reactors were abundant in moderate thermophilic acetogenic fermenting bacterial genera anaerobaculum coprothermobacter syntrophaceticus and thermovirga which are able to ferment organic acids peptides amino acids and some sugars alcohols producing hydrogen and co2 midas database macilroy et al 2017 species of coprothermobacter and syntrophaceticus are found in thermophilic digesters or anaerobic reactors and grow in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic methanogens the storage tank biomass also contained aquamicrobium and paracoccus denitrifiers able to use nitrates nitrites or nitrous oxides as electron acceptors and utilise carbohydrates organic fatty acids heterocyclic aromatics alcohols as carbon sources which were compounds found in the oil contaminated wastewater in terms of archaeal composition all the biomass samples had a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens from the methanobacteriales order such as methanosphaera miller 2015 methanobrevibacter and methanothermibacter midas database macilroy et al 2017 in contrast to the storage tank and anmbbr37 biomass acetoclastic methanosaeta and the metabolically versatile methanosarcina methanogens from the methanosarcinales order were only present in the biomass at 50 c 4 conclusions the anaerobic treatment of the oil contaminated wastewater entering the full scale storage tank was efficiently performed by a biofilm based reactor namely the anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr the anmbbr was able to handle double to triple the organic loading rates at lower hydraulic loads than the full scale tank with similar cod removals therefore the anaerobic process in the full scale storage tank can be conducted in a more compact volume although both mesophilic 37 c and thermophilic 50 c anaerobic treatment of the oil contaminated wastewater were feasible the anmbbr at 37 c displayed relatively higher treatment capacity the results from this study indicate the potential applicability of anmbbrs for the treatment of wastewaters containing oil derivatives

18581,oil contaminated wastewaters are generally treated by a combination of physico chemical and biological methods interest in the anaerobic treatment of oily wastewaters has increased since it complements aerobic treatment and produces energy in the form of methane the objectives of this study were to characterise the anaerobic process spontaneously occurring in a full scale storage tank at a facility treating waste oil and oil contaminated effluents and to evaluate the applicability of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr and an anaerobic contact reactor acr for treating the oil contaminated wastewater feeding the storage tank three lab scale reactors were operated in parallel over 465 days one mesophilic and one thermophilic anmbbr and one thermophilic acr the wastewater had a high strength with an average chemical oxygen demand cod of 36 g l with a soluble fraction of 80 the bod7 cod ratios varied between 0 1 and 0 5 indicating low aerobic degradability however biomethane potential tests indicated some level of anaerobic degradability with methane yields between 150 and 200 nml gcod the full scale storage tank operated at low organic loading rates 0 35 0 43 kgcod m3d and long hydraulic retention times hrt 83 104 d in comparison the anmbbrs achieved similar cod reductions 60 as the full scale tank but at a much shorter hrt of 30 d similar efficiency could only be reached at longer hrts 43 d in the acr due to low biomass levels resulting from poor sludge settleability the methane yield was higher 210 nmlch4 cod removed in the anmbbr operated at 37 c compared to the other reactors working at 50 c 180 nmlch4 cod removed this reactor also maintained a higher cod removal 67 at an increased olr of 1 1 kgcod m3d than the anmbbr at 50 c the microbial composition of the biomass from the full scale tank and the laboratory reactors provided evidence for the conversion of oil contaminated wastewater into methane with a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic mbbr contact reactor oily wastewater toxic compound thermophilic biogas 1 introduction wastewaters contaminated with crude oil petroleum are associated with the petro chemical industry with activities in petroleum extraction transportation and refining natural gas processing production of liquid fuels motor oils and lubricants and handling and storage of petroleum based derivatives wastes and residues demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 petroleum or oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and phenols ahdamun et al 2009 crude oil contaminated or oily wastewaters are toxic and they may present varied characteristics and compositions depending on their origin the oil fraction in water can be composed of fats hydrocarbons and petroleum fractions diesel oil gasoline and kerosene jamaly et al 2015 oily contaminants may comprise floating emulsified e g pahs and heavier alkyl phenols and dissolved e g aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with low molecular weight oil compounds some levels of extra heavy oil suspended solids e g asphaltenes waxes and microorganisms and a broad spectrum of organic and inorganic compounds demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 precise estimates of oil contaminated wastewaters may be rare but the production and handling of petroleum oils generate million tons of hazardous waste worldwide unep 2012 for example 5 09 mtons of hazardous oil wastes were generated in the european union in 2014 eurostat 2017 wastewaters from petroleum refineries have been estimated to be above 5 mm3 d 30 million barrels per day worldwide diya uddeen et al 2011 one swedish example where wastewaters contaminated with oil and toxic chemicals are treated is the oil recovery facility of stena recycling ab halmstad sweden this facility produces converted heating and lubrication oils from waste oil oil emulsions oily sludge and oil contaminated wastewaters the wastewater streams generated in the facility are treated chemically and biologically the biological treatment process includes an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr an activated sludge process followed by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes and activated carbon adsorption filtration section 1 supplementary material upstream the aerobic biological treatment the spontaneous production of biogas was discovered in a tank storing the oil contaminated effluents although the storage tank had not been optimised for biogas production with associated risks of green house gas emissions the methane produced is currently utilised for heat recovery that is used in the oil recovery process on site consequently the question arose of whether an increased production of methane could be achieved in a more efficient anaerobic treatment process that could lead to less energy intensive wastewater treatment and oil recovery it is foreseen that an optimised anaerobic reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod can decrease the aeration requirements for the following aerobic treatment step due to decreased organic loads and generate stably methane to be used as renewable energy in the oil recovery process oil contaminated wastewaters are generally treated by a combination of physico chemical and biological methods as reviewed elsewhere demirbas et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 yu et al 2017 diya uddeen et al 2011 generally a treatment process for oily wastewaters comprise pre treatment stages for the separation of oil and suspended solids followed by a more advanced treatment that can include chemical or biological oxidation solids particle separation and adsorption diya uddeen et al 2011 ahmadun et al 2009 physico chemical methods have been historically preferred for the treatment of wastewaters from oil and gas production likely due to their small footprint and operational simplicity despite their high capital costs and production of hazardous side streams camarillo and stringfellow 2018 however the role of biological methods for treating oily wastewater is being reconsidered under more stringent environmental regulations and resource recovery opportunities camarillo and stringfellow 2018 biological methods are applied in the advanced treatment of oily wastewaters for removing the biodegradable fraction of the dissolved or soluble cod no complete cod degradation is achieved by biological methods alone due to the presence of refractory or recalcitrant compounds notwithstanding that both aerobic and anaerobic processes have been tested and applied for oily wastewater treatment aerobic processes with biomass in suspension or as biofilms have been preferentially used ahdamdun et al 2009 camarillo and stringfellow 2018 aerobic processes for the treatment of oil contaminated wastewater include activated sludge in different configurations classic sequencing batch reactors completely stirred tank reactors cstr and with membrane based solid separation biological aerated filters rotating biological contactors fluidised bed reactors moving bed bioreactors mbbrs lagoons and wetlands interest in the utilization of anaerobic processes for the treatment of oily wastewaters has recently increased table 1 due likely to advantages of anaerobic systems complementing aerobic ones in comparison to aerobic processes that oxidise organic matter into co2 with the use of oxygen as electron acceptor anaerobic processes mainly reduce organic matter into methane which is an energy carrier or fuel with a potential for electricity heat generation anaerobic processes provide for an opportunity for energy recovery in tandem with cod removal beside energy generation using an anaerobic treatment step prior to the aerobic one will save additional energy due to the reduced organic load entering into the following aerobic treatment step and hence reducing the need of aeration if applied as a pretreatment anaerobic processes can be used for hydrolysing and fermenting organic matter before further biological treatment camarillo and stringfellow 2018 furthermore anaerobic processes have the potential to improve the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds lu et al 2013 and to decrease aeration requirements and biomass production due to the prevailing anaerobic conditions and lower biomass yields respectively anaerobic biofilm reactors with biomass as granules upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor or attached to carriers packed bed reactor mbbr have been favoured for evaluating the treatability of oil contaminated wastewaters as from petroleum refinery effluents table 1 compared to reactors with flocculent biomass in suspension biofilm systems allow for i higher biomass concentrations in a continuously operated reactor that leads to higher specific reaction rates ii enhanced sorption and entrapment capabilities of contaminants in the biomass wang et al 2016 and iii some resistance to loading and or toxic shocks lu et al 2013 in this study we faced the question of whether the oil contaminated wastewater from stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility could be treated more efficiently in a compact anaerobic system that could also provide stable biogas production and be adapted and implemented easily at the plant location an anaerobic mbbr anmbbr is a biofilm reactor in which biomass growth occurs upon free floating carrier media that are mechanically mixed and kept in the reactor by means of sieves the principles and main features of aerobic and anoxic mbbr processes have been reviewed elsewhere bassin and dezotti 2018 mcquarrie and boltz 2011 an anmbbr is not sensitive to high levels of solids in the influent and can be implemented at a wide range of volumetric scales without the need of water recirculation although requiring carrier media for biofilm development an anmbbr could be applicable to the treatment of wastewaters containing toxic and difficult to degrade compounds that may challenge the operation of high rate anaerobic reactors therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a compact anmbbr for the anaerobic treatment of stena recycling ab s oil contaminated wastewater with the specific objectives of removing cod and producing methane and of comparing the performance of the anmbbr against that of the full scale storage tank at the oil recovery plant and of an anaerobic contact reactor acr that could also be easily implemented on site the study was developed under the hypothesis that the efficiency of the anaerobic process occurring in the full scale storage tank could be improved by using a more compact anmbbr or an acr at higher loads this work adds to the still limited number of studies originating mainly from china and the usa that report the applicability of anaerobic biological treatment to oily wastewaters camarillo and stringfellow 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall approach this study comprised two parts 1 the characterisation of the anaerobic digestion process occurring in the full scale storage tank at stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility and 2 the operation of three lab scale anaerobic reactors treating the oil contaminated effluent feeding the storage tank the results of the evaluation of the full scale process were used for specifying the operating conditions of the lab scale reactors and as benchmark for comparing their performance efficiency overall three lab scale reactors were operated for a total of 456 days two anoxthane anmbbrs and one acr first two anoxthane anmbbrs were started up based on two different inoculation approaches and operated in parallel under mesophilic conditions 37 c for 156 days later one anmbbr at 37 c one anmbbr at 50 c and one acr at 50 c were operated in parallel for 300 days the initial start up and operation of the anmbbrs at 37 c considered that the full scale storage tank operated at this temperature which was shown to be 50 c after the assessment 2 2 evaluation of the spontaneous anaerobic process in the full scale storage tank the full scale storage tank evaluated at stena recycling ab s oil recovery facility halmstad sweden has a volume of 20 000 m3 and it is not mechanically mixed the storage tank receives oil contaminated effluents from the oil recovery process other oily wastewaters and water contaminated with other types of chemicals the feeding mode varies between continuous and batch but the influent flow to the tank is estimated to be between 8 and 10 m3 h the evaluation of the tank s anaerobic process was based on the characterisation of weekly composite samples of the water influent and effluent during 19 months january 2016 to july 2017 gas was sampled at three occasions and biomass at six occasions during this period daily influent and effluent samples 1 l d were collected during a week 7 days and mixed together in a weekly composite sample the weekly composite samples aimed to cover the variations in different batches of process waters being fed into the storage tank the influent effluent composite samples were characterised for ph conductivity total and soluble cod cod and codsol total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc biochemical oxygen demand bod7 total and soluble total nitrogen tn and tnsol orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 p ammonium n nh4 n hydrocarbons hydrocarbon oil index hoi and phenols influent and effluent grab samples for volatile fatty acids vfas analysis were taken once per week were filtered and either sent immediately for external analysis or frozen until analysis gas samples 0 5 l were collected in triplicates at four occasions from the headspace of the storage tank these samples were analysed for methane composition on site using a glass einhorn s saccharometer filled with a sodium hydroxide solution as follows a gas sample of 5 ml was injected rising to the top of the closed tube and forcing the level of liquid down since the co2 was captured in the solution the volume of biomethane in the biogas sample corresponding to the change in the level of the liquid could be directly measured biogas samples 0 5 1 l from three further occasions were taken in tedlar bags and sent to an external laboratory for analysis influent and effluent grab samples were tested once during the evaluation period for aerobic biological degradability and aerobic inhibition of respiration the anaerobic biodegradability and biogas production potential of the influent water was assessed based on biomethane potential bmp tests bmp tests were also used to evaluate the microbial activity of the biomass from the storage tank in comparison to that of mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic biomass from anaerobic digesters treating municipal waste activated sludge biomass samples 2 10 l were collected from the storage tank at several occasions sedimented sludge from the bottom of the tank february 9 may 17 june 22 2016 and suspended sludge from the top of the reactor or from the tank s effluent march 8 2016 february 22 and march 1 2017 2 3 start up and operation of two lab scale anmbbrs under mesophilic conditions initially two anmbbrs were started up in parallel at 37 c each anmbbr consisted of a glass reactor with double walls holding a water jacket connected to a recirculating temperature controlled water bath fig 1 the anmbbrs were gas tight with top mounted mechanical 4 blade mixers 20 50 hz and were each connected to a wastewater feeding pump watson marlow 520s and a gas flowmeter μflow bioprocess control sweden wastewater was kept under refrigeration 4 8 c and continuously fed the effluent from the anmbbr was discharged by overflow into a water trap in order to keep the system gastight one reactor with an operating volume of 3 85 l cleancarrierr1 was filled with clean anoxk 5 carriers at a filling degree of 50 volume the second reactor with an operating volume of 3 6 l inoccarrierr2 was filled with clean anoxk 5 carriers at 30 volume filling degree and anoxk 5 carriers seeded with an anaerobic biofilm at 20 volume filling degree the inoculated anoxk 5 carriers originated from a pilot scale anmbbr that operated at 12 c treating municipal wastewater the anoxk 5 carriers are made of high density polyethylene and have a specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 for start up the reactors were filled with tap water and the carriers were placed in the reactors both reactors were inoculated by frequently adding a sludge mixture composed of sedimented sludge from the bottom of the full scale stena storage tank and anaerobic sludge from a municipal mesophilic 37 c digester treating primary and excess waste activated sludge källby wwtp vasyd lund sweden the composition was made so that each sludge contributed with 50 to the total vs of the sludge mixture the sludge mixture was added daily 400 g d from monday to friday during one month the wastewater fed into the reactors corresponded to weekly composite samples of the influent to the full scale storage tank from 4 weeks in july august 2016 the reactors were started up and operated for 156 days at a target organic loading rate olr of 0 6 kgcodsol m3d during the first 110 days the wastewater feed was diluted to about 10 000 mgcodsol l with tap water and afterwards to about 20 000 mgcodsol l until day 191 when a raw batch of wastewater was used see section 2 4 wastewater dilution helped target constant olrs at desired hrts and after day 110 it also helped homogenised cod levels from variations in the batches of raw wastewater used on day 63 after the ph in the reactors dropped to 6 2 and 6 5 respectively nahco3 was added to maintain an alkalinity of about 3000 mgcaco3 l and a ph above 7 in the reactors throughout the entire experimental period trace elements were added to the wastewater feed via a trace elements solution one ml l feed section 2 supplementary material n and p were not added to the wastewater feed due to nutrient availability in excess based on effluent measurements on n 15 167 41 and 165 43 mgnh4 n l and 27 6 and 27 5 mgpo4 3 p l in cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively samples from the influent and the contents of the reactors 100 ml syringe were analysed regularly for ph alkalinity codsol vfas nh4 n po4 3 p total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss furthermore biogas samples were also taken regularly and analysed for ch4 and co2 2 4 comparative operation of two lab scale anmbbrs and one lab scale acr two lab scale anmbbrs and one lab scale acr were tested for the treatment of oily wastewater in parallel during 300 days the two anmbbr systems used were the same ones described above fig 1 and operated initially at 37 c for 156 days the acr consisted of a cstr working volume of 4 6 l connected to a conical settler from which the settled biomass at the bottom was recirculated to the cstr fig 1 before starting up the anmbbrs the available anox k 5 carriers from both reactors from the initial 156 days of operation at 37 c were combined and then divided equally between the two reactors with a resulting filling degree of 50 volume each then the reactors were filled with tap water and were started up at 37 c the temperature in one anmbbr was maintained at 37 c during the 300 days of operation anmbbr37 3 85 l while the temperature in the other anmbbr anmbbr50 3 60 l was gradually increased from 37 to 50 c during a six week period starting on day 113 the anmbbr50 was thereafter from day 149 operated at 50 c for 187 days the acr was started up 68 days later than the anmbbrs and it was inoculated with thermophilic 55 c sludge from a municipal digester treating primary and excess waste activated sludge kävlinge wwtp kävlinge sweden the acr was operated at 50 c acr50 acr50 was re inoculated with more digester sludge on day 125 settled sludge was initially recirculated with a pump and later manually due to tubing clogging from day 188 100 ml week weekly composite samples of the influent to the full scale storage tank 16 weeks in 2016 and 3 weeks in 2017 were used as feed to the reactors and the wastewater was diluted to about 20 000 mgcodsol l however from day 191 a single large batch of undiluted influent wastewater was used for the rest of the operation period the codsol of the diluted day 110 191 and undiluted 191 300 wastewater averaged 22 gcodsol l table 2 the use of this single batch of wastewater ensured that the performance of the three reactors was assessed without influences of variations of the sources of wastewater at stena recycling ab the wastewater feed was stored under refrigeration 5 8 c and pumped continuously to the reactors fig 1 from day one nahco3 was added to the wastewater feed 2 g l to regulate the ph in the reactors close to neutrality thereafter the nahco3 concentration was decreased successively until no addition day 156 due to decreasing alkalinity in the reactors day 191 nahco3 continued to be added at a lower concentration of 0 5 g l in the feed even after day 191 in the single wastewater batch trace elements were added to the feed in the same way as for the two anmbbrs operated at 37 c section 2 3 n and p were not added to the wastewater feed since effluent levels indicated nutrient availability in excess anmbbr37 was started up and operated with an average olr of 0 8 0 2 kgcod m3d for 238 days after day 238 anmbbr37 was operated with an average olr of 1 1 0 2 kgcod m3d anmbbr50 was started up and operated with an average olr of 0 9 0 2 kgcod m3d for 252 days and afterwards with a lower average olr of 0 7 0 1 kgcod m3d acr50 was operated with an average olr of 0 6 0 1 kgcod m3d since startup the same sampling approach and analyses described for the operation of the anmbbrs at 37 c above section 2 3 were performed here in addition influent and effluent analyses for total cod and phenols were conducted at the end of the operation day 300 the biofilm biomass on the carriers was quantified as ts vs the settleability of the biomass from acr50 at the end of the operation period was tested by following the interface sludge clarified water in a 1 l graduated cylinder for 1 h 2 5

characterisation of the oil contaminated wastewater the influent wastewater to the full scale storage tank table 2 presented a high strength with average cod contents of 36 g l and was characterised by a high fraction of dissolved components and organics 80 codsol of cod and 89 doc of toc wastewater contents variations were related to daily variations in the incoming oil contaminated waste streams treated at the plant the ph of the wastewater was relatively constant around 6 6 the specific composition of the wastewater cod was not determined however around 15 of it was vfas and the rest likely corresponded to other hydrocarbons as suggested by the levels of hoi and aliphatics and aromatics measured table 2 and fig 2c vfas can be directly utilised for methane production in the tank and their concentrations ranged between 2 and 8 gcod l with an average of 5 2 2 2 gcod l table 2 the hoi measures compounds that are extractable into an apolar hydrocarbon solvent hoffmann et al 2006 a ratio of cod n p of 1000 23 1 400 9 0 5 was calculated based on the tn and po4 3 p levels in the wastewater table 2 cod n p ratios necessary for adequate anaerobic wastewater treatment or anaerobic digestion have been suggested to be 300 5 1 400 6 7 0 75 he 1998 and 400 7 1 or 1000 7 1 for high and low olrs respectively pohland 1992 based on a comparison of these ratios and given the low olr in the storage tank the wastewater contained enough nutrients for the establishment of a spontaneous anaerobic digestion process in the tank the bod7 cod ratios of the oil contaminated wastewater were variable between 0 1 and 0 5 fig 2 a which corresponds to a wastewater with low aerobic biodegradability wastewaters with a bod7 cod ratio below 0 43 are considered difficult to be treated by biological processes svenskt vatten 2012 in terms of anaerobic biodegradability the bmp tests indicated that this oil contaminated wastewater was degradable to a certain extent a methane yield of 150 200 nml gcod was obtained when using anaerobic sludge from mesophilic or thermophilic municipal digesters which corresponds to 40 60 of the theoretical yield of 350 nml gcod data not shown 3 2 anaerobic process occurring in the storage tank the full scale storage tank hosted a thermophilic anaerobic process operating at about 50 c without mixing the flow rate into the tank varied between 190 and 240 m3 d with associated long hydraulic retention times hrts and low olrs table 2 the codsol reduction in the tank was between 50 and 80 during the assessment period fig 2b the variations in cod removal over time were likely a consequence of the changing characteristics of the influent wastewater and the lack of stable performance due to lack of mixing the lack of stirring in the tank may have led to unevenly distributed biomass hence microorganisms might have had different substrate availabilities both in terms of amounts and types of substrates depending on their location in the tank the bod7 cod in the effluent from the tank was lower than in the influent wastewater fig 2a indicating that some removal of biodegradable compounds occurred in the tank nevertheless in some instances the influent compounds could not be utilised effectively by the microorganisms since the bod7 cod ratios of the influent and effluent were similar the different groups of hydrocarbons were degraded to varying degrees depending on their chemical structure based on the analyses of the influent and effluent fig 2c the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with 12 or less carbons were removed to a larger extent 50 74 removal for aliphatics c12 28 79 for aromatics c10 than aliphatics and aromatics with more than 12 carbons 8 10 removal for aliphatics c12 0 3 for aromatics c10 the anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons has been coupled to sulphate reducing or denitrifying conditions holliger and zehnder 1996 rabus et al 2016 denitrifying bacteria have been reported to degrade alkanes with up to 20 carbons holliger and zehnder 1996 in biomass samples from the tank the genus paracoccus was among the five most abundant genera of bacteria identified section 3 5 paracoccus species are known to utilise nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxides as electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions midas database macilroy et al 2017 the degradation of aromatics is more complex since these first have to be transformed into central intermediates that will be subsequently reductively attacked and cleaved by hydrolysis to be able to enter central metabolic pathways holliger and zehnder 1996 in the storage tank the amount of phenols appeared to remain unchanged however the levels of phenols were below 100 mg l these levels of phenols are very low in comparison to the soluble cod levels of around 30 g l in the tank table 2 the average vfa levels in the effluent of the tank were as expected lower than in the influent the concentration of propionic acid increased slightly towards the end of the evaluation period data not shown but it never exceeded 800 mg propionic acid l i e it remained below what could be considered toxic levels to methanogens the accumulation of propionic acid is indicative of instability in anaerobic digestion and for example concentrations higher than 3000 mg propionate l have been reported to affect negatively the activity of methanogens li et al 2012 the gas production rate from the full scale storage tank could not be measured continuously nevertheless four gas samples taken from the gas outlet showed that the methane content in the produced gas was between 65 and 70 3 3 start up and operation of two laboratory scale anmbbrs under mesophilic conditions the start up of the two mesophilic anmbbrs cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 involved the repeated addition during one month of a mixture of biomass from a mesophilic anaerobic digester and biomass collected from the full scale storage tank this regular inoculation aimed at facilitating the attachment of anaerobic biomass to the carriers the addition of not only biomass from the storage tank but also from a digester was deemed necessary based on bmp test results indicating that the collected biomass from the storage tank was less active in converting cod from the oil contaminated wastewater into methane compared to the digester biomass data not shown the first 86 days of operation were used to troubleshoot the experimental setup and promote inoculation of the carriers this period was thus characterised by variations in hrt and olr fig 3 with instances of relatively low flow rates and hrts 30 d data not shown the dilution effect of the initial volume of tap water in the reactors and the characteristics of the added anaerobic biomass dominated the effluent characteristics during the first 65 days fig 3 the reactors were started up without extra alkalinity addition and the ph remained between 6 5 and 7 4 during the first 56 days however after biomass addition was stopped day 30 and the alkalinity in the reactors was washed out or consumed a sharp decrease in ph to 6 2 on day 63 forced the addition of sodium bicarbonate in the feed for the rest of the operation of the reactors to buffer ph values close to neutrality 7 1 7 6 after day 86 a more controlled hrt operation ensued fig 3 17 7 d n 27 and 13 6 d n 26 during days 86 117 and hrt 30 1 d n 15 and 27 1 d n 12 during days 118 156 for cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively this ensured relatively more constant olrs until day 156 cleancarrierr1 olr 0 57 0 10 kgcodsol m3d n 42 and inoccarrierr2 olr 0 61 0 14 kgcodsol m3d n 39 inoculation favoured the anaerobiosis in the reactors and already on day 30 when biomass addition was stopped a codsol removal of about 30 was measured in both reactors up until day 119 the codsol removal ranged within 30 and 54 fig 3 on day 119 the hrt was increased and the wastewater cod levels were almost doubled to maintain a similar olr and thereafter codsol removals of up to 70 were achieved in both reactors the vfa levels as ch3cooh equivalents in both reactors decreased from 1500 mg l days 86 95 to 500 1000 mg l for the rest of the operating period despite an increase in the incoming wastewater s vfa concentrations from 500 to 1000 to 2000 3000 mg l day 119 due to wastewater batch variations biogas production with average 80 ch4 increased over time more significantly after day 86 reaching methane yields per codsol removed of about 270 nmlch4 gcodsol and 230 nmlch4 gcodsol in cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 respectively during the last 20 days although inoccarrierr2 was started up with a 20 filling degree of carriers seeded with an anaerobic biofilm no difference in performance was observed between the two anmbbrs this similarity in performance suggested that the seeded carriers used in inoccarrierr2 may have played a lesser role than the continuous addition of anaerobic biomass as inoculum in establishing a biofilm on the carriers the experience gained with this specific oil contaminated wastewater suggests that an estimated startup time could be optimised to be within one or two months targeting hrts of 30d and olrs of 0 6 kgcodsol m3d under mesophilic conditions the start up approach of an anmbbr process will be strongly dependent on the ability to colonise the carriers with anaerobic biofilm in association with the biodegradability of the wastewater 3 4 comparative performance of laboratory scale anmbbrs acr and of the full scale process the startup and initial operation of both anmbbrs at 37 c with a target hrt of around 30d determined the slow increase in effluent levels of codsol fig 4 nh4 n po4 3 p phenols and caco3 alkalinity since carriers with developed biofilm from the previous operation of the anmbbrs cleancarrierr1 and inoccarrierr2 were put in tap water and wastewater was fed into the reactors data not shown the temperature was increased gradually in one of these anmbbrs up to 50 c anmbbr50 after confirming that the temperature in the full scale storage tank was thermophilic and not mesophilic as initially believed the acr at 50 c arc50 was only started up on day 68 with a target hrt of around 40d fig 4 due to delays in its manufacturing therefore the data reported and analysed here correspond to the period of parallel operation from day 111 300 when the reactors were operational at the target temperatures table 2 both anmbbrs performed similarly in terms of cod removal since startup at 37 c and even during the increase in temperature in anmbbr50 from 37 to 50 c from day 113 149 fig 4 nevertheless the anmbbr50 displayed more sensitivity to increases in influent cod levels fig 4 with increases 1000 mgcod l in the anmbbr50 than anmbbr37 with increases 200 mgcod l in the reactor with also higher associated vfa levels consequently whereas the olr was increased in anmbbr37 from 0 8 to 1 1 kgcod m3d day 238 the olr was decreased in anmmbr50 from 0 9 to 0 7 kgcod m3d day 253 table 2 the decrease in olr in anmbbr50 was deemed necessary to operate the reactor more stably the mesophilic anmbbr37 operated more stably and was able to maintain a higher cod removal at increased olrs than the thermophilic anmbbr50 fig 4 and table 2 the codsol removals were higher at 37 c 67 than at 50 c 58 table 2 this difference in performance could be explained by differences in microbial communities resulting from the different temperatures in the anmbbrs section 3 5 however the specific microbial community composition in anmbbr50 determining its performance may have been influenced by the development of the thermophilic biofilm from an original mesophilic biofilm at 37 c and by the operation of the anmbbr50 at 50 c for 147d in contrast anmbbr37 was started up with biofilm carriers already acclimated at 37 c and was operated for a longer period at this constant temperature table 2 although the maximum manageable olr by the anmbbr at 37 c was not determined in this study an increase in olr from 0 6 during the initial startup to 0 8 and then to 1 1 kgcod m3d was feasible higher olrs at 37 c may be feasible with this wastewater both thermophilic acr50 and anmbbr50 operated with similar codsol reductions fig 4 and table 2 however acr50 operated with a lower olr of around 0 6 kgcod m3d and longer hrt the load in acr50 could not be increased due to poor biomass settleability which forced the biomass levels in the reactor to be between 1 5 and 3 0 gvss l without reaching the target of 5 gvss l in contrast to anmbbr50 acr50 was inoculated with thermophilic 55 c sludge from a full scale municipal digester which was shown to degrade the oil contaminated wastewater nevertheless the initial thermophilic biomass did not appear to have given any advantage to the contact reactor over the mbbr furthermore the inoculation biomass contained fibres that remained in the system and masked the measurement of actual microbial biomass as vss in the reactor the poor sludge settleability in the acr50 made it impossible to quantify total cod removals in this reactor the ph in the three laboratory scale reactors was close to neutral i e between 6 9 and 7 5 table 2 the methane content of the biogas from the three reactors was close to 80 and similar among the reactors which could have been influenced by a high solubility of co2 in water nevertheless the cod conversion to methane based on the measured methane yields per cod removed table 2 was higher at 37 c 60 than at 50 c 52 the anmbbrs were able to handle double to triple the olrs at lower hrts than the full scale tank with similar cod removals table 2 these results point to the opportunity to decrease the size of the full scale tank if to operate it as an anmbbr maintaining biogas production and cod removals although direct comparisons with other oil contaminated wastewaters may be challenging due to the variety of types of oily wastewaters the cod removal of 62 at an olr of 1 1 kgcod m3d achieved here is higher or within the range reported elsewhere with other types of reactors or even an anmbbr lu et al 2013 under mesophilic conditions for oily wastewater table 1 the current study further indicated the advantage of retaining active biomass by growing a biofilm on carriers in an anmbbr rather than relying on biomass settle ability in an acr which in this case was unachievable the cod removal up to 62 measured in the lab scale reactors agreed with the maximum conversion yield of 60 of the theoretical value of 350 nmlch4 gcod obtained in the bmp tests when using the oil contaminated wastewater as substrate 3 5 microbial biomass and community analysis in the reactors and storage tank the bacterial and archaeal communities in the sedimented and suspended biomass from the full scale storage tank six samples from feb march may june 2016 and march 2017 were similar the most abundant operational taxonomic units otus of bacteria were the genera of anaerobaculum and aquamicrobium accounting both for 39 up to 74 of otu relative abundance in all the samples followed by syntrophaceticus coprothermobacter and paracoccus these five genera comprised 44 90 of the bacterial otu relative abundance thermovirga and tepidanaerobacter were also detected in sedimented and suspended biomass respectively with about 5 abundance the most abundant archaeal genus in the biomass samples was methanosphaera 39 58 followed by methanobrevibacter and otus from the methanobacteriaceae family these five archaeal genera comprised 82 98 of the relative abundance of the archaeal otus the bacterial communities in the biofilm and suspended biomass from the laboratory scale reactors at the end of the operation period displayed some differences in otu relative abundance but were consistently dominated by five bacterial otus from the genera anaerobaculum coprothermobacter tepidiphilus and syntrophaceticus and tepidanaerobacter these genera comprised 66 89 of the otu relative abundance in all samples disregarding the type of biomass and temperature anaerobaculum was consistently abundant in biomass samples at 37 and 50 c in contrast different archaeal otus were the most abundant in the biomass samples the genera of methanosphaera methanosaeta methanothermobacter and a methanomicrobiales otu presented relative abundances higher than 37 each the acr50 unsettleable biomass presented a high methanosaeta abundance 74 5 methanosaeta was also present in the anmbbr37 biofilm 13 2 methanothermobacter was only present 44 8 in the anmbbr50 biofilm along with methanosarcina 23 8 methanobrevibacter appeared in all the samples with a relative abundance of 4 8 the different archaeal communities in both reactors at 50 c could have been determined by the different sources of biomass inocula thermophilic ad biomass for acr50 and mesophilic biofilm at 37 c for anmbbr50 evidence for the conversion of the oil contaminated wastewater into methane was also provided by the microbial composition of the biomass both biomass samples from the full scale tank and the laboratory reactors were abundant in moderate thermophilic acetogenic fermenting bacterial genera anaerobaculum coprothermobacter syntrophaceticus and thermovirga which are able to ferment organic acids peptides amino acids and some sugars alcohols producing hydrogen and co2 midas database macilroy et al 2017 species of coprothermobacter and syntrophaceticus are found in thermophilic digesters or anaerobic reactors and grow in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic methanogens the storage tank biomass also contained aquamicrobium and paracoccus denitrifiers able to use nitrates nitrites or nitrous oxides as electron acceptors and utilise carbohydrates organic fatty acids heterocyclic aromatics alcohols as carbon sources which were compounds found in the oil contaminated wastewater in terms of archaeal composition all the biomass samples had a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens from the methanobacteriales order such as methanosphaera miller 2015 methanobrevibacter and methanothermibacter midas database macilroy et al 2017 in contrast to the storage tank and anmbbr37 biomass acetoclastic methanosaeta and the metabolically versatile methanosarcina methanogens from the methanosarcinales order were only present in the biomass at 50 c 4 conclusions the anaerobic treatment of the oil contaminated wastewater entering the full scale storage tank was efficiently performed by a biofilm based reactor namely the anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr the anmbbr was able to handle double to triple the organic loading rates at lower hydraulic loads than the full scale tank with similar cod removals therefore the anaerobic process in the full scale storage tank can be conducted in a more compact volume although both mesophilic 37 c and thermophilic 50 c anaerobic treatment of the oil contaminated wastewater were feasible the anmbbr at 37 c displayed relatively higher treatment capacity the results from this study indicate the potential applicability of anmbbrs for the treatment of wastewaters containing oil derivatives

18582,this study investigated the feasibility of a new biological nitrogen removal process that integrates sulfur driven autotrophic denitratation no3 no2 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox for simultaneous removal of nitrate and ammonium from industrial wastewater the proposed sulfur thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox process was developed in two phases first the thiosulfate driven denitratation was established in the uasb inoculated with activated sludge and fed with ammonium nitrate and thiosulfate for 52 days until the nitrite level in the effluent reached 32 1 mg n l second enriched anammox biomass was introduced to the uasb to develop the integrated thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda bioprocess 53 212 d results showed that nitrate and ammonium could be efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater by the integrated tdda system at a total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of 82 5 1 8 with an influent nh4 n of 101 2 2 2 mgn l no3 n of 101 1 1 5 mgn l and thiosulfate of 202 5 3 2 mg s l it was estimated that anammox and autotrophic denitritation no2 n2 contributed to about 90 and 10 of the tn removal respectively at stable operation the

and ca anammoxoglobus in this syntrophic biocenosis additionally batch experiments were conducted to reveal the kinetic rates and to reconcile the stoichiometry of the electron donor acceptor couples

2017 joss et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 heterotrophic denitratation no3 no2 can also produce nitrite which together with ammonium can be converted to dinitrogen gas by anammox the heterotrophic denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox process can be realized in a single reactor without complex controlling systems however the competition between heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox

treatment kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 van de graaf et al 1996 the industrial wastewater containing both nitrate and ammonium such as the effluents of mine and mill fertilizer factory table s1 are generally treated in two stage nitrification and denitrification with dosing external carbon source hirata et al 2001 shivaraman et al 2001 zaitsev et al 2008 compared with such conventional bnr coupling of sulfur driven denitratation and anammox process could be an efficient and cost effective approach therefore we proposed to dose thiosulfate as external electron donor for developing a new thiosulfate driven denitratation process and coupling with anammox for removal of nitrate and ammonium from wastewater in the present study the thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda system was developed in two phases thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitratation was started up in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor in the first 52 days then anammox biomass was inoculated into the uasb reactor and the reactor was continuously operated for another 160 days to investigate the feasibility and performance of the tdda process the detailed objectives of this study were to i investigate the performance and stability of the new combined bioprocess ii examine the stoichiometry and kinetics of both thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox experimentally iii analyze the microbial communities in the reactor and iv elucidate the mechanisms of thiosulfate oxidation and nitrogen removal in the tdda system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation the new tdda system was developed in a double walled lab scale uasb reactor with an effective volume of 2 0 l an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and a height of 130 cm a three phase liquid gas solid separator was installed at the top of the reactor and the produced gas was continuously recirculated by a peristaltic pump to enhance mixing the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 30 1 c by the recycling water from water bath to the inner and outer walls of the uasb details of the reactor set up are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary information the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor was set to 24 h before day 15 after which it was decreased to 12 h by doubling the influent flow rates for the rest of the investigation to day 212 the reactor was covered with aluminum foil to prevent growth of phototrophic bacteria and protect anammox bacteria from light the uasb reactor was operated for 212 days divided into two phases phase 1 for thiosulfate driven denitratation 0 52 d and phase 2 for the tdda 53 212 d the operational conditions are summarized in table 1 2 2 synthetic wastewater and sludge inoculum the two synthetic wastewater streams fed to the uasb comprised solutions a and b fed in equal flows 1 1 v v solution a contained na2s2o3 200 400 mg s l and nahco3 4000 mg l solution b contained nano3 100 200 mgn l and nh4cl 100 200mgn l mgso4 7h2o 600 mg l kh2po4 54 mg l cacl2 2h2o 360 mg l two ml l of each of trace element solutions i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 were added to solution b detailed information about solutions a and b as well as the trace elemental solutions is shown in table s2 the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the influent were designated at the moderate levels of the industrial wastewater table s1 each prepared solution was purged with pure dinitrogen gas for 10 min to remove oxygen before it was connected to the influent pipes the containers of the feeding solutions a and b and the reactor head space were connected to dinitrogen gas bags to maintain atmospheric pressure to initiate thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitratation the uasb was seeded with activated sludge taken from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 4 9 g l and 4 4 g l at the beginning of the operation fig s2 the uasb was seeded with 600 ml of anammox sludge on day 52 for developing tdda process the inoculated anammox biomass was taken from an anammox reactor the anammox system was an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr with an effective volume of 4 l that was operated for more than 200 days and fed with nitrite and ammonium the mlss and mlvss of anammox sludge were 4 8 and 4 2 g l the performance of anammox sbr is described in fig s3 on day 77 a further 400 ml of anammox sludge was added to the uasb reactor 2 3 batch tests after the uasb reactor achieved stability on day 129 three batch tests were performed on sludge harvested from the uasb reactor to investigate the stoichiometry and kinetics of sulfur and nitrogen conversions in the tdda system batch test a bt a was performed on day 142 to evaluate the thiosulfate driven denitrification activity only in bt a the initial concentrations of no3 and s2o3 2 were 50 mgn l and 100 mg s l respectively without ammonium batch test b bt b was conducted on day 144 to estimate the anammox activity only the initial nh4 and no2 concentrations were both 40 mgn l without thiosulfate batch test c bt c was performed on day 147 to simultaneously investigate autotrophic denitrification and anammox activities in bt c the initial concentrations of nitrogen and sulfur compounds were 50 mgn l no3 50 mgn l nh4 and 100 mg s l s2o3 2 the batch tests were conducted in serum bottles with a total volume of 120 ml and 100 ml for liquid the sludge taken from the uasb reactor was washed twice with mineral medium same composition as synthetic wastewater without substrates and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 25 c and resuspended in the serum bottles with mineral medium the initial ph value was adjusted to 8 0 by adding 0 2m hcl or 0 2m naoh the serum bottles were flushed with pure dinitrogen gas for 10 min to remove the oxygen in the liquid and headspace sealed with rubber stopper and aluminum cap and then incubated on a thermostatic shaker operated at 220 rpm for 1 h at 31 c to achieve stable condition then concentrated solutions nano3 nano2 nh4cl na2s2o3 were injected into serum bottles with a syringe to achieve the desired initial n and s concentrations during the batch experiments 2 ml of each sample was collected at appropriate time intervals 20 60 min to measure the concentrations of thiosulfate sulfate nitrate nitrite and ammonium the concentrations of mlss and mlvss in serum bottles were determined at the end of the tests all the tests were performed in duplicate bt a and bt c were carried out for 480 min until the nitrate was completely consumed and bt b was carried out for 150 min until the nitrite was depleted 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 contributions of anammox and denitritation to the tn removal as shown in fig 1 b anammox and autotrophic denitritation are responsible for the tn removal in the tdda system because both processes can produce nitrogen gas which is then released from the system in the tdda system ammonium uptake for bacterial synthesis was neglected because of low yield coefficients hence ammonium was assumed to be removed only via anammox the contributions from the anammox αa and the autotrophic denitritation αb process to the tn

nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by denitratation and then nitrite is in turn reduced to dinitrogen gas by denitritation as illustrated in fig 1a denitratation and denitritation rates are calculated as eq 3 and eq 4 respectively in the tdda system the nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by denitratation and the produced nitrite is utilized by anammox and denitritation fig 1b the rates

products were then conducted by illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance 3 1 1 phase 1 of the uasb thiosulfate driven denitratation the thiosulfate driven denitratation process was established in 52 days and it was divided into phase 1a 0 14 d phase 1b 15 28 d and phase 1c 29 52 d the influent concentrations of ammonium and nitrate on average were 50 9 1 4 mgn l and 51 6 0 9 mgn l in phases 1a and 1b respectively then increased to 100 6 2 2 mgn l and 100 2 1 4 mgn l in phase 1c fig 2 a the average nitrate removal efficiency was 74 3 in phase 1a dramatically decreased to 33 9 in phase 1b before gradually increasing to 62 5 at the end of phase 1c fig 2c the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was below 0 2 mgn l in phase 1a and then it was observed with a maximum concentration of 3 1 mgn l in phase 1b and the nitrite accumulation ratio nar varied from 7 2 to 18 6 calculated by eq s1 the nitrite concentration in the effluent continuously increased to 32 1 mgn l with a nitrite accumulation ratio of 52 2 at the end of phase 1c fig 2a this result indicates that the thiosulfate driven denitratation was successfully developed in the reactor in contrast ammonium cannot be removed in this phase with removal efficiency below 3 5 the concentration of thiosulfate in the influent was maintained at 175 4 5 4 mg s l to achieve a s n mass ratio of 3 5 in phase 1a fig 2b when the s n ratio was decreased to 2 0 in phase 1b the influent thiosulfate was 101 6 1 9 mg s l afterwards it was increased to 201 2 2 0 mg s l in phase 1c to keep the s n ratio at 2 0 when the influent ammonium and nitrate concentrations were doubled thiosulfate was completely consumed throughout phases 1a 1c and it could not be detected in the effluent of the uasb reactor the concentration of sulfate in the influent was kept at 42 6 1 4 mg s l throughout phases 1a 1c from the mgso4 7h2o in the influent the average concentration of sulfate in the effluent was 216 7 mg s l in phase 1a and it decreased to 147 3 mg s l in phase 1b before rising to 239 7 mg s l in phase 1c during phases 1a 1c the sulfur mass balance between the influent and the effluent exceeded 95 5 δ so4 2 s δ s2o3 2 s 100 therefore all of the thiosulfate was oxidized to sulfate with no accumulation of sulfur intermediate in the reactor and this result was in line with the previous studies using thiosulfate for autotrophic denitrification manconi et al 2007 matsui and yamamoto 1986 qian et al 2018 the level of nitrite in the effluent of the uasb reactor was negligible in phase 1a suggesting that the consumed nitrate was completely reduced to dinitrogen gas this finding was similar with previous studies that nitrate could be completely reduced to dinitrogen gas without nitrite accumulation in the effluent of the reactor when the s n ratio in the influent was higher than 4 3 yamamoto ikemoto et al 2000 zou et al 2016 however the significant increase of nitrite concentration in the effluent of the uasb reactor was observed in phases 1b and 1c as the s n ratio decreased to 2 0 matsui and yamamoto 1986 observed that over 30 of nitrite accumulation ratio in the fluidized bed reactor when the s n ratio was below 2 0 in the influent qian et al 2018 also reported that when the uasb reactor conducted with s n of 1 5 nitrite accumulation ratio increased to 80 in the effluent as a result the s n ratio is a critical parameter for determining the final products in autotrophic denitrification when the system was operated under s n of 3 5 formed nitrite can be further reduced to dinitrogen gas and negligible nitrite was detected in the effluent however when s n ratio was decreased to 2 0 accumulated nitrite cannot be further reduced due to thiosulfate limitation and nitrite was retained in the effluent 3 1 2 phase 2 of the uasb thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox to develop the proposed tdda system the enriched anammox biomass was introduced to the uasb reactor on day 52 during phase 2 the uasb was continuously operated for more than 5 months 160 days to investigate the performance of the tdda bioprocess phase 2 was comprised of phase 2a tdda start up 53 129 d and phase 2b tdda stable operation 130 212 d the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the influent were kept at 101 1 1 5 and 101 2 2 2 mgn l respectively in phase 2 fig 3 a the uasb reactor immediately showed ammonium removal capability after inoculation of anammox biomass since the ammonium concentration in the effluent decreased to 75 6 mgn l on day 53 fig 3a with an ammonium removal efficiency of 24 2 fig 3c thereafter the ammonium removal efficiency gradually increased and reached 71 8 at the end of phase 2a the ammonium removal efficiency and the effluent ammonium concentration during phase 2b remained constant at 75 7 2 1 and 24 6 2 3 mgn l respectively the concentration of nitrate in the effluent decreased along with the ammonium it decreased to 11 1 mgn l at the end of phase 2a and then remained at 9 6 1 5 mgn l throughout phase 2b with a nitrate removal efficiency exceeding 90 0 the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was low with an average of 0 7 mgn l during phases 2a and 2b as the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the effluent continuously decreased the tn removal efficiency increased from 39 5 on day 53 80 3 at the end of phase 2a and thereafter remained constant at 82 5 throughout phase 2b with a tn removal rate of 0 33 kg n m³ d the ratio of consumed no3 n to consumed nh4 n was maintained at 1 20 during stable operation of the tdda system and ratio of consumed s2o3 2 s to consumed no3 n was 2 21 the influent concentration of thiosulfate was maintained at 202 5 3 2 mg s l in phases 2a and 2b this thiosulfate was completely oxidized to sulfate in the uasb and together with the influent sulfate concentration of 42 1 2 3 mg s l resulted in an effluent sulfate concentration of 242 0 4 2 mg s l the variations of sulfur compounds in the tdda system were similar to those in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system in which thiosulfate was fully oxidized to sulfate and the sulfur mass balance exceeded 95 in order to examine the effectiveness of anammox in this system the contributions of anammox and autotrophic denitritation to the tn removal were estimated by eq 1 and eq 2 at the beginning of phase 2a autotrophic denitritation comprised 38 9 of the tn removal but it decreased to 10 1 fig 3d at the end of phase 2a and remained at about 10 throughout phase 2b in contrast anammox accounted for 61 1 of the tn removal at the beginning of phase 2a then it increased to 89 9 at the end of phase 2a and remained at about 90 throughout phase 2b these outcomes confirmed that about 90 of dinitrogen gas was generated via anammox in the combined system while the autotrophic denitrification was mainly responsible for nitrate reduction to nitrite and only 10 of dinitrogen gas was produced through autotrophic denitrification this finding is consistent with the performance in deamox that anammox constituted over 80 94 of the tn removal cao et al 2016 du et al 2017 consequently the efficient nitrogen removal in the tdda system was attributed to the cooperative action between autotrophic denitratation and anammox 3 2 kinetics analysis through batch experiments 3 2 1 evaluation of thiosulfate driven denitrification activity the first batch test bt a was performed to determine autotrophic denitrification activity without anammox as shown in fig 4 a the test was divided into period 1 0 20 min and period 2 20 480 min based on different conversion rates of nitrogen and sulfur compounds the thiosulfate was rapidly depleted in period 1 with the initial concentration of 105 7 mg s l and the consumption rate was 141 0 mg s gvss h table 2 the sulfate concentration rapidly increased from 57 9 mg s l to 111 5 mg s l at a generation rate of 68 5 mg s gvss h in period 1 it then increased more gradually to 154 4 mg s l at the end of period 2 at a constant rate of 2 6 mg s gvss h unlike present study previous experiments described that the amount of thiosulfate removed was in agreement with the amount of sulfate generated in thiosulfate driven denitrification campos et al 2008 mora et al 2014 this phenomenon implies that the thiosulfate was not directly oxidized to sulfate but with sulfur intermediates formation to be discussed in section 3 3 coupled with the oxidation of thiosulfate and its intermediates the concentration of nitrate quickly declined from 55 2 mgn l to 34 6 mgn l at a rate of 26 3 mgn gvss h in period 1 table 2 then gradually decreasing to zero at a removal rate of 2 1 mgn gvss h in period 2 the concentration of nitrite quickly increased to 19 9 mgn l at a nitrite accumulation rate of 25 4 mgn gvss h in period 1 before rising slowly and continuously to 42 3 mgn l at a rate of 1 6 mgn gvss h in period 2 the nitrite accumulation ratio reached 81 7 by the end of test bt a revealed nitrite accumulation in tdda system resulting from a higher reduction rate of nitrate than nitrite as the nitrate reduction rate was 29 2 and 4 2 times higher than the nitrite reduction rate in the first and second periods table 2 nitrite concentration was continuously increasing during experiment from the two step denitrification analysis fig 1a 25 of the electrons transferred 2 67 mmol e l from thiosulfate oxidation was used in nitrite reduction to dinitrogen gas while 75 7 88 mmol e l was consumed in nitrate reduction to nitrite 3 2 2 evaluation of anammox activity the second batch test bt b was performed to determine anammox activity without thiosulfate driven denitrification as shown in fig 4b the initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations were 41 3 mgn l and 42 6 mgn l respectively the concentrations of nitrite and ammonium simultaneously decreased at the rates of 7 6 and 5 5 mgn gvss h respectively while the concentration of nitrate slowly increased at a rate of 1 4 mgn gvss h the stoichiometric ratio of the ammonium consumption rate to the nitrite consumption rate was 1 38 and it was slightly higher than 1 32 1 33 obtained from enriched anammox culture in sbr and uasb reactors jetten et al 1998 tang et al 2011 3 2 3 evaluation of thiosulfate denitrification and anammox activities the third batch test bt c was carried out to simultaneously investigate the autotrophic denitrification and anammox activities described in fig 4c the conversions of thiosulfate and sulfate were similar to observation in the bt a in period 1 thiosulfate was completely consumed in 20 min at a rate of 133 7 mg s gvss h and about half of thiosulfate was converted to sulfate at a production rate of 70 7 mg s gvss h table 2 in period 2 the sulfate increased slowly to 162 9 mg s l at the end of experiment with a sulfate generation rate of 3 3 mg s gvss h nitrite increased to its peak of 20 3 mgn l at the end of period 1 the accumulated nitrite was then entirely consumed within 150 min afterwards the nitrite cannot be detected in the period 2 the concentration of nitrate dropped from 55 3 mgn l to 32 5 mgn l at a removal rate of 29 5 mgn gvss h in period 1 nitrate then dropped more gradually at 3 0 mgn gvss h in period 2 and it was depleted within 420 min the level of ammonium dropped from 54 5 mgn l to 52 9 mgn l in period 1 at a consumption rate of 2 0 mgn gvss h in period 2 the ammonium removal rate stayed at 5 3 mgn gvss h from 20 to 150 min in the presence of nitrite in the bulk liquid the ammonium removal rate then decreased and remained at 1 4 mgn gvss h after the formed nitrite concentration decreased to zero in the rest of period 2 from 150 to 420 min the ammonium concentration was finally reduced to 11 2 mgn l at the end of period 2 about 19 6 of the produced nitrite from nitrate reduction was reduced to dinitrogen gas by denitritation in the tdda system whereas 80 4 of the produced nitrite from denitratation was utilized by anammox and this was in agreement with nitrite accumulation ratio of 81 7 in bt a the ratio of removed no3 n to removed nh4 n and removed s2o3 2 s was 1 0 78 1 89 the stoichiometric value of the s n ratio for full denitrification was the 3 68 mora et al 2014 both nitrate and nitrite were entirely removed in this test and this result proved that tdda can largely reduce the thiosulfate electron donor demand by 49 compared with complete thiosulfate driven denitrification 3 3 speculated mechanisms in tdda system as mentioned above denitritation was less competitive than denitratation and anammox in the tdda system the reaction rates of denitritation denitratation and anammox could be obtained from the third batch test bt c the denitratation rate was about 22 7 times higher than the denitritation rate in period 1 and it was 2 1 4 4 times higher than denitritation in period 2 the electrons consumption in nitrate reduction 9 05 mmol e l were 3 35 times higher than nitrite reduction 2 70 mmol e l calculated from the two step denitrification analysis fig 1b the outcomes confirmed that denitratation has a higher activity than denitritation in the tdda system furthermore anammox was more competitive for nitrite utilization than denitritation the nitrite consumption rate of anammox 6 2 mgn gvss h was 4 4 times higher than the rate of denitritation 1 4 mgn gvss h when nitrite was present in the bulk liquid when the accumulated nitrite in the bulk liquid was completely depleted in period 2 the nitrite generated through the slow denitratation was consumed by anammox at 1 7 mgn gvss h which was still 3 4 higher than the denitritation rate 0 5 mgn gvss h the anammox has a higher activity than denitritation possibly due to its higher affinity to nitrite than denitritation as reported in the literature anammox bacteria have a high affinity for nitrite because of their unique anammoxosome membrane and nitrite transporters damste et al 2002 van niftrik and jetten 2012 for example the half saturation constants ks for nitrite of anammox were 0 2 35 μg l awata et al 2013 lotti et al 2014 while thiosulfate driven denitritation has a relatively low affinity for nitrite with a ks of 2 3 mgn l mora et al 2015 based on the observations in bt a and bt c the sulfate production rates were about half of the thiosulfate removal rate table 2 in period 1 then sulfate generation rate dramatically dropped by about 95 in period 2 also the medium became milky during the experiments based on the formation of the suspended material and sulfur unbalance between thiosulfate and sulfate it was postulated that sulfite and elemental sulfur were formed as intermediates during thiosulfate oxidation in batch tests schedel and truper 1980 studied the anaerobic oxidation of thiosulfate with thiobacillus denitrificans by radioactively labelled sulfur atoms and results revealed that thiosulfate oxidation started with splitting between sulfane and sulfone sulfur and then produced sulfite and elemental sulfur were separately oxidized branched thiosulfate oxidation as reported by hooper and dispirito 1985 that sulfite can be directly and rapidly oxidized to sulfate by the sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase inside the periplasm while the accumulated elemental sulfur was less active than produced sulfite schedel and truper 1980 hence it was speculated that this branched thiosulfate oxidation process s2o3 2 so3 2 s0 occurred firstly in the tdda process followed by the so3 2 and s0 oxidation coupled with the fast and slow denitratation respectively the different kinetic results between this experiment and previous studies campos et al 2008 mora et al 2014 qian et al 2018 were attributed to the multiple pathways of thiosulfate oxidation in sob as it was proposed that thiosulfate could be oxidized to sulfate by three completely different pathways lens and pol 2000 in order to further prove elemental sulfur formation in thiosulfate oxidation pathway a simplified kinetic model was developed to reveal the mechanisms of thiosulfate oxidation and nitrogen removal in the tdda system the model stoichiometric matrix is summarized in table s3 and the kinetic parameters are shown in table s4 the modelled results are presented in fig 4 the coefficients of determination r2 for ammonium nitrate sulfate and thiosulfate all exceeded 0 98 for the model of bt c table s5 indicating that the proposed model is able to describe the kinetic behavior of nitrogen and sulfur compounds moreover a check of the mass and element balance of the stoichiometry using the excel spreadsheet of the gujer matrix showed that all of the elements balanced therefore elemental sulfur was considered as an intermediate during thiosulfate oxidation in this study intermediates in thiosulfate oxidation will be quantified and the thiosulfate oxidation pathway will be determined in future studies 3 4 microbial community analysis the phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences was conducted at genus levels fig 5 the shannon index for the first and second samples were 4 11 and 3 21 and the simpson s diversity index were 0 06 and 0 22 respectively suggesting higher evenness and diversity in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system than the tdda system at the phylum level proteobacteria 41 33 68 33 planctomycetes 0 69 3 31 ignavibacteriae 0 85 3 24 chloroflexi 1 07 6 00 bacteroidetes 11 69 35 70 and armatimonadetes 0 68 1 65 were dominant in both microbial communities in the first sludge sample the functional bacteria in genus level were thiobacillus 21 53 thermomonas 0 54 ottowia 0 51 and sulfurimonas 0 41 fig 5 these four strains all belong to the proteobacteria phylum accounting for 41 33 of total relative abundance in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system the reduced sulfur compounds can be used by these four groups as electron donor to reduce nitrate or nitrite and hydrogen can also be used by sulfurimonas han and perner 2015 and ottowia is capable of utilizing organics for facultative anaerobic growth spring et al 2004 although no organics were added in the influent of the uasb reactor in this study heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria were still detected in the communities such as flavobacterium 2 18 terrimonas 1 29 and phaeodactylibacter 0 82 these heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria may also contribute to nitrate reduction in the reactor which could use organic matter liberated from the endogenous metabolism lysis and death of autotrophic bacteria okabe et al 2011 no strains belonging to the anammox genus were detected in the first sludge sample in accordance with negligible ammonium removal efficiency of the reactor in phase 1 in the second sludge sample the relative abundance of thiobacillus decreased to 3 46 while the number for sulfurimonas increased to 3 92 thermomonas and ottowia strains disappeared from the tdda system denitrifying bacteria using organic carbon were also detected in tdda system such as simplicispira 1 94 and flavobacterium 0 71 the high abundance of aeromonas was observed in the second sludge sample and it was reported that these bacteria are fermentative and facultative anaerobic and plays an important role in biofilm formation talagrand reboul et al 2017 meanwhile two groups belonging to the planctomycetes phylum and representing two anammox genera were detected in the tdda system with ca kuenenia 1 27 and ca anammoxoglobus 1 12 it has been reported that ca kuenenia are r strategists with a high affinity for ammonium and nitrite oshiki et al 2016 and ca anammoxoglobus are capable of co oxidation of propionate and ammonium in the presence of ammonium nitrite and nitrate kartal et al 2007 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria in the tdda system was in the similar range of other anammox based processes 1 7 3 du et al 2017 xie et al 2018 such community composition confirmed that sob can coexist with anammox bacteria in one reactor 4 conclusions the feasibility of developing a thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda process was investigated in a lab scale uasb reactor the following conclusions could be drawn from this study the tdda process can be stably operated to treat nitrate and ammonium contained wastewater with tn removal efficiency of 82 5 anammox and denitritation were responsible for about 90 and 10 of the tn removal respectively compared with complete thiosulfate driven denitrification the tdda process can reduce the electron consumption by about 49 the branched thiosulfate oxidation generated sulfur intermediates sulfite and elemental sulfur for fast and slow denitratation sob and anammox bacteria functioned symbiotically together acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the hong kong innovation and

18582,this study investigated the feasibility of a new biological nitrogen removal process that integrates sulfur driven autotrophic denitratation no3 no2 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox for simultaneous removal of nitrate and ammonium from industrial wastewater the proposed sulfur thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox process was developed in two phases first the thiosulfate driven denitratation was established in the uasb inoculated with activated sludge and fed with ammonium nitrate and thiosulfate for 52 days until the nitrite level in the effluent reached 32 1 mg n l second enriched anammox biomass was introduced to the uasb to develop the integrated thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda bioprocess 53 212 d results showed that nitrate and ammonium could be efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater by the integrated tdda system at a total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of 82 5 1 8 with an influent nh4 n of 101 2 2 2 mgn l no3 n of 101 1 1 5 mgn l and thiosulfate of 202 5 3 2 mg s l it was estimated that anammox and autotrophic denitritation no2 n2 contributed to about 90 and 10 of the tn removal respectively at stable operation the established tdda system was further supported by high throughput sequencing analysis that sulfur oxidizing bacteria e g thiobacillus and sulfurimonas coexisted with anammox bacteria e g ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobus in this syntrophic biocenosis additionally batch experiments were conducted to reveal the kinetic rates and to reconcile the stoichiometry of the electron donor acceptor couples

elemental sulfur coupled with fast and slow denitratation iii nitrite produced from denitratation together with ammonium were effectively converted to dinitrogen gas via anammox graphical abstract

it significantly affects the performance of pn a process both in treating ammonium rich wastewater e g reject water landfill leachate and food processing digestate and municipal wastewater cao et al 2017 joss et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 heterotrophic denitratation no3 no2 can also produce nitrite which together with ammonium can be converted to dinitrogen gas by anammox the heterotrophic denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox process can be realized in a single reactor without complex controlling systems however the competition between heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria is likely to occur in deamox the heterotrophic denitrifiers are more energetically active 427 0 kj mol with higher growth rate 0 25 h and biomass yields 1 1 gvss gno3 n henze 2007 nerenberg

in sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification systems an et al 2010 campos et al 2008 sun and nemati 2012 and this offers the opportunity to supply anammox bacteria with nitrite moreover due to the lower biomass yield of sob 0 59 0 65 gvss gno3 n koenig and liu 2001 mora et al 2014 the risk is lower for anammox bacteria to be overgrown by sob it is reported that the combination of sulfur driven denitratation and anammox plays an important role for nitrogen cycle in marine systems canfield et al 2010 russ et al 2014 however little is known about using such combined process for wastewater treatment kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 van de graaf et al 1996 the industrial wastewater containing both nitrate and ammonium such as the effluents of mine and mill fertilizer factory table s1 are generally treated in two stage nitrification and denitrification with dosing external carbon source hirata et al 2001 shivaraman et al 2001 zaitsev et al 2008 compared with such conventional bnr coupling of sulfur driven denitratation and anammox process could be an efficient and cost effective approach therefore we proposed to dose thiosulfate as external electron donor for developing a new thiosulfate driven denitratation process and coupling with anammox for removal of nitrate and ammonium from wastewater in the present study the thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda system was developed in two phases thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitratation was started up in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor in the first 52 days then anammox biomass was inoculated into the uasb reactor and the reactor was continuously operated for another 160 days to investigate the feasibility and performance of the tdda process the detailed objectives of this study were to i investigate the performance and stability of the new combined bioprocess ii examine the stoichiometry and kinetics of both thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox experimentally iii analyze the microbial communities in the reactor and iv elucidate the mechanisms of thiosulfate oxidation and nitrogen removal in the tdda system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation the new tdda system was developed in a double walled lab scale uasb reactor with an effective volume of 2 0 l an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and a height of 130 cm a three phase liquid gas solid separator was installed at the top of the reactor and the produced gas was continuously recirculated by a peristaltic pump to enhance mixing the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 30 1 c by the recycling water from water bath to the inner and outer walls of the uasb details of the reactor set up are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary information the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor was set to 24 h before day 15 after which it was decreased to 12 h by doubling the influent flow rates for the rest of the investigation to day 212 the reactor was covered with aluminum foil to prevent growth of phototrophic bacteria and protect anammox bacteria from light the uasb reactor was operated for 212 days divided into two phases phase 1 for thiosulfate driven denitratation 0 52 d and phase 2 for the tdda 53 212 d the operational conditions are summarized in table 1 2 2 synthetic wastewater and sludge inoculum the two synthetic wastewater streams fed to the uasb comprised solutions a and b fed in equal flows 1 1 v v solution a contained na2s2o3 200 400 mg s l and nahco3 4000 mg l solution b contained nano3 100 200 mgn l and nh4cl 100 200mgn l mgso4 7h2o 600 mg l kh2po4 54 mg l cacl2 2h2o 360 mg l two ml l of each of trace element solutions i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 were added to solution b detailed information about solutions a and b as well as the trace elemental solutions is shown in table s2 the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the influent were designated at the moderate levels of the industrial wastewater table s1 each prepared solution was purged with pure dinitrogen gas for 10 min to remove oxygen before it was connected to the influent pipes the containers of the feeding solutions a and b and the reactor head space were connected to dinitrogen gas bags to maintain atmospheric pressure to initiate thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitratation the uasb was seeded with activated sludge taken from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 4 9 g l and 4 4 g l at the beginning of the operation fig s2 the uasb was seeded with 600 ml of anammox sludge on day 52 for developing tdda process the inoculated anammox biomass was taken from an anammox reactor the anammox system was an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr with an effective volume of 4 l that was operated for more than 200 days and fed with nitrite and ammonium the mlss and mlvss of anammox sludge were 4 8 and 4 2 g l the performance of anammox sbr is described in fig s3 on day 77 a further 400 ml of anammox sludge was added to the uasb reactor 2 3 batch tests after the uasb reactor achieved stability on day 129 three batch tests were performed on sludge harvested from the uasb reactor to investigate the stoichiometry and kinetics of sulfur and nitrogen conversions in the tdda system batch test a bt a was performed on day 142 to evaluate the thiosulfate driven denitrification activity only in bt a the initial concentrations of no3 and s2o3 2 were 50 mgn l and 100 mg s l respectively without ammonium batch test b bt b was conducted on day 144 to estimate the anammox activity only the initial nh4 and no2 concentrations were both 40 mgn l without thiosulfate batch test c bt c was performed on day 147 to simultaneously investigate autotrophic denitrification and anammox activities in bt c the initial concentrations of nitrogen and sulfur compounds were 50 mgn l no3 50 mgn l nh4 and 100 mg s l s2o3 2 the batch tests were conducted in serum bottles with a total volume of 120 ml and 100 ml for liquid the sludge taken from the uasb reactor was washed twice with mineral medium same composition as synthetic wastewater without substrates and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 25 c and resuspended in the serum bottles with mineral medium the initial ph value was adjusted to 8 0 by adding 0 2m hcl or 0 2m naoh the serum bottles were flushed with pure dinitrogen gas for 10 min to remove the oxygen in the liquid and headspace sealed with rubber stopper and aluminum cap and then incubated on a thermostatic shaker operated at 220 rpm for 1 h at 31 c to achieve stable condition then concentrated solutions nano3 nano2 nh4cl na2s2o3 were injected into serum bottles with a syringe to achieve the desired initial n and s concentrations during the batch experiments 2 ml of each sample was collected at appropriate time intervals 20 60 min to measure the concentrations of thiosulfate sulfate nitrate nitrite and ammonium the concentrations of mlss and mlvss in serum bottles were determined at the end of the tests all the tests were performed in duplicate bt a and bt c were carried out for 480 min until the nitrate was completely consumed and bt b was carried out for 150 min until the nitrite was depleted 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 contributions of anammox and denitritation to the tn removal as shown in fig 1 b anammox and autotrophic denitritation are responsible for the tn removal in the tdda system because both processes can produce nitrogen gas which is then released from the system in the tdda system ammonium uptake for bacterial synthesis was neglected because of low yield coefficients hence ammonium was assumed to be removed only via anammox the contributions from the anammox αa and the autotrophic denitritation αb process to the tn removal were estimated by eq 1 and eq 2 1 αa 1 974 nh4 nremoval tnremoval 100 2 αb 100 αa where nh4 nremoval and tnremoval are the removed concentrations of ammonium mgn l and total nitrogen mgn l

nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by denitratation and then nitrite is in turn reduced to dinitrogen gas by denitritation as illustrated in fig 1a denitratation and denitritation rates are calculated as eq 3 and eq 4 respectively in the tdda system the nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by denitratation and the produced nitrite is utilized by anammox and denitritation fig 1b the rates

tdda system 2 5 analytical methods the mlss and mlvss concentrations were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 uasb influent and effluent samples were periodically collected to measure

analyzed by high throughput sequencing analysis briefly 20 ml of sludge were collected from the uasb reactor on day 52 representing the thiosulfate driven denitratation system and day 140 representing the tdda system and then stored in a freezer at 20 c until dna extraction the dna was extracted from the sludge sample using the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega usa according to manufacturer s

denitratation the thiosulfate driven denitratation process was established in 52 days and it was divided into phase 1a 0 14 d phase 1b 15 28 d and phase 1c 29 52 d the influent concentrations of ammonium and nitrate on average were 50 9 1 4 mgn l and 51 6 0 9 mgn l in phases 1a and 1b respectively then increased to 100 6 2 2 mgn l and 100 2 1 4 mgn l in phase 1c fig 2 a the average nitrate removal efficiency was 74 3 in phase 1a dramatically decreased to 33 9 in phase 1b before gradually increasing to 62 5 at the end of phase 1c fig 2c the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was below 0 2 mgn l in phase 1a and then it was observed with a maximum concentration of 3 1 mgn l in phase 1b and the nitrite accumulation ratio nar varied from 7 2 to 18 6 calculated by eq s1 the nitrite concentration in the effluent continuously increased to 32 1 mgn l with a nitrite accumulation ratio of 52 2 at the end of phase 1c fig 2a this result indicates that the thiosulfate driven denitratation was successfully developed in the reactor in contrast ammonium cannot be removed in this phase with removal efficiency below 3 5 the concentration of thiosulfate in the influent was maintained at 175 4 5 4 mg s l to achieve a s n mass ratio of 3 5 in phase 1a fig 2b when the s n ratio was decreased to 2 0 in phase 1b the influent thiosulfate was 101 6 1 9 mg s l afterwards it was increased to 201 2 2 0 mg s l in phase 1c to keep the s n ratio at 2 0 when the influent ammonium and nitrate concentrations were doubled thiosulfate was completely consumed throughout phases 1a 1c and it could not be detected in the effluent of the uasb reactor the concentration of sulfate in the influent was kept at 42 6 1 4 mg s l throughout phases 1a 1c from the mgso4 7h2o in the influent the average concentration of sulfate in the effluent was 216 7 mg s l in phase 1a and it decreased to 147 3 mg s l in phase 1b before rising to 239 7 mg s l in phase 1c during phases 1a 1c the sulfur mass balance between the influent and the effluent exceeded 95 5 δ so4 2 s δ s2o3 2 s 100 therefore all of the thiosulfate was oxidized to sulfate with no accumulation of sulfur intermediate in the reactor and this result was in line with the previous studies using thiosulfate for autotrophic denitrification manconi et al 2007 matsui and yamamoto 1986 qian et al 2018 the level of nitrite in the effluent of the uasb reactor was negligible in phase 1a suggesting that the consumed nitrate was completely reduced to dinitrogen gas this finding was similar with previous studies that nitrate could be completely reduced to dinitrogen gas without nitrite accumulation in the effluent of the reactor when the s n ratio in the influent was higher than 4 3 yamamoto ikemoto et al 2000 zou et al 2016 however the significant increase of nitrite concentration in the effluent of the uasb reactor was observed in phases 1b and 1c as the s n ratio decreased to 2 0 matsui and yamamoto 1986 observed that over 30 of nitrite accumulation ratio in the fluidized bed reactor when the s n ratio was below 2 0 in the influent qian et al 2018 also reported that when the uasb reactor conducted with s n of 1 5 nitrite accumulation ratio increased to 80 in the effluent as a result the s n ratio is a critical parameter for determining the final products in autotrophic denitrification when the system was operated under s n of 3 5 formed nitrite can be further reduced to dinitrogen gas and negligible nitrite was detected in the effluent however when s n ratio was decreased to 2 0 accumulated nitrite cannot be further reduced due to thiosulfate limitation and nitrite was retained in the effluent 3 1 2 phase 2 of the uasb thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox to develop the proposed tdda system the enriched anammox biomass was introduced to the uasb reactor on day 52 during phase 2 the uasb was continuously operated for more than 5 months 160 days to investigate the performance of the tdda bioprocess phase 2 was comprised of phase 2a tdda start up 53 129 d and phase 2b tdda stable operation 130 212 d the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the influent were kept at 101 1 1 5 and 101 2 2 2 mgn l respectively in phase 2 fig 3 a the uasb reactor immediately showed ammonium removal capability after inoculation of anammox biomass since the ammonium concentration in the effluent decreased to 75 6 mgn l on day 53 fig 3a with an ammonium removal efficiency of 24 2 fig 3c thereafter the ammonium removal efficiency gradually increased and reached 71 8 at the end of phase 2a the ammonium removal efficiency and the effluent ammonium concentration during phase 2b remained constant at 75 7 2 1 and 24 6 2 3 mgn l respectively the concentration of nitrate in the effluent decreased along with the ammonium it decreased to 11 1 mgn l at the end of phase 2a and then remained at 9 6 1 5 mgn l throughout phase 2b with a nitrate removal efficiency exceeding 90 0 the concentration of nitrite in the effluent was low with an average of 0 7 mgn l during phases 2a and 2b as the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the effluent continuously decreased the tn removal efficiency increased from 39 5 on day 53 80 3 at the end of phase 2a and thereafter remained constant at 82 5 throughout phase 2b with a tn removal rate of 0 33 kg n m³ d the ratio of consumed no3 n to consumed nh4 n was maintained at 1 20 during stable operation of the tdda system and ratio of consumed s2o3 2 s to consumed no3 n was 2 21 the influent concentration of thiosulfate was maintained at 202 5 3 2 mg s l in phases 2a and 2b this thiosulfate was completely oxidized to sulfate in the uasb and together with the influent sulfate concentration of 42 1 2 3 mg s l resulted in an effluent sulfate concentration of 242 0 4 2 mg s l the variations of sulfur compounds in the tdda system were similar to those in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system in which thiosulfate was fully oxidized to sulfate and the sulfur mass balance exceeded 95 in order to examine the effectiveness of anammox in this system the contributions of anammox and autotrophic denitritation to the tn removal were estimated by eq 1 and eq 2 at the beginning of phase 2a autotrophic denitritation comprised 38 9 of the tn removal but it decreased to 10 1 fig 3d at the end of phase 2a and remained at about 10 throughout phase 2b in contrast anammox accounted for 61 1 of the tn removal at the beginning of phase 2a then it increased to 89 9 at the end of phase 2a and remained at about 90 throughout phase 2b these outcomes confirmed that about 90 of dinitrogen gas was generated via anammox in the combined system while the autotrophic denitrification was mainly responsible for nitrate reduction to nitrite and only 10 of dinitrogen gas was produced through autotrophic denitrification this finding is consistent with the performance in deamox that anammox constituted over 80 94 of the tn removal cao et al 2016 du et al 2017 consequently the efficient nitrogen removal in the tdda system was attributed to the cooperative action between autotrophic denitratation and anammox 3 2 kinetics analysis through batch experiments 3 2 1 evaluation of thiosulfate driven denitrification activity the first batch test bt a was performed to determine autotrophic denitrification activity without anammox as shown in fig 4 a the test was divided into period 1 0 20 min and period 2 20 480 min based on different conversion rates of nitrogen and sulfur compounds the thiosulfate was rapidly depleted in period 1 with the initial concentration of 105 7 mg s l and the consumption rate was 141 0 mg s gvss h table 2 the sulfate concentration rapidly increased from 57 9 mg s l to 111 5 mg s l at a generation rate of 68 5 mg s gvss h in period 1 it then increased more gradually to 154 4 mg s l at the end of period 2 at a constant rate of 2 6 mg s gvss h unlike present study previous experiments described that the amount of thiosulfate removed was in agreement with the amount of sulfate generated in thiosulfate driven denitrification campos et al 2008 mora et al 2014 this phenomenon implies that the thiosulfate was not directly oxidized to sulfate but with sulfur intermediates formation to be discussed in section 3 3 coupled with the oxidation of thiosulfate and its intermediates the concentration of nitrate quickly declined from 55 2 mgn l to 34 6 mgn l at a rate of 26 3 mgn gvss h in period 1 table 2 then gradually decreasing to zero at a removal rate of 2 1 mgn gvss h in period 2 the concentration of nitrite quickly increased to 19 9 mgn l at a nitrite accumulation rate of 25 4 mgn gvss h in period 1 before rising slowly and continuously to 42 3 mgn l at a rate of 1 6 mgn gvss h in period 2 the nitrite accumulation ratio reached 81 7 by the end of test bt a revealed nitrite accumulation in tdda system resulting from a higher reduction rate of nitrate than nitrite as the nitrate reduction rate was 29 2 and 4 2 times higher than the nitrite reduction rate in the first and second periods table 2 nitrite concentration was continuously increasing during experiment from the two step denitrification analysis fig 1a 25 of the electrons transferred 2 67 mmol e l from thiosulfate oxidation was used in nitrite reduction to dinitrogen gas while 75 7 88 mmol e l was consumed in nitrate reduction to nitrite 3 2 2 evaluation of anammox activity the second batch test bt b was performed to determine anammox activity without thiosulfate driven denitrification as shown in fig 4b the initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations were 41 3 mgn l and 42 6 mgn l respectively the concentrations of nitrite and ammonium simultaneously decreased at the rates of 7 6 and 5 5 mgn gvss h respectively while the concentration of nitrate slowly increased at a rate of 1 4 mgn gvss h the stoichiometric ratio of the ammonium consumption rate to the nitrite consumption rate was 1 38 and it was slightly higher than 1 32 1 33 obtained from enriched anammox culture in sbr and uasb reactors jetten et al 1998 tang et al 2011 3 2 3 evaluation of thiosulfate denitrification and anammox activities the third batch test bt c was carried out to simultaneously investigate the autotrophic denitrification and anammox activities described in fig 4c the conversions of thiosulfate and sulfate were similar to observation in the bt a in period 1 thiosulfate was completely consumed in 20 min at a rate of 133 7 mg s gvss h and about half of thiosulfate was converted to sulfate at a production rate of 70 7 mg s gvss h table 2 in period 2 the sulfate increased slowly to 162 9 mg s l at the end of experiment with a sulfate generation rate of 3 3 mg s gvss h nitrite increased to its peak of 20 3 mgn l at the end of period 1 the accumulated nitrite was then entirely consumed within 150 min afterwards the nitrite cannot be detected in the period 2 the concentration of nitrate dropped from 55 3 mgn l to 32 5 mgn l at a removal rate of 29 5 mgn gvss h in period 1 nitrate then dropped more gradually at 3 0 mgn gvss h in period 2 and it was depleted within 420 min the level of ammonium dropped from 54 5 mgn l to 52 9 mgn l in period 1 at a consumption rate of 2 0 mgn gvss h in period 2 the ammonium removal rate stayed at 5 3 mgn gvss h from 20 to 150 min in the presence of nitrite in the bulk liquid the ammonium removal rate then decreased and remained at 1 4 mgn gvss h after the formed nitrite concentration decreased to zero in the rest of period 2 from 150 to 420 min the ammonium concentration was finally reduced to 11 2 mgn l at the end of period 2 about 19 6 of the produced nitrite from nitrate reduction was reduced to dinitrogen gas by denitritation in the tdda system whereas 80 4 of the produced nitrite from denitratation was utilized by anammox and this was in agreement with nitrite accumulation ratio of 81 7 in bt a the ratio of removed no3 n to removed nh4 n and removed s2o3 2 s was 1 0 78 1 89 the stoichiometric value of the s n ratio for full denitrification was the 3 68 mora et al 2014 both nitrate and nitrite were entirely removed in this test and this result proved that tdda can largely reduce the thiosulfate electron donor demand by 49 compared with complete thiosulfate driven denitrification 3 3 speculated mechanisms in tdda system as mentioned above denitritation was less competitive than denitratation and anammox in the tdda system the reaction rates of denitritation denitratation and anammox could be obtained from the third batch test bt c the denitratation rate was about 22 7 times higher than the denitritation rate in period 1 and it was 2 1 4 4 times higher than denitritation in period 2 the electrons consumption in nitrate reduction 9 05 mmol e l were 3 35 times higher than nitrite reduction 2 70 mmol e l calculated from the two step denitrification analysis fig 1b the outcomes confirmed that denitratation has a higher activity than denitritation in the tdda system furthermore anammox was more competitive for nitrite utilization than denitritation the nitrite consumption rate of anammox 6 2 mgn gvss h was 4 4 times higher than the rate of denitritation 1 4 mgn gvss h when nitrite was present in the bulk liquid when the accumulated nitrite in the bulk liquid was completely depleted in period 2 the nitrite generated through the slow denitratation was consumed by anammox at 1 7 mgn gvss h which was still 3 4 higher than the denitritation rate 0 5 mgn gvss h the anammox has a higher activity than denitritation possibly due to its higher affinity to nitrite than denitritation as reported in the literature anammox bacteria have a high affinity for nitrite because of their unique anammoxosome membrane and nitrite transporters damste et al 2002 van niftrik and jetten 2012 for example the half saturation constants ks for nitrite of anammox were 0 2 35 μg l awata et al 2013 lotti et al 2014 while thiosulfate driven denitritation has a relatively low affinity for nitrite with a ks of 2 3 mgn l mora et al 2015 based on the observations in bt a and bt c the sulfate production rates were about half of the thiosulfate removal rate table 2 in period 1 then sulfate generation rate dramatically dropped by about 95 in period 2 also the medium became milky during the experiments based on the formation of the suspended material and sulfur unbalance between thiosulfate and sulfate it was postulated that sulfite and elemental sulfur were formed as intermediates during thiosulfate oxidation in batch tests schedel and truper 1980 studied the anaerobic oxidation of thiosulfate with thiobacillus denitrificans by radioactively labelled sulfur atoms and results revealed that thiosulfate oxidation started with splitting between sulfane and sulfone sulfur and then produced sulfite and elemental sulfur were separately oxidized branched thiosulfate oxidation as reported by hooper and dispirito 1985 that sulfite can be directly and rapidly oxidized to sulfate by the sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase inside the periplasm while the accumulated elemental sulfur was less active than produced sulfite schedel and truper 1980 hence it was speculated that this branched thiosulfate oxidation process s2o3 2 so3 2 s0 occurred firstly in the tdda process followed by the so3 2 and s0 oxidation coupled with the fast and slow denitratation respectively the different kinetic results between this experiment and previous studies campos et al 2008 mora et al 2014 qian et al 2018 were attributed to the multiple pathways of thiosulfate oxidation in sob as it was proposed that thiosulfate could be oxidized to sulfate by three completely different pathways lens and pol 2000 in order to further prove elemental sulfur formation in thiosulfate oxidation pathway a simplified kinetic model was developed to reveal the mechanisms of thiosulfate oxidation and nitrogen removal in the tdda system the model stoichiometric matrix is summarized in table s3 and the kinetic parameters are shown in table s4 the modelled results are presented in fig 4 the coefficients of determination r2 for ammonium nitrate sulfate and thiosulfate all exceeded 0 98 for the model of bt c table s5 indicating that the proposed model is able to describe the kinetic behavior of nitrogen and sulfur compounds moreover a check of the mass and element balance of the stoichiometry using the excel spreadsheet of the gujer matrix showed that all of the elements balanced therefore elemental sulfur was considered as an intermediate during thiosulfate oxidation in this study intermediates in thiosulfate oxidation will be quantified and the thiosulfate oxidation pathway will be determined in future studies 3 4 microbial community analysis the phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences was conducted at genus levels fig 5 the shannon index for the first and second samples were 4 11 and 3 21 and the simpson s diversity index were 0 06 and 0 22 respectively suggesting higher evenness and diversity in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system than the tdda system at the phylum level proteobacteria 41 33 68 33 planctomycetes 0 69 3 31 ignavibacteriae 0 85 3 24 chloroflexi 1 07 6 00 bacteroidetes 11 69 35 70 and armatimonadetes 0 68 1 65 were dominant in both microbial communities in the first sludge sample the functional bacteria in genus level were thiobacillus 21 53 thermomonas 0 54 ottowia 0 51 and sulfurimonas 0 41 fig 5 these four strains all belong to the proteobacteria phylum accounting for 41 33 of total relative abundance in the thiosulfate driven denitratation system the reduced sulfur compounds can be used by these four groups as electron donor to reduce nitrate or nitrite and hydrogen can also be used by sulfurimonas han and perner 2015 and ottowia is capable of utilizing organics for facultative anaerobic growth spring et al 2004 although no organics were added in the influent of the uasb reactor in this study heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria were still detected in the communities such as flavobacterium 2 18 terrimonas 1 29 and phaeodactylibacter 0 82 these heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria may also contribute to nitrate reduction in the reactor which could use organic matter liberated from the endogenous metabolism lysis and death of autotrophic bacteria okabe et al 2011 no strains belonging to the anammox genus were detected in the first sludge sample in accordance with negligible ammonium removal efficiency of the reactor in phase 1 in the second sludge sample the relative abundance of thiobacillus decreased to 3 46 while the number for sulfurimonas increased to 3 92 thermomonas and ottowia strains disappeared from the tdda system denitrifying bacteria using organic carbon were also detected in tdda system such as simplicispira 1 94 and flavobacterium 0 71 the high abundance of aeromonas was observed in the second sludge sample and it was reported that these bacteria are fermentative and facultative anaerobic and plays an important role in biofilm formation talagrand reboul et al 2017 meanwhile two groups belonging to the planctomycetes phylum and representing two anammox genera were detected in the tdda system with ca kuenenia 1 27 and ca anammoxoglobus 1 12 it has been reported that ca kuenenia are r strategists with a high affinity for ammonium and nitrite oshiki et al 2016 and ca anammoxoglobus are capable of co oxidation of propionate and ammonium in the presence of ammonium nitrite and nitrate kartal et al 2007 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria in the tdda system was in the similar range of other anammox based processes 1 7 3 du et al 2017 xie et al 2018 such community composition confirmed that sob can coexist with anammox bacteria in one reactor 4 conclusions the feasibility of developing a thiosulfate driven denitratation and anammox tdda process was investigated in a lab scale uasb reactor the following conclusions could be drawn from this study the tdda process can be stably operated to treat nitrate and ammonium contained wastewater with tn removal efficiency of 82 5 anammox and denitritation were responsible for about 90 and 10 of the tn removal respectively compared with complete thiosulfate driven denitrification the tdda process can reduce the electron consumption by about 49 the branched thiosulfate oxidation generated sulfur intermediates sulfite and elemental sulfur for fast and slow denitratation sob and anammox bacteria functioned symbiotically together acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the hong kong innovation and

18583,urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa rather than through the emergent properties of communities here we use replicated catchment scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs we postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year 2016 2017 at 18 sites across 3 river systems in south wales united kingdom contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality with small increases in nitrate phosphate temperature conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates however were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by i reduced taxonomic and functional diversity ii simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance and iii reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus although correlative and partially confounded by other effects these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population community and ecosystem level effects in urban river systems and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution

runoff thus also potentially generating the largest ecological effects dyer and wang 2002 the effects of anthropogenic contaminants on individual organisms are relatively well understood and include mouthpart deformities reduced reproductive capability and increased mortality see colborn et al 1993 jobling et al 1998 tyler et al 1998 watts et al 2003 segner et al 2003 at higher levels of biological organisation however understanding of chemical effects is more restricted gavrilescu et al 2015 petrie et al 2015 windsor et al 2018 specifically there is a need for research assessing the effects of xenobiotic chemicals across communities and food webs to understand more accurately the risk of these pollutants in natural systems windsor et al 2018 assessing the effects of pollutants in the field is not straightforward and requires some understanding of the changing context in which urban pollution is managed the systematic regulation of conventional and toxic pollutants through national and european union directives e g urban wastewater treatment directive 91 271 eec water framework directive 2000 60 ec alongside advances in urban water treatment have led to significant reductions in the concentration of hazardous organic compounds within the uk and across europe eggen et al 2014 in particular improvements in contemporary sewage treatment such as the growing use of activated sludge processes has enabled the more effective removal of organic matter nitrate phosphate suspended sediments and many contaminants from effluents ahmed et al 2017 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 subsequently there have been improvements over recent decades in water quality and biological diversity in rivers downstream of urban areas at least in western europe brosnan and o shea 1996 vaughan and ormerod 2012 in spite of these improvements a range of contaminants still persist in urban runoff at low but toxic concentrations blackburn and waldock 1995 purdom et al 1994 zhou et al 2009 moreover biological recovery from the effects of past insanitary pollution is still only partial in england and wales with rivers in urban location still supporting only 60 of the macroinvertebrate families found in non urban catchments vaughan and ormerod 2012 parallel evidence suggests also that toxic substances might now affect clean water organisms such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus that are recolonising formerly polluted urban river systems morrissey et al 2013a b 2014 we looked to assess whether similar effects might explain the current status and incomplete recovery of communities of river organisms or the food webs of which they constitute from past pollution specifically we aimed to assess the putative effects of persistent xenobiotic pollution on the structure and function of riverine macroinvertebrate communities and food webs as a potential explanation for the incomplete recovery of urban rivers in britain from past insanitary pollution vaughan and ormerod 2012 within this over arching hypothesis we predicted that 1 food web structure will relate to the levels of urban wastewater contamination in river systems 2 the ecological function of river food webs defined by the diversity of biological traits will be negatively related to the levels of urban pollution 3 emergent effects resulting from changes in macroinvertebrate community and food web structure are present in urban river systems 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sites eighteen sites across south wales were used to assess relationships between urban effluents on macroinvertebrate communities fig 1 sample sites were paired upstream or downstream of wwtws and located across a gradient of urban land use 0 11 33 50 km2 and other urban pollution point sources up and down stream sites were within 1 km of one another and were selected to minimise differences in meso habitat conditions between locations for example substratum conditions depth and current velocity sites were situated across three hydrological catchments taff usk and wye each of which has a distinct land use history the taff catchment has historically supported heavy industrial activity related to coal mining and gasification scullion and edwards 1980 and the area remains heavily urbanised in contrast the usk and wye catchments are more rural with agricultural management practices dominating land use typically livestock grazing the inter catchment differences in land use generate variation in the environmental conditions and allow for different environmental contexts burdon et al 2016 contributing land cover including urban land km2 was determined for the upstream catchment of each sample site using jncc phase 1 habitat classification data jnnc 2010 in conjunction with spatial tools for the analysis of river systems stars and spatial stream network ssn ver hoef et al 2014 effluent discharge from wwtws was recorded as the dry weather average m3 s 1 collated from the regulatory consents from the government sponsored regulator nrw natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved river discharge m3 s 1 data were also collated from nrw river gauging stations proximal to the sample sites and summarised as the mean daily discharge over the monitoring period or as q95 low flow appendix s1 at sites downstream of wwtws the ratio of wastewater effluent to mean annual river discharge was highly variable enabling a gradient of environmental conditions across the landscape table 1 invertebrate communities across the catchments have a similar structure dominated by ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera diptera and coleoptera typical of relatively base rich stony streams and are derived from a wider regional species pool present across south wales appendix s2 2 2 physicochemical characterisation a series of physicochemical variables were measured to assess the effects of urban land cover and wastewater effluent on the water quality of stream reaches monthly spot measurements of water temperature c electrical conductivity ec μs cm total dissolved solids tds mg l and ph were used to assess changes in water chemistry in response to urban wastewater effluent following previous practice igbinosa and okoh 2009 water quality analyses 2015 2017 carried out by nrw natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved were also used as environmental covariates to account for potential variation in other water quality metrics one constraint was that these data were available only downstream of wwtws because these specific nrw monitoring sites specifically monitor water chemistry downstream of urban areas and wwtw effluent discharges table 1 and appendix s1 to account for the potential confounding effects of physical conditions on invertebrates including riparian cover channel morphology and benthic sediment character we used the river habitat survey rhs raven et al 1998 to generate a habitat quality hqa and modification score hms as well as riparian quality index rqi for each of the sample sites 2 3 chemical analyses the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes were measured in invertebrates across sample sites downstream of urban areas and effluent discharges n 9 for the specific purposes of this paper we use body burden data for pcbs and pbdes to provide a spatio temporally averaged measure of persistent contamination with concentrations of bioaccumulative chemicals in organisms assumed to reflect long term exposure concentrations schäfer et al 2015 these chemicals have a high toxicity are hydrophobic and partition into sedimentary organic matter phases in freshwater environments leading to likely interaction with benthic invertebrates karickhoff et al 1979 over 2016 may september benthic invertebrate taxa heptageniidae baetidae leuctridae hydropsychidae rhyacophilidae were sampled for each sample n 44 multiple individuals of each taxa n 50 200 were pooled to collect a 1 2 g of sample gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was then used to quantify the concentration of pcbs and pbdes in samples of each taxa across sites the total concentration of pcbs and pbdes ng g wet weight was aggregated and standardised based on the biomass of sampled invertebrates at each site g m 2 see appendix s3 to provide a measure of the level of persistent contamination in the invertebrate food web weighted ng g ww a full description of sample collection and analysis is provided in appendix s3 2 4 macroinvertebrate community structure macroinvertebrate communities were characterised by three pooled hess 1941 samples 165 cm2 500 μm mesh gauge per sampling occasion at each site intended to collect from the dominant benthic habitats present within each stream reach beisel et al 1998 samples were collected monthly over 2016 2017 and preserved on site in 70 ethanol before subsequent sorting and identification macroscopically to the lowest practical taxonomic resolution minimum of family and species where possible the final dataset comprised multivariate community level taxonomic data across the 18 sites taxonomic data were summarised using common metrics including species richness total abundance and simpson s index si 1 d simpson 1949 to assess any landscape level taxonomic homogenisation of macroinvertebrate communities that occurs in response to wwtw discharges the chao index of similarity chao et al 2005 was computed for independent pair wise comparisons upstream upstream and downstream downstream of effluent discharge points 2 5 macroinvertebrate community function to parameterise macroinvertebrate communty function we generated a functional dataset through linking taxonomic information to a series of fuzzy coded trait data derived from the european trait database tachet et al 2002 these data were also supplemented by non fuzzy categorised feeding guild data for macroinvertebrate taxa of the south wales i durance s j ormerod unpublished data this dataset was used to understand trait variation in response to urban land cover and effluent discharges but also to calculate the functional diversity of communities for each community we calculated inter taxon functional metrics with this approach being preferred over the mean taxon method due to risks in the latter of systematic and detrimental exclusion of important within taxon functional trait variability violle et al 2012 our approach followed gutiérrez cánovas et al 2015 in that a subset of traits related urban land cover and effluent concentrations were selected based on the values of individual pearson correlations traits with an average absolute coefficient of r 0 40 were included for the calculation of functional diversity for the sub set of selected traits assessments of inter taxon functional diversity were completed by defining a multidimensional euclidean space where axes summarised variation in traits subsequently taxon functional richness tfric as well as community functional richness fric dispersion fdis similarity fsim and redundancy fred were calculated at sample sites specific definitions of these functional metrics are provided in appendix s4 2 6 macroinvertebrate food webs food webs for each sample site were constructed from pooled annual macroinvertebrate data using computational methodology outlined in gray et al 2015 based on an r function webbuilder in conjunction with the cheddar package hudson et al 2013 the method used community data in conjunction with a reference dataset of 20 000 freshwater trophic interactions brose et al 2005 gray et al 2015 quantitative network metrics were calculated to describe food web structure connectance link density mean chain length generality number of resources per consumer and vulnerability number of consumers per resource bersier et al 2002 2 7 statistical analyses the potential effects of urban contamination on the structure and function of macroinvertebrate communities were investigated using r statistical software version 3 2 3 r core team 2015 prior to further analysis data were explored following zuur et al 2010 to check for normality heteroscedasticity and outliers in the data and to select statistical tests generalised linear models glms and generalised linear mixed models glmms the latter fitted using the package lme4 bates et al 2015 were used to assess the relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity food web characteristics and urban pollution where required catchment was included as a random effect to account for broad scale biogeographical patterns of species distribution grönroos and heino 2012 from broad model structures including a wide range of candidate variables arable land cover urban land cover water temperature total dissolved solids wwtw effluent discharge model selection was completed using both shrinkage and backward selection methods marra and wood 2011 validation procedures following zuur et al 2007 and thomas et al 2015 were used to assess the validity and robustness of statistical analyses for each model residual normality was assessed using qq plots homogeneity of variance was determined by plotting residuals against fitted values and influential observations were investigated using cook s leverage distances chao index values were non normal yet sample sizes were equal and between group variance was homogenous thus kruskal wallis rank sum tests ruxton and beauchamp 2008 were selected for analysis multivariate analyses were used to assess invertebrate community structure and function non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination was utilised to visualise the multivariate relationships nmds was computed using the jaccard index jaccard 1908 with a square root transformation and wisconsin double standardisation to account for variation associated with both common and rare taxa within the dataset kenkel and orloci 1986 multivariate glms constructed using the mvabund package wang et al 2012 were used to assess taxonomic responses and identify the dominant species contributing to observed patterns the relationships between macroinvertebrate community function and urban pollution sources were assessed using r mode linked to q mode rlq and fourth corner analysis following dray et al 2014 this allowed for links to be drawn between species trait and environmental datasets a modelling framework was not used to combine rlq with fourth corner analysis see ter braak et al 2017 multivariate methods taxonomic and functional metrics were applied to assess the responses of food webs to urban pollution 3 results 3 1 community structure along a gradient of urban land cover

persistent contaminants and urban land cover for example the mean chain length decreased within increasing levels of pcbs pbdes and urban land cover r2 0 72 f2 6 7 58 p 0 023 further relationships between a wider range of diversity and food web metrics are presented in appendix s5 4 discussion although there is evidence of recovery in the uk s urban rivers from the past effects of gross pollution previous studies have reported only partial recovery for benthic invertebrates vaughan and ormerod 2012 and fish mawle and milner 2008 our data confirm that the structure functional diversity and food web character of invertebrate communities remain impaired in the urban river systems of south wales urban effects on ionic composition or habitat structure could not be eliminated entirely as an explanation but relationships between water quality or habitat indices and urban land cover or wastewater discharge in the rivers studied were relatively weak in contrast selected persistent contaminants pcbs and pbdes occurred at significantly higher concentrations in invertebrates downstream of urban pollution sources in combination these data offer support for the hypothesis that contaminant mixtures might explain the incomplete recovery of macroinvertebrate food webs from the past effects of gross pollution though this support is qualified by the possibility that other stressors associated with urban stream systems might also be involved our data also add a novel dimension to understanding contaminant effects on river organisms through the indicating potential food webs responses to persistent pollution as with all field studies of this type our results are subject to several caveats first and most important the relationships detected between urban land cover contaminants and macroinvertebrate communities were correlative and do not necessarily reflect cause effect links in particular urbanisation causes a range of changes in river systems in addition to pollution for example altering habitat structure temperature regimes discharge and night time light regimes in ways that confound straightforward interpretation paul and meyer 2001 in this study at least limited alterations in general water quality nitrate phosphate temperature ec and tds in urban locations reduce the likelihood that the biological effects attributed to persistent contamination were in fact related predominantly to conventional pollution further although we measured just two groups of chemicals pcbs and pbdes these hydrophobic compounds readily enter the benthic habitats of river systems and are likely to interact more strongly with benthic invertebrates than various other contaminants notably hydrophilic water bound contaminants they are also have long residence times and high bioavailability in the benthic environment gaskell et al 2007 these compounds are also likely to be representative of a larger array of persistent contaminants in urban river systems pal et al 2014 thus there is a strong likelihood that effects ascribed here to these two groups in reality relate to a combination effect of wider range of covariate pollutants e g heavy metals plastics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and perfluorinated alkyl compounds a second caveat is that our study used relatively few sites instead focusing on the detailed parameterisation of biological communities and thus the identification of putative ecological responses to pollution on one hand this restricts the spatial coverage of findings yet previous studies operating at broader spatial scales e g national monitoring e g dyer and wang 2002 often compromise on biological detail by limiting metrics to sensitive taxa or univariate metrics of community structure e g species at risk index munz et al 2017 overall while our data provide an indication of the potential effects of urban pollutants on river food webs we suggest that the results are interpreted with the above limitations in mind the low flow and mean flow contribution of wastewater effluent to stream systems in this study 0 5 6 1 and 0 02 1 09 respectively initially appear low compared to other published literature 30 50 rueda et al 2002 in part this reflects the long standing regulation of sewage volumes relative to the discharge of the rivers that receive them moreover there are good reasons to believe that even these low effluent contributions could still generate ecological effects firstly we calculated the relative contribution of effluent from the individual inputs of wwtws rather than the total volume of upstream effluent input e g 82 in the river lea harries et al 1996 secondly using mean daily river discharge in the calculation of dilution factors provides conservative estimates of the total effluent contributions 0 02 1 09 in comparison to low flow values 0 5 6 1 this is especially important considering the rapid hydrological response of these piedmont river systems in a region of high rainfall for example the range of river discharge recorded 2016 2017 at the gauging station proximal to t1 river taff was 1 54 83 90 m3 s 1 natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved thirdly although the relative contribution of effluent appeared low compared with other studies in dryland regions e g mediterranean streams our results are corroborated by work elsewhere that has demonstrated significant effects on river food webs where total effective contributions of effluent averaged 3 debruyn et al 2003 finally the relative contribution of effluent is based on discharge volume hence only provides a crude indication of potential strength of effects which depend also on effluent toxicity effluent composition by source e g industrial domestic and the effectiveness of any treatment processes dyer and wang 2002 in these same rivers even with low apparent contributions effluent contributions to river runoff are sufficient to alter stable isotopic character of freshwater invertebrates suggesting substantial effects on macro nutrient fluxes morrissey et al 2013a notwithstanding the relatively small proportionate contribution to flow volume our findings suggest that differences in invertebrate community and food web character in urban landscapes are strongly associated with wastewater discharges and the accompanying higher levels of pcbs and pbdes contamination these associations occurred in spite of only minor differences in other measured physicochemical factors that could explain reduced biological diversity in urban river systems notably water temperature conductivity dissolved solids nitrate phosphate and habitat character vaughan and ormerod 2012 while improvements in wastewater treatment have reduced gross pollution problems across urban river systems in england and wales sufficiently to allow clean water species such as atlantic salmon salmo salar linnaeus 1758 to recolonise mawle and milner 2008 changes in invertebrate richness and composition do not yet show full recovery maltby and ormerod 2011 vaughan and ormerod 2012 inputs into rivers of both persistent and current use pollutants in urban areas from general runoff storm drains combined sewer overflows and wastewater discharges therefore offer a plausible explanation for the limited observed recovery from past pollution indeed previous data from these rivers show that wastewater discharges are sufficient to change the stable isotopic signatures of river organisms implying the involvement of wastewater in energy and nutrient additions in food webs morrissey et al 2013a further to this the occurrence of persistent organic contaminants in apex predators such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus along the same rivers at concentrations that have been implicated in negative ecotoxicological effects morrissey et al 2013b 2014 although the toxicological data for the effects of modern or legacy xenobiotic substances on invertebrates are still scarce windsor et al 2018 based on rudimentary environmental quality standards eqsbiota values for pbdes european commission 2013 the raw concentration data of pbde congeners 28 47 99 100 153 and 154 observed in invertebrates herein 0 07 7 61 ng g ww are representative of potential ecological effects 0 0085 ng g ww directive 2008 105 eu thus further supporting the observed alterations in invertebrate communities these risk thresholds however are generalised across fish molluscs crustaceans and other biota thus a key question that follows is whether the concentrations pbdes pcbs and other urban contaminants were sufficiently high in invertebrates to cause any ecotoxicological effects that might explain the observed food web impairment or reduced diversity certainly compared to other studies on similar invertebrate taxa the levels of both pcbs 0 18 36 28 ng g ww and pbdes 0 08 7 61 ng g ww appear similar if not marginally higher than in other studies in urban river systems pcbs 1 81 22 07 ng g ww walters et al 2008 and pbdes 1 20 13 8 ng g ww de boer et al 2003 the largest needs overall are for a more complete understanding of the exact array of contaminants present in urban rivers coupled with ecotoxicological assessments focusing on the effects of urban chemical mixtures under both field and controlled laboratory conditions the detection of an interaction between urban land cover and the presence of wastewater discharges further highlights the importance appraising the environmental context in which the effects of pollution occur see burdon et al 2016 in our case urban land cover and wwtw discharges appeared to act together in reducing biodiversity while wastewater discharges in less urbanised sites had more restricted effects on the structure and function of invertebrate communities the higher concentrations of persistent pollutants nitrate phosphate in combination with reduced habitat quality in urban stream systems appeared to alter food web structure and function with wwtw discharges compounding effects through pollutant addition the trend observed here contrasts with one case study in which wastewater discharges in swiss rural stream systems had greater effects yet this is possibly because pollutant loads in the streams investigated streams were dominated by pesticides from agricultural run off burdon et al 2016 munz et al 2017 certainly the structure of invertebrate communities is influenced by pesticides often from agricultural sources beketov et al 2013 the influence of agricultural pollution and pesticides in the current study however cannot be excluded as these compounds are also emitted from both wwtws and other sources in agricultural regions bunzel et al 2013 münze et al 2017 although the concentration and composition of xenobiotic pollution may vary between river systems in agricultural and urban regions it is apparent from this study and others that the combination of pollution from the wider catchment and wwtw discharges are responsible for generating reductions in the structural and functional diversity of invertebrate communities in addition to identifying the potential role for contaminants in slowing the recovery of urban rivers from gross pollution a novel aspect of our study was the assessment of food web effects of pollution such assessments are infrequent with studies instead focusing on individual and population level responses windsor et al 2018 our data has revealed a series of potential emergent effects on food webs in response to contamination in urban river systems including a reduction in connectance and link density that is indicative of food web simplification such effects on food webs although suspected from previous isotope analyses di lascio et al 2013 have not previously been shown additionally we identified how urban pollution could cause a range of functional alterations among invertebrate communities through trait based analyses this included reductions in the relative abundance of aerially dispersing taxa at polluted urbanised sites that if pronounced could have implications for prey subsidies to riparian zones through reduced matter and energy transfer kautza and sullivan 2015 such effects may in turn impact predators such as bats that prey on insects emerging from rivers and can be affected by changes in the prey spectrum available abbott et al 2009 as well as consequences for riparian organisms dependent on emergent prey the simplification of aquatic food webs at polluted urban sites also has the potential to affect aquatic apex predators a range of clean water vertebrates rely on macroinvertebrate prey in rivers including salmonid fish bell et al 1994 and river birds that have recently recolonised the uk s recovering urban river systems ormerod 1985 ormerod and tyler 1991 mawle and milner 2008 the observed reductions in the density of several macroinvertebrate taxa in the urban rivers of south wales e g hydropsyche spp rhyacophila spp and leuctra spp is likely important for apex predators for example these taxa would normally form a large component of the diet of the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus linnaeus 1758 ormerod 1985 these prey items are nutritionally important for both adults and juveniles and any reductions in their density in the benthos could carry significant energetic costs o halloran et al 1990 any such indirect effects of contamination on prey available to dippers alongside direct effects generated by the enhanced bioaccumulation of toxic xenobiotic pollutants morrissey et al 2013b would be consistent with their inferior body condition along urban rivers in south wales morrissey et al 2014 5 conclusion in conclusion despite improving water quality and increasing invertebrate richness in urban river systems across the uk over the past 30 years our data from study sites in south wales provide evidence that xenobiotic contaminants could offer a potential explanation for the incomplete recovery in the structure and function of biological communities in these same rivers simplified macroinvertebrate food webs alterations in trait character and reduced functional diversity could all have implications for vertebrates that depend on river production while also offering biological indications of progress towards recovery that are not normally appraised

18583,urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa rather than through the emergent properties of communities here we use replicated catchment scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs we postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year 2016 2017 at 18 sites across 3 river systems in south wales united kingdom contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality with small increases in nitrate phosphate temperature conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates however were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by i reduced taxonomic and functional diversity ii simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance and iii reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus although correlative and partially confounded by other effects these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population community and ecosystem level effects in urban river systems and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodiversity ecosystems food webs functional diversity macroinvertebrates persistent organic pollutants 1 introduction urban landscapes across the world are linked with effects on water quantity and reduced quality that reflect factors such increased population density waste disposal flow modification river habitat modification and increased water temperatures dudgeon et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2008 reid et al 2018 among these effects water pollution is one of the most pervasive and has recognised detrimental impacts on river biota harding et al 1998 moss 2008 relyea 2005 schulz 2004 while also representing risks to human health schwarzenbach et al 2010 a large number of pollutants reach river systems from point and diffuse sources walsh 2000 bester et al 2008 heeb et al 2012 and in urban systems these include impervious urban surfaces stormwater systems wastewater treatment works wwtws combined sewage overflows and industry discharges pitt et al 1995 feng et al 1998 phillips et al 2012 krein et al 2013 wastewaters are typically dominated by organic compounds sediments and nutrients but they also contain low levels of xenobiotic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals as well as other pollutants that reach sewers from surface drains discharges from industry depend on the specific processes involved but often involve low concentrations of toxic substances either of emerging concern or legacy pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes or non brominated flame retardants fu et al 2003 owens et al 2001 for all urban pollution sources the relative discharge and chemical composition is inherently dependent upon population density demography and the types of anthropogenic activity within the upstream contributing catchment taebi and droste 2004 consequently areas with high population density and high urban land cover contribute most effluent and xenobiotic pollutants as a proportion of river runoff thus also potentially generating the largest ecological effects dyer and wang 2002 the effects of anthropogenic contaminants on individual organisms are relatively well understood and include mouthpart deformities reduced reproductive capability and increased mortality see colborn et al 1993 jobling et al 1998 tyler et al 1998 watts et al 2003 segner et al 2003 at higher levels of biological organisation however understanding of chemical effects is more restricted gavrilescu et al 2015 petrie et al 2015 windsor et al 2018 specifically there is a need for research assessing the effects of xenobiotic chemicals across communities and food webs to understand more accurately the risk of these pollutants in natural systems windsor et al 2018 assessing the effects of pollutants in the field is not straightforward and requires some understanding of the changing context in which urban pollution is managed the systematic regulation of conventional and toxic pollutants through national and european union directives e g urban wastewater treatment directive 91 271 eec water framework directive 2000 60 ec alongside advances in urban water treatment have led to significant reductions in the concentration of hazardous organic compounds within the uk and across europe eggen et al 2014 in particular improvements in contemporary sewage treatment such as the growing use of activated sludge processes has enabled the more effective removal of organic matter nitrate phosphate suspended sediments and many contaminants from effluents ahmed et al 2017 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 subsequently there have been improvements over recent decades in water quality and biological diversity in rivers downstream of urban areas at least in western europe brosnan and o shea 1996 vaughan and ormerod 2012 in spite of these improvements a range of contaminants still persist in urban runoff at low but toxic concentrations blackburn and waldock 1995 purdom et al 1994 zhou et al 2009 moreover biological recovery from the effects of past insanitary pollution is still only partial in england and wales with rivers in urban location still supporting only 60 of the macroinvertebrate families found in non urban catchments vaughan and ormerod 2012 parallel evidence suggests also that toxic substances might now affect clean water organisms such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus that are recolonising formerly polluted urban river systems morrissey et al 2013a b 2014 we looked to assess whether similar effects might explain the current status and incomplete recovery of communities of river organisms or the food webs of which they constitute from past pollution specifically we aimed to assess the putative effects of persistent xenobiotic pollution on the structure and function of riverine macroinvertebrate communities and food webs as a potential explanation for the incomplete recovery of urban rivers in britain from past insanitary pollution vaughan and ormerod 2012 within this over arching hypothesis we predicted that 1 food web structure will relate to the levels of urban wastewater contamination in river systems 2 the ecological function of river food webs defined by the diversity of biological traits will be negatively related to the levels of urban pollution 3 emergent effects resulting from changes in macroinvertebrate community and food web structure are present in urban river systems 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sites eighteen sites across south wales were used to assess relationships between urban effluents on macroinvertebrate communities fig 1 sample sites were paired upstream or downstream of wwtws and located across a gradient of urban land use 0 11 33 50 km2 and other urban pollution point sources up and down stream sites were within 1 km of one another and were selected to minimise differences in meso habitat conditions between locations for example substratum conditions depth and current velocity sites were situated across three hydrological catchments taff usk and wye each of which has a distinct land use history the taff catchment has historically supported heavy industrial activity related to coal mining and gasification scullion and edwards 1980 and the area remains heavily urbanised in contrast the usk and wye catchments are more rural with agricultural management practices dominating land use typically livestock grazing the inter catchment differences in land use generate variation in the environmental conditions and allow for different environmental contexts burdon et al 2016 contributing land cover including urban land km2 was determined for the upstream catchment of each sample site using jncc phase 1 habitat classification data jnnc 2010 in conjunction with spatial tools for the analysis of river systems stars and spatial stream network ssn ver hoef et al 2014 effluent discharge from wwtws was recorded as the dry weather average m3 s 1 collated from the regulatory consents from the government sponsored regulator nrw natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved river discharge m3 s 1 data were also collated from nrw river gauging stations proximal to the sample sites and summarised as the mean daily discharge over the monitoring period or as q95 low flow appendix s1 at sites downstream of wwtws the ratio of wastewater effluent to mean annual river discharge was highly variable enabling a gradient of environmental conditions across the landscape table 1 invertebrate communities across the catchments have a similar structure dominated by ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera diptera and coleoptera typical of relatively base rich stony streams and are derived from a wider regional species pool present across south wales appendix s2 2 2 physicochemical characterisation a series of physicochemical variables were measured to assess the effects of urban land cover and wastewater effluent on the water quality of stream reaches monthly spot measurements of water temperature c electrical conductivity ec μs cm total dissolved solids tds mg l and ph were used to assess changes in water chemistry in response to urban wastewater effluent following previous practice igbinosa and okoh 2009 water quality analyses 2015 2017 carried out by nrw natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved were also used as environmental covariates to account for potential variation in other water quality metrics one constraint was that these data were available only downstream of wwtws because these specific nrw monitoring sites specifically monitor water chemistry downstream of urban areas and wwtw effluent discharges table 1 and appendix s1 to account for the potential confounding effects of physical conditions on invertebrates including riparian cover channel morphology and benthic sediment character we used the river habitat survey rhs raven et al 1998 to generate a habitat quality hqa and modification score hms as well as riparian quality index rqi for each of the sample sites 2 3 chemical analyses the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes were measured in invertebrates across sample sites downstream of urban areas and effluent discharges n 9 for the specific purposes of this paper we use body burden data for pcbs and pbdes to provide a spatio temporally averaged measure of persistent contamination with concentrations of bioaccumulative chemicals in organisms assumed to reflect long term exposure concentrations schäfer et al 2015 these chemicals have a high toxicity are hydrophobic and partition into sedimentary organic matter phases in freshwater environments leading to likely interaction with benthic invertebrates karickhoff et al 1979 over 2016 may september benthic invertebrate taxa heptageniidae baetidae leuctridae hydropsychidae rhyacophilidae were sampled for each sample n 44 multiple individuals of each taxa n 50 200 were pooled to collect a 1 2 g of sample gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was then used to quantify the concentration of pcbs and pbdes in samples of each taxa across sites the total concentration of pcbs and pbdes ng g wet weight was aggregated and standardised based on the biomass of sampled invertebrates at each site g m 2 see appendix s3 to provide a measure of the level of persistent contamination in the invertebrate food web weighted ng g ww a full description of sample collection and analysis is provided in appendix s3 2 4 macroinvertebrate community structure macroinvertebrate communities were characterised by three pooled hess 1941 samples 165 cm2 500 μm mesh gauge per sampling occasion at each site intended to collect from the dominant benthic habitats present within each stream reach beisel et al 1998 samples were collected monthly over 2016 2017 and preserved on site in 70 ethanol before subsequent sorting and identification macroscopically to the lowest practical taxonomic resolution minimum of family and species where possible the final dataset comprised multivariate community level taxonomic data across the 18 sites taxonomic data were summarised using common metrics including species richness total abundance and simpson s index si 1 d simpson 1949 to assess any landscape level taxonomic homogenisation of macroinvertebrate communities that occurs in response to wwtw discharges the chao index of similarity chao et al 2005 was computed for independent pair wise comparisons upstream upstream and downstream downstream of effluent discharge points 2 5 macroinvertebrate community function to parameterise macroinvertebrate communty function we generated a functional dataset through linking taxonomic information to a series of fuzzy coded trait data derived from the european trait database tachet et al 2002 these data were also supplemented by non fuzzy categorised feeding guild data for macroinvertebrate taxa of the south wales i durance s j ormerod unpublished data this dataset was used to understand trait variation in response to urban land cover and effluent discharges but also to calculate the functional diversity of communities for each community we calculated inter taxon functional metrics with this approach being preferred over the mean taxon method due to risks in the latter of systematic and detrimental exclusion of important within taxon functional trait variability violle et al 2012 our approach followed gutiérrez cánovas et al 2015 in that a subset of traits related urban land cover and effluent concentrations were selected based on the values of individual pearson correlations traits with an average absolute coefficient of r 0 40 were included for the calculation of functional diversity for the sub set of selected traits assessments of inter taxon functional diversity were completed by defining a multidimensional euclidean space where axes summarised variation in traits subsequently taxon functional richness tfric as well as community functional richness fric dispersion fdis similarity fsim and redundancy fred were calculated at sample sites specific definitions of these functional metrics are provided in appendix s4 2 6 macroinvertebrate food webs food webs for each sample site were constructed from pooled annual macroinvertebrate data using computational methodology outlined in gray et al 2015 based on an r function webbuilder in conjunction with the cheddar package hudson et al 2013 the method used community data in conjunction with a reference dataset of 20 000 freshwater trophic interactions brose et al 2005 gray et al 2015 quantitative network metrics were calculated to describe food web structure connectance link density mean chain length generality number of resources per consumer and vulnerability number of consumers per resource bersier et al 2002 2 7 statistical analyses the potential effects of urban contamination on the structure and function of macroinvertebrate communities were investigated using r statistical software version 3 2 3 r core team 2015 prior to further analysis data were explored following zuur et al 2010 to check for normality heteroscedasticity and outliers in the data and to select statistical tests generalised linear models glms and generalised linear mixed models glmms the latter fitted using the package lme4 bates et al 2015 were used to assess the relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity food web characteristics and urban pollution where required catchment was included as a random effect to account for broad scale biogeographical patterns of species distribution grönroos and heino 2012 from broad model structures including a wide range of candidate variables arable land cover urban land cover water temperature total dissolved solids wwtw effluent discharge model selection was completed using both shrinkage and backward selection methods marra and wood 2011 validation procedures following zuur et al 2007 and thomas et al 2015 were used to assess the validity and robustness of statistical analyses for each model residual normality was assessed using qq plots homogeneity of variance was determined by plotting residuals against fitted values and influential observations were investigated using cook s leverage distances chao index values were non normal yet sample sizes were equal and between group variance was homogenous thus kruskal wallis rank sum tests ruxton and beauchamp 2008 were selected for analysis multivariate analyses were used to assess invertebrate community structure and function non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination was utilised to visualise the multivariate relationships nmds was computed using the jaccard index jaccard 1908 with a square root transformation and wisconsin double standardisation to account for variation associated with both common and rare taxa within the dataset kenkel and orloci 1986 multivariate glms constructed using the mvabund package wang et al 2012 were used to assess taxonomic responses and identify the dominant species contributing to observed patterns the relationships between macroinvertebrate community function and urban pollution sources were assessed using r mode linked to q mode rlq and fourth corner analysis following dray et al 2014 this allowed for links to be drawn between species trait and environmental datasets a modelling framework was not used to combine rlq with fourth corner analysis see ter braak et al 2017 multivariate methods taxonomic and functional metrics were applied to assess the responses of food webs to urban pollution 3 results 3 1 community structure along a gradient of urban land cover

persistent contaminants and urban land cover for example the mean chain length decreased within increasing levels of pcbs pbdes and urban land cover r2 0 72 f2 6 7 58 p 0 023 further relationships between a wider range of diversity and food web metrics are presented in appendix s5 4 discussion although there is evidence of recovery in the uk s urban rivers from the past effects of gross pollution previous studies have reported only partial recovery for benthic invertebrates vaughan and ormerod 2012 and fish mawle and milner 2008 our data confirm that the structure functional diversity and food web character of invertebrate communities remain impaired in the urban river systems of south wales urban effects on ionic composition or habitat structure could not be eliminated entirely as an explanation but relationships between water quality or habitat indices and urban land cover or wastewater discharge in the rivers studied were relatively weak in contrast selected persistent contaminants pcbs and pbdes occurred at significantly higher concentrations in invertebrates downstream of urban pollution sources in combination these data offer support for the hypothesis that contaminant mixtures might explain the incomplete recovery of macroinvertebrate food webs from the past effects of gross pollution though this support is qualified by the possibility that other stressors associated with urban stream systems might also be involved our data also add a novel dimension to understanding contaminant effects on river organisms through the indicating potential food webs responses to persistent pollution as with all field studies of this type our results are subject to several caveats first and most important the relationships detected between urban land cover contaminants and macroinvertebrate communities were correlative and do not necessarily reflect cause effect links in particular urbanisation causes a range of changes in river systems in addition to pollution for example altering habitat structure temperature regimes discharge and night time light regimes in ways that confound straightforward interpretation paul and meyer 2001 in this study at least limited alterations in general water quality nitrate phosphate temperature ec and tds in urban locations reduce the likelihood that the biological effects attributed to persistent contamination were in fact related predominantly to conventional pollution further although we measured just two groups of chemicals pcbs and pbdes these hydrophobic compounds readily enter the benthic habitats of river systems and are likely to interact more strongly with benthic invertebrates than various other contaminants notably hydrophilic water bound contaminants they are also have long residence times and high bioavailability in the benthic environment gaskell et al 2007 these compounds are also likely to be representative of a larger array of persistent contaminants in urban river systems pal et al 2014 thus there is a strong likelihood that effects ascribed here to these two groups in reality relate to a combination effect of wider range of covariate pollutants e g heavy metals plastics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and perfluorinated alkyl compounds a second caveat is that our study used relatively few sites instead focusing on the detailed parameterisation of biological communities and thus the identification of putative ecological responses to pollution on one hand this restricts the spatial coverage of findings yet previous studies operating at broader spatial scales e g national monitoring e g dyer and wang 2002 often compromise on biological detail by limiting metrics to sensitive taxa or univariate metrics of community structure e g species at risk index munz et al 2017 overall while our data provide an indication of the potential effects of urban pollutants on river food webs we suggest that the results are interpreted with the above limitations in mind the low flow and mean flow contribution of wastewater effluent to stream systems in this study 0 5 6 1 and 0 02 1 09 respectively initially appear low compared to other published literature 30 50 rueda et al 2002 in part this reflects the long standing regulation of sewage volumes relative to the discharge of the rivers that receive them moreover there are good reasons to believe that even these low effluent contributions could still generate ecological effects firstly we calculated the relative contribution of effluent from the individual inputs of wwtws rather than the total volume of upstream effluent input e g 82 in the river lea harries et al 1996 secondly using mean daily river discharge in the calculation of dilution factors provides conservative estimates of the total effluent contributions 0 02 1 09 in comparison to low flow values 0 5 6 1 this is especially important considering the rapid hydrological response of these piedmont river systems in a region of high rainfall for example the range of river discharge recorded 2016 2017 at the gauging station proximal to t1 river taff was 1 54 83 90 m3 s 1 natural resources wales and database right all rights reserved thirdly although the relative contribution of effluent appeared low compared with other studies in dryland regions e g mediterranean streams our results are corroborated by work elsewhere that has demonstrated significant effects on river food webs where total effective contributions of effluent averaged 3 debruyn et al 2003 finally the relative contribution of effluent is based on discharge volume hence only provides a crude indication of potential strength of effects which depend also on effluent toxicity effluent composition by source e g industrial domestic and the effectiveness of any treatment processes dyer and wang 2002 in these same rivers even with low apparent contributions effluent contributions to river runoff are sufficient to alter stable isotopic character of freshwater invertebrates suggesting substantial effects on macro nutrient fluxes morrissey et al 2013a notwithstanding the relatively small proportionate contribution to flow volume our findings suggest that differences in invertebrate community and food web character in urban landscapes are strongly associated with wastewater discharges and the accompanying higher levels of pcbs and pbdes contamination these associations occurred in spite of only minor differences in other measured physicochemical factors that could explain reduced biological diversity in urban river systems notably water temperature conductivity dissolved solids nitrate phosphate and habitat character vaughan and ormerod 2012 while improvements in wastewater treatment have reduced gross pollution problems across urban river systems in england and wales sufficiently to allow clean water species such as atlantic salmon salmo salar linnaeus 1758 to recolonise mawle and milner 2008 changes in invertebrate richness and composition do not yet show full recovery maltby and ormerod 2011 vaughan and ormerod 2012 inputs into rivers of both persistent and current use pollutants in urban areas from general runoff storm drains combined sewer overflows and wastewater discharges therefore offer a plausible explanation for the limited observed recovery from past pollution indeed previous data from these rivers show that wastewater discharges are sufficient to change the stable isotopic signatures of river organisms implying the involvement of wastewater in energy and nutrient additions in food webs morrissey et al 2013a further to this the occurrence of persistent organic contaminants in apex predators such as the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus along the same rivers at concentrations that have been implicated in negative ecotoxicological effects morrissey et al 2013b 2014 although the toxicological data for the effects of modern or legacy xenobiotic substances on invertebrates are still scarce windsor et al 2018 based on rudimentary environmental quality standards eqsbiota values for pbdes european commission 2013 the raw concentration data of pbde congeners 28 47 99 100 153 and 154 observed in invertebrates herein 0 07 7 61 ng g ww are representative of potential ecological effects 0 0085 ng g ww directive 2008 105 eu thus further supporting the observed alterations in invertebrate communities these risk thresholds however are generalised across fish molluscs crustaceans and other biota thus a key question that follows is whether the concentrations pbdes pcbs and other urban contaminants were sufficiently high in invertebrates to cause any ecotoxicological effects that might explain the observed food web impairment or reduced diversity certainly compared to other studies on similar invertebrate taxa the levels of both pcbs 0 18 36 28 ng g ww and pbdes 0 08 7 61 ng g ww appear similar if not marginally higher than in other studies in urban river systems pcbs 1 81 22 07 ng g ww walters et al 2008 and pbdes 1 20 13 8 ng g ww de boer et al 2003 the largest needs overall are for a more complete understanding of the exact array of contaminants present in urban rivers coupled with ecotoxicological assessments focusing on the effects of urban chemical mixtures under both field and controlled laboratory conditions the detection of an interaction between urban land cover and the presence of wastewater discharges further highlights the importance appraising the environmental context in which the effects of pollution occur see burdon et al 2016 in our case urban land cover and wwtw discharges appeared to act together in reducing biodiversity while wastewater discharges in less urbanised sites had more restricted effects on the structure and function of invertebrate communities the higher concentrations of persistent pollutants nitrate phosphate in combination with reduced habitat quality in urban stream systems appeared to alter food web structure and function with wwtw discharges compounding effects through pollutant addition the trend observed here contrasts with one case study in which wastewater discharges in swiss rural stream systems had greater effects yet this is possibly because pollutant loads in the streams investigated streams were dominated by pesticides from agricultural run off burdon et al 2016 munz et al 2017 certainly the structure of invertebrate communities is influenced by pesticides often from agricultural sources beketov et al 2013 the influence of agricultural pollution and pesticides in the current study however cannot be excluded as these compounds are also emitted from both wwtws and other sources in agricultural regions bunzel et al 2013 münze et al 2017 although the concentration and composition of xenobiotic pollution may vary between river systems in agricultural and urban regions it is apparent from this study and others that the combination of pollution from the wider catchment and wwtw discharges are responsible for generating reductions in the structural and functional diversity of invertebrate communities in addition to identifying the potential role for contaminants in slowing the recovery of urban rivers from gross pollution a novel aspect of our study was the assessment of food web effects of pollution such assessments are infrequent with studies instead focusing on individual and population level responses windsor et al 2018 our data has revealed a series of potential emergent effects on food webs in response to contamination in urban river systems including a reduction in connectance and link density that is indicative of food web simplification such effects on food webs although suspected from previous isotope analyses di lascio et al 2013 have not previously been shown additionally we identified how urban pollution could cause a range of functional alterations among invertebrate communities through trait based analyses this included reductions in the relative abundance of aerially dispersing taxa at polluted urbanised sites that if pronounced could have implications for prey subsidies to riparian zones through reduced matter and energy transfer kautza and sullivan 2015 such effects may in turn impact predators such as bats that prey on insects emerging from rivers and can be affected by changes in the prey spectrum available abbott et al 2009 as well as consequences for riparian organisms dependent on emergent prey the simplification of aquatic food webs at polluted urban sites also has the potential to affect aquatic apex predators a range of clean water vertebrates rely on macroinvertebrate prey in rivers including salmonid fish bell et al 1994 and river birds that have recently recolonised the uk s recovering urban river systems ormerod 1985 ormerod and tyler 1991 mawle and milner 2008 the observed reductions in the density of several macroinvertebrate taxa in the urban rivers of south wales e g hydropsyche spp rhyacophila spp and leuctra spp is likely important for apex predators for example these taxa would normally form a large component of the diet of the eurasian dipper cinclus cinclus linnaeus 1758 ormerod 1985 these prey items are nutritionally important for both adults and juveniles and any reductions in their density in the benthos could carry significant energetic costs o halloran et al 1990 any such indirect effects of contamination on prey available to dippers alongside direct effects generated by the enhanced bioaccumulation of toxic xenobiotic pollutants morrissey et al 2013b would be consistent with their inferior body condition along urban rivers in south wales morrissey et al 2014 5 conclusion in conclusion despite improving water quality and increasing invertebrate richness in urban river systems across the uk over the past 30 years our data from study sites in south wales provide evidence that xenobiotic contaminants could offer a potential explanation for the incomplete recovery in the structure and function of biological communities in these same rivers simplified macroinvertebrate food webs alterations in trait character and reduced functional diversity could all have implications for vertebrates that depend on river production while also offering biological indications of progress towards recovery that are not normally appraised we suggest there is a need to understand changes like these in more detail at broader spatial extents and at sufficient biological resolution to capture emergent ecosystem effects declaration of

18584,urban flooding has become a global issue due to climate change urbanization and limitation in the capacity of urban drainage infrastructures to tackle the growing threats it is crucial to understand urban surface flood resilience i e how urban drainage catchments can resist against and recover from flooding this study proposes a grid cell based resilience metric to assess urban surface flood resilience at the urban drainage catchment scale the new metric is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total grid cell number in an urban drainage catchment a two dimensional cellular automata based model caddies is used to simulate urban surface flooding this methodology is demonstrated using a case study in dalian china which is divided into 31 urban drainage catchments for flood resilience analysis results show the high resolution resilience assessment identifies vulnerable catchments and helps develop effective adaptation strategies to enhance urban surface flood resilience comparison of the new metric with an existing metric reveals that new metric has the advantage of fully reflecting the changing process of system performance effectiveness of adaptation strategies for enhancing urban surface flood resilience is discussed for different catchments this study provides a new way to characterize urban flood resilience and an in depth understanding of flood resilience for urban drainage catchments of different characteristics and thus help develop effective intervention strategies for sustainable sponge city development graphical abstract image 1 keywords grid cell flood resilience flood severity system performance urban surface flooding 1 introduction urban surface flooding exacerbated by climate change and rapid urbanization has caused grave negative consequences in many cities worldwide over the past decades hammond et al 2015 löwe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the summer of 2007 55 000 properties in the uk were flooded with an estimated economic loss of 3 2 billion pitt 2008 the flood event in july 2012 in beijing led to 79 deaths and an estimated economic loss of 11 64 billion yuan 1 29 billion yin et al 2016 to tackle urban flooding significant efforts have been made in developing flood assessment methods or frameworks hirabayashi et al 2013 jenkins et al 2017 morrison et al 2017 which are essential to support decision making for investment on flood management schemes such as the sponge city initiative in china jia et al 2017 however the current practice mainly focuses on the assessment of flood risk i e the product of the likelihood of flooding and the related consequence greater efforts are required to assess system resilience which is a concept firstly introduced in ecology holling 1973 and has been applied in many engineering fields to measure the ability of a system to respond and recover from failures under exceptional conditions holling 1996 hu et al 2018 lee and kim 2017a 2017b liao 2012 linkov et al 2014 meng et al 2018 mugume et al 2015 simonovic 2016 sweetapple et al 2018 by incorporating resilience in urban flooding assessment and management existing drainage capacity of an area can be better utilized and investment can be focused on places that are less resilient to flooding indeed there is a growing awareness to include resilience assessment in urban design and management for example the uk government urges resilience to be considered at all especially early stages of infrastructure works such as investment decisions and strategic planning gallego lopez and essex 2016 this has been enforced in industrial practice e g water companies in england and wales are required to incorporate resilience analysis in business plans on public water supply and sewer networks defra 2016 ofwat 2017 however no conceptual frameworks and evaluation standards were provided and no clear methodologies for resilience analysis were provided in the regulations or guidelines which are essential for effective delivery of resilience conceptual frameworks and metrics have been proposed in literature for the assessment and quantification of flood resilience batica 2015 bertilsson et al 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 lee and kim 2017b miguez and veról 2017 restemeyer et al 2015 bruneau et al 2003 developed a framework for assessing seismic resilience of communities measured by robustness rapidity resourcefulness and redundancy in the technical organizational social and economic dimensions restemeyer et al 2015 developed a heuristic framework for qualitative assessment of flood resilience cities where resilience is defined by robustness adaptability and transformability corresponding to various appraisal measures multi criteria indices are commonly proposed for measuring the multifaceted flooding resilience bertilsson et al 2019 chen and leandro 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 for example a spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi was proposed to quantify resilience by flood risk and vulnerability household s income and drainage capacities bertilsson et al 2019 chen and leandro 2019 developed a flood resilience index fri that estimated performance at both the failure and recovery phases by physical and economic and social indicators respectively principal components analysis was employed to derive a composite index by integrating flood related social ecological infrastructural and economic indicators kotzee and reyers 2016 although these metrics encompass various factors that contribute to flood resilience they heavily rely on subjective expert judgements for the selection and weighting of composing indicators to guide central large scale infrastructure schemes such as the sponge city initiative objective assessment of existing drainage capacity and spatial flooding resilience over a landscape is necessary performance based metrics provide a new way of assessing urban flood resilience based on the definition of resilience by butler et al 2014 i e the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subjected to exceptional conditions a metric was proposed by mugume et al 2015 to evaluate resilience of urban drainage systems it measures the severity a function of failure magnitude and duration of flooding when subject to different levels of structural failure lee and kim 2017b developed a resilience index for urban drainage systems based on flood damages which occurs only when flood depth reaches a certain point however the one dimensional 1d sewer flow model i e storm water management model swmm was employed for flood modelling and the calculation of the aforementioned resilience indices as such they cannot simulate urban flood resilience at high spatial and temporal resolutions which is jointly influenced by many factors such as topography and land cover type in addition to the drainage network capacity yet the detailed dynamic and spatial flooding assessment is essential to support the planning and design of intervention strategies of flood management schemes the aim of this study is to propose a performance based analytical framework for assessing flood resilience at urban drainage catchment scale a new resilience metric is proposed that can measure the spatial variation in response to extreme rainfall storm events the cellular automata dual drainage simulation caddies model guidolin et al 2016 which is a two dimensional 2d flood model is used for efficient and detailed simulation of urban surface flooding i e location and magnitude of flooding chen et al 2012 guidolin et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the proposed framework is applied to siergou dalian china with 31 catchments to identify the vulnerable areas and provide guidance for building resilient and sustainable cities discussion is made on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies on enhancing urban surface flood resilience 2 methodology a key flood resilience index reported in literature which is used for comparison in this work is reviewed in section 2 1 the proposed urban surface flood metric is defined in section 2 2 the modelling platform for the simulation of urban flood used in this study is described in the final sub section 2 1 flood resilience resilience is commonly defined as the capacity of a system to resist withstand rapidly recover from and adapt more readily to exceptional conditions the concept can be illustrated by the framework proposed by juan garcía et al 2017 where stressors properties metrics and interventions are defined for engineering resilience in the case of urban flood resilience the main stressor is rainfall storm and resilience is calculated by the loss in system functionality and recovery time bocchini et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 mugume et al 2015 under a range of scenarios the performance curve for an urban system under a specified extreme rainfall event is shown in fig 1 the black dotted line represents the original performance level of service and the black solid line shows the actual system performance p t the value of system performance varies from 0 i e total loss of system performance to 1 i e no loss the initial level of service is 1 which decreases from t s following an extreme rainfall event reaches the minimum value of p f at t ps restores from t pe and fully recovers to the full level of service at t e flood severity is an aggregated representation of the level of system damage during the entire process as shown by the shaded area in fig 1 and calculated as follows 1 s e v 1 t n 0 t n 1 p t d t where sev is flood severity and t n is the total simulation time mugume et al 2015 proposed a simplified metric res 0 by approximating the flood severity sev in eq 1 by a rectangular area as formulated in eqs 2 and 3 2 s e v v t f v t i t f t n 3 r e s 0 1 s e v 1 v t f v t i t f t n where v tf is the total flood volume v ti is total inflow into a drainage system t f is the mean duration of flooding across the entire network and t n is the total simulation time 2 2 flood resilience assessment to measure resilience for complex networks ganin et al 2016 assumed the nodes have only two possible states i e active and inactive and the percentage of nodes that are active are used to assess system performance following this idea a new resilience metric which is based on grid cells is proposed in this study for the assessment of resilience at catchment levels that is a catchment is divided into grid cells which have two possible states i e flooded or unflooded represented by the blue and white shaded cells in fig 2 respectively system performance of a catchment is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total number of the grid cells as presented in eqs 4 6 flood resilience is an aggregation of system performance during the entire simulation as presented in eq 7 4 g i t 1 0 d i t h c d i t h c where t 0 t n 5 n t i 1 n g i t 6 p t 1 n t n 7 r e s 1 t n 0 t n p t d t where d i t is water depth of grid cell i at time t g i t is the state of grid cell i at time t h c is the threshold of flood depth n t is the total number of flooded grid cells n is the total number of grid cells in a catchment p t is system performance at time t t n is the total simulation time and res is the urban surface flood resilience 2 3 flood modelling the cellular automata dual drainage simulation caddies model is used for efficient calculation of urban surface flood under a wide range of rainfall storms it is a novel model based on the principle of cellular automata ca which performs a 2d pluvial flood inundation simulation using simple transition rules for modelling complex physical systems guidolin et al 2016 a ca model usually consists of five essential features a discrete space the distribution of the neighbor cells the state of the cells the discrete time step and the transition rules itami 1994 the first version of caddies model ca2d uses a ranking system instead of directly solving the manning s equation to evaluate water volume transferred between cells ghimire et al 2013 in this paper an improved version with a weight based approach is used as it can achieve faster calculation of transferred water ratios from the central cell to the downstream neighbor cells intercellular volume furthermore each grid cell has its own roughness value and infiltration rate to represent soil infiltration and drainage capacity respectively the model was demonstrated to have high efficiency and accuracy by various case studies such as analytical problems 2d benchmarking test cases for 2d flood modelling proposed by the uk environment agency and real world case studies liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 webber et al 2018b for example the flood depths from caddies and infoworks show a satisfactory agreement in a real world test case in torquay uk and the speed of caddies is up to eight times faster than that of infoworks guidolin et al 2016 furthermore webber et al 2018a demonstrated that caddies can identify flood prone areas and generate flood depths highly correlated over 97 with the industry standard approach by infoworks icm using a case study in st neots of cambridgeshire uk 3 case study 3 1 study area the siergou area 10 1 km2 in dalian china is used as the case study the drainage system in this area is of limited capacity and is designed to cope with 1 year return period rainfall only as shown in fig 3 a the digital elevation data dem of bare terrain has a 5 m 5 m resolution with the highest and lowest elevations of 223 6 m and 0 6 m respectively urban surface water flows from south siergou to north siergou this area is divided into 31 catchments in fig 4 their boundaries are determined by terrain elevation and their characteristics are shown in table 1 the sum of grid cells and average values of other parameters of the 31 catchments are presented in the last row total as shown in fig 3 b the topography is classified into five different land cover types i e building green land manmade surface road and water which are assigned with different infiltration rates and roughness parameters in the caddies flood model different constant infiltration rates were applied to different land cover categories to reflect the distinctive urban drainage and soil infiltration capacities wang et al 2018 82 5 of the siergou area is developed as buildings and impervious surfaces while 17 5 of the area remains as permeable green land according to the drainage capacity of siergou the infiltration values of the impervious areas and the green spaces are set to be 30 mm h and 40 mm h respectively 3 2 rainfall events to gain insights into system behaviour under various rainfall intensities different design rainfall events of 2 h duration of 30 50 100 200 year return periods are generated according to the rainfall intensity equation of dalian zhang et al 2017 and the rainfall hyetographs are shown in fig 5 they have the same location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 5 the rainfall intensity is calculated as 8 i 1230 157 1 0 724 lg p 167 t 5 783 0 661 where i mm h is the average rainfall intensity p a is return period and t min is the duration of rainfall 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood resilience analysis the maximum flood depth under the 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 100 and 200 year return periods are presented in fig 6 where color represents the maximum water depth obtained by caddies fig 6 shows that extensive flood is observed over the study area and the flood depth and area increase with the growing rainfall intensity the scenario with the 200 year return period rainfall event is chosen to explain the calculation process of urban flood resilience fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of flooded grid cell numbers in the siergou area which increases rapidly to a maximum value of 2 1 105 at 1 1 h and then decreases mainly due to the drainage of the sewer system however it takes about 36 h for the excess runoff to be removed from the siergou area due to the limited drainage capacity especially at the downstream catchments water depths at different times are examined to further investigate the dynamics of flooding at each catchment flood inundation depth and area in siergou at 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h and 12 h is presented in fig 8 where four typical catchments of c2 c5 c30 and c31 are highlighted with colored boundaries fig 8 clearly shows that different catchments have contrasting responses to excess surface water under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period the flood area of c31 is large at 2 h but it almost disappears at 4 h the quick removal of excess surface water can be attributed to the large average slope and green land cover ratio 38 7 as shown in table 1 by contrast c2 suffers from serious flood with a maximum water depth of 1 3 m and a large flood area of 3 6 104 m2 even at 12 h the long flood duration in c2 is caused by the insufficient capacity of the local drainage network and the low lying terrain as shown in fig 3 a assuming the flood depth thresholds for building green land manmade surface road and water to be 10 cm 15 cm 2 cm 2 cm and 20 cm respectively the number of flooded grid cells in each catchment at different times can be obtained the results for c2 c5 c30 and c31 under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a the number of flooded grid cells at c30 during the first 45 min of the simulation is low which then increases rapidly to the peak value at 1 4 h the numbers of flooded grid cells at 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h and 24 h are 0 10389 11901 9623 6017 4917 2672 and 0 respectively the other three catchments show different resilience performance compared to c30 some catchments can fully recover from the rainfall in a short time while others take longer for example c31 has a larger maximum flooded grid cell number of 12069 but it only takes 4 h to recover completely in comparison to 14413 and 24 h of c30 the full recovery time for c2 is even longer and nearly to 36 h the system performance of the four catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period are presented in fig 9 b all curves decrease from 1 to a certain level and then recover to 1 however the four curves show different characteristics including the worst system performance and recovery rate for example the minimum values of system performance for c2 c5 c30 and c31 are 0 44 0 60 0 45 and 0 75 respectively even though c31 has a larger maximum flooded grid cell number than c2 and c5 its minimum system performance is better due to the larger total grid cell number 4 2 overall flood resilience of 31 catchments the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period are shown in fig 10 results show that catchments located at upstream generally have larger resilience values than those at downstream e g the flood resilience value of c31 is 0 99 compared to 0 69 and 0 65 of c2 and c22 respectively nevertheless urban flood resilience is influenced by a variety of internal external factors such as terrain slope land cover type drainage capacity rainfall storm and characteristics of adjacent catchments for example despite being located at downstream c11 has a high resilience value of 0 97 due to its higher average elevation than the adjacent catchment c17 by the assessment of recovery rate the proposed resilience analysis complements the traditional assessment and provides insights on the real life consequences of the flood results for example fig 6 d shows the maximum water depth of siergou under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period the maximum water depths of some grid cells exceed 0 6 m however the real life impacts may not be as serious because the recovery rate is high e g flood resilience value being 0 99 the flood resilience values of 31 catchments under 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 and 100 year return periods are shown in fig 11 the resilience value generally decreases with the increase in rainfall intensity furthermore results reveal that catchments with low flood resilience are more sensitive to the change in rainfall intensity for example the flood resilience values of c2 are 0 86 0 81 0 74 and 0 69 under 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 100 and 200 year return periods which are 0 98 0 98 0 97 and 0 97 for c1 respectively a comprehensive resilience assessment of all the catchments reveals the priority areas for interventions to improve flood resilience and reduce flood consequences to investigate the influence of the catchment parameters on urban flood resilience the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments are plotted against average slope percentage of green land number of grids and average elevation of catchments in fig 12 a 12 d as shown in fig 12 a catchments with a large average slope tend to have a large resilience value for example the average slope values for c21 c15 c25 and c24 are 12 85 10 24 9 33 and 8 26 respectively and their flood resilience values are 0 98 0 99 0 98 and 0 99 respectively however catchments with small average slopes may also have large flood resilience values for example the average slopes of c18 and c19 are nearly equal 1 55 and 1 50 yet there is a big difference in their resilience values 0 77 and 0 99 c19 has a smaller slope but a higher resilience value than c20 this shows that catchment slope is a strong influencing but not the sole factor in determining flood resilience compared to fig 12 a fig 12 b and c show a similar relationship between flood resilience and percentage of green land and average elevation respectively for example catchment with a large percentage of green land elevation e g c15 c25 c31 c24 tends to have a higher resilience value however although the percentage of green land of c20 is larger than c19 i e 31 and 0 3 respectively c20 has a smaller resilience value than c19 i e 0 94 and 0 99 respectively this can be explained by other factors such as characteristics of adjacent catchments or outlet boundary conditions for example runoff of c19 mainly flows into the adjacent catchment of c1 while c20 has a closed downstream boundary thus runoff cannot be drained away quickly there is no strong relationship between flood resilience and the number of grids this is because resilience is calculated as the number of unflooded cells divided by the all grid cells in a catchment hence catchment size has no impact on the resilience metric value as urban flood resilience cannot be represented by single factors the proposed resilience metric provides value for flood management as it can simulate the joint impacts of the relevant factors on flooding resilience 4 3 impacts of water depth threshold the sensitivity of flood resilience to flood depth thresholds is examined by running two scenarios hs 2 and hs 3 with different threshold values their settings are shown in table 2 in comparison with those used in the previous sections i e hs 1 in hs 2 a 10 cm increase is applied for all land cover types compared to hs 1 hs 3 uses the same threshold value of 20 cm for every land cover type the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments at the three scenarios are shown in fig 13 in fig 13 the flood resilience values in hs 2 are higher than those in hs 1 the flooded grid numbers are lower as the threshold value increases which leads to improvement in system performance and resilience however catchments with smaller resilience values in hs 1 tend to have larger increase rates in flood resilience for example the flood resilience values of c2 c13 and c22 are 0 69 0 83 and 0 65 in hs 1 which increase to 0 78 0 92 and 0 73 in hs 2 the increase rate of flood resilience of c2 c13 and c22 are 13 11 and 12 respectively on the contrary the flood resilience values of c23 c24 and c25 in hs 2 all increase by 1 only although flood depth thresholds for green land and water in hs 3 are smaller than those in hs 2 the resilience values are generally larger in hs 3 this shows that the threshold values for impervious surfaces have a larger impact on the resilience results 4 4 comparison of metrics the urban flood resilience metric proposed in this study res by eq 7 is compared with the metric reported in mugume et al 2015 res 0 by eq 3 the comparison of resilience values for 31 catchments under four 2 h design rainfall events of 30 50 100 200 year return periods are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that similar results strong positive correlation are obtained for the 31 catchments under the four design rainfall events of 30 50 100 200 year return periods both res 0 and res tend to reduce with the increase in rainfall intensity catchments with smaller resilience values can be identified as vulnerable areas the values of res 0 are negative for some catchments e g 1 08 0 89 0 38 and 0 32 for c22 c2 c18 and c30 respectively the negative value indicates that the corresponding catchment receives urban runoff from its adjacent catchments which results in a larger total flood volume for these catchments adaptation strategies need to be applied in their adjacent catchments to alleviate flooding nevertheless the relative resilience values for two catchments measured by res 0 can be very different from those by res as shown in fig 14 d the values of res for c13 and c30 are nearly equal i e 0 82 but there is a big difference in the values of res 0 i e 0 50 and 0 32 a similar pattern is observed between c18 and c30 this can be explained by the detailed resilience performance of the catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the system performance curves for c13 and c30 are very different in terms of failure magnitude failure duration and recovery rate meng et al 2018 the worst system performance for c13 and c30 are 0 28 and 0 45 and their time for full recovery are 9 3 h and 22 0 h respectively however their flood severity values are equal hence their res values are the same this shows that some details are lost when simplifying the system failure and recovery curve as a rectangular 4 5 effects of adaptation strategies 4 5 1 adaptation scenarios design adaptation strategies such as conventional piped solutions sustainable drainage system suds e g green roofs rainwater harvesting and attenuation tanks infiltration trenches permeable pavement green infrastructure are widely adopted to manage flood risk by slowing down and reducing the quantity of urban surface water runoff the adoption of these adaptation strategies for improving urban surface flood resilience is consistent with the ultimate goal of sponge city construction in china the combinational use of different adaptation strategies is found to be effective in improving system resilience sweetapple et al 2018 hence the selection of intervention measures at different locations in a catchment is needed though there are limitations in using 2d urban surface flood modelling for assessing intervention options satisfactory representations can be made by adjustment of the parameters that control flow input output and transmission speed in each cell webber et al 2018b in this paper adjustment of infiltration rate is used to represent the application of various intervention options three adaptation strategies were modelled and tested i e adaptation measures only adopted in the downstream catchment ds adaptation measures only adopted in the upstream catchment us and adaptation measures both adopted in the upstream and downstream catchments uds c2 c13 c22 and c30 are chosen for analysing the effectiveness of the adaptation strategies as they have relatively smaller resilience values the four catchments are classified into two vulnerable areas of i i e c2 and c13 and ii i e c22 and c30 as highlighted in fig 16 according to the direction of runoff flow through catchments the downstream catchments in areas i and ii are c2 and c22 respectively the grid cells with larger maximum flood water depth were preferentially chosen for adaptation as seen in table 3 the total numbers of grid cells with adaptation measures for area i and ii are 2409 and 6582 respectively and their layouts are shown in fig 16 note that the same number of grid cells is intervened under the three scenarios in an area further the adaptation measures adopted are not specific interventions but rather combinations of various intervention options the infiltration rate for the grid cells with adaptation measures adopted is assumed to be 60 mm h to reflect the effects of capturing storing of rainfall and infiltrating water 4 5 2 effect of adaptation strategies on urban surface flood resilience the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period is used to further investigate the effects of adaptation strategies on the improvement of urban surface flood resilience the flood resilience values of res for catchments of c2 c13 c22 and c30 under the adaptation scenarios of s ds us and uds are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that resilience values increase for all the four catchments under the scenarios of ds us and uds compared to the do nothing scenario s in fig 17 adaptation strategies help enhance flood resilience by increasing the drainage capacity however the responses to the adaptation scenarios of ds us and uds for each catchment are different for example the resilience values of c2 under s ds us and uds are 0 69 0 81 0 71 and 0 79 respectively the increase rate of resilience under ds us and uds are 17 6 3 0 and 14 6 compared to the do nothing scenario s therefore scenario ds shows the greatest improvement in urban surface flood resilience for c2 similarly c13 located at upstream could achieve the largest resilience increase in the us scenario this demonstrates that the best effects of adaptation strategies for each catchment in area i will occur only when the adaptation measures are adopted within their own catchments however in terms of the overall resilience improvement in the entire area i the ds scenario can achieve almost the same effects as the uds scenarios this shows that most runoff in area i is generated in the downstream catchment ds so it is not effective to reduce runoff generation from upstream catchments nevertheless the resilience values of c22 and c30 show different characteristics compared to those of c2 and c13 shown in fig 17 for example the resilience values of c22 under s ds us and uds are 0 65 0 77 0 74 and 0 78 respectively and the corresponding values for c30 are 0 82 0 86 0 87 and 0 88 respectively therefore adaptation measures adopted in the upstream and downstream catchments uds can achieve the best effects in enhancing resilience of each catchment in area ii this implies that reducing the runoff generation from the entire area including the upstream catchment is significant for area ii in summary the resilience assessment using the proposed resilience metric can identify the effective adaptation strategy for an area covering more than one urban drainage catchment it is impossible to apply a universal adaptation strategy for different areas due to different catchment characteristics and mechanisms that cause flooding hence resilience analysis should be performed for flood intervention planning and design in the sponge city development process 5 conclusions in this paper a new grid cell based metric is proposed to assess flood resilience for urban surface flood management a ca based urban two dimensional model is used to simulate surface flooding flood resilience values of different catchments are compared and analyzed using a case study of the siergou in dalian china the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in enhancing urban surface flood resilience is investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 the grid cell based metric can accurately reveal the flooding dynamics of urban drainage catchments in response to extreme events i e the varying number of flooded grid cells at a high resolution such as 5 m 5 m in the case study flood resilience is influenced by the joint impact of different urban drainage catchment characteristics such as different land cover percentages catchment average slope and drainage capacity the coupling of 2 d modelling and grid cell based metric enables comprehensive resilience assessment of all catchments it reveals the priority areas for flood interventions and provides useful evidence for informed decision making towards large scale investments in urban flood management 2 though similarities exist between the two resilience values of the grid cell based and the simplified metrics in most urban drainage catchments there is a striking difference between the values by the two metrics in some catchments the difference is caused by the simplification of the system performance curve in the simplified metric resulting in an inaccurate representation of failure magnitude failure duration and recovery rate nevertheless it is found that the simplified metric can have a negative value in a catchment due to a large volume of urban runoff from adjacent catchments which is useful in identifying the source of runoff and thus effective intervention strategies 3 comparing different flood adaptation strategies shows that reducing the runoff generation from the upstream catchment alone is not effective in flood resilience improvement instead both upstream and downstream catchments should be considered together to develop the most effective measures for resilience enhancement in the whole area this implies that resilience assessment using the new metric is critical to develop effective adaptation strategies for urban catchments of different characteristics in the sponge city development process impacts of terrain features on urban flood resilience should be further explored with a flood model in future study which can accurately represent hydrological processes in urban areas and flow dynamics in drainage networks further there is a need to evaluate the influence on the resilience results from the simplified simulation of drainage by sewer networks in caddies model using the constant infiltration approach acknowledgments this research was funded by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council under the

18584,urban flooding has become a global issue due to climate change urbanization and limitation in the capacity of urban drainage infrastructures to tackle the growing threats it is crucial to understand urban surface flood resilience i e how urban drainage catchments can resist against and recover from flooding this study proposes a grid cell based resilience metric to assess urban surface flood resilience at the urban drainage catchment scale the new metric is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total grid cell number in an urban drainage catchment a two dimensional cellular automata based model caddies is used to simulate urban surface flooding this methodology is demonstrated using a case study in dalian china which is divided into 31 urban drainage catchments for flood resilience analysis results show the high resolution resilience assessment identifies vulnerable catchments and helps develop effective adaptation strategies to enhance urban surface flood resilience comparison of the new metric with an existing metric reveals that new metric has the advantage of fully reflecting the changing process of system performance effectiveness of adaptation strategies for enhancing urban surface flood resilience is discussed for different catchments this study provides a new way to characterize urban flood resilience and an in depth understanding of flood resilience for urban drainage catchments of different characteristics and thus help develop effective intervention strategies for sustainable sponge city development graphical abstract image 1 keywords grid cell flood resilience flood severity system performance urban surface flooding 1 introduction urban surface flooding exacerbated by climate change and rapid urbanization has caused grave negative consequences in many cities worldwide over the past decades hammond et al 2015 löwe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the summer of 2007 55 000 properties in the uk were flooded with an estimated economic loss of 3 2 billion pitt 2008 the flood event in july 2012 in beijing led to 79 deaths and an estimated economic loss of 11 64 billion yuan 1 29 billion yin et al 2016 to tackle urban flooding significant efforts have been made in developing flood assessment methods or frameworks hirabayashi et al 2013 jenkins et al 2017 morrison et al 2017 which are essential to support decision making for investment on flood management schemes such as the sponge city initiative in china jia et al 2017 however the current practice mainly focuses on the assessment of flood risk i e the product of the likelihood of flooding and the related consequence greater efforts are required to assess system resilience which is a concept firstly introduced in ecology holling 1973 and has been applied in many engineering fields to measure the ability of a system to respond and recover from failures under exceptional conditions holling 1996 hu et al 2018 lee and kim 2017a 2017b liao 2012 linkov et al 2014 meng et al 2018 mugume et al 2015 simonovic 2016 sweetapple et al 2018 by incorporating resilience in urban flooding assessment and management existing drainage capacity of an area can be better utilized and investment can be focused on places that are less resilient to flooding indeed there is a growing awareness to include resilience assessment in urban design and management for example the uk government urges resilience to be considered at all especially early stages of infrastructure works such as investment decisions and strategic planning gallego lopez and essex 2016 this has been enforced in industrial practice e g water companies in england and wales are required to incorporate resilience analysis in business plans on public water supply and sewer networks defra 2016 ofwat 2017 however no conceptual frameworks and evaluation standards were provided and no clear methodologies for resilience analysis were provided in the regulations or guidelines which are essential for effective delivery of resilience conceptual frameworks and metrics have been proposed in literature for the assessment and quantification of flood resilience batica 2015 bertilsson et al 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 lee and kim 2017b miguez and veról 2017 restemeyer et al 2015 bruneau et al 2003 developed a framework for assessing seismic resilience of communities measured by robustness rapidity resourcefulness and redundancy in the technical organizational social and economic dimensions restemeyer et al 2015 developed a heuristic framework for qualitative assessment of flood resilience cities where resilience is defined by robustness adaptability and transformability corresponding to various appraisal measures multi criteria indices are commonly proposed for measuring the multifaceted flooding resilience bertilsson et al 2019 chen and leandro 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 for example a spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi was proposed to quantify resilience by flood risk and vulnerability household s income and drainage capacities bertilsson et al 2019 chen and leandro 2019 developed a flood resilience index fri that estimated performance at both the failure and recovery phases by physical and economic and social indicators respectively principal components analysis was employed to derive a composite index by integrating flood related social ecological infrastructural and economic indicators kotzee and reyers 2016 although these metrics encompass various factors that contribute to flood resilience they heavily rely on subjective expert judgements for the selection and weighting of composing indicators to guide central large scale infrastructure schemes such as the sponge city initiative objective assessment of existing drainage capacity and spatial flooding resilience over a landscape is necessary performance based metrics provide a new way of assessing urban flood resilience based on the definition of resilience by butler et al 2014 i e the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subjected to exceptional conditions a metric was proposed by mugume et al 2015 to evaluate resilience of urban drainage systems it measures the severity a function of failure magnitude and duration of flooding when subject to different levels of structural failure lee and kim 2017b developed a resilience index for urban drainage systems based on flood damages which occurs only when flood depth reaches a certain point however the one dimensional 1d sewer flow model i e storm water management model swmm was employed for flood modelling and the calculation of the aforementioned resilience indices as such they cannot simulate urban flood resilience at high spatial and temporal resolutions which is jointly influenced by many factors such as topography and land cover type in addition to the drainage network capacity yet the detailed dynamic and spatial flooding assessment is essential to support the planning and design of intervention strategies of flood management schemes the aim of this study is to propose a performance based analytical framework for assessing flood resilience at urban drainage catchment scale a new resilience metric is proposed that can measure the spatial variation in response to extreme rainfall storm events the cellular automata dual drainage simulation caddies model guidolin et al 2016 which is a two dimensional 2d flood model is used for efficient and detailed simulation of urban surface flooding i e location and magnitude of flooding chen et al 2012 guidolin et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the proposed framework is applied to siergou dalian china with 31 catchments to identify the vulnerable areas and provide guidance for building resilient and sustainable cities discussion is made on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies on enhancing urban surface flood resilience 2 methodology a key flood resilience index reported in literature which is used for comparison in this work is reviewed in section 2 1 the proposed urban surface flood metric is defined in section 2 2 the modelling platform for the simulation of urban flood used in this study is described in the final sub section 2 1 flood resilience resilience is commonly defined as the capacity of a system to resist withstand rapidly recover from and adapt more readily to exceptional conditions the concept can be illustrated by the framework proposed by juan garcía et al 2017 where stressors properties metrics and interventions are defined for engineering resilience in the case of urban flood resilience the main stressor is rainfall storm and resilience is calculated by the loss in system functionality and recovery time bocchini et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 mugume et al 2015 under a range of scenarios the performance curve for an urban system under a specified extreme rainfall event is shown in fig 1 the black dotted line represents the original performance level of service and the black solid line shows the actual system performance p t the value of system performance varies from 0 i e total loss of system performance to 1 i e no loss the initial level of service is 1 which decreases from t s following an extreme rainfall event reaches the minimum value of p f at t ps restores from t pe and fully recovers to the full level of service at t e flood severity is an aggregated representation of the level of system damage during the entire process as shown by the shaded area in fig 1 and calculated as follows 1 s e v 1 t n 0 t n 1 p t d t where sev is flood severity and t n is the total simulation time mugume et al 2015 proposed a simplified metric res 0 by approximating the flood severity sev in eq 1 by a rectangular area as formulated in eqs 2 and 3 2 s e v v t f v t i t f t n 3 r e s 0 1 s e v 1 v t f v t i t f t n where v tf is the total flood volume v ti is total inflow into a drainage system t f is the mean duration of flooding across the entire network and t n is the total simulation time 2 2 flood resilience assessment to measure resilience for complex networks ganin et al 2016 assumed the nodes have only two possible states i e active and inactive and the percentage of nodes that are active are used to assess system performance following this idea a new resilience metric which is based on grid cells is proposed in this study for the assessment of resilience at catchment levels that is a catchment is divided into grid cells which have two possible states i e flooded or unflooded represented by the blue and white shaded cells in fig 2 respectively system performance of a catchment is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total number of the grid cells as presented in eqs 4 6 flood resilience is an aggregation of system performance during the entire simulation as presented in eq 7 4 g i t 1 0 d i t h c d i t h c where t 0 t n 5 n t i 1 n g i t 6 p t 1 n t n 7 r e s 1 t n 0 t n p t d t where d i t is water depth of grid cell i at time t g i t is the state of grid cell i at time t h c is the threshold of flood depth n t is the total number of flooded grid cells n is the total number of grid cells in a catchment p t is system performance at time t t n is the total simulation time and res is the urban surface flood resilience 2 3 flood modelling the cellular automata dual drainage simulation caddies model is used for efficient calculation of urban surface flood under a wide range of rainfall storms it is a novel model based on the principle of cellular automata ca which performs a 2d pluvial flood inundation simulation using simple transition rules for modelling complex physical systems guidolin et al 2016 a ca model usually consists of five essential features a discrete space the distribution of the neighbor cells the state of the cells the discrete time step and the transition rules itami 1994 the first version of caddies model ca2d uses a ranking system instead of directly solving the manning s equation to evaluate water volume transferred between cells ghimire et al 2013 in this paper an improved version with a weight based approach is used as it can achieve faster calculation of transferred water ratios from the central cell to the downstream neighbor cells intercellular volume furthermore each grid cell has its own roughness value and infiltration rate to represent soil infiltration and drainage capacity respectively the model was demonstrated to have high efficiency and accuracy by various case studies such as analytical problems 2d benchmarking test cases for 2d flood modelling proposed by the uk environment agency and real world case studies liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 webber et al 2018b for example the flood depths from caddies and infoworks show a satisfactory agreement in a real world test case in torquay uk and the speed of caddies is up to eight times faster than that of infoworks guidolin et al 2016 furthermore webber et al 2018a demonstrated that caddies can identify flood prone areas and generate flood depths highly correlated over 97 with the industry standard approach by infoworks icm using a case study in st neots of cambridgeshire uk 3 case study 3 1 study area the siergou area 10 1 km2 in dalian china is used as the case study the drainage system in this area is of limited capacity and is designed to cope with 1 year return period rainfall only as shown in fig 3 a the digital elevation data dem of bare terrain has a 5 m 5 m resolution with the highest and lowest elevations of 223 6 m and 0 6 m respectively urban surface water flows from south siergou to north siergou this area is divided into 31 catchments in fig 4 their boundaries are determined by terrain elevation and their characteristics are shown in table 1 the sum of grid cells and average values of other parameters of the 31 catchments are presented in the last row total as shown in fig 3 b the topography is classified into five different land cover types i e building green land manmade surface road and water which are assigned with different infiltration rates and roughness parameters in the caddies flood model different constant infiltration rates were applied to different land cover categories to reflect the distinctive urban drainage and soil infiltration capacities wang et al 2018 82 5 of the siergou area is developed as buildings and impervious surfaces while 17 5 of the area remains as permeable green land according to the drainage capacity of siergou the infiltration values of the impervious areas and the green spaces are set to be 30 mm h and 40 mm h respectively 3 2 rainfall events to gain insights into system behaviour under various rainfall intensities different design rainfall events of 2 h duration of 30 50 100 200 year return periods are generated according to the rainfall intensity equation of dalian zhang et al 2017 and the rainfall hyetographs are shown in fig 5 they have the same location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 5 the rainfall intensity is calculated as 8 i 1230 157 1 0 724 lg p 167 t 5 783 0 661 where i mm h is the average rainfall intensity p a is return period and t min is the duration of rainfall 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood resilience analysis the maximum flood depth under the 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 100 and 200 year return periods are presented in fig 6 where color represents the maximum water depth obtained by caddies fig 6 shows that extensive flood is observed over the study area and the flood depth and area increase with the growing rainfall intensity the scenario with the 200 year return period rainfall event is chosen to explain the calculation process of urban flood resilience fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of flooded grid cell numbers in the siergou area which increases rapidly to a maximum value of 2 1 105 at 1 1 h and then decreases mainly due to the drainage of the sewer system however it takes about 36 h for the excess runoff to be removed from the siergou area due to the limited drainage capacity especially at the downstream catchments water depths at different times are examined to further investigate the dynamics of flooding at each catchment flood inundation depth and area in siergou at 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h and 12 h is presented in fig 8 where four typical catchments of c2 c5 c30 and c31 are highlighted with colored boundaries fig 8 clearly shows that different catchments have contrasting responses to excess surface water under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period the flood area of c31 is large at 2 h but it almost disappears at 4 h the quick removal of excess surface water can be attributed to the large average slope and green land cover ratio 38 7 as shown in table 1 by contrast c2 suffers from serious flood with a maximum water depth of 1 3 m and a large flood area of 3 6 104 m2 even at 12 h the long flood duration in c2 is caused by the insufficient capacity of the local drainage network and the low lying terrain as shown in fig 3 a assuming the flood depth thresholds for building green land manmade surface road and water to be 10 cm 15 cm 2 cm 2 cm and 20 cm respectively the number of flooded grid cells in each catchment at different times can be obtained the results for c2 c5 c30 and c31 under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a the number of flooded grid cells at c30 during the first 45 min of the simulation is low which then increases rapidly to the peak value at 1 4 h the numbers of flooded grid cells at 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 18 h and 24 h are 0 10389 11901 9623 6017 4917 2672 and 0 respectively the other three catchments show different resilience performance compared to c30 some catchments can fully recover from the rainfall in a short time while others take longer for example c31 has a larger maximum flooded grid cell number of 12069 but it only takes 4 h to recover completely in comparison to 14413 and 24 h of c30 the full recovery time for c2 is even longer and nearly to 36 h the system performance of the four catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period are presented in fig 9 b all curves decrease from 1 to a certain level and then recover to 1 however the four curves show different characteristics including the worst system performance and recovery rate for example the minimum values of system performance for c2 c5 c30 and c31 are 0 44 0 60 0 45 and 0 75 respectively even though c31 has a larger maximum flooded grid cell number than c2 and c5 its minimum system performance is better due to the larger total grid cell number 4 2 overall flood resilience of 31 catchments the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period are shown in fig 10 results show that catchments located at upstream generally have larger resilience values than those at downstream e g the flood resilience value of c31 is 0 99 compared to 0 69 and 0 65 of c2 and c22 respectively nevertheless urban flood resilience is influenced by a variety of internal external factors such as terrain slope land cover type drainage capacity rainfall storm and characteristics of adjacent catchments for example despite being located at downstream c11 has a high resilience value of 0 97 due to its higher average elevation than the adjacent catchment c17 by the assessment of recovery rate the proposed resilience analysis complements the traditional assessment and provides insights on the real life consequences of the flood results for example fig 6 d shows the maximum water depth of siergou under the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period the maximum water depths of some grid cells exceed 0 6 m however the real life impacts may not be as serious because the recovery rate is high e g flood resilience value being 0 99 the flood resilience values of 31 catchments under 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 and 100 year return periods are shown in fig 11 the resilience value generally decreases with the increase in rainfall intensity furthermore results reveal that catchments with low flood resilience are more sensitive to the change in rainfall intensity for example the flood resilience values of c2 are 0 86 0 81 0 74 and 0 69 under 2 h design rainfalls of 30 50 100 and 200 year return periods which are 0 98 0 98 0 97 and 0 97 for c1 respectively a comprehensive resilience assessment of all the catchments reveals the priority areas for interventions to improve flood resilience and reduce flood consequences to investigate the influence of the catchment parameters on urban flood resilience the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments are plotted against average slope percentage of green land number of grids and average elevation of catchments in fig 12 a 12 d as shown in fig 12 a catchments with a large average slope tend to have a large resilience value for example the average slope values for c21 c15 c25 and c24 are 12 85 10 24 9 33 and 8 26 respectively and their flood resilience values are 0 98 0 99 0 98 and 0 99 respectively however catchments with small average slopes may also have large flood resilience values for example the average slopes of c18 and c19 are nearly equal 1 55 and 1 50 yet there is a big difference in their resilience values 0 77 and 0 99 c19 has a smaller slope but a higher resilience value than c20 this shows that catchment slope is a strong influencing but not the sole factor in determining flood resilience compared to fig 12 a fig 12 b and c show a similar relationship between flood resilience and percentage of green land and average elevation respectively for example catchment with a large percentage of green land elevation e g c15 c25 c31 c24 tends to have a higher resilience value however although the percentage of green land of c20 is larger than c19 i e 31 and 0 3 respectively c20 has a smaller resilience value than c19 i e 0 94 and 0 99 respectively this can be explained by other factors such as characteristics of adjacent catchments or outlet boundary conditions for example runoff of c19 mainly flows into the adjacent catchment of c1 while c20 has a closed downstream boundary thus runoff cannot be drained away quickly there is no strong relationship between flood resilience and the number of grids this is because resilience is calculated as the number of unflooded cells divided by the all grid cells in a catchment hence catchment size has no impact on the resilience metric value as urban flood resilience cannot be represented by single factors the proposed resilience metric provides value for flood management as it can simulate the joint impacts of the relevant factors on flooding resilience 4 3 impacts of water depth threshold the sensitivity of flood resilience to flood depth thresholds is examined by running two scenarios hs 2 and hs 3 with different threshold values their settings are shown in table 2 in comparison with those used in the previous sections i e hs 1 in hs 2 a 10 cm increase is applied for all land cover types compared to hs 1 hs 3 uses the same threshold value of 20 cm for every land cover type the flood resilience values of the 31 catchments at the three scenarios are shown in fig 13 in fig 13 the flood resilience values in hs 2 are higher than those in hs 1 the flooded grid numbers are lower as the threshold value increases which leads to improvement in system performance and resilience however catchments with smaller resilience values in hs 1 tend to have larger increase rates in flood resilience for example the flood resilience values of c2 c13 and c22 are 0 69 0 83 and 0 65 in hs 1 which increase to 0 78 0 92 and 0 73 in hs 2 the increase rate of flood resilience of c2 c13 and c22 are 13 11 and 12 respectively on the contrary the flood resilience values of c23 c24 and c25 in hs 2 all increase by 1 only although flood depth thresholds for green land and water in hs 3 are smaller than those in hs 2 the resilience values are generally larger in hs 3 this shows that the threshold values for impervious surfaces have a larger impact on the resilience results 4 4 comparison of metrics the urban flood resilience metric proposed in this study res by eq 7 is compared with the metric reported in mugume et al 2015 res 0 by eq 3 the comparison of resilience values for 31 catchments under four 2 h design rainfall events of 30 50 100 200 year return periods are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that similar results strong positive correlation are obtained for the 31 catchments under the four design rainfall events of 30 50 100 200 year return periods both res 0 and res tend to reduce with the increase in rainfall intensity catchments with smaller resilience values can be identified as vulnerable areas the values of res 0 are negative for some catchments e g 1 08 0 89 0 38 and 0 32 for c22 c2 c18 and c30 respectively the negative value indicates that the corresponding catchment receives urban runoff from its adjacent catchments which results in a larger total flood volume for these catchments adaptation strategies need to be applied in their adjacent catchments to alleviate flooding nevertheless the relative resilience values for two catchments measured by res 0 can be very different from those by res as shown in fig 14 d the values of res for c13 and c30 are nearly equal i e 0 82 but there is a big difference in the values of res 0 i e 0 50 and 0 32 a similar pattern is observed between c18 and c30 this can be explained by the detailed resilience performance of the catchments under 2 h design rainfall for 200 year return period shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the system performance curves for c13 and c30 are very different in terms of failure magnitude failure duration and recovery rate meng et al 2018 the worst system performance for c13 and c30 are 0 28 and 0 45 and their time for full recovery are 9 3 h and 22 0 h respectively however their flood severity values are equal hence their res values are the same this shows that some details are lost when simplifying the system failure and recovery curve as a rectangular 4 5 effects of adaptation strategies 4 5 1 adaptation scenarios design adaptation strategies such as conventional piped solutions sustainable drainage system suds e g green roofs rainwater harvesting and attenuation tanks infiltration trenches permeable pavement green infrastructure are widely adopted to manage flood risk by slowing down and reducing the quantity of urban surface water runoff the adoption of these adaptation strategies for improving urban surface flood resilience is consistent with the ultimate goal of sponge city construction in china the combinational use of different adaptation strategies is found to be effective in improving system resilience sweetapple et al 2018 hence the selection of intervention measures at different locations in a catchment is needed though there are limitations in using 2d urban surface flood modelling for assessing intervention options satisfactory representations can be made by adjustment of the parameters that control flow input output and transmission speed in each cell webber et al 2018b in this paper adjustment of infiltration rate is used to represent the application of various intervention options three adaptation strategies were modelled and tested i e adaptation measures only adopted in the downstream catchment ds adaptation measures only adopted in the upstream catchment us and adaptation measures both adopted in the upstream and downstream catchments uds c2 c13 c22 and c30 are chosen for analysing the effectiveness of the adaptation strategies as they have relatively smaller resilience values the four catchments are classified into two vulnerable areas of i i e c2 and c13 and ii i e c22 and c30 as highlighted in fig 16 according to the direction of runoff flow through catchments the downstream catchments in areas i and ii are c2 and c22 respectively the grid cells with larger maximum flood water depth were preferentially chosen for adaptation as seen in table 3 the total numbers of grid cells with adaptation measures for area i and ii are 2409 and 6582 respectively and their layouts are shown in fig 16 note that the same number of grid cells is intervened under the three scenarios in an area further the adaptation measures adopted are not specific interventions but rather combinations of various intervention options the infiltration rate for the grid cells with adaptation measures adopted is assumed to be 60 mm h to reflect the effects of capturing storing of rainfall and infiltrating water 4 5 2 effect of adaptation strategies on urban surface flood resilience the 2 h design rainfall of 200 year return period is used to further investigate the effects of adaptation strategies on the improvement of urban surface flood resilience the flood resilience values of res for catchments of c2 c13 c22 and c30 under the adaptation scenarios of s ds us and uds are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that resilience values increase for all the four catchments under the scenarios of ds us and uds compared to the do nothing scenario s in fig 17 adaptation strategies help enhance flood resilience by increasing the drainage capacity however the responses to the adaptation scenarios of ds us and uds for each catchment are different for example the resilience values of c2 under s ds us and uds are 0 69 0 81 0 71 and 0 79 respectively the increase rate of resilience under ds us and uds are 17 6 3 0 and 14 6 compared to the do nothing scenario s therefore scenario ds shows the greatest improvement in urban surface flood resilience for c2 similarly c13 located at upstream could achieve the largest resilience increase in the us scenario this demonstrates that the best effects of adaptation strategies for each catchment in area i will occur only when the adaptation measures are adopted within their own catchments however in terms of the overall resilience improvement in the entire area i the ds scenario can achieve almost the same effects as the uds scenarios this shows that most runoff in area i is generated in the downstream catchment ds so it is not effective to reduce runoff generation from upstream catchments nevertheless the resilience values of c22 and c30 show different characteristics compared to those of c2 and c13 shown in fig 17 for example the resilience values of c22 under s ds us and uds are 0 65 0 77 0 74 and 0 78 respectively and the corresponding values for c30 are 0 82 0 86 0 87 and 0 88 respectively therefore adaptation measures adopted in the upstream and downstream catchments uds can achieve the best effects in enhancing resilience of each catchment in area ii this implies that reducing the runoff generation from the entire area including the upstream catchment is significant for area ii in summary the resilience assessment using the proposed resilience metric can identify the effective adaptation strategy for an area covering more than one urban drainage catchment it is impossible to apply a universal adaptation strategy for different areas due to different catchment characteristics and mechanisms that cause flooding hence resilience analysis should be performed for flood intervention planning and design in the sponge city development process 5 conclusions in this paper a new grid cell based metric is proposed to assess flood resilience for urban surface flood management a ca based urban two dimensional model is used to simulate surface flooding flood resilience values of different catchments are compared and analyzed using a case study of the siergou in dalian china the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in enhancing urban surface flood resilience is investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 the grid cell based metric can accurately reveal the flooding dynamics of urban drainage catchments in response to extreme events i e the varying number of flooded grid cells at a high resolution such as 5 m 5 m in the case study flood resilience is influenced by the joint impact of different urban drainage catchment characteristics such as different land cover percentages catchment average slope and drainage capacity the coupling of 2 d modelling and grid cell based metric enables comprehensive resilience assessment of all catchments it reveals the priority areas for flood interventions and provides useful evidence for informed decision making towards large scale investments in urban flood management 2 though similarities exist between the two resilience values of the grid cell based and the simplified metrics in most urban drainage catchments there is a striking difference between the values by the two metrics in some catchments the difference is caused by the simplification of the system performance curve in the simplified metric resulting in an inaccurate representation of failure magnitude failure duration and recovery rate nevertheless it is found that the simplified metric can have a negative value in a catchment due to a large volume of urban runoff from adjacent catchments which is useful in identifying the source of runoff and thus effective intervention strategies 3 comparing different flood adaptation strategies shows that reducing the runoff generation from the upstream catchment alone is not effective in flood resilience improvement instead both upstream and downstream catchments should be considered together to develop the most effective measures for resilience enhancement in the whole area this implies that resilience assessment using the new metric is critical to develop effective adaptation strategies for urban catchments of different characteristics in the sponge city development process impacts of terrain features on urban flood resilience should be further explored with a flood model in future study which can accurately
