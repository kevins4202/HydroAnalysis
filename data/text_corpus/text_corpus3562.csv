17810,nitrogen removal with energy recovery through denitrification dependent n2o production is garnering recent attention due to its cost advantages the most effective current method requires alternating cod and nitrite to achieve high n2o production making it incompatible with typical wastewaters and consequently difficult to use in most settings the work described here introduces a robust and highly efficient n2o recovery approach which has the potential to work with wastewaters containing cod and nitrite simultaneously this method relies on low ph incubation and inert gas sparging igs to shift a community of mainly n2 producing nitrite denitrifiers to a community that accumulates n2o when incubated in the absence of igs before experiencing igs samples from activated sludge incubated at a ph of 4 5 and 6 0 only achieved a maximum n2o production efficiency pe n2o of 26 after igs the pe n2o values increased to 97 5 and 80 2 for samples from these same ph 4 5 and ph 6 0 reactors respectively igs did not lead to n2o production in a ph 7 5 bioreactor meta omics analysis revealed that igs resulted in an increase in bacteria utilizing the clade i nitrous oxide reductase nosz i relative to bacteria utilizing the clade ii nitrous oxide reductase nosz ii this likely results from igs flushing out n2o leaving nitrite as the principal nitrogen oxide available for respiration favoring nosz i utilizing bacteria which are more likely to be complete denitrifiers metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that the high pe n2o values that occurred after stopping igs result from the no generated by chemodenitrification accumulating to levels that inactivate 4fe 4s clusters in the nosr protein essential for n2o reduction in the nosz i denitrifiers this study provides an efficient and straightforward method for n2o recovery widening the options for energy recovery from nitrogen based wastes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological nitrogen removal

al 2001 zhou et al 2018 currently intensive research efforts have focused on the process of recovering energy from waste chemical oxygen demand cod as methane rotaru et al 2014 feng et al 2014 cruz viggi et al 2014 many novel wastewater treatment processes focus on decreasing energy demand of nitrogen removal via short circuiting the conventional nitrification denitrification with nitrite as an important intermediate pynaert et al 2004 furukawa et al 2006 chen et al 2009 however little energy is recovered from nitrogenous compounds in these processes recently some efforts have been made to recover energy from nitrous oxide n2o which is derived from reactive forms of n kampschreur et al 2009 schreiber et al 2012 n2o is more typically viewed as an unwanted by product of wastewater treatment because it is a greenhouse gas 310 times more powerful than co2 us epa 2006 and a dominant ozone depleting substance burke et al 2018 montzka et al 2011 myhre et al 2013 ravishankara et al 2009 us epa 2012 consequently most studies work to minimize n2o production frutos et al 2018 leix et al 2017 massara et al 2017 however n2o is not dissimilar from ch4 since both are harmful if discharged but are also sources of renewable energy if captured and combusted in fact n2o is a powerful oxidant used in propulsion and automotive applications and can be used to increase energy recovery from methane pfahl et al 2000 scherson et al 2014 combustion of ch4 with n2o releases 30 more heat than combustion with o2 and mitigates the release of n2o to the atmosphere gao et al 2014 scherson and colleagues introduced a new n removal process that recovers energy from nitrogenous oxygen demand nod as n2o scherson et al 2013 the process is called the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando and converts reactive n to n2o which is then captured and used to recover energy by using it as a co oxidant in ch4 combustion or decomposing the n2o over a metal oxide catalyst cando is operationally complex requiring alternating acetate and nitrite pulses which lead to partial denitrification from no2 to n2o when cells are oxidizing intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb the physiology linking phb utilization to increased n2o production is poorly understood the n2o production efficiency pe n2o defined as the maximum ratio of n2o n over reduced nitrite of cando has been reported to be in the range of 65 80 scherson et al 2013 2014 gao et al 2017 while this is a significant increase in n2o production over the traditional nitrification denitrification process the requirement for alternating periods of carbon and nitrite creates operational issues since most wastewaters will contain both thus restricting wider application of the cando process a major developmental challenge associated with achieving high pe n2o levels is preventing the biological reduction of n2o to n2 the most well established means for doing this is low ph hanaki et al 1992 thörn and sörensson 1996 previous studies using an activated sludge from a pilot plant have shown that over 40 of the denitrified nitrate accumulated as n2o at ph 6 0 while almost 100 of the denitrified nitrate accumulated as n2o at ph below 5 0 hanaki et al 1992 thomsen et al 1994 thörn and sörensson 1996 it is also generally acknowledged that the n2o fraction of the total nitrogenous gas produced by denitrification increases with decreased ph in soil koskinen and keeney 1982 van den heuvel et al 2011 another strategy for achieving high pe n2o that holds promise is using inert gas sparging to displace the dissolved n2o and thus eliminate any physiological benefit associated with n2o reduction since denitrification is a modular process it may be possible to use this strategy to shift the denitrifying community away from complete denitrification to a community in which the majority of the organisms are incapable of the terminal step of denitrification short term studies have shown that reversal of n2o dissolution using n2 sparging increased n2o yields by 16 weiβbach et al 2018 it is not unreasonable to conclude that by combining low ph with sparging it might be possible to develop a microbial community that shows stable and highly efficient n2o production therefore the aims of this study were to 1 develop a novel robust and highly efficient n2o recovery approach based on low ph incubation combined with sparging 2 to gain insight into the physiological mechanisms causing n2o accumulation based on metagenomic combing metatranscriptomic analysis these results will expand our current understanding of energy recovery from nitrogen waste and expand the types of wastewater that can be used for high n2o production 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation three 250 ml sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 200 ml were operated at three different ph levels ph 4 5 r4 5 ph 6 0 r6 0 and ph 7 5 r7 5 for 150 days these

performance of n2o production three bioreactors r4 5 ph 4 5 r6 0 ph 6 0 and r7 5 ph 7 5 were operated for 150 days and the pe n2o was determined periodically during this time representative measurement for no2 removal and n2o production are shown in fig s1 the no2 removal efficiency was over 98 in all batch experiments pe n2o in all the batch experiments are summarized fig 1 focusing on r4 5 and r6 0 first pe n2o increased from 0 to 26 for samples from these two reactors during phase i unexpectedly the pe n2o dropped to 0 for samples taken from both r4 5 and r6 0 during phase ii which is when igs occurs however the pe n2o values of the samples increased dramatically when igs was terminated in phase iii maximum pe n2o values during phase iii were 97 5 in r4 5 and 80 2 for r6 0 over the same time frame and phases of sampling n2o production from the r7 5 samples was always below detectable limits the observation that samples experiencing igs produced no detectable n2o was contrary to expectations to determine if this result was dependent on igs phase iii was followed by phase iv during which igs was resumed however during phase iv the sparging gas was changed to ar since the n2 used in phase ii is the end product of denitrification another inert gas was used to eliminate the possibility n2 sparging might lead to unexpected shifts in denitrification rates or the bacterial community as observed during phase ii the pe n2o dropped to 0 in phase iv in samples from both r4 5 and r6 0 phase v was then initiated with the cessation of igs and as seen during phase iii the pe n2o of the samples increased dramatically to 95 5 for r4 5 and 72 0 for r6 0 very similar to phase iii values these results show that igs induced cessation of n2o production was reproducible and independent of the gas used and that termination of the igs leads to high pe n2o values during both phase iii and phase v the pe n2o values of the extracted samples were higher than observed in previous studies scherson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 as in phases ii and iii there was no n2o produced by samples from r7 5 taken during phases iv and v 3 2 microbial community revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess community composition during the various phases of reactor operation unweighted pcoa analysis based on the absence or presence of phylotypes showed that the communities in r4 5 and r6 0 were more similar to each other than to r7 5 fig s2 focusing on the acidic reactors as expected the community rapidly diverges from the inoculum and further changes occur during igs however there are only minor shifts in the community after cessation of igs the relative abundances of the most abundant phylotypes at the family level for phases i through iii are shown in fig 2 for r4 5 and r6 0 saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae dominated during phase i day 1 50 with abundances of 18 8 26 2 and 13 3 14 2 respectively after igs onset in phase ii day 50 90 comamonadaceae became the dominant phylotype accounting for 35 2 38 5 while the abundance of saprospiraceae decreased to 2 13 2 another important trend is that rhodocyclaceae represented about 0 1 0 7 of the total bacteria in phase i but then increased dramatically to 12 5 16 4 of the total in phase ii the abundances of comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae remained stable after cessation of igs during phase iii day 90 130 and the microbial community overall remained similar to phase ii the microbial community in r7 5 remained relatively stable during all phases with rhodocyclaceae being the dominant phylotype accounting for 38 5 47 7 of the total regardless of the phase of incubation the most abundant family in the acidic reactors comamonadaceae is a large and diverse bacterial family belonging to the order burkholderiales previous studies indicate that comamonadaceae were usually among the dominant community members in several n2o accumulation denitrifying reactors scherson et al 2013 2014 however the mechanisms of n2o accumulation that occurs upon comamonadaceae enrichment is still unclear 3 3 community reconstruction based on metagenomic sequencing in order to better understand how these community shifts lead to the observed pe n2o patterns metagenomic sequences from the three reactors were used to obtain a genome scale view of the microbial community pcoa based on the metagenome reads provided additional evidence that igs shaped the microbial community in the acidic reactors and that there was little change in the community after cessation of igs fig s3 assembly yielded 30 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags with a completeness and contamination values of 80 0 and 10 0 respectively table s1 15 of these mags corresponded to family level groups found in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results occurrence of each mag in the community is shown in fig 3 a the occurrence of genes encoding proteins required for nitrite denitrification is shown in fig 3b despite their being stable and robust n2o production after igs in both acidic reactors twenty of the 30 reconstructed genomes harbored the capacity for n2o reduction five of the mags including com1 assigned to comamonadaceae and alc1 assigned to alcaligenaceae which have notably high occurrence in the communities were complete nitrite denitrifiers and harbored the nosz i gene at the onset of phase ii these mags accounted for only 0 7 of the total dna reads however after cessation of igs this group accounted for an average 21 6 of dna read abundance this high occurrence of complete nitrite denitrifiers is distinct from recent studies in an aquifer system and a partial nitritation anammox bioreactor as well as in an analysis of complete genomes retrieved from public databases that have found that incomplete denitrifiers were the dominant type of denitrifier anantharaman et al 2016 graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 gao et al 2019 at the onset of phase ii mags with nosz ii were numerically dominant occurring in 15 mags and accounted for 9 7 of the total dna reads in the acidic reactors however this group decreased dramatically after igs and only accounted for an average of 3 7 of the total dna reads one possible explanation for the prevalence of bacteria with nosz i after igs is that inert gas sparging is driving off the dissolved gaseous nitrogen oxides e g no and n2o produced during denitrification resulting in nitrite being the principal nitrogen oxide available during phases ii and iv under these circumstances the portion of denitrifiers who lack the capacity to reduce nitrite decreased at the same time mags with nosz i also have a nir but those with nosz ii do not fig 3 this cooccurrence trend is supported by recent work that compared 652 microbial genomes across 18 phyla and found that 83 of the genomes harbor nosz i also have nirs or nirk so organisms with nosz i are more likely to be complete denitrifiers while 51 of n2o reducing bacteria with nosz ii do not have the ability to reduce nitrate or nitrite graf et al 2014 there were 5 mags in the set that lacked nosz but contained either nir or nor and this group accounted for only 1 4 and 1 5 of the total dna reads in the acidic reactors at the end of phase ii and iii respectively so unlike the other mags changes in growth conditions between the end of phase ii and the end of phase iii did not cause any significant change in their occurrence in the community taken together both 16s and metagenomic analysis showed there was not a significant change in the community between the end of phase ii and the end of phase iii therefore a change in the community cannot fully account for the differences in the pe n2o values between these phases suggesting physiological differences were involved 3 4 metatranscriptomic analysis samples from 80d phase ii and 130d phase iii were taken in r4 5 for metatranscriptomic analysis because pe n2o at these two times was steady indicating an adapted community the 30 high quality mags accounted for 62 2 and 58 1 of the total cdna reads obtained from the 80d and 130d samples respectively indicating that they were representative of the expression of the microbial community in the two phases in general gene expression corresponded with abundance in the acidic reactors fig 4 for example com1 had a relative gene expression of 40 1 of total cdna reads whereas alc1 had values of 2 6 however one low abundance genome assigned to mycobacteriaceae myb1 was observed to be particularly active based on gene expression more significantly though nosz i containing organisms had higher levels of transcription than nosz ii containing organisms in both phase ii and phase iii five of the mags that harbored the nosz i gene accounted for 50 4 and 32 6 of cdna reads abundance in phase ii and phase iii respectively while the value of 15 nosz ii gene harboring mags were only 0 3 and 0 5 respectively to further investigate the mechanism of high pe n2o gene expression during phases ii and iii was analyzed in the three mags com1 alc1 and myb1 which accounted for the highest portion of the cdna reads two groups of genes were investigated those required for nitrite denitrification and the 50 genes whose transcripts showed the largest increase in a comparison of the period after cessation of igs to the period during igs in r4 5 fig 5 showed that the expression of nirk and qnor in com1 and alc1 were higher at the end of phase iii relative to the end of phase ii while genes in the nos cluster were down regulated in a similar comparison this expression pattern of the nitrite denitrification genes is consistent with a significant difference in pe n2o under the two different conditions the large changes in expression of genes whose protein products are involved in iron sulfur cluster assembly and repair the isc and suf family was unanticipated highlighted in blue in tables s2 s4 and fig 5 in all three mags transcription of this group of genes was much higher in phase iii than phase ii previous work has shown that the sufabcdse and iscrsua operons are induced under oxidative stress conditions yeo et al 2006 a commonly encountered metabolic stress for pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria is the presence of reactive nitrogen species rns in particular one of the intermediates of denitrification nitric oxide no stern et al 2013 no stress is likely here due to a cessation of igs since this gas is no longer being sparged from the media an increasing production of no as a consequence of decreasing ph during biological denitrification has been found in previous studies for example bergaust et al 2010 liu et al 2014 another important source of no is a consequence of nitrite decomposition to no in low ph conditions through chemodenitrification a process which has been well described bancroft et al 1979 van cleemput and samater 1996 mckenney et al 1990 found that chemodenitrification apparently dominates no production at ph 4 5 and the decreasing ph increased no production rates significantly 0 4 10 8 mol min at ph 5 5 while 2 1 10 8 mol min at ph 4 0 li et al 2018 showed that abiotic nitrite decomposition contributed as much no as biological production at ph 4 9 based on the reported kinetics of nitrite decomposition kappelmeyer et al 2003 venterea et al 2005 lim et al 2018 the amount of no expect to be produced via chemodenitrification biological process unconsidered in all three reactors was calculated fig s4 while these models of no generation ignore biological contributions to its production and consumption they are consistent with the observation that low ph reactors experience higher no stress than the ph 7 5 reactor while nosz does not contain fe s centers there is nonetheless a connection between fe s stability and nos function due to nosr wunsch et al 2005 whose coding gene is one of the genes in the nos gene cluster of both com1 and alc1 fig 5 nosr is a transmembrane protein with a large n terminal flavin binding domain located in the periplasm as well as a c terminal ferredoxin like domain with two 4fe 4s clusters in the cytoplasm wunsch and zumft 2005 zumft and kroneck 2007 nosr is well known to play a critical role in n2o reduction since it was first shown that nosr insertion mutants generated by transposon tn5 mutagenesis no longer produced the nosz transcript cuypers et al 1992 importantly it was also shown that deletion of the ferredoxin like domain significantly decreased the n2o reducing activity of whole cells wunsch et al 2005 the observed upregulation of sufabcdse and iscrsua operons after cessation of igs indicated that the organisms were under oxidative stress conditions likely due to no which could directly react with iron sulfur clusters harrop et al 2008 yang et al 2010 landry et al 2011 it is not unreasonable to conclude then that a no dependent inactivation of nosr is a principal reason for the high pe n2o levels of samples taken during phase iii 3 5 model explaining high pe n2o after igs in acidic condition the results presented provide sufficient evidence to understand how acidic conditions igs and cessation of igs lead to high pe n2o levels during nitrite denitrification during phase i the community undergoes large changes as it adapts to low ph conditions as well as exposure to no at the end of phase i nosz ii containing mags accounted for 9 7 of the total dna reads while the portion of nosz i containing mags was only 0 71 during phase ii igs limits exposure to no and the numbers of organism with nosz i increased significantly at the end of phase ii the portion of nosz i and nosz ii containing organisms were 22 6 and 1 26 respectively bacteria that utilize clade i nos require nosr for n2o reductase activity sanford et al 2012 the metatranscriptomic data suggests there is a no dependent destabilization of fe s proteins which includes nosr in phase iii since the no levels in phase iii increase due to a cessation of igs this results in high pe n2o values this indicates that the community shift is a critical factor for the high pe n2o 97 5 in phase iii compared to that 26 0 in phase i despite no being present in both phases the observation that the pe n2o values in r6 0 are lower is also explained by this model since at this ph the rate of no2 decomposition to no will be lower thus causing lower levels of nosr inactivation 3 6 implication of this work conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are energy intensive and yield little or no recovered resources however with embedded energy in both organic carbon and nutrients n p wastewater has the potential for substantial energy recovery from a low value feedstock a paradigm shift is occurring that is transforming understanding of necessary energy inputs as well as the potential energy of resource outputs from wastewater treatment and energy neutral or even energy positive treatment is increasingly achievable recently energy recovery from n removal has become a focus of research and development among the processes developed cando enables direct energy recovery as n2o from nitrogen gao et al 2014 the necessity of alternating anaerobic phb accumulating and anoxic nitrite reducing periods in its step2 partial anoxic reduction of no2 to n2o creates operational issues since most wastewaters will contain both thus creating challenges that restrict the wider application of the cando process here we describe a method that produces n2o that relies upon low ph incubation and inert gas sparging igs to shift the microbial community to organisms that will accumulate n2o when incubated in the absence of igs during nitrite dependent denitrification the n2o yield in lab scale bioreactors was higher than observed in previous studies scherson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 based on the work described here the configuration of a system allowing high pe n2o that could potentially be implemented in wwtps is shown in fig 6 an acidic sludge treatment unit is added to overcome microflora adaptation sludge cycling between the sidestream sludge treatment unit and the n2o production reactor is proposed to ensure high pe n2o under neutral ph conditions in addition to the development of a stable robust system for high n2o recovery this work offers unique insight into the reasons underlying why low ph can lead to n2o accumulation in many environments the current favored explanation is low ph destabilizes copper centers in nos bergaust et al 2010 the results described here provide evidence that no dependent destabilization of nosr is another reason that no can be a stress in acidic environments has been demonstrated in recent work showing that nor is the dominant denitrification genes in acidic soils roco et al 2019 therefore it is not unreasonable to conclude that if no levels reach levels high enough to select for nor then nosr activity could be impacted as well 4 conclusion in this study a robust and highly efficient n2o recovery approach which has the potential to work with wastewaters containing cod and nitrite simultaneously was developed the data indicated that termination of the igs leads to high pe n2o values under low ph incubation meta omics analysis revealed that igs resulted in an increase in bacteria utilizing nosz i relative to nosz ii the high pe n2o values were resulted from no that inactivate 4fe 4s clusters in the nosr protein in the nosz i denitrifiers this study provides an efficient and straightforward method for n2o recovery as well as unique insight into the reasons underlying why low ph can lead to n2o accumulation in

recover energy from nitrous oxide n2o which is derived from reactive forms of n kampschreur et al 2009 schreiber et al 2012 n2o is more typically viewed as an unwanted by product of wastewater treatment because it is a greenhouse gas 310 times more powerful than co2 us epa 2006 and a dominant ozone depleting substance burke et al 2018 montzka et al 2011 myhre et al 2013 ravishankara et al 2009 us epa 2012 consequently most studies work to minimize n2o production frutos et al 2018 leix et al 2017 massara et al 2017 however n2o is not dissimilar from ch4 since both are harmful if discharged but are also sources of renewable energy if captured and combusted in fact n2o is a powerful oxidant used in propulsion and automotive applications and can be used to increase energy recovery from methane pfahl et al 2000 scherson et al 2014 combustion of ch4 with n2o releases 30 more heat than combustion with o2 and mitigates the release of n2o to the atmosphere gao et al 2014 scherson and colleagues introduced a new n removal process that recovers energy from nitrogenous oxygen demand nod as n2o scherson et al 2013 the process is called the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando and converts reactive n to n2o which is then captured and used to recover energy by using it as a co oxidant in ch4 combustion or decomposing the n2o over a metal oxide catalyst cando is operationally complex requiring alternating acetate and nitrite pulses which lead to partial denitrification from no2 to n2o when cells are oxidizing intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb the physiology linking phb utilization to increased n2o production is poorly understood the n2o production efficiency pe n2o defined as the maximum ratio of n2o n over reduced nitrite of cando has been reported to be in the range of 65 80 scherson et al 2013 2014 gao et al 2017 while this is a significant increase in n2o production over the traditional nitrification denitrification process the requirement for alternating periods of carbon and nitrite creates operational issues since most wastewaters will contain both thus restricting wider application of the cando process a major developmental challenge associated with achieving high pe n2o levels is preventing the biological reduction of n2o to n2 the most well established means for doing this is low ph hanaki et al 1992 thörn and sörensson 1996 previous studies using an activated sludge from a pilot plant have shown that over 40 of the denitrified nitrate accumulated as n2o at ph 6 0 while almost 100 of the denitrified nitrate accumulated as n2o at ph below 5 0 hanaki et al 1992 thomsen et al 1994 thörn and sörensson 1996 it is also generally acknowledged that the n2o fraction of the total nitrogenous gas produced by denitrification increases with decreased ph in soil koskinen and keeney 1982 van den heuvel et al 2011 another strategy for achieving high pe n2o that holds promise is using inert gas sparging to displace the dissolved n2o and thus eliminate any physiological benefit associated with n2o reduction since denitrification is a modular process it may be possible to use this strategy to shift the denitrifying community away from complete denitrification to a community in which the majority of the organisms are incapable of the terminal step of denitrification short term studies have shown that reversal of n2o dissolution using n2 sparging increased n2o yields by 16 weiβbach et al 2018 it is not unreasonable to conclude that by combining low ph with sparging it might be possible to develop a microbial community that shows stable and highly efficient n2o production therefore the aims of this study were to 1 develop a novel robust and highly efficient n2o recovery approach based on low ph incubation combined with sparging 2 to gain insight into the physiological mechanisms causing n2o accumulation based on metagenomic combing metatranscriptomic analysis these results will expand our current understanding of energy recovery from nitrogen waste and expand the types of wastewater that can be used for high n2o production 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation three 250 ml sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 200 ml were operated at three different ph levels ph 4 5 r4 5 ph 6 0 r6 0 and ph 7 5 r7 5 for 150 days these

performance of n2o production three bioreactors r4 5 ph 4 5 r6 0 ph 6 0 and r7 5 ph 7 5 were operated for 150 days and the pe n2o was determined periodically during this time representative measurement for no2 removal and n2o production are shown in fig s1 the no2 removal efficiency was over 98 in all batch experiments pe n2o in all the batch experiments are summarized fig 1 focusing on r4 5 and r6 0 first pe n2o increased from 0 to 26 for samples from these two reactors during phase i unexpectedly the pe n2o dropped to 0 for samples taken from both r4 5 and r6 0 during phase ii which is when igs occurs however the pe n2o values of the samples increased dramatically when igs was terminated in phase iii maximum pe n2o values during phase iii were 97 5 in r4 5 and 80 2 for r6 0 over the same time frame and phases of sampling n2o production from the r7 5 samples was always below detectable limits the observation that samples experiencing igs produced no detectable n2o was contrary to expectations to determine if this result was dependent on igs phase iii was followed by phase iv during which igs was resumed however during phase iv the sparging gas was changed to ar since the n2 used in phase ii is the end product of denitrification another inert gas was used to eliminate the possibility n2 sparging might lead to unexpected shifts in denitrification rates or the bacterial community as observed during phase ii the pe n2o dropped to 0 in phase iv in samples from both r4 5 and r6 0 phase v was then initiated with the cessation of igs and as seen during phase iii the pe n2o of the samples increased dramatically to 95 5 for r4 5 and 72 0 for r6 0 very similar to phase iii values these results show that igs induced cessation of n2o production was reproducible and independent of the gas used and that termination of the igs leads to high pe n2o values during both phase iii and phase v the pe n2o values of the extracted samples were higher than observed in previous studies scherson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 as in phases ii and iii there was no n2o produced by samples from r7 5 taken during phases iv and v 3 2 microbial community revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess community composition during the various phases of reactor operation unweighted pcoa analysis based on the absence or presence of phylotypes showed that the communities in r4 5 and r6 0 were more similar to each other than to r7 5 fig s2 focusing on the acidic reactors as expected the community rapidly diverges from the inoculum and further changes occur during igs however there are only minor shifts in the community after cessation of igs the relative abundances of the most abundant phylotypes at the family level for phases i through iii are shown in fig 2 for r4 5 and r6 0 saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae dominated during phase i day 1 50 with abundances of 18 8 26 2 and 13 3 14 2 respectively after igs onset in phase ii day 50 90 comamonadaceae became the dominant phylotype accounting for 35 2 38 5 while the abundance of saprospiraceae decreased to 2 13 2 another important trend is that rhodocyclaceae represented about 0 1 0 7 of the total bacteria in phase i but then increased dramatically to 12 5 16 4 of the total in phase ii the abundances of comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae remained stable after cessation of igs during phase iii day 90 130 and the microbial community overall remained similar to phase ii the microbial community in r7 5 remained relatively stable during all phases with rhodocyclaceae being the dominant phylotype accounting for 38 5 47 7 of the total regardless of the phase of incubation the most abundant family in the acidic reactors comamonadaceae is a large and diverse bacterial family belonging to the order burkholderiales previous studies indicate that comamonadaceae were usually among the dominant community members in several n2o accumulation denitrifying reactors scherson et al 2013 2014 however the mechanisms of n2o accumulation that occurs upon comamonadaceae enrichment is still unclear 3 3 community reconstruction based on metagenomic sequencing in order to better understand how these community shifts lead to the observed pe n2o patterns metagenomic sequences from the three reactors were used to obtain a genome scale view of the microbial community pcoa based on the metagenome reads provided additional evidence that igs shaped the microbial community in the acidic reactors and that there was little change in the community after cessation of igs fig s3 assembly yielded 30 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags with a completeness and contamination values of 80 0 and 10 0 respectively table s1 15 of these mags corresponded to family level groups found in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results occurrence of each mag in the community is shown in fig 3 a the occurrence of genes encoding proteins required for nitrite denitrification is shown in fig 3b despite their being stable and robust n2o production after igs in both acidic reactors twenty of the 30 reconstructed genomes harbored the capacity for n2o reduction five of the mags including com1 assigned to comamonadaceae and alc1 assigned to alcaligenaceae which have notably high occurrence in the communities were complete nitrite denitrifiers and harbored the nosz i gene at the onset of phase ii these mags accounted for only 0 7 of the total dna reads however after cessation of igs this group accounted for an average 21 6 of dna read abundance this high occurrence of complete nitrite denitrifiers is distinct from recent studies in an aquifer system and a partial nitritation anammox bioreactor as well as in an analysis of complete genomes retrieved from public databases that have found that incomplete denitrifiers were the dominant type of denitrifier anantharaman et al 2016 graf et al 2014 hallin et al 2017 speth et al 2016 gao et al 2019 at the onset of phase ii mags with nosz ii were numerically dominant occurring in 15 mags and accounted for 9 7 of the total dna reads in the acidic reactors however this group decreased dramatically after igs and only accounted for an average of 3 7 of the total dna reads one possible explanation for the prevalence of bacteria with nosz i after igs is that inert gas sparging is driving off the dissolved gaseous nitrogen oxides e g no and n2o produced during denitrification resulting in nitrite being the principal nitrogen oxide available during phases ii and iv under these circumstances the portion of denitrifiers who lack the capacity to reduce nitrite decreased at the same time mags with nosz i also have a nir but those with nosz ii do not fig 3 this cooccurrence trend is supported by recent work that compared 652 microbial genomes across 18 phyla and found that 83 of the genomes harbor nosz i also have nirs or nirk so organisms with nosz i are more likely to be complete denitrifiers while 51 of n2o reducing bacteria with nosz ii do not have the ability to reduce nitrate or nitrite graf et al 2014 there were 5 mags in the set that lacked nosz but contained either nir or nor and this group accounted for only 1 4 and 1 5 of the total dna reads in the acidic reactors at the end of phase ii and iii respectively so unlike the other mags changes in growth conditions between the end of phase ii and the end of phase iii did not cause any significant change in their occurrence in the community taken together both 16s and metagenomic analysis showed there was not a significant change in the community between the end of phase ii and the end of phase iii therefore a change in the community cannot fully account for the differences in the pe n2o values between these phases suggesting physiological differences were involved 3 4 metatranscriptomic analysis samples from 80d phase ii and 130d phase iii were taken in r4 5 for metatranscriptomic analysis because pe n2o at these two times was steady indicating an adapted community the 30 high quality mags accounted for 62 2 and 58 1 of the total cdna reads obtained from the 80d and 130d samples respectively indicating that they were representative of the expression of the microbial community in the two phases in general gene expression corresponded with abundance in the acidic reactors fig 4 for example com1 had a relative gene expression of 40 1 of total cdna reads whereas alc1 had values of 2 6 however one low abundance genome assigned to mycobacteriaceae myb1 was observed to be particularly active based on gene expression more significantly though nosz i containing organisms had higher levels of transcription than nosz ii containing organisms in both phase ii and phase iii five of the mags that harbored the nosz i gene accounted for 50 4 and 32 6 of cdna reads abundance in phase ii and phase iii respectively while the value of 15 nosz ii gene harboring mags were only 0 3 and 0 5 respectively to further investigate the mechanism of high pe n2o gene expression during phases ii and iii was analyzed in the three mags com1 alc1 and myb1 which accounted for the highest portion of the cdna reads two groups of genes were investigated those required for nitrite denitrification and the 50 genes whose transcripts showed the largest increase in a comparison of the period after cessation of igs to the period during igs in r4 5 fig 5 showed that the expression of nirk and qnor in com1 and alc1 were higher at the end of phase iii relative to the end of phase ii while genes in the nos cluster were down regulated in a similar comparison this expression pattern of the nitrite denitrification genes is consistent with a significant difference in pe n2o under the two different conditions the large changes in expression of genes whose protein products are involved in iron sulfur cluster assembly and repair the isc and suf family was unanticipated highlighted in blue in tables s2 s4 and fig 5 in all three mags transcription of this group of genes was much higher in phase iii than phase ii previous work has shown that the sufabcdse and iscrsua operons are induced under oxidative stress conditions yeo et al 2006 a commonly encountered metabolic stress for pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria is the presence of reactive nitrogen species rns in particular one of the intermediates of denitrification nitric oxide no stern et al 2013 no stress is likely here due to a cessation of igs since this gas is no longer being sparged from the media an increasing production of no as a consequence of decreasing ph during biological denitrification has been found in previous studies for example bergaust et al 2010 liu et al 2014 another important source of no is a consequence of nitrite decomposition to no in low ph conditions through chemodenitrification a process which has been well described bancroft et al 1979 van cleemput and samater 1996 mckenney et al 1990 found that chemodenitrification apparently dominates no production at ph 4 5 and the decreasing ph increased no production rates significantly 0 4 10 8 mol min at ph 5 5 while 2 1 10 8 mol min at ph 4 0 li et al 2018 showed that abiotic nitrite decomposition contributed as much no as biological production at ph 4 9 based on the reported kinetics of nitrite decomposition kappelmeyer et al 2003 venterea et al 2005 lim et al 2018 the amount of no expect to be produced via chemodenitrification biological process unconsidered in all three reactors was calculated fig s4 while these models of no generation ignore biological contributions to its production and consumption they are consistent with the observation that low ph reactors experience higher no stress than the ph 7 5 reactor while nosz does not contain fe s centers there is nonetheless a connection between fe s stability and nos function due to nosr wunsch et al 2005 whose coding gene is one of the genes in the nos gene cluster of both com1 and alc1 fig 5 nosr is a transmembrane protein with a large n terminal flavin binding domain located in the periplasm as well as a c terminal ferredoxin like domain with two 4fe 4s clusters in the cytoplasm wunsch and zumft 2005 zumft and kroneck 2007 nosr is well known to play a critical role in n2o reduction since it was first shown that nosr insertion mutants generated by transposon tn5 mutagenesis no longer produced the nosz transcript cuypers et al 1992 importantly it was also shown that deletion of the ferredoxin like domain significantly decreased the n2o reducing activity of whole cells wunsch et al 2005 the observed upregulation of sufabcdse and iscrsua operons after cessation of igs indicated that the organisms were under oxidative stress conditions likely due to no which could directly react with iron sulfur clusters harrop et al 2008 yang et al 2010 landry et al 2011 it is not unreasonable to conclude then that a no dependent inactivation of nosr is a principal reason for the high pe n2o levels of samples taken during phase iii 3 5 model explaining high pe n2o after igs in acidic condition the results presented provide sufficient evidence to understand how acidic conditions igs and cessation of igs lead to high pe n2o levels during nitrite denitrification during phase i the community undergoes large changes as it adapts to low ph conditions as well as exposure to no at the end of phase i nosz ii containing mags accounted for 9 7 of the total dna reads while the portion of nosz i containing mags was only 0 71 during phase ii igs limits exposure to no and the numbers of organism with nosz i increased significantly at the end of phase ii the portion of nosz i and nosz ii containing organisms were 22 6 and 1 26 respectively bacteria that utilize clade i nos require nosr for n2o reductase activity sanford et al 2012 the metatranscriptomic data suggests there is a no dependent destabilization of fe s proteins which includes nosr in phase iii since the no levels in phase iii increase due to a cessation of igs this results in high pe n2o values this indicates that the community shift is a critical factor for the high pe n2o 97 5 in phase iii compared to that 26 0 in phase i despite no being present in both phases the observation that the pe n2o values in r6 0 are lower is also explained by this model since at this ph the rate of no2 decomposition to no will be lower thus causing lower levels of nosr inactivation 3 6 implication of this work conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are energy intensive and yield little or no recovered resources however with embedded energy in both organic carbon and nutrients n p wastewater has the potential for substantial energy recovery from a low value feedstock a paradigm shift is occurring that is transforming understanding of necessary energy inputs as well as the potential energy of resource outputs from wastewater treatment and energy neutral or even energy positive treatment is increasingly achievable recently energy recovery from n removal has become a focus of research and development among the processes developed cando enables direct energy recovery as n2o from nitrogen gao et al 2014 the necessity of alternating anaerobic phb accumulating and anoxic nitrite reducing periods in its step2 partial anoxic reduction of no2 to n2o creates operational issues since most wastewaters will contain both thus creating challenges that restrict the wider application of the cando process here we describe a method that produces n2o that relies upon low ph incubation and inert gas sparging igs to shift the microbial community to organisms that will accumulate n2o when incubated in the absence of igs during nitrite dependent denitrification the n2o yield in lab scale bioreactors was higher than observed in previous studies scherson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 based on the work described here the configuration of a system allowing high pe n2o that could potentially be implemented in wwtps is shown in fig 6 an acidic sludge treatment unit is added to overcome microflora adaptation sludge cycling between the sidestream sludge treatment unit and the n2o production reactor is proposed to ensure high pe n2o under neutral ph conditions in addition to the development of a stable robust system for high n2o recovery this work offers unique insight into the reasons underlying why low ph can lead to n2o accumulation in many environments the current favored explanation is low ph destabilizes copper centers in nos bergaust et al 2010 the results described here provide evidence that no dependent destabilization of nosr is another reason that no can be a stress in acidic environments has been demonstrated in recent work showing that nor is the dominant denitrification genes in acidic soils roco et al 2019 therefore it is not unreasonable to conclude that if no levels reach levels high enough to select for nor then nosr activity could be impacted as well 4 conclusion in this study a robust and highly efficient n2o recovery approach which has the potential to work with wastewaters containing cod and nitrite simultaneously was developed the data indicated that termination of the igs leads to high pe n2o values under low ph incubation meta omics analysis revealed that igs resulted in an increase in bacteria utilizing nosz i relative to nosz ii the high pe n2o values were resulted from no that inactivate 4fe 4s clusters in the nosr protein in the nosz i denitrifiers this study provides an efficient and straightforward method for n2o recovery as well as unique insight into the reasons underlying why low ph can lead to n2o accumulation in

available poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes the membranes were characterised for surface morphology roughness contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the dcmd test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling during the dcmd test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm pfpea solution the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux from 17 to 43 kg m 2 h 1 and decreased pfpea rejection from 85 to 58 as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 c further the feed retentate side showed a 1 8 2 1 and 2 8 fold increase in pfpea concentration tested at feed temperatures 50 60 and 70 c respectively the permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of pfpea revealing that the pfpea moved across the ptfe membrane during dcmd which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time this study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules such as pfas from source points relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters the study also

instance exhibit at 20 c vapor pressures of 2 48 10 6 and 0 017 mmhg respectively kucharzyk et al 2017 in addition while the inherent stability of the c f bonds also makes it difficult to degrade these compounds the relative solubility of pfas may reach up to 9 5 g l 1 at 25 c in water making them extremely dangerous to living organisms ahrens and bundschuh 2014 ghisi et al 2019 such properties render pfas difficult to degrade through metabolic and environmental processes and progressive pfas accumulation across trophic levels leads to dramatic toxicity in aquatic ecosystems fernandez et al 2016 hekster et al 2003 although pfas compounds have been used across different industries technologies to remove pfas from the environment and ecosystems still need attention pfas

oxidation processes uv irradiation and low pressure membrane separation van der bruggen et al 2003 yu et al 2017 such technologies are however not suited to the remediation of pfas due to their small molecular weight high transportability and diffusivity as well as amphiphilic nature and stability of the c f bond rayne and forest 2009 pfas contaminated water sources are typically found in close proximity to industrial areas landfills airports and firefighting training and operation sites and therefore require advanced separation technologies that can concentrate or selectively capture pfas

conventional techniques thus requiring large amounts of diluted pfas solutions to be thermally destroyed horst et al 2018 the removal of short chain pfas such as perfluorobutanoic acid and perfluoropentanoic acid for instance were not found to be much effective in membrane separation up to 80 leading to direct health and environmental challenges ghisi et al 2019 kucharzyk et al 2017 adsorption with organically modified silica ozo fractionation and viable destruction based methods such as sonochemical degradation electro chemical treatment as well as a combination of advanced oxidation and advanced reduction methods were recently developed and demonstrated to treat such short chain pfas molecules horst et al 2018 kucharzyk et al 2017 nzeribe et al 2019 such operations however remain expensive and difficult to scale up yet lead to either low concentration liquors or lengthy degradation processes due to the inherent low pfas concentrations within the liquors in the order of few ppm to few tens of ppm camacho et al 2013 since pfas chemicals exhibit low vapor pressure evaporative separation techniques may be exploited to facilitate their recovery and concentration from the liquors kucharzyk et al 2017 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd a liquid separation technique using a porous hydrophobic membrane has been extensively used for desalination or concentration applications allowing also for the separation of volatile contaminants from a main solvent stream in this process the vapor passes through the membrane pores depending on the different volatilities of the components in the feed leading to their separation and condensation at the permeate stream smolders and franken 1989 although dcmd was primarily applied to desalination but also to the concentration of complex food or pharmaceutical and petrochemical effluents camacho et al 2013 dumée et al 2013 its use to concentrate surfactant like molecules and effluents rich in amphiphilic compounds was recently demonstrated camacho et al 2013 the operating principle of dcmd relies on the generation of a temperature gradient across the wall of a non wettable macroporous membrane this temperature difference generates a vapor pressure gradient which supports evaporation of the process liquid from the hot feed side and its condensation on the cold permeate side camacho et al 2013 concentration polarization is one of the key phenomena during the dcmd process owing to the system design containing temperature gradient a non volatile solute rich layer close to the membrane surface will dramatically affect the solvent vapor pressure and therefore reduce solvent vapor transfer the vapor pressure gradient due to the temperature difference across hydrophobic membranes in scaled up md systems leads to pure water flux between 20 and 30 kg m 2 h 1 alklaibi and lior 2005 with specific membrane materials designed to transport water vapor up to 98 kg m 2 h 1 and selectivity often above 99 9 wang et al 2011 surface fouling during dcmd operation with fatty acids and hydrophobic molecules however represents a challenge due to the strong molecular interactions between the contaminants and the membrane material surface the evaluation of the nature of specific interactions between complex amphiphilic molecules and potential membrane material modification must be further investigated to develop the next generation of membranes able to work in complex water matrix environments huang et al 2017 wang and lin 2017 in this study poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes were used for efficient concentration and removal of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea a short chain pfas by dcmd pfpea is a low molecular weight and vapor pressure pfas compound having a boiling point of 140 c which is much higher than that of water but yet lower than other pfas compounds used in fire retardants bhhatarai and gramatica 2011 the purpose of this study is therefore to demonstrate for the first time the suitability of dcmd to treat pfas contaminated waters the discussion will be focused on understanding the interactions between pfas and the membrane materials and compare dcmd performance to concentrate pfas to that achieved in literature for ro technologies the study evaluates the ability of dcmd to concentrate pfpea molecules and unravels the mechanism of fouling between the membrane materials and the pfpea molecules based on surface molecular interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals ptfe flat sheet membranes exhibiting an average pore size of 0 46 0 02 μm were procured from ningbo changqi porous membrane technology co ltd ningbo china perfluoropentanoic acid mw 264 05 g mol 1 was procured from sigma aldrich usa deionized di water from a milli q plus system millipore bedford ma usa was used in all experiments 2 2 dcmd set up and operations the removal of pfpea from the aqueous solution was evaluated by performing dcmd tests using the ptfe membrane the membrane module was placed horizontally that allowed the feed solution to flow through the bottom of the module and cooling water through the top of the module using a system previously described elsewhere dumée et al 2016 the inlet temperatures of the hot and cold streams were controlled with insulated heat exchangers all experiments were conducted by setting the flow at 150 rpm on a masterflex catalyst fh100 precision peristaltic pump fitted with double heads and masterflex i p platinum cured silicone tubing matching the flow rate on both feed and permeate streams the flowrate of the pump with the tubing 5 mm inner diameter was around 15 6 0 12 l h 1 while the flow velocity is 22 0 17 cm s 1 the feed and permeate solutions were kept in insulated reservoirs and circulated through the membrane module using the peristaltic pump for each test a new membrane with an area of 490 6 mm2 was used with constant permeate temperature 20 c cold and varying feed temperatures between 50 60 and 70 c hot two series of experiments with different operating periods 6 and 72 h were conducted a 10 ppm pfpea solution was prepared using di water as the feed solution 800 ml for the 6 h run and 5 l for 72 h run temperature conductivity and ph were data logged continuously the conductivities of the feed and permeate were measured using tps conductivity ph meters tps pty ltd brendale queensland australia from which the concentration of pfpea in the feed and permeate tanks were calculated based on the calibration curve fig s1 flux vapor pressures and rejection rates were calculated following previous works dumée et al 2010 a description of the vapor pressure calculations is provided in the supplementary information 2 3 characterisation techniques the surface morphology of the membranes before and after dcmd testing was analysed using scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55vp germany with an accelerating voltage of 5 kv and a working distance of 10 mm before sem imaging the membrane samples were sputter coated with 5 nm gold layer in a high vacuum leica em ace600 profilometry was used to confirm membrane fouling by measuring the surface roughness of membranes before and after the dcmd run using a 3d laser confocal microscope lext ols4100 olympus japan the membrane sample was prepared as 10 mm2 and taped at a flat glass slide 20 mm 50 mm and placed under the lens of the profilometer since the laser scan measurement for the membrane surface is a non contact technique the membrane sample do not need further modification which would cause the damage on the surface the image size was set to 32 32 μm with 1024 1024 pixels using 50 optical lenses and step mode with a resolution of 0 01 μm pitch for scanning the average surface roughness sa was calculated using a 10 10 μm area with the software ols4100 presents the arithmetic average of a 3d roughness water contact angle caw of the membranes was measured before and after dcmd testing using an optical contact angle meter cam101 ksv instruments finland each membrane sample was cut into thin rectangular strips and the two edges of the membrane were pasted onto the heating pad with sticky tape a glass syringe filled with di water was then used to dispense about 4 μl droplet through a needle onto the membrane surface and the caw was calculated with the aid of computer software the reported caw is the average of three values of caw measurements surface fouling of membranes by pfpea was analysed by investigating the surface functional groups of the membrane samples before and after the dcmd test by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy with a single reflection attenuated total reflection atr plate ftir universal atr 9 perkinelmer usa the membrane sample for ftir measurement was cut into a 10 mm2 sheet to have at least 3 points scanned for repetition of spectra the spectra were measured in the absorbance mode from the wavenumber range 600 4000 cm 1 integrated for 64 scans although the ftir data cannot be used to evaluate quantitatively the pfas concentration on the ptfe membranes it was chosen to focus on the carboxylic groups present across the pfas chains this characterization challenge is due to the fact that evaluating quantitatively the fluoride content across a ptfe base membrane fouled by fluoride containing molecules in very high molecular contents as pfas is would not be practical sensitive and quantitative techniques such as xps were considered but would show c f bonds which would be located at the same energy levels regardless if arising from the membrane and the pfas there is therefore no appropriate technique here to truly assess on the membrane the exact pfas content on the membrane surface the pore size distributions of the membranes were measured using a capillary flow porometer 3gzh from quantachrome membrane samples of 25 mm diameter each were thoroughly wetted in the porofil liquid before analysis to ensure that the pores were fully saturated with the liquid and then placed in the sample holder each sample was subjected to pressures from 0 5 to 4 2 bar for a wet and dry run to measure the pore size distribution the pore size was measured three times for each membrane to obtain the average pore size kujawski et al 1989 szczerbińska et al 2017 3 results and discussion the performance of the commercial ptfe membranes to concentrate the pfpea solutions were evaluated over time using dcmd process to assess the potential surface diffusion and plasticization of pfpea across the membranes a systematic study was performed to correlate the surface state of the membranes to the separation performance 3 1 membrane distillation performance in fig 1 a the average flux estimated by the whole duration of dcmd and pfpea rejection are presented the flux increased from 17 5 to 42 4 kg m 2 h 1 for feed temperatures set between 50 and 70 c corresponding to an estimated vapor pressure difference range between feed and permeate from 6 2 to 20 3 kpa table s1 at a feed temperature of 50 c the rejection of pfpea reached the highest value reported of this study at 85 the rejection of pfpea was found to drop from 85 to 58 with respect to the feed temperature increase from 50 to 70 c correlated to an increase in the rate of evaporation of feed solution the rejection was corresponding to the pfpea concentrations over time which increased steadily on both the feed and permeate sides fig 1 b c for the feed side the pfpea concentration increased from 10 to 18 3 ppm at 50 c feed temperature and to 26 7 ppm at 70 c feed temperature this aspect was attributed as elaborated further in section 3 4 to the higher rate of water evaporation at higher feed temperature which supported the drag diffusion of pfas molecules across the surface of the pores of the membranes on the permeate side the pfpea concentration increased up to 0 10 ppm at a 50 c feed temperature and to 0 68 ppm at 70 c feed temperature the flux of pfpea during the dcmd was also estimated from the concentration variation as a function with vapor pressure differences to support the decrease of rejection due to high vapor pressure fig s2 in addition a 72 h dcmd experiment with a feed temperature of 60 c and a permeate temperature of 20 c was performed due to the relatively limited rejection 82 and flux recorded for 6 h compared to that at feed temperatures of 50 and 70 c the average flux reached 27 5 kg m 2 h 1 when the temperatures of feed and permeate solutions were stabilized and then decreased to 24 5 kg m 2 h 1 at the 72 h point fig s3a the changes in the pfpea concentration for both feed and permeate sides are shown in fig s3b both potential membrane compaction and fouling of membranes were suspected to yield the decrease of flux observed over time this unusual aspect related to the initial water vapor increase was related to the initial surface hydrophobization arising from the pfas fouling across the membrane surface past a certain point the pfas fouling layer started to restrict the size of the pores and thus reduced the water evaporation rate as visible from the second part of the section where the water vapor transfer becomes hindered this aspect will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 surface morphology of the pfas fouled membranes as seen across the sems of the surface of the ptfe membranes extensive fouling occurred quickly as accumulated layers over the separation operation fig 2 both globular matter and damaged ptfe fibrils native to the structure of the ptfe membranes and foulant precipitation occurred during the stretching step of the ptfe films and is used to generate the porous structure figs 2 and s4 zarebska et al 2014 as seen in fig 2 the fouling across the membrane surface increased with the feed temperature from 50 to 70 c corresponding to the higher rate of evaporation in feed the permeate side of the ptfe membranes was also imaged by sem to assess the potential presence of pfpea as revealed across the sems fig s4 a e the morphology of ptfe membranes on the permeate side remained clean without any visible deposition in addition cross sectional sems of the 72 h tested membrane confirms a few micrometers of surface fouling with pfpea down to the top of the ptfe membrane structure figure s4 f assessing quantitatively the distribution of pfpea across the material was however difficult due to the limited amount of foulants present lawson and lloyd 1997 the roughness of the membrane surface was also evaluated to reveal the extent of the fouling process with an increase in temperature and duration of dcmd 3d maps developed by laser profilometry revealed the deposition of the foulant layer attributing to a smoothing effect to the membrane surface fig 3 as compared with the roughness of the pristine membrane 454 46 8 nm the sa roughness was reduced by 22 for the membrane tested at 50 c in dcmd 356 41 5 nm surface roughness however became smoother with 309 33 nm and then rougher with 397 83 5 nm for membranes tested at 60 c and 70 c feed temperatures in fig 4 a and fig s5 there was a slight increase in the water contact angles from 112 5 2 3 to 115 5 4 8 when the feed temperature increase from 50 to 70 c during dcmd experiments respectively furthermore for the 72 h dcmd tested membrane at 60 c the roughness increased to 432 105 6 nm by the accumulation of foulant layers and a higher contact angle of 116 9 5 4 was measured 3 3 composition analysis of the surface of the fouled membranes ftir was used to analyse the chemical composition of the membrane before and after dcmd tests fig 4 b and figure s6 a and was used to determine pfpea fouling across the ptfe membrane since the signature of the fluoro compounds adsorbing across the membrane material used in dcmd would be similar to the footprint of the native ptfe material direct quantitative evaluation of the pfpea content was rendered difficult as seen in fig 4 c a small shoulder band at estimate 1022 cm 1 was found after all dcmd tests which may be attributed to the c o bonding arising from the carboxylic groups present as terminal chains across the molecules galante et al 2010 nakanaga et al 1994 at 70 c the intensity of this band was more prominent for the samples tested further again supporting the correlation between the density of surface contaminants and feed temperatures furthermore the intensity of the c o band from membrane tested at 60 c for 72 h increased compared to the membrane tested at 60 c for 6 h demonstrating a higher density of foulants on the membrane with an increase in testing duration as shown in fig s6 b in addition the band at approximately 802 cm 1 could be attributed to cf3 deformation also belonging to the pfpea mukherjee et al 2010 warren and mcquillan 2008 ftir results suggest that the foulant present on the ptfe membrane shows highest intensity band of pfpea located in the spectra from the higher temperature and longer duration series 3 4 discussion on the fouling and rejection mechanisms based on the dcmd performance and characterizations of the ptfe membranes after tests a mechanism to explain fouling of pfpea onto the ptfe membrane was developed since the pfas materials including pfpea have been used as a surfactant for fire retardant applications similar physical behaviour was suggested during mixing with water with normal surfactant and proteins chew et al 2017 as seen in fig 5 a initially when the feed is in contact with the ptfe membrane the pfpea in the feed was progressively adsorbed onto the surface of the ptfe fibrils acting similar to surfactant molecules the fouling would nucleate into globular structures filling up the surface and pores until a semi continuous but yet inhomogeneous potential liquid solid transition state layer was developed the low volatility of pfpea with partial vapor pressure values around 0 7 pa at 22 25 c and a low mole fraction of 6 82 10 4 compared to water in the feed solution do not support the hypothesis of transient evaporation of pfpea but that of surface diffusion during dcmd from table s1 öberg and liu 2011 tijing et al 2015 the rate of vaporization of water is more than 4000 times higher than pfpea kucharzyk et al 2017 supporting the unlikeliness of pfpea evaporation during the dcmd process table s1 however the increased pfpea concentration on the permeate sides suggests that either evaporation or surface diffusion across occurred across the inner surface of the fibrils and would initiate fouling of the membranes during the process fig 5 b the increase in evaporation rate on the feed leading to a higher speed of vapor across the membrane dramatically affected the concentration polarization of pfpea across the surface of the membrane therefore the pfpea concentration gradient in close vicinity to the surface of ptfe membrane could continuously increase in the concentration polarized layer on the feed side gryta 2008 at 25 c precipitation of pfpea onto the membrane surface should happen if the concentration of the foulant overcomes 61 11 mg l 1 which corresponds to the solubility limit as from data provided on the us environmental protection agency s epi suite unfortunately data for pfpea at higher temperatures are not available but based on other fluorinated surfactant molecules it is expected that the solubility limit shall nearly double each time the solution temperature itself is doubled it would therefore be realistic if the solubility limit at 50 and 70 c was in the range 100 150 mg l 1 as the pfpea accumulates onto the membrane surface the concentration gradient across the membrane would increase which may facilitate surface diffusion due to physical surface wicking across the pores of the membrane chew et al 2017 lawson and lloyd 1997 wang et al 2018b among the tested membranes the highest increase in water contact angle i e 1 1 fold for membrane tested at 60 c for 72 h confirmed the hydrophobicity of membrane from the accumulation made from the hydrophobic fluorinated tail of pfpea again supporting the fact that direct liquid intrusion is highly difficult franken et al 1987 goh et al 2013 in addition the pfpea concentrating over the surface of the membrane would form a monolayer across the pores due to the amphiphilic nature of the foulant which locally reduced the evaporation of water barnes 2008 the higher water evaporation rates were found to act as a physical driving force for the pfpea surface diffusion supporting dragging of the materials across the pore surface this rationale is substantiated by the fact that the 3 3 fold increase in water vapor pressure difference between the 50 and 70 c feed temperatures led to a nearly doubled rejection of pfas at 50 c compared to 70 c this aspect is truly critical in the present study since it highlights the role of the process parameters on the dynamics of fouling and foulant pore penetration lawson and lloyd 1997 in addition the sem morphology of the permeate side of ptfe membrane indicates that the diffused pfpea is likely to re dissolve as soon as it reaches the cold stream side fig 5 c wang et al 2018b hence the pfpea would transit to partial solid liquid state during the surface diffusion across the membrane pores and dissolved easily to the permeate as shown in fig 5 d a direct physical bridge may form leading to a much longer duration of pore filling and accumulation diffusion to the permeate side for the long term dcmd run amaya vías et al 2019 wang et al 2018b therefore compared to pressure driven membrane separation systems such as nf and ro pfas during dcmd is unlikely to permeate across the membrane either liquid phase without high pressure input i e nf at least 200 kpa ro typically around 1300 kpa or in vapor phase due to the native vapor pressure of pfas compounds tang et al 2006 2007 wang et al 2018a the severe fouling visible across the ptfe membranes here may not only affect the water permeation performance but also hint at other surface diffusion mechanisms and impact the ptfe membrane materials durably the sems of the surface of the membranes hint at potential plasticization of the ptfe due to the strong interactions between the pfas fluoro compounds and ptfe membrane zhang et al 2019 the plasticization happened across the membrane surface weakening the ptfe fibrils leading to premature damage of the membranes fig 2 lath et al 2019 pfas are commonly used as plasticizers across plastic items improving flame retardancy and thermal stability of materials and are therefore known to diffuse well across polymeric materials the pfpea used in the current study could also act like a surfactant molecule and be attracted towards the membrane surface to produce an adsorbed layer eventually reducing the evaporation rate of the water across the membrane chew et al 2017 the pore size evaluation of the membranes was found to be affected initially upon contact with the membranes over the testing fig s7 shahid and nijmeijer 2014 swaidan et al 2015 the average pore size of pristine ptfe was found at 0 46 0 02 μm which slightly decreased to 0 40 0 02 μm after the dcmd run at 50 c and then increased to 0 48 0 05 μm at 60 c which finally reached 0 67 0 04 μm at 70 c the smaller pore size from the 50 c dcmd indicates the potential of minor effects on the fracture of ptfe fibrils but fouling and partial filling of pores due to the lower plasticization kinetics at 50 c compared to 60 and 70 c hence when higher feed temperature was applied plasticization and lead to an increased amount of feed to be transported i e a relatively high amount of pfpea to diffuse across the pore surface then a slight decrease in flux was presented at 20 h dcmd test forming layers of foulant on the membrane surface corresponding to the broken fibrils as shown in the sem image and pore size distribution the changes in pore size visible after dcmd operation for 72 h at 60 c confirm the damage of ptfe fibrils and suggest that membrane materials should be redesigned for this application to match the amphiphilic nature of the compounds as well as their ability to affect such polymeric materials profoundly the flux decline observed for the dcmd tests performed for 72 h resulted in a drop of 9 1 while previously reported nf permeation reduction due to surface fouling was found to be on the order of 16 after accounting for compaction of the support layer material tang et al 2007 the rejection for the short chain pfas less than c5 was maximum 85 in dcmd under 6 2 kpa vapor pressure compared to the reported 80 in nf under 600 kpa wang et al 2018a in addition to potentially prevent the fouling a coating based on ceramic or oleophobic materials could be used to block diffusion of pfpea into the ptfe structure razmjou et al 2012 the engineering of specific membrane materials for such complex amphiphilic and fluorinated compounds should be re envisaged to yield membranes which are mechanically stury and able to deliver stable long term performance 4 conclusions and perspectives this study revealed for the first time the potential of dcmd to capture and concentrate a model pfas compounds and evaluate the specific fouling mechanisms occurring during the operation the choice of this short 5 carbon pfas compound was made to evaluate the performance of the system to deal with one of the most mobile and low molecular weight of the pfas materials available it was found that severe fouling of the membranes occurred over the scope of the test for the first few hours of concentration while slow surface diffusion of pfpea across the pores led to a decrease in rejection the wettability and pore size measurements showed a tendency for hydrophobization and a likely plasticization of the membrane material leading to ptfe fibrils fracture from diffusion of the fluorinated compounds into the bulk polymer practical routes to reduce the impact of the surface fouling across the dcmd membranes may be considered to reduce the adverse deposition of pfas over time given the relatively large pore size of dcmd membranes compared to other desalination technologies challenges related beyond surface fouling to pore clogging render any remediation treatments difficult such strategies to name the main ones applied to date include i the use of anti scalant or chemical cleanings ii the application of micro or electromagnetic waves iii air bubbles scourging and back washing as well as iv surface modifications of the membrane materials tijing et al 2015 zarebska et al 2015 such strategies could be relevant to pfas mitigation and shall be considered in future works on amphiphilic materials concentration or dewatering the potential of other commercial membrane materials including poly vinyldifluoride and poly propylene membranes could also represent viable options to limit the f f interactions and therefore the surface diffusion it is however likely that such mechanisms although potentially reduced in scale would nevertheless occur over time and at higher operating temperatures as discussing in the present work further studies should therefore focus on the development of surface coatings allowing for anti fouling behaviours with oleophobic properties to prevent adsorption diffusion and penetration across the membrane materials the kinetics of pfas molecules surface diffusion as well as the impact of more diverse water matrices including various pfas chain length would also be relevant items to test in order to develop a comprehensive model towards surface fouling and materials stability this work not only opens a new avenue for the concentration of amphiphilic molecules with potential beyond pfas remediation but also identifies potential structural and chemical modifications of the membrane materials to improve the efficiency

17811,polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are ecotoxic amphiphilic compounds containing alkyl fluorinated chains terminated with weak acid moieties and hence difficult to be degraded or removed from water sources direct contact membrane distillation dcmd was used for concentrating and removing of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea compounds from model contaminated water using commercially available poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes the membranes were characterised for surface morphology roughness contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the dcmd test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling during the dcmd test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm pfpea solution the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux from 17 to 43 kg m 2 h 1 and decreased pfpea rejection from 85 to 58 as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 c further the feed retentate side showed a 1 8 2 1 and 2 8 fold increase in pfpea concentration tested at feed temperatures 50 60 and 70 c respectively the permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of pfpea revealing that the pfpea moved across the ptfe membrane during dcmd which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time this study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules such as pfas from source points relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters the study also points at gaps in materials science and surface engineering to be tackled to deal with pfas compounds efficiently graphical abstract image 1 keywords direct contact membrane distillation pfas hydrophobic interactions surface fouling water purification 1 introduction polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are extremely persistent toxic contaminants exert harmful effects on living organisms and ecosystems showing long range transport through groundwater and surface water ahrens and bundschuh 2014 pfas are amphiphilic molecules composed of hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chains terminated by either hydrophilic weak carboxylic or sulphonic acid functional groups and exhibiting very low vapor pressures perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for instance exhibit at 20 c vapor pressures of 2 48 10 6 and 0 017 mmhg respectively kucharzyk et al 2017 in addition while the inherent stability of the c f bonds also makes it difficult to degrade these compounds the relative solubility of pfas may reach up to 9 5 g l 1 at 25 c in water making them extremely dangerous to living organisms ahrens and bundschuh 2014 ghisi et al 2019 such properties render pfas difficult to degrade through metabolic and environmental processes and progressive pfas accumulation across trophic levels leads to dramatic toxicity in aquatic ecosystems fernandez et al 2016 hekster et al 2003 although pfas compounds have been used across different industries technologies to remove pfas from the environment and ecosystems still need attention pfas

plating textile finishing and fire retardant foam products or additives in plastics ahrens and bundschuh 2014 rahman et al 2014 although the production of pfas became restricted in 2009 horst et al

birds and mammals in human pfas may accumulate in the blood serum which may trigger cancer damage liver disrupt hormones and alter kidney functions ghisi et al 2019 pelch et al 2019 the epa us

ecosystems traditional technologies used for treatment of wastewaters include coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand bed filtration biofiltration oxidation chlorination ozonation advanced oxidation processes uv irradiation and low pressure membrane separation van der bruggen et al 2003 yu et al 2017 such technologies are however not suited to the remediation of pfas due to their small molecular weight high transportability and diffusivity as well as amphiphilic nature and stability of the c f bond rayne and forest 2009 pfas contaminated water sources are typically found in close proximity to industrial areas landfills airports and firefighting training and operation sites and therefore require advanced separation technologies that can concentrate or selectively capture pfas

removal followed by oxidation thermal pyrolysis and plant and microbial digestion to degrade pfas rahman et al 2014 nf was found to yield over 90 rejection while ro trials were reported to achieve over 99 rejection of pfas compounds containing at least 5 carbon atoms present on the main chains within a pressure range of 2 5 20 bar tang et al 2006 2007 wang et al 2018a although long chain pfas molecules 14 carbon atom chains and longer may be effectively removed using traditional extraction concentration methods low molecular weight pfas compounds cannot be easily extracted with such conventional techniques thus requiring large amounts of diluted pfas solutions to be thermally destroyed horst et al 2018 the removal of short chain pfas such as perfluorobutanoic acid and

however remain expensive and difficult to scale up yet lead to either low concentration liquors or lengthy degradation processes due to the inherent low pfas concentrations within the liquors in the

temperature difference generates a vapor pressure gradient which supports evaporation of the process liquid from the hot feed side and its condensation on the cold permeate side camacho et al 2013 concentration polarization is one of the key phenomena during the dcmd process owing to the system design containing temperature gradient a non volatile solute rich layer close to the membrane surface will dramatically affect the solvent vapor pressure and therefore reduce solvent vapor transfer the vapor pressure gradient due to the temperature difference across hydrophobic membranes in scaled up md systems leads to pure water flux between 20 and 30 kg m 2 h 1 alklaibi and lior 2005 with specific membrane materials designed to transport water vapor up to 98 kg m 2 h 1 and selectivity often above 99 9 wang et al 2011 surface fouling during dcmd operation with fatty acids and hydrophobic molecules however represents a challenge due to the strong molecular interactions between the contaminants and the membrane material surface the evaluation of the nature of specific interactions between complex amphiphilic molecules and potential membrane material modification must be further investigated to develop the next generation of membranes able to work in complex water matrix environments huang et al 2017 wang and lin 2017 in this study poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes were used for efficient concentration and removal of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea a short chain pfas by dcmd pfpea is a low molecular weight and vapor pressure pfas compound having a boiling point of 140 c which is much higher than that of water but yet lower than other pfas compounds used in fire retardants bhhatarai and gramatica 2011 the purpose of this study is therefore to demonstrate for the first time the suitability of dcmd to treat pfas contaminated waters the discussion will be focused on understanding the interactions between pfas and the membrane materials and compare dcmd performance to concentrate pfas to that achieved in literature for ro technologies the study evaluates the ability of dcmd to concentrate pfpea molecules and unravels the mechanism of fouling between the membrane materials and the pfpea molecules based on surface molecular interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals ptfe flat sheet membranes exhibiting an average pore size of 0 46 0 02 μm were procured from ningbo changqi porous membrane technology co ltd ningbo china perfluoropentanoic acid mw 264 05 g mol 1 was procured from sigma aldrich usa deionized di water from a milli q plus system millipore bedford ma usa was used in all experiments 2 2 dcmd set up and operations the removal of pfpea from the aqueous solution was evaluated by performing dcmd tests using the ptfe membrane the membrane module was placed horizontally that allowed the feed solution to flow through the bottom of the module and cooling water through the top of the module using a system previously described elsewhere dumée et al 2016 the inlet temperatures of the hot and cold streams were controlled with insulated heat exchangers all experiments were conducted by setting the flow at 150 rpm on a masterflex catalyst fh100 precision peristaltic pump fitted with double heads and masterflex i p platinum cured silicone tubing matching the flow rate on both feed and permeate streams the flowrate of the pump with the tubing 5 mm inner diameter was around 15 6 0 12 l h 1 while the flow velocity is 22 0 17 cm s 1 the feed and permeate solutions were kept in insulated reservoirs and circulated through the membrane module using the peristaltic pump for each test a new membrane with an area of 490 6 mm2 was used with constant permeate temperature 20 c cold and varying feed temperatures between 50 60 and 70 c hot two series of experiments with different operating periods 6 and 72 h were conducted a 10 ppm pfpea solution was prepared using di water as the feed solution 800 ml for the 6 h run and 5 l for 72 h run temperature conductivity and ph were data logged continuously the conductivities of the feed and permeate were measured using tps conductivity ph meters tps pty ltd brendale queensland australia from which the concentration of pfpea in the feed and permeate tanks were calculated based on the calibration curve fig s1 flux vapor pressures and rejection rates were calculated following previous works dumée et al 2010 a description of the vapor pressure calculations is provided in the supplementary information 2 3 characterisation techniques the surface morphology of the membranes before and after dcmd testing was analysed using scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55vp germany with an accelerating voltage of 5 kv and a working distance of 10 mm before sem imaging the membrane samples were sputter coated with 5 nm gold layer in a high vacuum leica em ace600 profilometry was used to confirm membrane fouling by measuring the surface roughness of membranes before and after the dcmd run using a 3d laser confocal microscope lext ols4100 olympus japan the membrane sample was prepared as 10 mm2 and taped at a flat glass slide 20 mm 50 mm and placed under the lens of the profilometer since the laser scan measurement for the membrane surface is a non contact technique the membrane sample do not need further modification which would cause the damage on the surface the image size was set to 32 32 μm with 1024 1024 pixels using 50 optical lenses and step mode with a resolution of 0 01 μm pitch for scanning the average surface roughness sa was calculated using a 10 10 μm area with the software ols4100 presents the arithmetic average of a 3d roughness water contact angle caw of the membranes was measured before and after dcmd testing using an optical contact angle meter cam101 ksv instruments finland each membrane sample was cut into thin rectangular strips and the two edges of the membrane were pasted onto the heating pad with sticky tape a glass syringe filled with di water was then used to dispense about 4 μl droplet through a needle onto the membrane surface and the caw was calculated with the aid of computer software the reported caw is the average of three values of caw measurements surface fouling of membranes by pfpea was analysed by investigating the surface functional groups of the membrane samples before and after the dcmd test by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy with a single reflection attenuated total reflection atr plate ftir universal atr 9 perkinelmer usa the membrane sample for ftir measurement was cut into a 10 mm2 sheet to have at least 3 points scanned for repetition of spectra the spectra were measured in the absorbance mode from the wavenumber range 600 4000 cm 1 integrated for 64 scans although the ftir data cannot be used to evaluate quantitatively the pfas concentration on the ptfe membranes it was chosen to focus on the carboxylic groups present across the pfas chains this characterization challenge is due to the fact that evaluating quantitatively the fluoride content across a ptfe base membrane fouled by fluoride containing molecules in very high molecular contents as pfas is would not be practical sensitive and quantitative techniques such as xps were considered but would show c f bonds which would be located at the same energy levels regardless if arising from the membrane and the pfas there is therefore no appropriate technique here to truly assess on the membrane the exact pfas content on the membrane surface the pore size distributions of the membranes were measured using a capillary flow porometer 3gzh from quantachrome membrane samples of 25 mm diameter each were thoroughly wetted in the porofil liquid before analysis to ensure that the pores were fully saturated with the liquid and then placed in the sample holder each sample was subjected to pressures from 0 5 to 4 2 bar for a wet and dry run to measure the pore size distribution the pore size was measured three times for each membrane to obtain the average pore size kujawski et al 1989 szczerbińska et al 2017 3 results and discussion the performance of the commercial ptfe membranes to concentrate the pfpea solutions were evaluated over time using dcmd process to assess the potential surface diffusion and plasticization of pfpea across the membranes a systematic study was performed to correlate the surface state of the membranes to the separation performance 3 1 membrane distillation performance in fig 1 a the average flux estimated by the whole duration of dcmd and pfpea rejection are presented the flux increased from 17 5 to 42 4 kg m 2 h 1 for feed temperatures set between 50 and 70 c corresponding to an estimated vapor pressure difference range between feed and permeate from 6 2 to 20 3 kpa table s1 at a feed temperature of 50 c the rejection of pfpea reached the highest value reported of this study at 85 the rejection of pfpea was found to drop from 85 to 58 with respect to the feed temperature increase from 50 to 70 c correlated to an increase in the rate of evaporation of feed solution the rejection was corresponding to the pfpea concentrations over time which increased steadily on both the feed and permeate sides fig 1 b c for the feed side the pfpea concentration increased from 10 to 18 3 ppm at 50 c feed temperature and to 26 7 ppm at 70 c feed temperature this aspect was attributed as elaborated further in section 3 4 to the higher rate of water evaporation at higher feed temperature which supported the drag diffusion of pfas molecules across the surface of the pores of the membranes on the permeate side the pfpea concentration increased up to 0 10 ppm at a 50 c feed temperature and to 0 68 ppm at 70 c feed temperature the flux of pfpea during the dcmd was also estimated from the concentration variation as a function with vapor pressure differences to support the decrease of rejection due to high vapor pressure fig s2 in addition a 72 h dcmd experiment with a feed temperature of 60 c and a permeate temperature of 20 c was performed due to the relatively limited rejection 82 and flux recorded for 6 h compared to that at feed temperatures of 50 and 70 c the average flux reached 27 5 kg m 2 h 1 when the temperatures of feed and permeate solutions were stabilized and then decreased to 24 5 kg m 2 h 1 at the 72 h point fig s3a the changes in the pfpea concentration for both feed and permeate sides are shown in fig s3b both potential membrane compaction and fouling of membranes were suspected to yield the decrease of flux observed over time this unusual aspect related to the initial water vapor increase was related to the initial surface hydrophobization arising from the pfas fouling across the membrane surface past a certain point the pfas fouling layer started to restrict the size of the pores and thus reduced the water evaporation rate as visible from the second part of the section where the water vapor transfer becomes hindered this aspect will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 surface morphology of the pfas fouled membranes as seen across the sems of the surface of the ptfe membranes extensive fouling occurred quickly as accumulated layers over the separation operation fig 2 both globular matter and damaged ptfe fibrils native to the structure of the ptfe membranes and foulant precipitation occurred during the stretching step of the ptfe films and is used to generate the porous structure figs 2 and s4 zarebska et al 2014 as seen in fig 2 the fouling across the membrane surface increased with the feed temperature from 50 to 70 c corresponding to the higher rate of evaporation in feed the permeate side of the ptfe membranes was also imaged by sem to assess the potential presence of pfpea as revealed across the sems fig s4 a e the morphology of ptfe membranes on the permeate side remained clean without any visible deposition in addition cross sectional sems of the 72 h tested membrane confirms a few micrometers of surface fouling with pfpea down to the top of the ptfe membrane structure figure s4 f assessing quantitatively the distribution of pfpea across the material was however difficult due to the limited amount of foulants present lawson and lloyd 1997 the roughness of the membrane surface was also evaluated to reveal the extent of the fouling process with an increase in temperature and duration of dcmd 3d maps developed by laser profilometry revealed the deposition of the foulant layer attributing to a smoothing effect to the membrane surface fig 3 as compared with the roughness of the pristine membrane 454 46 8 nm the sa roughness was reduced by 22 for the membrane tested at 50 c in dcmd 356 41 5 nm surface roughness however became smoother with 309 33 nm and then rougher with 397 83 5 nm for membranes tested at 60 c and 70 c feed temperatures in fig 4 a and fig s5 there was a slight increase in the water contact angles from 112 5 2 3 to 115 5 4 8 when the feed temperature increase from 50 to 70 c during dcmd experiments respectively furthermore for the 72 h dcmd tested membrane at 60 c the roughness increased to 432 105 6 nm by the accumulation of foulant layers and a higher contact angle of 116 9 5 4 was measured 3 3 composition analysis of the surface of the fouled membranes ftir was used to analyse the chemical composition of the membrane before and after dcmd tests fig 4 b and figure s6 a and was used to determine pfpea fouling across the ptfe membrane since the signature of the fluoro compounds adsorbing across the membrane material used in dcmd would be similar to the footprint of the native ptfe material direct quantitative evaluation of the pfpea content was rendered difficult as seen in fig 4 c a small shoulder band at estimate 1022 cm 1 was found after all dcmd tests which may be attributed to the c o bonding arising from the carboxylic groups present as terminal chains across the molecules galante et al 2010 nakanaga et al 1994 at 70 c the intensity of this band was more prominent for the samples tested further again supporting the correlation between the density of surface contaminants and feed temperatures furthermore the intensity of the c o band from membrane tested at 60 c for 72 h increased compared to the membrane tested at 60 c for 6 h demonstrating a higher density of foulants on the membrane with an increase in testing duration as shown in fig s6 b in addition the band at approximately 802 cm 1 could be attributed to cf3 deformation also belonging to the pfpea mukherjee et al 2010 warren and mcquillan 2008 ftir results suggest that the foulant present on the ptfe membrane shows highest intensity band of pfpea located in the spectra from the higher temperature and longer duration series 3 4 discussion on the fouling and rejection mechanisms based on the dcmd performance and characterizations of the ptfe membranes after tests a mechanism to explain fouling of pfpea onto the ptfe membrane was developed since the pfas materials including pfpea have been used as a surfactant for fire retardant applications similar physical behaviour was suggested during mixing with water with normal surfactant and proteins chew et al 2017 as seen in fig 5 a initially when the feed is in contact with the ptfe membrane the pfpea in the feed was progressively adsorbed onto the surface of the ptfe fibrils acting similar to surfactant molecules the fouling would nucleate into globular structures filling up the surface and pores until a semi continuous but yet inhomogeneous potential liquid solid transition state layer was developed the low volatility of pfpea with partial vapor pressure values around 0 7 pa at 22 25 c and a low mole fraction of 6 82 10 4 compared to water in the feed solution do not support the hypothesis of transient evaporation of pfpea but that of surface diffusion during dcmd from table s1 öberg and liu 2011 tijing et al 2015 the rate of vaporization of water is more than 4000 times higher than pfpea kucharzyk et al 2017 supporting the unlikeliness of pfpea evaporation during the dcmd process table s1 however the increased pfpea concentration on the permeate sides suggests that either evaporation or surface diffusion across occurred across the inner surface of the fibrils and would initiate fouling of the membranes during the process fig 5 b the increase in evaporation rate on the feed leading to a higher speed of vapor across the membrane dramatically affected the concentration polarization of pfpea across the surface of the membrane therefore the pfpea concentration gradient in close vicinity to the surface of ptfe membrane could continuously increase in the concentration polarized layer on the feed side gryta 2008 at 25 c precipitation of pfpea onto the membrane surface should happen if the concentration of the foulant overcomes 61 11 mg l 1 which corresponds to the solubility limit as from data provided on the us environmental protection agency s epi suite unfortunately data for pfpea at higher temperatures are not available but based on other fluorinated surfactant molecules it is expected that the solubility limit shall nearly double each time the solution temperature itself is doubled it would therefore be realistic if the solubility limit at 50 and 70 c was in the range 100 150 mg l 1 as the pfpea accumulates onto the membrane surface the concentration gradient across the membrane would increase which may facilitate surface diffusion due to physical surface wicking across the pores of the membrane chew et al 2017 lawson and lloyd 1997 wang et al 2018b among the tested membranes the highest increase in water contact angle i e 1 1 fold for membrane tested at 60 c for 72 h confirmed the hydrophobicity of membrane from the accumulation made from the hydrophobic fluorinated tail of pfpea again supporting the fact that direct liquid intrusion is highly difficult franken et al 1987 goh et al 2013 in addition the pfpea concentrating over the surface of the membrane would form a monolayer across the pores due to the amphiphilic nature of the foulant which locally reduced the evaporation of water barnes 2008 the higher water evaporation rates were found to act as a physical driving force for the pfpea surface diffusion supporting dragging of the materials across the pore surface this rationale is substantiated by the fact that the 3 3 fold increase in water vapor pressure difference between the 50 and 70 c feed temperatures led to a nearly doubled rejection of pfas at 50 c compared to 70 c this aspect is truly critical in the present study since it highlights the role of the process parameters on the dynamics of fouling and foulant pore penetration lawson and lloyd 1997 in addition the sem morphology of the permeate side of ptfe membrane indicates that the diffused pfpea is likely to re dissolve as soon as it reaches the cold stream side fig 5 c wang et al 2018b hence the pfpea would transit to partial solid liquid state during the surface diffusion across the membrane pores and dissolved easily to the permeate as shown in fig 5 d a direct physical bridge may form leading to a much longer duration of pore filling and accumulation diffusion to the permeate side for the long term dcmd run amaya vías et al 2019 wang et al 2018b therefore compared to pressure driven membrane separation systems such as nf and ro pfas during dcmd is unlikely to permeate across the membrane either liquid phase without high pressure input i e nf at least 200 kpa ro typically around 1300 kpa or in vapor phase due to the native vapor pressure of pfas compounds tang et al 2006 2007 wang et al 2018a the severe fouling visible across the ptfe membranes here may not only affect the water permeation performance but also hint at other surface diffusion mechanisms and impact the ptfe membrane materials durably the sems of the surface of the membranes hint at potential plasticization of the ptfe due to the strong interactions between the pfas fluoro compounds and ptfe membrane zhang et al 2019 the plasticization happened across the membrane surface weakening the ptfe fibrils leading to premature damage of the membranes fig 2 lath et al 2019 pfas are commonly used as plasticizers across plastic items improving flame retardancy and thermal stability of materials and are therefore known to diffuse well across polymeric materials the pfpea used in the current study could also act like a surfactant molecule and be attracted towards the membrane surface to produce an adsorbed layer eventually reducing the evaporation rate of the water across the membrane chew et al 2017 the pore size evaluation of the membranes was found to be affected initially upon contact with the membranes over the testing fig s7 shahid and nijmeijer 2014 swaidan et al 2015 the average pore size of pristine ptfe was found at 0 46 0 02 μm which slightly decreased to 0 40 0 02 μm after the dcmd run at 50 c and then increased to 0 48 0 05 μm at 60 c which finally reached 0 67 0 04 μm at 70 c the smaller pore size from the 50 c dcmd indicates the potential of minor effects on the fracture of ptfe fibrils but fouling and partial filling of pores due to the lower plasticization kinetics at 50 c compared to 60 and 70 c hence when higher feed temperature was applied plasticization and lead to an increased amount of feed to be transported i e a relatively high amount of pfpea to diffuse across the pore surface then a slight decrease in flux was presented at 20 h dcmd test forming layers of foulant on the membrane surface corresponding to the broken fibrils as shown in the sem image and pore size distribution the changes in pore size visible after dcmd operation for 72 h at 60 c confirm the damage of ptfe fibrils and suggest that membrane materials should be redesigned for this application to match the amphiphilic nature of the compounds as well as their ability to affect such polymeric materials profoundly the flux decline observed for the dcmd tests performed for 72 h resulted in a drop of 9 1 while previously reported nf permeation reduction due to surface fouling was found to be on the order of 16 after accounting for compaction of the support layer material tang et al 2007 the rejection for the short chain pfas less than c5 was maximum 85 in dcmd under 6 2 kpa vapor pressure compared to the reported 80 in nf under 600 kpa wang et al 2018a in addition to potentially prevent the fouling a coating based on ceramic or oleophobic materials could be used to block diffusion of pfpea into the ptfe structure razmjou et al 2012 the engineering of specific membrane materials for such complex amphiphilic and fluorinated compounds should be re envisaged to yield membranes which are mechanically stury and able to deliver stable long term performance 4 conclusions and perspectives this study revealed for the first time the potential of dcmd to capture and concentrate a model pfas compounds and evaluate the specific fouling mechanisms occurring during the operation the choice of this short 5 carbon pfas compound was made to evaluate the performance of the system to deal with one of the most mobile and low molecular weight of the pfas materials available it was found that severe fouling of the membranes occurred over the scope of the test for the first few hours of concentration while slow surface diffusion of pfpea across the pores led to a decrease in rejection the wettability and pore size measurements showed a tendency for hydrophobization and a likely plasticization of the membrane material leading to ptfe fibrils fracture from diffusion of the fluorinated compounds into the bulk polymer practical routes to reduce the impact of the surface fouling across the dcmd membranes may be considered to reduce the adverse deposition of pfas over time given the relatively large pore size of dcmd membranes compared to other desalination technologies challenges related beyond surface fouling to pore clogging render any remediation treatments difficult such strategies to name the main ones applied to date include i the use of anti scalant or chemical cleanings ii the application of micro or electromagnetic waves iii air bubbles scourging and back washing as well as iv surface modifications of the membrane materials tijing et al 2015 zarebska et al 2015 such strategies could be relevant to pfas mitigation and shall be considered in future works on amphiphilic materials concentration or dewatering the potential of other commercial membrane materials including poly vinyldifluoride and poly propylene membranes could also represent viable options to limit the f f interactions and therefore the surface diffusion it is however likely that such mechanisms although potentially reduced in scale would nevertheless occur over time and at higher operating temperatures as discussing in the present work further studies should therefore focus on the development of surface coatings allowing for anti fouling behaviours with oleophobic properties to prevent adsorption diffusion and penetration across the membrane materials the kinetics of pfas molecules surface diffusion as well as the impact of more diverse water matrices including various pfas chain length would also be relevant items to test in order to develop a comprehensive model towards surface fouling and materials stability this work not only opens a new avenue for the concentration of amphiphilic molecules with potential beyond pfas remediation but also identifies potential structural and chemical modifications of the membrane materials to improve the efficiency

17812,nanoparticle and microplastic colloid transport behaviors impact strategies for groundwater protection and remediation complex colloid transport behaviors of anionic nano and micro sized colloids have been previously elucidated via independent experiments in chemically cleaned and amended granular media with grain sizes in the range of fine to coarse sand e g 200 1000 μm such experiments show that under conditions where a repulsive barrier was present in colloid collector interactions unfavorable conditions the distribution of retained colloids down gradient from their source deviates from the exponential decrease expected from compounded loss across a series of collectors grains previous experiments have not examined the impact of colloid size or granular media grain size on colloid distribution down gradient from their source particularly in streambed equilibrated granular media to address this gap a field transport experiment in constructed wetland stream beds to distances up to 20 m were conducted for colloids ranging in size from micro to nano 60 nm 7 μm in streambed equilibrated pea gravel and sand 4200 and 420 μm mean grain sizes respectively all colloid sizes showed non exponential hyper exponential distributions from source over meter scales in pea gravel versus cm scales reported for fine sand colloids in the ca 1 μm size range were most mobile as expected from mass transfer to surfaces and interaction with nanoscale heterogeneity the distance over which non exponential colloid distribution occurred increased with media grain size

apparent colloid retention rate coefficients at near e g few meters versus greater distances from source however this conclusion is weakened by fluid velocity variations with distance from source that

zhang et al 2001 despite the above limitations existing studies suggest that non exponential colloid distribution from source occurs in natural granular media and therefore presents challenges for transport prediction related to groundwater protection and remediation however understanding the mechanism underlying observed non exponential colloid distribution from source requires assessing the impact of colloid size and granular media grain size on non exponential distribution which was not performed in previous experiments the purpose of this study was therefore to examine colloid distributions from source in streambed equilibrated granular media ranging in mean grain size from fine sand to pea gravel for colloid sizes ranging from nano to micro scale because many reports already exist for non exponential colloid distribution in sand sized granular media the focus here was on coarser media although sand was included to demonstrate that transport distances were consistent with previous reports and that the impact of colloid size was consistent with coarser media 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and granular media description colloid transport experiments

carbonate species and a dissolved organic carbon content of 11 5 mg l flow in the constructed channels was sourced via pump from a nearby reservoir that was supplied by local groundwater during the six months preceding the colloid transport experiment flow to the channels was sufficient approximately 48 l min to maintain approximately 3 5 cm water column depth above the sediment surface seven days prior to and during the colloid transport experiment flow was reduced to 200 ml min pea gravel and approximately 100 ml min sand to saturate each granular media to its surface low points on each granular media surface were raised by addition of approximately 1 cm of on site pea gravel and sand to eliminate overlying water column and channel flow and thereby restrict flow and transport to underlying granular media supplementary material fig s1 because the source pool of the sand channel was located downstream from the beginning of that channel a pit was excavated in the channel immediately upstream to intercept flow upstream that would otherwise enter the channel upstream of the source pool an unknown fraction of the applied channel source water flowed upstream toward the

tube 30 mm od inserted into the perforated conical tubes and connected to a 50 ml syringe collected samples were injected into 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes containing 100 μl sodium azide 0 2 m for preservation and were refrigerated until analysis the sampling frequency created sufficient personnel demand between the two channels that sampling in the pea gravel channel was prioritized since transport experiments for a similar colloid size range in environmental sand media were recently reported rasmuson et al 2019b sand sampling frequency was designed to capture breakthrough at longer distances later times in the event that field conditions allowed such transport after the second elution period following the low is pulse introduction second 48 h granular media samples 200 ml were excavated across the entire depth at the channel center at each sampling location granular media samples were immediately shaken vigorously with 200 ml of distilled water for 1 min to drive detachment

material figs s9 and s10 colloid concentrations remained above the quantitation limit extended tailing well beyond cessation of injection extended tailing at all sampling locations where breakthrough occurred fig 2 supplementary material figs s9 and s10 this extended tailing represented colloid dispersion and or reentrainment as opposed to slow reduction in source pool concentration since source pool concentrations dropped below the quantitation limit within 1 5 h pea gravel and 12 min sand following cessation of injection supplementary material fig s7 3 2 trends in attachment rate coefficients kf effective attachment rate coefficients k f calculated from average steady state breakthrough c c o decreased with increasing transport distance for all colloid sizes across the first 5 m of transport fig 3 with decreases of a factor of three to five among the different colloid sizes values of k f appeared to converge at the 9 8 m distance fig 3 and error bars spanned the range of data at this distance beyond this distance c c0 values approached the quantitation limit such that low confidence was associated with k f values at the 19 5 m distance decreased effective k f with distance was not due to overprinting of colloid surfaces by organic matter in groundwater and potentially decreased attachment during transport as demonstrated by relatively constant measured colloid ζ potentials in site groundwater which were stable over time periods less than initial breakthrough and longer than the overall potential increase 33 less negative for 1 6 μm colloids however the timescale of this slow increase to modestly less negative values is far greater than the time required for breakthrough within 5 m of the source 2 h supplementary material fig s20 and increased ζ potential during transport would be expected to increase rather than decrease k f in the sand channel colloid breakthrough exceeded the quantitation limit only at the 0 15 m distance closest to source verifying that transport distances in the streambed equilibrated sand supplementary material fig s10 were consistent with those previously reported in chemically cleaned sand effective attachment rate coefficients were lowest for the 1 6 μm colloid size fig 3 supplementary material fig s11 this trend with colloid size occurred in both the pea gravel and sand channels fig 4 supplementary material fig s11 at all distances where breakthrough was greater than the quantitation limit except at the 9 8 m distance in pea gravel where k f error bars standard deviations for all colloid sizes spanned the overall range among the different colloid sizes supplementary material fig s12 3 3 colloid reentrainment in response to low ionic strength pulse in response to the low is pulse in the pea gravel aqueous colloid concentrations increased by approximately a factor of five at locations closest to the injection site i e 4 9 m fig 5 supplementary material fig s13 panels a c lesser reentrainment response at greater sampling distances presumably reflect reduced is contrast due to dispersion supplementary material fig s13 panels d f in addition to mobilizing colloids the low is pulse visibly mobilized organic matter e g algal material which was also detected in spectroscopic analyses via increased background scatter in the ca 7 μm size range supplementary material fig s14 3 4 sediment profiles the number concentration of colloids recovered from gravel showed a non monotonic trend i e a maximum concentration at some distance from the source supplementary material fig s15 symbols that the distribution of retained colloids was non monotonic contrasts with the monotonic decrease in k f with increased transport distance fig 4 this contrast likely reflects mobilization of near source colloids by the low is pulse fig 5 and supplementary material fig s13 which occurred proximal to the source the hypothetical distribution of colloids expected from exponential distribution from source was determined using k f values corresponding to the upstream most 0 6 m and downstream most 9 8 m locations where k f was quantifiable supplementary material fig s15 dashed and dotted lines superimposing the exponential distributions of retained colloids approximates an expected hyper exponential distribution which contrasts against the observed non monotonic distribution supplementary material fig s15 this contrast is greatest at the upstream most sampling location consistent with the observed mobilization of colloids predominantly at locations proximal to source fig 5 and supplementary material fig s13 4 discussion 4 1 non exponential colloid distribution from source the observed trend in k f with transport distance fig 3 for nano to micro sized colloids in streambed equilibrated granular media highlights a major challenge for predicting colloid transport distances in the environment for resource protection or remediation the approximate factor of four k f reduction from 240 day to 60 day across 5 m distance for 0 21 μm colloids fig 3 reduced the colloid removal achieved across that transport distance from 5 3 log at 0 5 m to 1 3 log at 5 0 m based on the k f determined from observed breakthrough at the 0 3 m distance the relative breakthrough c c 0 at 5 m distance would be predicted as 5 1 10 6 which is 4 log greater removal than the observed c c 0 0 05 at this distance a major over prediction over a modest field transport distance observed colloid transport distances in streambed equilibrated sand were on the order of centimeters supplementary material fig s10 consistent with those observed under laboratory conditions e g li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 tong et al 2006 wang et al 2014 in contrast observed colloid transport distances in streambed equilibrated pea gravel were on the order of meters fig 3 lesser removal with increasing grain size is an expectation of colloid filtration theory cft yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 since the likelihood that colloids will intercept grains as quantified by η and k f decreases as grain fluid shell thickness increases with increasing grain size however the results also demonstrate that in addition to removal the distance over which non exponential distribution effective k f decrease occurred also increased with grain size hyper exponential colloid distributions from source extended over similar distances regardless of colloid size ranging over two orders of magnitude 0 06 μm 7 7 μm fig 3 given that non exponential colloid distributions are reported to occur over cm scale distances in sand sized granular media e g li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 tong et al 2006 wang et al 2014 the meter scale hyper exponential colloid distributions observed in pea gravel demonstrate that non exponential distributions extend over larger distances in coarser media i e scales with grain size the mechanism driving non exponential colloid distributions from source under unfavorable conditions is a subject of active research e g hilpert and johnson 2018 johnson et al 2018 bedrikovetsky et al 2019 but the ubiquity of this observation suggests that the mechanism arises from fundamental transport processes the potential impact on colloid stability of equilibration with aqueous components during transport deserves consideration in field transport studies because dilution with site groundwater by approximately 1 4 occurred during colloid suspension preparation and another approximately 1 200 dilution occurred during introduction to the pool the potential additional dilution of stock stabilizing surfactants during transport down gradient from the pool is presumably inconsequential if colloid aggregation had occurred during transport one would expect k f to have increased with increasing transport for the larger 1 6 μm and 7 7 μm colloids which is not what was observed the scaling with grain size demonstrated here is consistent with the hypothesis that the effective k f decrease is driven by loss of a fast attaching fraction that is depleted as that fraction of the colloid population attaches to grain surfaces johnson et al 2018 this finding is explored in a separate manuscript johnson 2020 via simulations adopting the above hypothesis for description of observations from the streambed equilibrated pea gravel described here and from a wisconsin fine sand rasumuson et al 2019b the observed limited colloid transport in the fine sand in this environmental setting suggests that colloid transport behavior over meter scale and larger distances in fine sand in field settings necessarily involves physical heterogeneity i e preferential transport pathways for which the relative impacts of colloid surface interaction is uncharacterized in contrast the observed non exponential colloid distribution in the pea gravel suggests that colloid surface interaction a dominant control on the observed colloid distributions from source in field settings comprised of coarse granular media such as streambed alluvium 4 2 minimum retention for n μ transition size range establishing relevance of laboratory observed highest colloid mobility in chemically cleaned media for colloid sizes within the nano to micro scale n μ transition size range i e 0 02 2 0 μm ron et al 2019a to streambed equilibrated media fig 4 supplementary material fig s11 highlights the opportunity to incorporate this characteristic as a design parameter in colloid based environmental remediation in granular aquifers one strategy proposes to aggregate novel nanoparticles to the n μ transition size range in order to facilitate their transport through non target porous media followed by disaggregation at the target location to enhance penetration into granular media pore space and reactivity via increased surface area ron et al 2019b that colloids of size in the n μ transition and near neutral buoyancy have highest mobility in granular media has long been known for favorable conditions yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 whereas only recently was it demonstrated that this enhanced mobility is further exaggerated under unfavorable conditions ron et al 2019a that recognition of this attribute only recently occurred likely reflects that existing field tests have not previously examined to the knowledge of the authors a suite of varying colloid sizes while holding surface characteristics relatively constant however laboratory column transport of various pathogens i e viruses bacteria and protozoa in ohio river sand over 3 9 m transport distances reported greatest mobility for bacteria n μ transition sized relative to the viruses nano scale and protozoa micro scale despite uncontrolled colloid surface properties gupta et al 2009 field monitoring for pathogens demonstrates greater prevalence of viruses relative to bacteria borchardt et al 2003 kyle et al 2008 eydal et al 2009 allen et al 2017 which nominally contradicts greater mobility of colloids in the n μ transition size range however viruses display lower collision efficiencies i e stickiness than bacteria presumably owing to their surface characteristics gannon et al 1991 schivjen et al 2000 ron et al 2019a furthermore differences in replication growth and inactivation death john and rose 2005 ecological predation levin 1977 lenski 1988 and source concentrations each may influence relative prevalence of viruses versus bacteria the lowest ζ potential was associated with the 1 6 μm colloids yielding the highest calculated repulsive barrier for that size among the range of colloid sizes examined supplementary material fig s18 however this lowest ζ potential does not explain the minimum k f corresponding to this colloid size since measured properties for all colloid sizes yielded insurmountable repulsive barriers to attachment 5000 kt supplementary material fig s18 the barrier was dominated by edl repulsion for all colloid sizes except 7 7 μm for which repulsion was dominated by steric interactions while colloid attachment is qualitatively related to the magnitude of the repulsive barrier e g torkzaban et al 2007 shen et al 2012 the predicted insurmountability of repulsive barriers requires one of two assumptions regarding attachment specifically that immobilization occurs either 1 via secondary minimum interactions e g torkzaban et al 2007 2008 or 2 via interaction with nanoscale heterogeneity e g elimelech and o melia 1990 duffadar et al 2007 pazmino et al 2014 rasmuson et al 2019a ron et al 2019a experimental and mechanistic reasons supporting the latter are well reported johnson et al 2010 pazmino et al 2014 2015 a self consistent outcome of attributing attachment to nanoscale heterogeneity is mechanistic prediction of highest mobility for n μ transition colloids due to their least likelihood of encountering heterodomains zones of opposite charge due to their least combined diffusion settling and hydrodynamic drag ron et al 2019a 4 3 unfavorable colloid surface interactions that non exponential colloid distributions from source emerge in the laboratory specifically under unfavorable conditions li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a tufenkji et al 2004 li and johnson 2005 tong and johnson 2007 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 suggests that colloid collector interactions in streambed equilibrated pea gravel were unfavorable however the observed factor of three amplitude range in k f across the colloid size range fig 4 was far less than that observed under highly unfavorable conditions in the laboratory using chemically cleaned media ron et al 2019a rasmuson et al 2019a where k f varied up to three orders of magnitude at the highest ph and lowest is the lesser amplitude observed in the pea gravel suggests that conditions in the pea gravel channel as well as in the sand channel supplementary material fig s11 were not highly unfavorable that conditions were modestly unfavorable in pea gravel is also supported by the fact that the predicted single collector k f from colloid trajectory simulations under favorable conditions bracketed the observed values supplementary material fig s19 the favorable condition simulations were for happel grain diameters of 446 μm and 6 mm which are the respective number based geometric mean and weight based arithmetic means of pea gravel supplementary material fig s3 that conditions were unfavorable albeit modestly in the pea gravel channel is also supported by the observed colloid detachment in response to solution is reduction fig 5 which also appears to have altered the observed final colloid distribution in sediment to produce non monotonic profiles of retained colloids as described above supplementary material fig s15 experiments examining colloid release in response to is perturbation in the laboratory ryan and gschwend 1994 roy and dzombak 1996 franchi o melia 2003 hahn et al 2004 shen et al 2012 yi and chen 2013 demonstrate that colloid release is negligible when attached colloids were originally loaded under favorable conditions e g franchi o melia 2003 hahn et al 2004 the reentrainment of colloids in response to a low is pulse in pea gravel is consistent with unfavorable colloid surface interaction suggesting a role of colloid mobilization in reports of increased pathogen prevalence curriero et al 2001 auld et al 2004 dorner et al 2006 and formation plugging following soil colloid mobilization mcneal and coleman 1966 frenkel et al 1978 in response to infiltration of low is water i e heavy rainfall 5 conclusions the distribution of colloids from source was non exponential hyper exponential in streambed equilibrated granular media demonstrating that equilibration of naturally rough grain surfaces with natural organic matter in the presence of groundwater electrolytes yielded the same complex transport behaviors that emerge under unfavorable conditions in chemically cleaned granular media under highly controlled conditions non exponential distributions were demonstrated to be consistent for colloids ranging from nano to micro sizes and bulk compositions ranging from gold nano to polymeric cml and pmma micro among these colloids with similar surface properties colloid sizes in the n μ transition size range 0 2 2 0 μm diameter were most mobile as expected from their least combined diffusion sedimentation and fluid drag at the grain surface non exponential distribution was described by an effective colloid retention rate coefficient that decreased with increasing distance of transport which has been mechanistically predicted in chemically cleaned granular media only under the assumption that a fast attaching faction of the colloid population is depleted by loss to grain surfaces the scale over which non exponential distribution occurred was consistently greater in coarser media pea gravel versus fine sand regardless of colloid size implicating colloid loss to grain surfaces as a driver of non exponential distribution the findings guide development of robust methods to predict non

17812,nanoparticle and microplastic colloid transport behaviors impact strategies for groundwater protection and remediation complex colloid transport behaviors of anionic nano and micro sized colloids have been previously elucidated via independent experiments in chemically cleaned and amended granular media with grain sizes in the range of fine to coarse sand e g 200 1000 μm such experiments show that under conditions where a repulsive barrier was present in colloid collector interactions unfavorable conditions the distribution of retained colloids down gradient from their source deviates from the exponential decrease expected from compounded loss across a series of collectors grains previous experiments have not examined the impact of colloid size or granular media grain size on colloid distribution down gradient from their source particularly in streambed equilibrated granular media to address this gap a field transport experiment in constructed wetland stream beds to distances up to 20 m were conducted for colloids ranging in size from micro to nano 60 nm 7 μm in streambed equilibrated pea gravel and sand 4200 and 420 μm mean grain sizes respectively all colloid sizes showed non exponential hyper exponential distributions from source over meter scales in pea gravel versus cm scales reported for fine sand colloids in the ca 1 μm size range were most mobile as expected from mass transfer to surfaces and interaction with nanoscale heterogeneity the distance over which non exponential colloid distribution occurred increased with media grain size

gupta et al 2009 rasmuson et al 2019b limited field studies indicate non exponential colloid distribution from source schijven et al 1999 2000 johnson et al 2001 zhang et al 2001 based on greater apparent colloid retention rate coefficients at near e g few meters versus greater distances from source however this conclusion is weakened by fluid velocity variations with distance from source that

zhang et al 2001 despite the above limitations existing studies suggest that non exponential colloid distribution from source occurs in natural granular media and therefore presents challenges for transport prediction related to groundwater protection and remediation however understanding the mechanism underlying observed non exponential colloid distribution from source requires assessing the impact of colloid size and granular media grain size on non exponential distribution which was not performed in previous experiments the purpose of this study was therefore to examine colloid distributions from source in streambed equilibrated granular media ranging in mean grain size from fine sand to pea gravel for colloid sizes ranging from nano to micro scale because many reports already exist for non exponential colloid distribution in sand sized granular media the focus here was on coarser media although sand was included to demonstrate that transport distances were consistent with previous reports and that the impact of colloid size was consistent with coarser media 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and granular media description colloid transport experiments

subsurface granular media during excavation and extraction from both granular media at the end of the experiment because sediment surface chemistries were purposefully altered by natural organic

negative ζ potentials at the ph of the transport experiment trauscht et al 2015 channel source water had a ph of 8 1 conductance of 550 μs cm ionic strength is of 20 mm dominated by ca2 mg2 s04 2 and carbonate species and a dissolved organic carbon content of 11 5 mg l flow in the constructed channels was sourced via pump from a nearby reservoir that was supplied by local groundwater during the six months preceding the colloid transport experiment flow to the channels was sufficient approximately 48 l min to maintain approximately 3 5 cm water column depth above the sediment surface seven days prior to and during the colloid transport experiment flow was reduced to 200 ml min pea gravel and approximately 100 ml min sand to saturate each granular media to its surface low points on each granular media surface were raised by addition of approximately 1 cm of on site pea gravel and sand to eliminate overlying water column and channel flow and thereby restrict flow and transport to underlying granular media supplementary material fig s1 because the source pool of the sand channel was located downstream from the beginning of that channel a pit was excavated in the channel immediately upstream to intercept flow upstream that would otherwise enter the channel upstream of the source pool an unknown fraction of the applied channel source water flowed upstream toward the

colloidal suspensions diluted 1 4 in site groundwater at least 1 h prior to experiment were introduced at durations 270 and 150 min for pea gravel and sand respectively sufficient to produce steady state breakthrough plateaus at all sampled distances from source supplementary material measured pool concentrations indicate an additional dilution of approximately 1 200 in site groundwater upon addition of colloid solution to the pool following breakthrough and extended elution a low ionic strength pulse distilled water was introduced 270 min to examine potential colloid reentrainment

tube 30 mm od inserted into the perforated conical tubes and connected to a 50 ml syringe collected samples were injected into 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes containing 100 μl sodium azide 0 2 m for preservation and were refrigerated until analysis the sampling frequency created sufficient personnel demand between the two channels that sampling in the pea gravel channel was prioritized since transport experiments for a similar colloid size range in environmental sand media were recently reported rasmuson et al 2019b sand sampling frequency was designed to capture breakthrough at longer distances later times in the event that field conditions allowed such transport after the second elution period following the low is pulse introduction second 48 h granular media samples 200 ml were excavated across the entire depth at the channel center at each sampling location granular media samples were immediately shaken vigorously with 200 ml of distilled water for 1 min to drive detachment of retained microspheres syringes were used to collect 10 ml of supernatant which was stored in 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes preserved as described for aqueous samples 2 5 sample analysis colloid

m day averaged among the 0 15 and 4 8 m observation distances supplementary material fig s8 which is approximately an order of magnitude higher than nominal velocities reported for sand several m day as expected from the relatively high permeability of gravel initial colloid breakthrough in the pea gravel channel was synchronous among all colloid sizes and also with rhodamine breakthrough at the sampled locations fig 2 supplementary material fig s9 extrapolating rhodamine breakthrough at observed locations to non sampled distances according to the solution to the advection dispersion equation

in the pea gravel channel average steady state relative breakthrough c c o of colloids decreased with distance in both the pea gravel and the sand channels falling below the quantitation limit at distances of 19 5 m in the pea gravel and beyond 0 15 m and before 0 3 m in the sand fig 2 panel b supplementary material figs s9 and s10 initial colloid breakthrough occurred prior to the first sampling time in the sand channel although elution was well delineated prior to decrease of relative concentrations the below quantitation limit supplementary material fig s9 verifying that transport distances in the streambed equilibrated sand were consistent with those previously reported in chemically cleaned sand li et al 2004 li and johnson 2005 tong et al 2006 as well as natural sand rasmuson et al 2019b johnson 2020 in both granular media breakthrough relative concentration was highest for 1 6 μm colloids at all sampling distances where breakthrough was observed supplementary material figs s9 and s10 colloid concentrations remained above the quantitation limit extended tailing well beyond cessation of injection extended tailing at all sampling locations where breakthrough occurred fig 2 supplementary material figs s9 and s10 this extended tailing represented colloid dispersion and or reentrainment as opposed to slow reduction in source pool concentration since source pool concentrations dropped below the quantitation limit within 1 5 h pea gravel and 12 min sand following cessation of injection supplementary material fig s7 3 2 trends in attachment rate coefficients kf effective attachment rate coefficients k f calculated from average steady state breakthrough c c o decreased with increasing transport distance for all colloid sizes across the first 5 m of transport fig 3 with decreases of a factor of three to five among the different colloid sizes values of k f appeared to converge at the 9 8 m distance fig 3 and error bars spanned the range of data at this distance beyond this distance c c0 values approached the quantitation limit such that low confidence was associated with k f values at the 19 5 m distance decreased effective k f with distance was not due to overprinting of colloid surfaces by organic matter in groundwater and potentially decreased attachment during transport as demonstrated by relatively constant measured colloid ζ potentials in site groundwater which were stable over time periods less than initial breakthrough and longer than the overall potential increase 33 less negative for 1 6 μm colloids however the timescale of this slow increase to modestly less negative values is far greater than the time required for breakthrough within 5 m of the source 2 h supplementary material fig s20 and increased ζ potential during transport would be expected to increase rather than decrease k f in the sand channel colloid breakthrough exceeded the quantitation limit only at the 0 15 m distance closest to source verifying that transport distances in the streambed equilibrated sand supplementary material fig s10 were consistent with those previously reported in chemically cleaned sand effective attachment rate coefficients were lowest for the 1 6 μm colloid size fig 3 supplementary material fig s11 this trend with colloid size occurred in both the pea gravel and sand channels fig 4 supplementary material fig s11 at all distances where breakthrough was greater than the quantitation limit except at the 9 8 m distance in pea gravel where k f error bars standard deviations for all colloid sizes spanned the overall range among the different colloid sizes supplementary material fig s12 3 3 colloid reentrainment in response to low ionic strength pulse in response to the low is pulse in the pea gravel aqueous colloid concentrations increased by approximately a factor of five at locations closest to the injection site i e 4 9 m fig 5 supplementary material fig s13 panels a c lesser reentrainment response at greater sampling distances presumably reflect reduced is contrast due to dispersion supplementary material fig s13 panels d f in addition to mobilizing colloids the low is pulse visibly mobilized organic matter e g algal material which was also detected in spectroscopic analyses via increased background scatter in the ca 7 μm size range supplementary material fig s14 3 4 sediment profiles the number concentration of colloids recovered from gravel showed a non monotonic trend i e a maximum concentration at some distance from the source supplementary material fig s15 symbols that the distribution of retained colloids was non monotonic contrasts with the monotonic decrease in k f with increased transport distance fig 4 this contrast likely reflects mobilization of near source colloids by the low is pulse fig 5 and supplementary material fig s13 which occurred proximal to the source the hypothetical distribution of colloids expected from exponential distribution from source was determined using k f values corresponding to the upstream most 0 6 m and downstream most 9 8 m locations where k f was quantifiable supplementary material fig s15 dashed and dotted lines superimposing the exponential distributions of retained colloids approximates an expected hyper exponential distribution which contrasts against the observed non monotonic distribution supplementary material fig s15 this contrast is greatest at the upstream most sampling location consistent with the observed mobilization of colloids predominantly at locations proximal to source fig 5 and supplementary material fig s13 4 discussion 4 1 non exponential colloid distribution from source the observed trend in k f with transport distance fig 3 for nano to micro sized colloids in streambed equilibrated granular media highlights a major challenge for predicting colloid transport distances in the environment for resource protection or remediation the approximate factor of four k f reduction from 240 day to 60 day across 5 m distance for 0 21 μm colloids fig 3 reduced the colloid removal achieved across that transport distance from 5 3 log at 0 5 m to 1 3 log at 5 0 m based on the k f determined from observed breakthrough at the 0 3 m distance the relative breakthrough c c 0 at 5 m distance would be predicted as 5 1 10 6 which is 4 log greater removal than the observed c c 0 0 05 at this distance a major over prediction over a modest field transport distance observed colloid transport distances in streambed equilibrated sand were on the order of centimeters supplementary material fig s10 consistent with those observed under laboratory conditions e g li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 tong et al 2006 wang et al 2014 in contrast observed colloid transport distances in streambed equilibrated pea gravel were on the order of meters fig 3 lesser removal with increasing grain size is an expectation of colloid filtration theory cft yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 since the likelihood that colloids will intercept grains as quantified by η and k f decreases as grain fluid shell thickness increases with increasing grain size however the results also demonstrate that in addition to removal the distance over which non exponential distribution effective k f decrease occurred also increased with grain size hyper exponential colloid distributions from source extended over similar distances regardless of colloid size ranging over two orders of magnitude 0 06 μm 7 7 μm fig 3 given that non exponential colloid distributions are reported to occur over cm scale distances in sand sized granular media e g li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 tong et al 2006 wang et al 2014 the meter scale hyper exponential colloid distributions observed in pea gravel demonstrate that non exponential distributions extend over larger distances in coarser media i e scales with grain size the mechanism driving non exponential colloid distributions from source under unfavorable conditions is a subject of active research e g hilpert and johnson 2018 johnson et al 2018 bedrikovetsky et al 2019 but the ubiquity of this observation suggests that the mechanism arises from fundamental transport processes the potential impact on colloid stability of equilibration with aqueous components during transport deserves consideration in field transport studies because dilution with site groundwater by approximately 1 4 occurred during colloid suspension preparation and another approximately 1 200 dilution occurred during introduction to the pool the potential additional dilution of stock stabilizing surfactants during transport down gradient from the pool is presumably inconsequential if colloid aggregation had occurred during transport one would expect k f to have increased with increasing transport for the larger 1 6 μm and 7 7 μm colloids which is not what was observed the scaling with grain size demonstrated here is consistent with the hypothesis that the effective k f decrease is driven by loss of a fast attaching fraction that is depleted as that fraction of the colloid population attaches to grain surfaces johnson et al 2018 this finding is explored in a separate manuscript johnson 2020 via simulations adopting the above hypothesis for description of observations from the streambed equilibrated pea gravel described here and from a wisconsin fine sand rasumuson et al 2019b the observed limited colloid transport in the fine sand in this environmental setting suggests that colloid transport behavior over meter scale and larger distances in fine sand in field settings necessarily involves physical heterogeneity i e preferential transport pathways for which the relative impacts of colloid surface interaction is uncharacterized in contrast the observed non exponential colloid distribution in the pea gravel suggests that colloid surface interaction a dominant control on the observed colloid distributions from source in field settings comprised of coarse granular media such as streambed alluvium 4 2 minimum retention for n μ transition size range establishing relevance of laboratory observed highest colloid mobility in chemically cleaned media for colloid sizes within the nano to micro scale n μ transition size range i e 0 02 2 0 μm ron et al 2019a to streambed equilibrated media fig 4 supplementary material fig s11 highlights the opportunity to incorporate this characteristic as a design parameter in colloid based environmental remediation in granular aquifers one strategy proposes to aggregate novel nanoparticles to the n μ transition size range in order to facilitate their transport through non target porous media followed by disaggregation at the target location to enhance penetration into granular media pore space and reactivity via increased surface area ron et al 2019b that colloids of size in the n μ transition and near neutral buoyancy have highest mobility in granular media has long been known for favorable conditions yao et al 1971 rajagopalan and tien 1976 whereas only recently was it demonstrated that this enhanced mobility is further exaggerated under unfavorable conditions ron et al 2019a that recognition of this attribute only recently occurred likely reflects that existing field tests have not previously examined to the knowledge of the authors a suite of varying colloid sizes while holding surface characteristics relatively constant however laboratory column transport of various pathogens i e viruses bacteria and protozoa in ohio river sand over 3 9 m transport distances reported greatest mobility for bacteria n μ transition sized relative to the viruses nano scale and protozoa micro scale despite uncontrolled colloid surface properties gupta et al 2009 field monitoring for pathogens demonstrates greater prevalence of viruses relative to bacteria borchardt et al 2003 kyle et al 2008 eydal et al 2009 allen et al 2017 which nominally contradicts greater mobility of colloids in the n μ transition size range however viruses display lower collision efficiencies i e stickiness than bacteria presumably owing to their surface characteristics gannon et al 1991 schivjen et al 2000 ron et al 2019a furthermore differences in replication growth and inactivation death john and rose 2005 ecological predation levin 1977 lenski 1988 and source concentrations each may influence relative prevalence of viruses versus bacteria the lowest ζ potential was associated with the 1 6 μm colloids yielding the highest calculated repulsive barrier for that size among the range of colloid sizes examined supplementary material fig s18 however this lowest ζ potential does not explain the minimum k f corresponding to this colloid size since measured properties for all colloid sizes yielded insurmountable repulsive barriers to attachment 5000 kt supplementary material fig s18 the barrier was dominated by edl repulsion for all colloid sizes except 7 7 μm for which repulsion was dominated by steric interactions while colloid attachment is qualitatively related to the magnitude of the repulsive barrier e g torkzaban et al 2007 shen et al 2012 the predicted insurmountability of repulsive barriers requires one of two assumptions regarding attachment specifically that immobilization occurs either 1 via secondary minimum interactions e g torkzaban et al 2007 2008 or 2 via interaction with nanoscale heterogeneity e g elimelech and o melia 1990 duffadar et al 2007 pazmino et al 2014 rasmuson et al 2019a ron et al 2019a experimental and mechanistic reasons supporting the latter are well reported johnson et al 2010 pazmino et al 2014 2015 a self consistent outcome of attributing attachment to nanoscale heterogeneity is mechanistic prediction of highest mobility for n μ transition colloids due to their least likelihood of encountering heterodomains zones of opposite charge due to their least combined diffusion settling and hydrodynamic drag ron et al 2019a 4 3 unfavorable colloid surface interactions that non exponential colloid distributions from source emerge in the laboratory specifically under unfavorable conditions li et al 2004 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a tufenkji et al 2004 li and johnson 2005 tong and johnson 2007 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 suggests that colloid collector interactions in streambed equilibrated pea gravel were unfavorable however the observed factor of three amplitude range in k f across the colloid size range fig 4 was far less than that observed under highly unfavorable conditions in the laboratory using chemically cleaned media ron et al 2019a rasmuson et al 2019a where k f varied up to three orders of magnitude at the highest ph and lowest is the lesser amplitude observed in the pea gravel suggests that conditions in the pea gravel channel as well as in the sand channel supplementary material fig s11 were not highly unfavorable that conditions were modestly unfavorable in pea gravel is also supported by the fact that the predicted single collector k f from colloid trajectory simulations under favorable conditions bracketed the observed values supplementary material fig s19 the favorable condition simulations were for happel grain diameters of 446 μm and 6 mm which are the respective number based geometric mean and weight based arithmetic means of pea gravel supplementary material fig s3 that conditions were unfavorable albeit modestly in the pea gravel channel is also supported by the observed colloid detachment in response to solution is reduction fig 5 which also appears to have altered the observed final colloid distribution in sediment to produce non monotonic profiles of retained colloids as described above supplementary material fig s15 experiments examining colloid release in response to is perturbation in the laboratory ryan and gschwend 1994 roy and dzombak 1996 franchi o melia 2003 hahn et al 2004 shen et al 2012 yi and chen 2013 demonstrate that colloid release is negligible when attached colloids were originally loaded under favorable conditions e g franchi o melia 2003 hahn et al 2004 the reentrainment of colloids in response to a low is pulse in pea gravel is consistent with unfavorable colloid surface interaction suggesting a role of colloid mobilization in reports of increased pathogen prevalence curriero et al 2001 auld et al 2004 dorner et al 2006 and formation plugging following soil colloid mobilization mcneal and coleman 1966 frenkel et al 1978 in response to infiltration of low is water i e heavy rainfall 5 conclusions the distribution of colloids from source was non exponential hyper exponential in streambed equilibrated granular media demonstrating that equilibration of naturally rough grain surfaces with natural organic matter in the presence of groundwater electrolytes yielded the same complex transport behaviors that emerge under unfavorable conditions in chemically cleaned granular media under highly controlled conditions non exponential distributions were demonstrated to be consistent for colloids ranging from nano to micro sizes and bulk compositions ranging from gold nano to polymeric cml and pmma micro among these colloids with similar surface properties colloid sizes in the n μ transition size range 0 2 2 0 μm diameter were most mobile as expected from their least combined diffusion sedimentation and fluid drag at the grain surface non exponential distribution was described by an effective colloid retention rate coefficient that decreased with increasing distance of transport which has been mechanistically predicted in chemically cleaned granular media only under the assumption that a fast attaching faction of the colloid population is depleted by loss to grain surfaces the scale over which non exponential distribution occurred was consistently greater in coarser media pea gravel versus fine sand regardless of colloid size implicating colloid loss to grain surfaces as a driver of non exponential distribution the findings guide development of robust methods to predict non

17813,an integrated process combining ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with biological activated carbon filtration o3 cmf bac process was designed and evaluated using a pilot scale 10 m3 d test for the advanced treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater in a coastal wastewater plant the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized for the optimal treatment performance of this integrated process the results showed that this integrated process performed well in pollutant removal the concentrations of codcr phosphate and color in the effluents were 17 9 mg l 0 25 mg l and 5 dilution times in average respectively the effluent quality met the local discharge standard even under a high influent cod concentration 195 mg l in average the synergistic effect of the ozonation and ceramic membrane filtration was investigated through the fluorescence characteristics and hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of organic compounds it revealed that ozonation mitigated the membrane fouling and the nanopores in the ceramic membranes enhanced the ozonation efficiency meanwhile the fenton process had a slightly better effluent quality than the integrated process but fenton process consumed much more chemicals and required the sludge disposal resulting in higher cost the estimated unit cost for this integrated process was only 34 of that for the fenton process overall the integrated process demonstrated high stability reliable effluents and low cost providing a promising and cost efficient technology for the treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords hypersaline petrochemical wastewater advanced treatment ozonation ceramic membrane biological activated carbon 1 introduction the petrochemical plants consume a large amount of fresh water and discharge a significant quantity of industrial wastewater during the manufacturing process li et al 2011 walls 2010 wang et al 2014 most petrochemical wastewater contains high amounts of toxic and recalcitrant organics with poor biodegradability estrada arriaga et al 2012 liu et al 2014 theodorakis et al 2012 some petrochemical wastewater contains high salinity which might inhibit microbial growth and corrode treatment facilities jin et al 2008 xiang and jun 2012 yin 2006 the complexity of the petrochemical wastewater and the stringent discharge limit demand the development of efficient wastewater treatment physical treatment chemical treatment and biological treatment are commonly used to treat the petrochemical wastewater in two stages li et al 2010 patel and madamwar 2000 verma et al 2010 the first stage is the pretreatment to reduce suspended particles and oil such as air floatation jafarinejad and jiang 2019 coagulation zeng et al 2007 and biological aerated filter ding et al 2016 xin et al 2006 however pretreatments usually have a low removal efficiency for refractory organic pollutants and the chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluents is still high the second stage is the advanced treatment to remove the residual pollutants from the secondary effluent to meet the discharge standards currently reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes aops have commonly been applied for the advanced treatment of petrochemical wastewater guo et al 2018 sivagami et al 2019 venzke et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yetilmezsoy and sakar 2008 according to madaeni et al most of pollutants including cod conductivity color and ions can be removed efficiently by ro membranes madaeni and eslamifard 2010 however the application of ro technology is limited by low recovery ratio high energy consumption and the stringent quality of feed water for ro process benito alcázar et al 2010 fenton process as one of the commonly used aops has the capability of rapid degradation of recalcitrant pollutants in the wastewater however fenton process is chemical consuming and generates a large amount of sludge that requires post treatment recently researches are focused on reducing chemical dosage and decreasing operation costs of fenton process but its economic viability remains doubtful in the large scale commercial applications bello et al 2019 demir duz et al 2019 the combined process of ozonation with membrane filtration has gained increasing attention in wastewater treatment because of its high efficiency to destruct the structure of refractory organic pollutants and increase the biodegradability of the secondary effluent most importantly ozonation produces no secondary pollutions and membrane filtration has the advantages of small footprint and high stability alzahrani and mohammad 2014 in the past decade ceramic membranes have been applied widely because of their high chemical resistance good mechanical strength high membrane flux and long lifetime which can effectively overcome the shortcomings of polymeric membranes padaki et al 2015 sondhi et al 2003 tin et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 many studies have been conducted on the application of ozonation combined with ceramic membrane filtration in wastewater treatment and the combined process is proved to be efficient for the advanced treatment of secondary wastewater effluent lehman and liu 2009 zhang et al 2016 compared to ozonation alone the ozonation in the membrane pores is catalyzed compared to ozonation alone the ozonation in the membrane pores is catalyzed our previous studies find that the degradation efficiency of organics by ozone inside the membrane pores is substantially improved fan and zhang 2014 and the high efficiency of ozonation mitigates the membrane fouling during the filtration song et al 2017 besides this accelerated decomposition process ensures the low ozone concentration in the membrane effluent which avoids the potential harm to the following biological process tang et al 2019 however some studies report that the organic matters cannot be mineralized thoroughly by the ozonation and the intermediates or byproducts after the ozonation might be even more toxic and refractory than the original organics which requires the biological carbon filter as a further treatment step han et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it is believed that the ozonation increase the biodegradability of the secondary effluent for the following biological activated carbon bac filtration and the integration of ozonation ceramic membrane and bac will be a promising option to increase the efficiency of the advanced wastewater treatment processes this study aims to investigate the performance and mechanism of the combined process of ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with biological activated carbon filtration o3 cmf bac process for the advanced treatment of petrochemical wastewater a pilot test 10 m3 d was conducted with the actual secondary effluent from a coastal wastewater plant located in a petrochemical industrial park the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized to achieve high removal efficiency and stable operation moreover the performance in organic pollutant removal and operating cost of this integrated process were compared with the fenton process that has been used in the plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water this pilot scale study was operated in a wastewater plant for a coastal petrochemical industry located in huizhou china this wastewater

the fenton process presented in table 1 are the characteristics of the feed wastewater for the integrated process and the effluent from the fenton process in order to simulate the seasonal fluctuation

rate is 4 m h corresponding to the empty bed contact time of 30 min the backwashing interval of the bac tank is once every 15 days for 10 min with a flowrate of 10 l m2 s using the clean water the start up of the bac filter by seeding activated sludge from the mbr in the plant is carried out one week before the experiment this hybrid system is controlled by a programmable logic controller plc with full automation 2 3 analytical methods an online gaseous ozone detector ideal 2000 ideal china was used to measure the gaseous ozone concentration the aqueous ozone concentration in the membrane tank was monitored using a portable ozone detector pth043d palintest ltd uk ph was measured with a ph meter phb 4 leici shanghai and conductivity was measured with a conductivity meter sl1000 hach usa color phosphate and chemical oxygen demand codcr were determined by the methods of the chinese nepa standard national environment protection agency china fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectra was analyzed on a three dimensional fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the excitation spectra were scanned from 220 to 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm increment and the emission spectra were scanned from 240 to 600 nm at 1 nm increment chen et al 2003 the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of organics were characterized by xad 8 resins supelco company usa and xad 4 resins amberlite rohm hass company usa the organics were fractionated into hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions according to the methods described by zheng et al 2014 all the samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm whatman usa and stored at 4 c before the analyses in 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of permeate flux on the performance of the pilot system during the practical application of membrane filtration the permeate flux is a critical factor with regard to the treatment efficiency operation stability energy consumption and membrane fouling fujioka and nghiem 2015 tang et al 2019 tin et al 2017 the permeate flux of ceramic membranes usually ranges from 20 l m2 h lmh to 150 lmh based on the quality of feed water sondhi et al 2003 in order to obtain the optimal membrane flux for the hybrid system to treat the petrochemical wastewater the performance of the removal efficiency and the membrane fouling were tested under different membrane fluxes during the test the ozone dosage was 10 mg l and the membrane flux was changed from 25 lmh 40 lmh to 55 lmh successively the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored as an indicator of membrane fouling the effluents from ozone ceramic membrane tank o3 cmf effluent and the biological activated carbon pool bac effluent were analyzed to investigate the contributions from each process unit to the removal of pollutants moreover the treatment efficiency of the integrated process was compared with that of the fenton process which has been applied in the plant during the test 3 1 1 evaluation of membrane fouling under different permeate fluxes tmp is an important index to evaluate the long term stability of the membrane process weschenfelder et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 tmp increases by around 5 kpa with sudden jumps for every 15 lmh the flux increases during the operation period under 25 lhm the tmp is kept stable for more than 3 days it indicates that the membrane fouling is negligible when the membrane flux is lower than the critical flux field and pearce 2011 the tmp increases slightly during the 4 day operation under the flux of 40 lmh once the flux increases to 55 lhm the tmp increases suddenly to 20 kpa but decreases gradually to 15 kpa this phenomenon might be explained by the mitigation of membrane fouling via the ozonation previous studies have demonstrated that ozonation is efficient in controlling the membrane fouling and achieves in situ membrane cleaning song et al 2017 thus the results indicate that the ceramic membrane can maintain a long term stable operation with the flux of 55 lmh 3 1 2 effect of permeate flux on the removal of pollutants it can be seen from fig 3 a that the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 48 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 19 6 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod is 51 3 and 80 1 by o3 cmf and bac units respectively it indicates that the hybrid system has a high removal efficiency for organic compounds although the cod concentration of feed water fluctuates greatly the integrated process provides an effluent with stable water quality when the flux is 55 lmh the cod in the o3 cmf effluent has a slightly higher concentration than that under the flux of 40 lmh but the following bac unit further removes the organic pollutants and ensures the cod concentration lower than the discharge limit ozone as a highly oxidative agent can disintegrate rapidly into hydroxyl radicals which break down unsaturated bonds cc cn nn etc of organic compounds and improve their biodegradability for the following bac filtration tripathi and tripathi 2011 thus the integration of ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with bac filtration is a promising option to ensure the removal of organic pollutants in the wastewater treatment meanwhile the average concentration of cod in the effluent of fenton process is around 10 mg l which indicates that fenton process has a slightly better removal efficiency on cod than the integrated process the variation of phosphate in the feed water and effluents are shown in fig 3b though there is an obvious fluctuation of phosphate concentration in the feed the phosphate in the effluent of the hybrid process is steadily kept lower than 0 5 mg l during the entire experiment it is worth to note that the flux has no obvious impact on the removal efficiency of phosphate besides the phosphate concentration in the effluents of the hybrid process is close to that of fenton process during the fenton process phosphate is removed through the formation of iron phosphate precipitation which is then discharged with the fenton sludge yang et al 2019 in contrast the integrated process removes phosphate through the adsorption and filtration of ceramic membrane without extra chemical consumption kramer et al 2019 the color of water is mainly derived from the decomposition of natural humic substances and normally the presence of unsaturated organic moieties conjugated in the compounds causes colors rice et al 1981 it can be seen from fig 3c that the color of the o3 cmf effluent can meet the discharge standards and the color of bac effluent is stable lower than 10 dilution times the removal efficiency of color by the integrated process is 85 6 close to that by the fenton process 92 5 when the flux increases from 40 lmh to 55 lmh the color of the o3 cmf effluent increases significantly this might be due to the insufficient reaction time of ozone with pollutants though the color is removed further by the bac unit the residual organic substances in the o3 cmf effluent might increase the pollutant loading on the bac filter thus 40 lmh is selected as the optimal flux for the integrated process in the following experiments in the integrated process ozone is particularly reactive with unsaturated groups that cause the color cleaving the conjugation by oxidation during the process the ph is basically stable as neutral see fig s2b the fenton process employs iron salts and hydrogen peroxide under acidic conditions ph 3 to generate hydroxyl radicals and oxidize the organic pollutants but the fenton process generates a large amount of iron sludge as well as acidic effluent that requires post treatment such as the neutralization from ph 3 5 to about ph 7 5 8 0 with sodium hydroxide solution and further separation of sludge from effluents by the ultrafiltration see fig s1 with this regard the integrated process is a more environmental friendly option than the fenton process 3 2 effect of contaminant concentration on the performance of the pilot system during the practical operation the pollutant concentrations in the feed wastewater have inevitable fluctuations due to the season weather and plant maintenances which might affect the performance of the advanced treatment processes lessard and beck 1990 thus the integrated process is tested with feed wastewater that has higher concentrations of pollutants the cod of the feed wastewater is changed from 60 to 150 mg l to 150 250 mg l the ceramic membrane filtration is operated with a permeate flux of 40 lmh during the experiment the ozone dosage is adjusted appropriately based on the tmp change and the removal efficiency of pollutants it can be seen from fig 4 that the tmp is stable around 11 kpa when the cod concentrations in the influent is 60 150 mg l indicating that ozone dosage of 10 mg l is enough to control the membrane fouling when the cod concentrations in the feed wastewater increases to 150 250 mg l the tmp shows an obvious jump and keeps increasing with a speed of about 5 0 kpa d it indicated that membrane fouling is getting worse under the higher organic loading thus the ozone dosage is increased to 20 mg l to control the membrane fouling as expected the tmp stops increasing and keeps at around 30 kpa indicating that the membrane fouling is effectively controlled by increasing the ozone dosage presented in fig 5 a is the cod variation during the experiment with varied cod loadings when the cod of the feed water is 60 150 mg l the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 43 2 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 17 9 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod by the integrated process is 78 9 when the cod of the feed water increases to 150 250 mg l the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 54 6 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 25 4 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod by the integrated process is 82 3 higher than that under the lower organic loading the results demonstrate that the integrated process can tolerate a high organic loading in the feed wastewater and ensure the effluent quality the removal efficiency of phosphate is stable all the time as shown in fig 5b it can be seen that the phosphate concentrations in the effluents from the o3 cmf and bac units are almost the same indicating that the removal of phosphate is mainly contributed from the o3 cmf unit this might be explained by the enhanced adsorption effect of the fouling layer on the membrane surface after the long operation xue et al 2018 different from phosphate the color in the feed wastewater increases correspondingly with the increased organic loading it can be seen from fig 5c that the color in the effluent of o3 cmf increases and bac unit helps remove the color further to maintain the color less than 10 dilution times in the effluent this result shows that the integrated process has a high removal efficiency for the color up to 91 5 which is contributed from both o3 cmf and bac filtration the removal mechanism and the contributions from each unit will be investigated below by analyzing the characteristics of organic substances in the feed water and effluents 3 3 the characteristics of organic pollutants in feed water and effluents 3 3 1 characterization based on the fluorescence excitation emission matrix in order to further investigate the contributions of ozonation and ceramic membrane filtration cmf for the removal of organic pollutants in hypersaline petrochemical wastewater the three dimensional feem of different water samples are evaluated using a spectrofluorometer the feem spectra can provide information about the molecular structure and composition of dissolved organic matter dom in the water samples five fluorescence regions have been categorized using the fluorescence regional integration fri methods chen et al 2003 including i tryptophan like proteins λex em 220 250 280 330 nm ii tyrosine like proteins λex em 220 250 330 380 nm iii fulvic acid like substances λex em 220 250 380 480 nm iv soluble microbial product smp substances λex em 250 350 280 380 nm and v humic acid like substances λex em 250 420 380 560 nm as shown in fig 6 a five primary fluorescent peaks are observed in the untreated feed water peaks a b and c are centered approximately at the λex em of 240 340 245 385 and 280 335 nm and they represent tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like substances and smp substances respectively peaks d1 λex em 315 390 and d2 λex em 300 435 are attributed to humic acid like substances as shown in fig 6b peaks d1 and b disappear while peaks a d2 and c show much weaker signals after the cmf treatment the fluorescence intensities for regions iii iv and v decrease by 54 3 46 8 and 59 7 respectively demonstrating that the sole membrane separation has a high removal efficiency in most of the smp fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances meanwhile the tyrosine like substances region ii are not removed effectively by the sole cmf due to their small molecular weights because cmf rejects the organic matters mainly via size exclusion effect moreover the sole membrane filtration process suffers from membrane fouling with the pollutants rejected on the membrane surface and in the pores the above results are consistent with the finding in a previous study that the main components of the foulants on membrane surface and in pores are smp substances such as polysaccharides proteins and humic and fulvic substances ibn abdul hamid et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 many studies have reported that ozone can oxidize the complexing organics including humic substances and fulvic acids rivas et al 2009 as a strong oxidant ozone can effectively change or destroy the structure of organic pollutants after the ozonation treatment the fluorescence intensity in all the five regions exhibits an obvious decrease fig 6c and e especially under a higher ozone dosage 30 mg l by contrast to the sole cmf process peak d2 decreases significantly while peak d1 remains strong under a low ozone dosage demonstrating the limited removal efficiency of ozonation on humic acid like organics this result is consistent with the findings in a previous study that certain humic substances are inert to ozonation yu et al 2019 according to chen et al highly aromatic and hydrophobic humus may be degradable during ozonation chen et al 2017 which explains the significant decrease in peak d2 after ozonation treatment it is worth noting that peak b representing the fulvic acid like substances undergoes a blue shift of 5 10 nm along the emission axis and peak d2 representing a portion of the humic acid like substances also undergoes a blue shift of 5 nm along the excitation axis based on the previous researches the blue shift of the peaks indicates 1 the decomposition of aromatic moieties to smaller molecules 2 the reduction in the degree of π bonds such as decreasing the number of aromatic rings or conjugated bonds in a chain structure and 3 the elimination of certain functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl and amine świetlik and sikorska 2004 zhang et al 2008 therefore the ozonation degrades one portion of the humic acid like substances that are easily degradable compounds such as aromatic humus and one portion of the fulvic substances is converted into small molecule organics with incomplete mineralization the remaining refractory compounds might be the fulvic acid like substances and the humic substances that are inert to ozonation the fluorescence distributions in the water samples are depicted in fig 7 which shows that the coupled process of cmf with ozonation significantly improves the removal of organics than that of the cmf alone and ozonation alone especially for regions iii v fig 6d shows that the cmf complements the limited removal efficiency of ozonation for humic acid like substances region v and tyrosine like proteins region ii particularly peak d1 decreases dramatically after the cmf ozonation treatment compared with the sole ozonation fig 6c peak d1 represents the portion of humic substances that are difficult for the ozonation to degrade coupling with ceramic membrane filtration the enhanced removal efficiency of ozonation might be attributed to the synergistic effect in the ozonation occurring in the membrane pores previous studies show that the specific decomposition efficiency of ozone inside membrane pores is hundreds times higher than that in bulk water solutions fan and zhang 2014 which implies that the degradation efficiency of organics by ozone inside the membrane pores is substantially improved this also explains the high efficiency of ozonation on the mitigation of membrane fouling during the filtration when the ozone dosage increases to 30 mg l fig 6f the fluorescence signals for all the regions decrease significantly after the treatment of ozonation cmf process but just slightly weaker than those after sole ozonation with dosage of 30 mg l this indicates that ozonation plays a dominating role in the removal of organics when the ozone dosage is high enough from an economic point of view the coupling of cmf with ozonation improves the removal efficiency reduces the ozone dosage and consequently saves the cost though the increase of ozone dosage improves the degradation of all the dom proper ozone dosages should be applied to couple with the ceramic membrane filtration to achieve the optimal performance based on the feed water quality 3 3 2 characterization based on the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of dissolved organics are examined and the concentrations of dom fractions in terms of doc are presented in fig 8 in the feed water hpi component is the most abundant fraction accounting for 39 6 of the total dom the hpo fraction is the second largest portion 32 4 after the cmf treatment all the components in the feed water decrease slightly and the proportions of each component do not change significantly this result is consistent with the findings obtained from the feem spectrum which shows that the fluorescence intensities decrease in all the regions fig 6b this indicates that sole ceramic membrane filtration rejects the organics mainly by the size exclusion without changing their chemical characteristics after the ozonation treatment the hpi fraction in the feed water increases significantly by 25 8 while the hpo fraction decreases by 44 0 according to jarusutthirak et al the hpo and tpi fractions possess characteristics of humic substances i e high aromaticity and carboxylic functional groups jarusutthirak et al 2002 this is also consistent with the conclusions obtained from the above analysis of feem spectra the intensity changes of peak d2 in fig 6 show that the ozonation alternates the functional groups of the humic acid like substances resulting in the decrease of hpo and tpi fractions therefore the proportion of hydrophilic organic matter increases after ozonation the enhanced hydrophilicity of the organic substances might increase its solubility in water which is beneficial for the organic substances to pass through the membrane pores on the other hand ozonation converts the foulants that have been attached on the membrane surfaces or blocked in the membrane pores into small molecule organics which are able to pass through the ceramic membrane pores thus ozonation modifies the structure and property of organic pollutants to reduce the fouling of the ceramic membrane 3 4 techno economic analysis of the integrated process compared with the fenton process a detailed analysis of the cost for the integrated process and the fenton process is shown in table 3 it is well known that the wastewater quantity and quality as well as the scale of treatment systems greatly affect the cost thus the economic analysis is performed based on the plant capacity in this study i e 4000 m3 d the calculations of depreciation and the replacement of membranes and activated carbon are based on a lifespan of 20 years the unit costs m3 for both processes are estimated for the comparison presented in fig s1 the fenton process is composed of fenton reaction system and the ultrafiltration system the capital costs of the fenton process system and the ultrafiltration system are 535 000 and 387 500 respectively the cost of the pvdf membrane used in the ultrafiltration system is 111 081 the service life of the pvdf membranes is assumed as 3 years and the replacement cost of the membrane in 20 years is estimated to be 31 481 per year in the fenton process system the dosage of h2o2 is 425 g m3 the dosage of feso4 is 475 g m3 and the dosages of h2so4 and naoh are 490 g m3 and 400 g m3 respectively in addition to the chemical cost for the membrane cleaning that is estimated to be 0 02 m3 the total chemicals cost is 0 368 m3 i e 537 280 per year the treatment cost of hazardous iron containing sludge is estimated to be 379 600 per year besides this wastewater plant might increase the h2o2 dosage to reduce the amount of sludge during the fenton treatment process making the chemical cost higher for the integrated process the capital cost is composed of installation costs for the ceramic membrane filtration system the ozonation system the bac system and the investments for ceramic membranes and activated carbon materials the cost of the ceramic membranes that are used in the cmf system is 436 000 which is higher than the pvdf membranes in the fenton process considering the replacement cost the service life of the ceramic membranes is assumed as 15 years so the replacement cost of ceramic membrane in 20 years is 13 889 per year which is much less than that for the replacement of pvdf membranes the capital cost of the granular activated carbon system is 438 000 the service life of the activated carbon is assumed to be 5 years and the replacement cost of activated carbon is 12 000 per year in the integrated process no extra chemicals are used for the treatment other than the sodium hypochlorite for membrane chemical cleaning the chemical cost is as low as 29 200 per year table 3 shows that the total capital costs for the integrated process 1 726 005 is higher than that for the fenton process 1 033 581 however the operation cost of the fenton process is almost three times that of the integrated process operation costs are mainly chemicals electricity and membrane replacement in the fenton process chemicals cost is 46 1 of operation costs while it is only 11 5 in the integrated process moreover the sludge disposal also accounts 32 6 of operating costs in the fenton process the majority of the operation cost of the integrated system is from electricity demands which accounts for 65 5 besides the integrated system is an automated system with no need for close supervision saving the labor cost considering the depreciation of construction costs and 6 interest rate the unit cost would be 0 88 m3 and 0 30 m3 for the fenton process and the integrated process respectively the effluent quality after the integrated process can meet the discharge standard though the fenton process has better effluent quality the comparative cost with the fenton process manifests the financial advantage of this integrated process 4 conclusion this work proposed an integrated process that couples ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with activated carbon filtration for the advanced treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater the performance of the integrated process was investigated at a pilot scale in comparison with the fenton process that has been used in the wastewater plant the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized for the optimal treatment performance of this integrated process the results showed that our proposed process provided a long term stable treatment efficiency for the pollutants in the petrochemical wastewater even under a high influent cod concentration 195 mg l in average this integrated process performed well in pollutant removal with codcr phosphate and color in the effluents being 17 9 mg l 0 25 mg l and 5 dilution times in average respectively meeting the local discharge standard synergistic effects of combining ozonation ceramic membrane filtration and active carbon filtration have been found during the analysis of the organics removal contribution by each unit ozonation degrades the organic pollutants that cause the membrane fouling and achieves the in situ membrane cleaning meantime the degradation efficiency of organics by the ozone is substantially improved inside the membrane pores moreover ozonation converts part of the organics into small molecules with incomplete mineralization but enhanced bio degradability which are further removed by the following biological activated carbon filtration on the other hand though fenton process showed better effluent quality the estimated unit cost for this integrated process was only 34 of that for the fenton process moreover fenton process consumes lots of chemicals and generates large amounts of sludge while the integrated process does not produce secondary pollutions proving to be more environmental friendly overall the integrated process in this work demonstrates high economic

17813,an integrated process combining ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with biological activated carbon filtration o3 cmf bac process was designed and evaluated using a pilot scale 10 m3 d test for the advanced treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater in a coastal wastewater plant the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized for the optimal treatment performance of this integrated process the results showed that this integrated process performed well in pollutant removal the concentrations of codcr phosphate and color in the effluents were 17 9 mg l 0 25 mg l and 5 dilution times in average respectively the effluent quality met the local discharge standard even under a high influent cod concentration 195 mg l in average the synergistic effect of the ozonation and ceramic membrane filtration was investigated through the fluorescence characteristics and hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of organic compounds it revealed that ozonation mitigated the membrane fouling and the nanopores in the ceramic membranes enhanced the ozonation efficiency meanwhile the fenton process had a slightly better effluent quality than the integrated process but fenton process consumed much more chemicals and required the sludge disposal resulting in higher cost the estimated unit cost for this integrated process was only 34 of that for the fenton process overall the integrated process demonstrated high stability reliable effluents and low cost providing a promising and cost efficient technology for the treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords hypersaline petrochemical wastewater advanced treatment ozonation ceramic membrane biological activated carbon 1 introduction the petrochemical plants consume a large amount of fresh water and discharge a significant quantity of industrial wastewater during the manufacturing process li et al 2011 walls 2010 wang et al 2014 most petrochemical wastewater contains high amounts of toxic and recalcitrant organics with poor biodegradability estrada arriaga et al 2012 liu et al 2014 theodorakis et al 2012 some petrochemical wastewater contains high salinity which might inhibit microbial growth and corrode treatment facilities jin et al 2008 xiang and jun 2012 yin 2006 the complexity of the petrochemical wastewater and the stringent discharge limit demand the development of efficient wastewater treatment physical treatment chemical treatment and biological treatment are commonly used to treat the petrochemical wastewater in two stages li et al 2010 patel and madamwar 2000 verma et al 2010 the first stage is the pretreatment to reduce suspended particles and oil such as air floatation jafarinejad and jiang 2019 coagulation zeng et al 2007 and biological aerated filter ding et al 2016 xin et al 2006 however pretreatments usually have a low removal efficiency for refractory organic pollutants and the chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluents is still high the second stage is the advanced treatment to remove the residual pollutants from the secondary effluent to meet the discharge standards currently reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes aops have commonly been applied for the advanced treatment of petrochemical wastewater guo et al 2018 sivagami et al 2019 venzke et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yetilmezsoy and sakar 2008 according to madaeni et al most of pollutants including cod conductivity color and ions can be removed efficiently by ro membranes madaeni and eslamifard 2010 however the application of ro technology is limited by low recovery ratio high energy consumption and the stringent quality of feed water for ro process benito alcázar et al 2010 fenton process as one of the commonly used aops has the capability of rapid degradation of recalcitrant pollutants in the wastewater however fenton process is chemical consuming and generates a large amount of sludge that requires post treatment recently researches are focused on reducing chemical dosage and decreasing operation costs of fenton process but its economic viability remains doubtful in the large scale commercial applications bello et al 2019 demir duz et al 2019 the combined process of ozonation with membrane filtration has gained increasing attention in wastewater treatment because of its high efficiency to destruct the structure of refractory organic pollutants and increase the biodegradability of the secondary effluent most importantly ozonation produces no secondary pollutions and membrane filtration has the advantages of small footprint and high stability alzahrani and mohammad 2014 in the past decade ceramic membranes have been applied widely because of their high chemical resistance good mechanical strength high membrane flux and long lifetime which can effectively overcome the shortcomings of polymeric membranes padaki et al 2015 sondhi et al 2003 tin et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 many studies have been conducted on the application of ozonation combined with ceramic membrane filtration in wastewater treatment and the combined process is proved to be efficient for the advanced treatment of secondary wastewater effluent lehman and liu 2009 zhang et al 2016 compared to ozonation alone the ozonation in the membrane pores is catalyzed compared to ozonation alone the ozonation in the membrane pores is catalyzed our previous studies find that the degradation efficiency of organics by ozone inside the membrane pores is substantially improved fan and zhang 2014 and the high efficiency of ozonation mitigates the membrane fouling during the filtration song et al 2017 besides this accelerated decomposition process ensures the low ozone concentration in the membrane effluent which avoids the potential harm to the following biological process tang et al 2019 however some studies report that the organic matters cannot be mineralized thoroughly by the ozonation and the intermediates or byproducts after the ozonation might be even more toxic and refractory than the original organics which requires the biological carbon filter as a further treatment step han et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it is believed that the ozonation increase the biodegradability of the secondary effluent for the following biological activated carbon bac filtration and the integration of ozonation ceramic membrane and bac will be a promising option to increase the efficiency of the advanced wastewater treatment processes this study aims to investigate the performance and mechanism of the combined process of ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with biological activated carbon filtration o3 cmf bac process for the advanced treatment of petrochemical wastewater a pilot test 10 m3 d was conducted with the actual secondary effluent from a coastal wastewater plant located in a petrochemical industrial park the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized to achieve high removal efficiency and stable operation moreover the performance in organic pollutant removal and operating cost of this integrated process were compared with the fenton process that has been used in the plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water this pilot scale study was operated in a wastewater plant for a coastal petrochemical industry located in huizhou china this wastewater plant used membrane bioreactor mbr for the pre treatment and fenton process for the advanced treatment followed with the ultrafiltration using polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes mean pore size 0 03 μm to separate the fenton sludge see fig s1 the feed wastewater for our integrated process was collected from the effluent of the mbr process in the wastewater plant which was also the influent of the fenton process presented in table 1 are the characteristics of the feed wastewater for the integrated process and the effluent from the fenton process in order to simulate the seasonal fluctuation of wastewater quality in the wastewater plant the feed water with higher organic loading was prepared by mixing the feed water with the wastewater from the emergency storage pool in the wastewater

consumption and membrane fouling fujioka and nghiem 2015 tang et al 2019 tin et al 2017 the permeate flux of ceramic membranes usually ranges from 20 l m2 h lmh to 150 lmh based on the quality of feed water sondhi et al 2003 in order to obtain the optimal membrane flux for the hybrid system to treat the petrochemical wastewater the performance of the removal efficiency and the membrane fouling were tested under different membrane fluxes during the test the ozone dosage was 10 mg l and the membrane flux was changed from 25 lmh 40 lmh to 55 lmh successively the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored as an indicator of membrane fouling the effluents from ozone ceramic membrane tank o3 cmf effluent and the biological activated carbon pool bac effluent were analyzed to investigate the contributions from each process unit to the removal of pollutants moreover the treatment efficiency of the integrated process was compared with that of the fenton process which has been applied in the plant during the test 3 1 1 evaluation of membrane fouling under different permeate fluxes tmp is an important index to evaluate the long term stability of the membrane process weschenfelder et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 tmp increases by around 5 kpa with sudden jumps for every 15 lmh the flux increases during the operation period under 25 lhm the tmp is kept stable for more than 3 days it indicates that the membrane fouling is negligible when the membrane flux is lower than the critical flux field and pearce 2011 the tmp increases slightly during the 4 day operation under the flux of 40 lmh once the flux increases to 55 lhm the tmp increases suddenly to 20 kpa but decreases gradually to 15 kpa this phenomenon might be explained by the mitigation of membrane fouling via the ozonation previous studies have demonstrated that ozonation is efficient in controlling the membrane fouling and achieves in situ membrane cleaning song et al 2017 thus the results indicate that the ceramic membrane can maintain a long term stable operation with the flux of 55 lmh 3 1 2 effect of permeate flux on the removal of pollutants it can be seen from fig 3 a that the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 48 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 19 6 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod is 51 3 and 80 1 by o3 cmf and bac units respectively it indicates that the hybrid system has a high removal efficiency for organic compounds although the cod concentration of feed water fluctuates greatly the integrated process provides an effluent with stable water quality when the flux is 55 lmh the cod in the o3 cmf effluent has a slightly higher concentration than that under the flux of 40 lmh but the following bac unit further removes the organic pollutants and ensures the cod concentration lower than the discharge limit ozone as a highly oxidative agent can disintegrate rapidly into hydroxyl radicals which break down unsaturated bonds cc cn nn etc of organic compounds and improve their biodegradability for the following bac filtration tripathi and tripathi 2011 thus the integration of ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with bac filtration is a promising option to ensure the removal of organic pollutants in the wastewater treatment meanwhile the average concentration of cod in the effluent of fenton process is around 10 mg l which indicates that fenton process has a slightly better removal efficiency on cod than the integrated process the variation of phosphate in the feed water and effluents are shown in fig 3b though there is an obvious fluctuation of phosphate concentration in the feed the phosphate in the effluent of the hybrid process is steadily kept lower than 0 5 mg l during the entire experiment it is worth to note that the flux has no obvious impact on the removal efficiency of phosphate besides the phosphate concentration in the effluents of the hybrid process is close to that of fenton process during the fenton process phosphate is removed through the formation of iron phosphate precipitation which is then discharged with the fenton sludge yang et al 2019 in contrast the integrated process removes phosphate through the adsorption and filtration of ceramic membrane without extra chemical consumption kramer et al 2019 the color of water is mainly derived from the decomposition of natural humic substances and normally the presence of unsaturated organic moieties conjugated in the compounds causes colors rice et al 1981 it can be seen from fig 3c that the color of the o3 cmf effluent can meet the discharge standards and the color of bac effluent is stable lower than 10 dilution times the removal efficiency of color by the integrated process is 85 6 close to that by the fenton process 92 5 when the flux increases from 40 lmh to 55 lmh the color of the o3 cmf effluent increases significantly this might be due to the insufficient reaction time of ozone with pollutants though the color is removed further by the bac unit the residual organic substances in the o3 cmf effluent might increase the pollutant loading on the bac filter thus 40 lmh is selected as the optimal flux for the integrated process in the following experiments in the integrated process ozone is particularly reactive with unsaturated groups that cause the color cleaving the conjugation by oxidation during the process the ph is basically stable as neutral see fig s2b the fenton process employs iron salts and hydrogen peroxide under acidic conditions ph 3 to generate hydroxyl radicals and oxidize the organic pollutants but the fenton process generates a large amount of iron sludge as well as acidic effluent that requires post treatment such as the neutralization from ph 3 5 to about ph 7 5 8 0 with sodium hydroxide solution and further separation of sludge from effluents by the ultrafiltration see fig s1 with this regard the integrated process is a more environmental friendly option than the fenton process 3 2 effect of contaminant concentration on the performance of the pilot system during the practical operation the pollutant concentrations in the feed wastewater have inevitable fluctuations due to the season weather and plant maintenances which might affect the performance of the advanced treatment processes lessard and beck 1990 thus the integrated process is tested with feed wastewater that has higher concentrations of pollutants the cod of the feed wastewater is changed from 60 to 150 mg l to 150 250 mg l the ceramic membrane filtration is operated with a permeate flux of 40 lmh during the experiment the ozone dosage is adjusted appropriately based on the tmp change and the removal efficiency of pollutants it can be seen from fig 4 that the tmp is stable around 11 kpa when the cod concentrations in the influent is 60 150 mg l indicating that ozone dosage of 10 mg l is enough to control the membrane fouling when the cod concentrations in the feed wastewater increases to 150 250 mg l the tmp shows an obvious jump and keeps increasing with a speed of about 5 0 kpa d it indicated that membrane fouling is getting worse under the higher organic loading thus the ozone dosage is increased to 20 mg l to control the membrane fouling as expected the tmp stops increasing and keeps at around 30 kpa indicating that the membrane fouling is effectively controlled by increasing the ozone dosage presented in fig 5 a is the cod variation during the experiment with varied cod loadings when the cod of the feed water is 60 150 mg l the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 43 2 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 17 9 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod by the integrated process is 78 9 when the cod of the feed water increases to 150 250 mg l the average cod of the o3 cmf effluent is 54 6 mg l and that of the bac effluent is 25 4 mg l the average removal efficiency of cod by the integrated process is 82 3 higher than that under the lower organic loading the results demonstrate that the integrated process can tolerate a high organic loading in the feed wastewater and ensure the effluent quality the removal efficiency of phosphate is stable all the time as shown in fig 5b it can be seen that the phosphate concentrations in the effluents from the o3 cmf and bac units are almost the same indicating that the removal of phosphate is mainly contributed from the o3 cmf unit this might be explained by the enhanced adsorption effect of the fouling layer on the membrane surface after the long operation xue et al 2018 different from phosphate the color in the feed wastewater increases correspondingly with the increased organic loading it can be seen from fig 5c that the color in the effluent of o3 cmf increases and bac unit helps remove the color further to maintain the color less than 10 dilution times in the effluent this result shows that the integrated process has a high removal efficiency for the color up to 91 5 which is contributed from both o3 cmf and bac filtration the removal mechanism and the contributions from each unit will be investigated below by analyzing the characteristics of organic substances in the feed water and effluents 3 3 the characteristics of organic pollutants in feed water and effluents 3 3 1 characterization based on the fluorescence excitation emission matrix in order to further investigate the contributions of ozonation and ceramic membrane filtration cmf for the removal of organic pollutants in hypersaline petrochemical wastewater the three dimensional feem of different water samples are evaluated using a spectrofluorometer the feem spectra can provide information about the molecular structure and composition of dissolved organic matter dom in the water samples five fluorescence regions have been categorized using the fluorescence regional integration fri methods chen et al 2003 including i tryptophan like proteins λex em 220 250 280 330 nm ii tyrosine like proteins λex em 220 250 330 380 nm iii fulvic acid like substances λex em 220 250 380 480 nm iv soluble microbial product smp substances λex em 250 350 280 380 nm and v humic acid like substances λex em 250 420 380 560 nm as shown in fig 6 a five primary fluorescent peaks are observed in the untreated feed water peaks a b and c are centered approximately at the λex em of 240 340 245 385 and 280 335 nm and they represent tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like substances and smp substances respectively peaks d1 λex em 315 390 and d2 λex em 300 435 are attributed to humic acid like substances as shown in fig 6b peaks d1 and b disappear while peaks a d2 and c show much weaker signals after the cmf treatment the fluorescence intensities for regions iii iv and v decrease by 54 3 46 8 and 59 7 respectively demonstrating that the sole membrane separation has a high removal efficiency in most of the smp fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances meanwhile the tyrosine like substances region ii are not removed effectively by the sole cmf due to their small molecular weights because cmf rejects the organic matters mainly via size exclusion effect moreover the sole membrane filtration process suffers from membrane fouling with the pollutants rejected on the membrane surface and in the pores the above results are consistent with the finding in a previous study that the main components of the foulants on membrane surface and in pores are smp substances such as polysaccharides proteins and humic and fulvic substances ibn abdul hamid et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 many studies have reported that ozone can oxidize the complexing organics including humic substances and fulvic acids rivas et al 2009 as a strong oxidant ozone can effectively change or destroy the structure of organic pollutants after the ozonation treatment the fluorescence intensity in all the five regions exhibits an obvious decrease fig 6c and e especially under a higher ozone dosage 30 mg l by contrast to the sole cmf process peak d2 decreases significantly while peak d1 remains strong under a low ozone dosage demonstrating the limited removal efficiency of ozonation on humic acid like organics this result is consistent with the findings in a previous study that certain humic substances are inert to ozonation yu et al 2019 according to chen et al highly aromatic and hydrophobic humus may be degradable during ozonation chen et al 2017 which explains the significant decrease in peak d2 after ozonation treatment it is worth noting that peak b representing the fulvic acid like substances undergoes a blue shift of 5 10 nm along the emission axis and peak d2 representing a portion of the humic acid like substances also undergoes a blue shift of 5 nm along the excitation axis based on the previous researches the blue shift of the peaks indicates 1 the decomposition of aromatic moieties to smaller molecules 2 the reduction in the degree of π bonds such as decreasing the number of aromatic rings or conjugated bonds in a chain structure and 3 the elimination of certain functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl and amine świetlik and sikorska 2004 zhang et al 2008 therefore the ozonation degrades one portion of the humic acid like substances that are easily degradable compounds such as aromatic humus and one portion of the fulvic substances is converted into small molecule organics with incomplete mineralization the remaining refractory compounds might be the fulvic acid like substances and the humic substances that are inert to ozonation the fluorescence distributions in the water samples are depicted in fig 7 which shows that the coupled process of cmf with ozonation significantly improves the removal of organics than that of the cmf alone and ozonation alone especially for regions iii v fig 6d shows that the cmf complements the limited removal efficiency of ozonation for humic acid like substances region v and tyrosine like proteins region ii particularly peak d1 decreases dramatically after the cmf ozonation treatment compared with the sole ozonation fig 6c peak d1 represents the portion of humic substances that are difficult for the ozonation to degrade coupling with ceramic membrane filtration the enhanced removal efficiency of ozonation might be attributed to the synergistic effect in the ozonation occurring in the membrane pores previous studies show that the specific decomposition efficiency of ozone inside membrane pores is hundreds times higher than that in bulk water solutions fan and zhang 2014 which implies that the degradation efficiency of organics by ozone inside the membrane pores is substantially improved this also explains the high efficiency of ozonation on the mitigation of membrane fouling during the filtration when the ozone dosage increases to 30 mg l fig 6f the fluorescence signals for all the regions decrease significantly after the treatment of ozonation cmf process but just slightly weaker than those after sole ozonation with dosage of 30 mg l this indicates that ozonation plays a dominating role in the removal of organics when the ozone dosage is high enough from an economic point of view the coupling of cmf with ozonation improves the removal efficiency reduces the ozone dosage and consequently saves the cost though the increase of ozone dosage improves the degradation of all the dom proper ozone dosages should be applied to couple with the ceramic membrane filtration to achieve the optimal performance based on the feed water quality 3 3 2 characterization based on the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of dissolved organics are examined and the concentrations of dom fractions in terms of doc are presented in fig 8 in the feed water hpi component is the most abundant fraction accounting for 39 6 of the total dom the hpo fraction is the second largest portion 32 4 after the cmf treatment all the components in the feed water decrease slightly and the proportions of each component do not change significantly this result is consistent with the findings obtained from the feem spectrum which shows that the fluorescence intensities decrease in all the regions fig 6b this indicates that sole ceramic membrane filtration rejects the organics mainly by the size exclusion without changing their chemical characteristics after the ozonation treatment the hpi fraction in the feed water increases significantly by 25 8 while the hpo fraction decreases by 44 0 according to jarusutthirak et al the hpo and tpi fractions possess characteristics of humic substances i e high aromaticity and carboxylic functional groups jarusutthirak et al 2002 this is also consistent with the conclusions obtained from the above analysis of feem spectra the intensity changes of peak d2 in fig 6 show that the ozonation alternates the functional groups of the humic acid like substances resulting in the decrease of hpo and tpi fractions therefore the proportion of hydrophilic organic matter increases after ozonation the enhanced hydrophilicity of the organic substances might increase its solubility in water which is beneficial for the organic substances to pass through the membrane pores on the other hand ozonation converts the foulants that have been attached on the membrane surfaces or blocked in the membrane pores into small molecule organics which are able to pass through the ceramic membrane pores thus ozonation modifies the structure and property of organic pollutants to reduce the fouling of the ceramic membrane 3 4 techno economic analysis of the integrated process compared with the fenton process a detailed analysis of the cost for the integrated process and the fenton process is shown in table 3 it is well known that the wastewater quantity and quality as well as the scale of treatment systems greatly affect the cost thus the economic analysis is performed based on the plant capacity in this study i e 4000 m3 d the calculations of depreciation and the replacement of membranes and activated carbon are based on a lifespan of 20 years the unit costs m3 for both processes are estimated for the comparison presented in fig s1 the fenton process is composed of fenton reaction system and the ultrafiltration system the capital costs of the fenton process system and the ultrafiltration system are 535 000 and 387 500 respectively the cost of the pvdf membrane used in the ultrafiltration system is 111 081 the service life of the pvdf membranes is assumed as 3 years and the replacement cost of the membrane in 20 years is estimated to be 31 481 per year in the fenton process system the dosage of h2o2 is 425 g m3 the dosage of feso4 is 475 g m3 and the dosages of h2so4 and naoh are 490 g m3 and 400 g m3 respectively in addition to the chemical cost for the membrane cleaning that is estimated to be 0 02 m3 the total chemicals cost is 0 368 m3 i e 537 280 per year the treatment cost of hazardous iron containing sludge is estimated to be 379 600 per year besides this wastewater plant might increase the h2o2 dosage to reduce the amount of sludge during the fenton treatment process making the chemical cost higher for the integrated process the capital cost is composed of installation costs for the ceramic membrane filtration system the ozonation system the bac system and the investments for ceramic membranes and activated carbon materials the cost of the ceramic membranes that are used in the cmf system is 436 000 which is higher than the pvdf membranes in the fenton process considering the replacement cost the service life of the ceramic membranes is assumed as 15 years so the replacement cost of ceramic membrane in 20 years is 13 889 per year which is much less than that for the replacement of pvdf membranes the capital cost of the granular activated carbon system is 438 000 the service life of the activated carbon is assumed to be 5 years and the replacement cost of activated carbon is 12 000 per year in the integrated process no extra chemicals are used for the treatment other than the sodium hypochlorite for membrane chemical cleaning the chemical cost is as low as 29 200 per year table 3 shows that the total capital costs for the integrated process 1 726 005 is higher than that for the fenton process 1 033 581 however the operation cost of the fenton process is almost three times that of the integrated process operation costs are mainly chemicals electricity and membrane replacement in the fenton process chemicals cost is 46 1 of operation costs while it is only 11 5 in the integrated process moreover the sludge disposal also accounts 32 6 of operating costs in the fenton process the majority of the operation cost of the integrated system is from electricity demands which accounts for 65 5 besides the integrated system is an automated system with no need for close supervision saving the labor cost considering the depreciation of construction costs and 6 interest rate the unit cost would be 0 88 m3 and 0 30 m3 for the fenton process and the integrated process respectively the effluent quality after the integrated process can meet the discharge standard though the fenton process has better effluent quality the comparative cost with the fenton process manifests the financial advantage of this integrated process 4 conclusion this work proposed an integrated process that couples ozonation ceramic membrane filtration with activated carbon filtration for the advanced treatment of hypersaline petrochemical wastewater the performance of the integrated process was investigated at a pilot scale in comparison with the fenton process that has been used in the wastewater plant the membrane flux and ozone dosage were optimized for the optimal treatment performance of this integrated process the results showed that our proposed process provided a long term stable treatment efficiency for the pollutants in the petrochemical wastewater even under a high influent cod concentration 195 mg l in average this integrated process performed well in pollutant removal with codcr phosphate and color in the effluents being 17 9 mg l 0 25 mg l and 5 dilution times in average respectively meeting the local discharge standard synergistic effects of combining ozonation ceramic membrane filtration and active carbon filtration have been found during the analysis of the organics removal contribution by each unit ozonation degrades the organic pollutants that cause the membrane fouling and achieves the in situ membrane cleaning meantime the degradation efficiency of organics by the ozone is substantially improved inside the membrane pores moreover ozonation converts part of the organics into small molecules with incomplete mineralization but enhanced bio degradability which are further removed by the following biological activated carbon filtration on the other hand though fenton process showed better effluent quality the estimated unit cost for this integrated process was only 34 of that for the fenton process moreover fenton process consumes lots of chemicals and generates large amounts of sludge while the integrated process does not produce secondary pollutions proving to be more environmental friendly overall the integrated process in this work demonstrates high economic

17814,thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activate sludge was was carried out in pilot scale over a year to investigate its seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and its impact on dewaterability sludge liquor quality and formation of soluble refractory cod scodref temperature of tap was set at 65 70 c and ph was increased by initial dosing of sodium hydroxide naoh 50 w w 1 2 5 ml l sludge as alkali agent following 2 2 5 h reaction time pilot digesters were fed with primary sludge ps and hydrolyzed was hwas and compared to a reference digester fed with ps and untreated was biogas yield increase due to tap of was showed a sinusoidal trend throughout the year with maximum in summer 42 minimum in winter 3 and average of 20 indicating a strong seasonal effect on tap efficiency ammonium nh 4 n orthophosphate po 4 3 p and sulphate so 4 2 in sludge liquor increased by 34 6 17 0 and 21 6 with tap respectively centrifugation tests showed no significant difference in dewaterability of both digestates with respect to total solids of sludge cake normalized capillary suction time of digestate increased due to tap indicating a lower capability for water release furthermore detected scodref after batch aerobic biodegradation tests showed an increase of 30 3 with tap hence implementation of tap of was in full scale will potentially lead to an increase of 0 8 1 1 mg l of scodref in effluent of six wastewater treatment plants wwtp in berlin in conclusion tap of was leads to increase in biogas production with a slighter negative impact on effluent cod quality than high temperature thermal hydrolysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords thermal alkaline pretreatment biogas yield dewatering return load zahn wellens test effluent cod 1 introduction activated sludge process is the most widely used treatment process on wwtps throughout the world waste activated sludge was as the unfavorable byproduct of this process puts wwtps under significant financial burden for its disposal appels et al 2008 therefore it is economically beneficial to reduce was amounts as much as possible anaerobic digestion ad as a well established process leads to reduction of organic matter of was while producing biogas as a renewable energy source however biodegradability of was in ad is relatively low 35 40 removal of volatile solids vs due to its complex microbial structure dwa 2014 besides was shows a low dewatering potential after ad dwa 2008 accordingly different pretreatment techniques have been investigated in order to enhance biodegradation and dewaterability of was carrere et al 2010 2016 neumann et al 2016 biogas produced in ad is often utilized on site in a combined heat and power chp plant to maximize energy recovery produced electrical energy can be used directly at the wwtp or be injected to the grid on the other hand produced thermal energy cannot be stored efficiently and thus must be used instantly most often for digester heating and auxiliary heat demand of the plant e g buildings hot water for modern wwtps with efficient digestion and chp heat production from chp exceeds actual heat demand at the wwtp leaving excess heat from the cooling cycle and exhaust gas that is wasted to the atmosphere by exploiting this readily available heat on site thermal pretreatment techniques have been more attractive to wwtp operators than alternative processes which operate only on electrical energy this is also reflected in the growing number of full scale installations of thermal pretreatment processes worldwide barber 2016 thermal hydrolysis th and low temperature thermal alkaline pretreatment tap are two pretreatment techniques which exploit thermal energy produced in a chp th 130 170 c with specific thermal energy demand of 130 190 kwh m3 is more energy intensive than tap 60 70 c with 40 50 kwh m3 dwa 2016 moreover tap could use even low temperature waste heat from a chp cooling cycle due to lower operating temperatures consequently operation of steam generators as in th with associated operational risks is omitted on the other hand tap needs a constant supply of alkali agent to compensate for lower temperatures to boost its effect hence it is of high interest to know for wwtp operators how tap acts as a competitive alternative to th on all relevant aspects of was pretreatment before ad along with benefits of th and tap in sludge handling there comes also drawback of increase in solubilized organic carbon nitrogen phosphorus and inorganic orthophosphate po 4 3 p ammonium nh 4 n fraction of sludge liquor after ad beside additional costs of treating this increased return load it could also lead to impairment of effluent quality of wwtp e g in terms of increase in effluent cod through soluble refractory cod scodref toutian et al 2020 with strict local and national regulations on effluent quality parameters including cod this is an important deciding factor before implementing pretreatment processes ec 1991 germany 1996 regarding tap effects of alkali agent and dosage treatment time and temperature on disintegration of was has already been investigated extensively in batch mode lab scale studies campo et al 2018 kim et al 2013a shehu et al 2012 vigueras carmona et al 2011 therefore change of tap operational parameters was not subject of current study instead other tap knowledge gaps in literature were addressed these studies mainly focus on one or two aspects such as cod solubilization degree biogas yield or dewaterability and do not consider tap effects on the whole process chain of sludge treatment moreover biochemical methane potential results from batch tests are subject to inoculums which are not adapted to pretreated was and may not be fully representative of continuous ad operation besides since was is normally mixed with primary sludge ps before ad on wwtps it is also important to investigate this potential synergistic effect on biogas and dewaterability instead of was or pretreated was alone furthermore whether long term tap poses a potential adverse impact on stability of ad has not been investigated yet finally due to seasonal changes of influent properties of a wwtp and subsequent varying operational parameters characteristics of was also alters resulting in different seasonal outcomes in biogas yield and dewatering potential denkert and reza tehrani 2017 hai et al 2014 this necessitates yearlong continuous pilot trials mimicking real conditions on wwtps for more rigorous conclusions on the effects of tap consequently the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of tap of was on characteristics change of was ph scod po 4 3 p nh 4 n etc seasonal biogas yield increase throughout one operational year long term stability of digester dewaterability of digestate return load increase of sludge liquor and scodref after aerobic biodegradation of sludge liquor to estimate the impact of tap implementation on wwtp effluent quality a conversion factor was defined to correlate formation of scodref to the amount of pretreated vs in was using this factor the effect of tap on effluent cod increase of six wwtps in berlin was predicted through modelling whenever possible results of this tap study were compared with authors previous study on th toutian et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge thickened was was taken from a large municipal wwtp in berlin operated with pre denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr this wwtp is referred to as reference wwtp wwtpref in this study was is thickened with centrifuges after polymer dosing 0 7 kg active substance per kg total solids ts ps was taken from the primary settling tanks activated sludge as inoculum for zahn wellens test was collected from the return activated sludge pipeline inoculum for anaerobic digesters was digestate taken from digestion tanks on wwtpref the characteristics of was and ps are summarized in table 1 the high concentrations of scod nh 4 n and po 4 3 p are due to a certain degree of pre hydrolysis between sampling and analysis time one to two days as explained in fig s1 of supplementary material 2 2 pilot scale thermal alkaline pretreatment tap was carried out batch wise in a pilot plant pondus verfahrenstechnik gmbh germany on site at the wwtpref during one day of the week in a 24 h continuous operation trials took place in time period of july 2018 june 2019 for one year week 1 to week 52 operational optimization and maintenance were carried out between week 26 to week 33 the process flow diagram of the tap pilot plant is shown in fig 1 a see fig s2 for a photo of pilot plant the operational parameters were suggested by process supplier pondus and are summarized in table 2 thickened was was first sieved through a stainless steel sieve with mesh size of 5 mm fig s3 to protect the influent pump against potential coarse material then was was mixed with alkali dosed at 1 2 5 ml sodium hydroxide naoh 50 w w l of was subsequently was was pumped through a spiral coil heat exchanger placed in a water bath which was heated up to 65 70 c

spiral coil heat exchanger which was intended to cool down the hydrolyzed was hwas after pretreatment cooling water of the wwtpref was used to continuously cool the hwas down to 22 24 c in the end hwas was collected in a 1 m3 container to be transported for ad in each tap run around 500 l was was hydrolyzed 2 3 transportation and storage of sludge as no parallel pilot digesters were available at the wwtpref ad was operated at another site dbi institute freiberg consequently weekly transport of freshly taken was ps and hwas was required by truck 3 h drive the sludges were then transferred to 3 containers each with 1 m3 volume each container was equipped with a mechanical stirrer to avoid settling an ambient air cooling system was used to minimize the inherent autolysis of sludge during one week storage time samples of digested sludge from two digesters were sent back weekly to berlin for further analyses 2 4 anaerobic digestion the specifications of anaerobic digesters are listed in table 3 and configuration of digesters and feedstock containers are depicted in fig 1b see fig s4 for a photo of digesters operational parameters similar to those of the digesters on the wwtpref were maintained accordingly mesophilic digestion at 37 c with 20 days hrt was implemented digester a was fed daily with ps and was and served as a reference digester b was fed with ps and hwas after tap the mixing ratio between ps and was or hwas for both digesters was 1 1 volume basis organic loading rate was comparable for both digesters 1 5 kg vs m3 d each digester was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and online measurement systems of biogas volume flow rate composition temperature and pressure data of biogas production were normalized to the standard temperature and pressure conditions 273

measured to assess stability of fermentation process in digesters voβ et al 2009 voa corresponds to volatile fatty acids content and is measured as equivalent mg l acetic acid tac represents buffer

zahn wellens test procedures of oecd guideline 302 b were followed empa 1992 details of zahn wellens test procedure in this study were previously described toutian et al 2020 the zahn wellens test period in current study was limited to 7 days as this short term biodegradation can be used to mimic aerobic degradation of organic substances in activated sludge germany 1996 the supernatant of the

modelling approach based on average q and vs of a wwtp 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of was after tap to investigate effect of tap on was characteristics of was and hwas were determined as shown in fig 2 a ts of was and hwas were 6 75 and 6 67 respectively indicating no significant ts change during tap this is an advantage of tap over th since it removes necessity of pre dewatering of was to 16 before th and diluting it again afterwards to be fit for the following ad process vs ts of was and hwas were 80 28 and 79 24 respectively showing no significant loss of organics after tap fig 2b the ph of was directly after dosing of naoh was as high as 12 12 5 at extreme ph values extracellular polymeric substances eps solubilize and ionization of hydroxyl radicals leads to swelling of particulate substances neyens et al 2004 subsequently several reactions such as saponification of lipids in cell wall leads to release of intracellular organic matter neyens et al 2004 due to release of organic acids during tap through chemical and biological activities the ph drops down again in this study the applied naoh dosage caused ph of hwas to be not higher than 7 0 after tap fig 2c authors speculate that there also might be another reason for that which relates to configuration of tap in this study in fact in this pilot plant alkali is added to sludge before it is heated up to 70 c this leads to less alkali dosage needed to bring ph up to 12 0 afterwards heating sludge causes other part of organic acids to be released which bring the ph down to values lower than 7 0 but if sludge were first heated up to 70 c and then alkali were added part of alkali would be used by organic acids released by thermal effect this would not only increase the amount of naoh needed to bring ph up 12 0 but also would prevent ph of sludge to come down to 7 0 after tap since part of organic acids were already released by thermal effect accordingly process configuration of current study avoids the use of mineral acids to neutralize the ph after tap and thus saves costs on chemicals this is a very important techno economical aspect since many studies in literature have reported on neutralization required after tap in a study ruiz hernando et al 2014 estimated acid costs needed for post neutralization of alkaline pretreated was 157 g naoh kg ts to be almost half of the costs of alkali consumption the scod of was increased significantly from 2740 to 19 840 mg l after tap fig 2d this corresponded to sdcod equal to 20 3 regarding sdcod there is a wide range of values in literature demir 2018 reported 78 sdcod through tap of was conventional activated sludge process with naoh at 90 c for 25 min the same value was also reported by kim et al 2013a wang et al 2016a reached 30 50 sdcod after tap of was with naoh at 25 90 c for 1 h by increasing treatment time up to 24 h at 90 c sdcod increased to 49 57 wang et al 2016a in another study haigang et al 2016 reported only 9 15 sdcod even at higher temperatures of 105 135 c this wide range of sdcod is due to different pretreatment conditions and was characteristics authors have previously reported 20 6 41 5 sdcod after th 130 170 c of was from same wwtp as in current study which is above sdcod achieved here after tap toutian et al 2020 the po 4 3 p increased significantly from 560 to 1044 mg l which corresponded to sd po 4 3 p equal to 22 8 fig 2e the high values of po 4 3 p in was show a pre hydrolysis step between sampling time and analytical measurements since the was in this study was from an ebpr plant the increase in po 4 3 p of hwas could be attributed to two different mechanisms or a combination of them first mechanism could be thermal and chemical destruction of orthophosphate bonds of phospholipids in cell membranes the sd po 4 3 p up to 43 1 due to thermal destruction was previously reported after th of bio p was at significantly higher temperatures 130 170 c toutian et al 2020 the second mechanism could be due to biological release of po 4 3 p during tap where volatile fatty acids are available and redox potential is also in required functional range of polyphosphate accumulating organisms due to addition of naoh cheng nan et al 2001 the sporg which is soluble organic phosphorus also increased after tap from 28 to 232 mg l fig 2f the nh 4 n increased from 141 to 350 mg l after tap fig 2g this corresponded to sd nh 4 n equal to 3 9 considering usual high concentrations of nh 4 n in sludge liquor after ad this shows that most part of ammonification process still happens through microorganisms activity during ad in a previous study nh 4 n release was insignificant even after high temperatures of th 130 170 c indicating different chemical and biological reaction pathways for nh 4 n and po 4 3 p toutian et al 2020 3 2 specific biogas production and volatile solids reduction gliding sbps for digesters a and b are depicted in fig 3 a the gliding sbp of digester b was higher than in digester a a noticeable fact is that sbps of both digesters increased as temperature of activated sludge tanks of wwtpref decreased week 10 to week 37 i e october to march subsequently sbps started to decrease again as temperature of activated sludge tanks of wwtpref increased week 4 to week 10 and week 37 to week 50 i e april to september minimum gliding sbp was 248 nl kg vsadded while maximum gliding sbp raised to 464 nl kg vsadded showing 87 difference in biogas yield by ad of ps was at its lowest and highest values as a result effect of tap on sbp of was was also different in various seasons of the year as shown in fig 3a relative increase of gliding sbp varied widely from 3 minimum value during winter to 42 maximum value during summer before the maintenance period with restart of the tests after maintenance period relative increase of gliding sbp raised from 3 to 38 the average value of relative increase in gliding sbp was 20 for the whole test period this was quite in agreement with findings of hai et al 2014 who reported the same sinusoidal trend in water temperature of wwtp and methane production rate from ad of was throughout a year according to their study the difference was as high as nearly 100 with methane production rate being at its maximum during winter minimum temperature of wwtp 14 c and at its minimum during summer maximum temperature of wwtp 27 c this corresponds well with the 87 difference in current study hai et al 2014 also showed that this sinusoidal trend in temperature of water in wwtp throughout the year fitted the ratio of unbiodegradable particulates xu to total was organics xorg this ratio ranged from 40 to 65 between minimum and maximum temperatures showing more decay of was biomass in higher water temperatures this clearly implies that the significantly higher tap effect on biogas yield during summer in current study could be attributed to higher ratio of unbiodegradable organics in was which is more susceptible to destruction by pretreatment in another study wang et al 1997 have reported lower vsr of was in summer resulting in higher relative increase in bmp after thermal pretreatment at 60 100 c in their study for three hrts in ad and after thermal pretreatment at 60 c vsr relative increase decreased from 18 1 25 0 and 29 3 during summer to 11 8 16 4 and 15 6 during winter respectively sinusoidal trends in biomethane yield of microalgae and biohydrogen yield of sludge throughout a year has also been reported by adams et al 2011 and xu et al 2012 respectively griffin and wells 2017 reported that temperature is the principal factor which causes significant change of microbial community in activated sludge throughout different seasons furthermore kim et al 2013b investigated the effect of certain operational parameters on population of general and rare bacterial taxa in an activated sludge system over two years they concluded that temperature was a significant parameter for rare bacterial taxa on the other hand general bacterial taxa were affected more by influent and effluent biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen therefore microbial change of was throughout the year could be a reason for wide range of biomethane yield increase after tap or th reported in literature as a comparison to tap authors reported up to 27 increase in biomethane yield of only was after th 170 c in single batch biochemical methane tests toutian et al 2020 it was not investigated if this 27 increase changes throughout different seasons of the year and whether co digestion of ps has a synergistic positive effect on biogas yield gliding vsrs of digesters a and b are shown in fig 3b the gliding vsrs of digester b ranging from 48 2 to 60 3 with average of 52 8 were higher than those of digester a ranging from 40 4 to 56 6 with average of 48 5 relative increase of gliding vsr varied from 2 to 23 throughout whole test period characteristics of produced biogas and fermentates from two digesters are presented in table 4 co2 and ch4 contents of biogas from digesters a and b were 56 6 and 56 4 showing no effect of tap on methane content of biogas 3 3 stability of digester ph as shown in fig 4 a both digesters had same ph values 6 95 at the beginning of test period subsequently ph of both digesters increased steadily during first fourteen weeks and then fluctuated slightly at these increased levels as digesters were stabilized by feeding routine ph of digester a ranged from 6 88 to 7 54 with median value equal to 7 16 while ph of digester b was between 7 02 and 7 59 with median value equal to 7 35 fig 4b higher ph range of digester b was due to pretreatment of was with naoh resulting in presence of more hydroxyl ions oh this slight ph increase did not cause any operational problem for digester b and was regarded as no harm for anaerobic digestion performance voa voas measured as equivalent acetic acid are shown in fig 4c a slight increasing trend in voas concentration for both digesters during the test period could be seen nevertheless voas of digester a ranged from 918 to 2193 mg l with median value equal to 1401 mg l while voas of digester b were between 1056 and 2286 mg l with median value equal to 1522 mg l fig 4d this accounted for 8 6 increase in voas in digester b due to tap indicating positive effect of tap on fermentation tac tac of digesters during test period is shown in fig 4e tac of digester a ranged from 2732 to 5769 mg l with median value equal to 4021 mg l while tac of digester b was between 3646 and 7218 mg l with median value equal to 5451 mg l fig 4f therefore tap enhanced the buffer capacity of digester b by 35 6 this shows a potential for increasing organic loading rate of digester by implementing tap of was before ad since olr was in the order of 1 5 kg vs m3 d possibility of increasing olr combined with significant reduction of viscosity after tap could potentially reduce the size of digestion tanks even to half resulting in significant capital cost savings wang et al 2016b voa tac voa tac ratios of digesters a and b during test period are shown in fig 4g this ratio ranged from 0 23 to 0 50 mg l with median value equal to 0 35 for digester a while it was between 0 17 and 0 41 mg l with median value equal to 0 28 for digester b fig 4h the normal range for this parameter differs from one digester to another and is dependent of different parameters however ratios between 0 15 and 0 45 have been reported as reference values voβ et al 2009 higher ratios indicate tendency towards over acidification of digester and lower ratios indicate under loaded status of digester in both cases organic load should be adjusted in order that digester gets back to normal working condition conclusively both digesters in this study were stable throughout test period again lower ratio of digester b offers the potential of increasing organic loading rate as explained above 3 4 dewaterability of digestate cst test results of ncst tests are shown in fig 5 a ncst for both digestates increased in winter months and decreased again in spring months indicating worsening of dewaterability during winter the exacerbation of digestate dewaterability in winter is an already known problem for wwtp operators denkert and reza tehrani 2017 the digestate of digester b had a median ncst value of 22 s kg g while digester a had a median ncst value of 15 s kg g fig 5b therefore tap caused the digestate of digester b to show less capability for releasing water this could be attributed to addition of na cations in the sludge by tap which increases monovalent to divalent cation ratio in digestate of digester b leading to aggravation of dewatering higgins et al 1997 liu et al 2017 compared two tap scenarios a one stage tap 90 c ph 12 0 3 h with a four stage tap 60 90 c ph 6 0 12 0 3 6 h for dewaterability assessments in both scenarios cst increased directly after tap from below 100 s up to 1600 and 2500 s implying worsening water release capability they also showed that increase in loosely bound eps correlates well with increase in cst dogan and sanin 2009 also reported increase in cst of digested sludge pretreated with naoh ph 10 and 11 from 138 to 157 and 151 s centrifugation test fig 5c shows individual weekly results of centrifugation tests of the digestates ts of sludge cakes for digesters a and b had median values of 14 3 and 14 4 respectively fig 5d accordingly there was no significant difference between sludge cake ts of digesters a and b resulted from pretreatment insignificant improvement in ts of dewatered digestate after tap pondus was also reported in a full scale tap plant dünnebeil 2018 li et al 2013 has also reported no improvement in dewaterability after alkaline post treatment of pre digested sludge 5 of digester volume after 24 h digestion returned back to the digester on the contrary to tap authors have previously reported up to 4 increase in ts of digestate 14 3 18 6 after th 170 c toutian et al 2020 since dewaterability improvement leads to significant disposal cost savings on wwtps this should be taken into consideration when deciding between th and tap in techno economical assessments 3 5 sludge liquor load increase n h 4 n fig 6 a shows results of nh 4 n measurements during test period median nh 4 n concentrations of digesters a and b were 1338 and 1801 mg l respectively fig 6b this shows 34 6 higher nh 4 n concentration in digester b than in digester a which is attributed to higher degradation of organics resulted from tap this increase puts wwtps under extra burden of nitrogen removal in main or side stream treatment which reflects in additional costs of aeration and carbon source plus capacity shortages it also reduces the content of nutrients in dewatered sludge which lessens its value for agricultural utilization however it could be regarded as a potential positive effect of tap for new wwtp concepts with nutrients recovery units on side stream in the future p o 4 3 p results of po 4 3 p measurements during test period are shown in fig 6c po 4 3 p increased constantly in the initial thirteen weeks in sludge liquors of both digesters this was due to the fact that in the beginning both digesters were fully filled with digested sludge from the wwtpref this wwtp had a struvite precipitation unit airprex after digesters which caused significant reduction of po 4 3 p content in digestate heinzmann and engel 2006 from thirteenth week on the concentration of po 4 3 p in both digesters reached stabilized levels digester b had a median po 4 3 p concentration of 594 mg l while digester a had a median po 4 3 p concentration of 695 mg l fig 6d this 17 0 increase in po 4 3 p concentration is due to higher degradation of organics in digester b again this increase causes extra chemical costs for phosphorus removal plus potential capacity lack for wwtps and reduction of nutritional value of dewatered sludge for agricultural utilization however with increasing demands on phosphorus recovery as a vital non renewable resource this increase could lead to enhancing the recovery potential of renewable fertilizers such as struvite on wwtps s o 4 2 sulphate measurement results are shown in fig 6e sulphate concentration for both digesters increased constantly to the end of the test this may be attributed to a slight activity shift of sulphate reducing bacteria towards methanogenic bacteria throughout the test period nevertheless sludge liquor of digester b had 21 6 higher sulphate concentration than digester a due to higher degradation of organics in digester b when considering the whole test period fig 6f 3 6 refractory soluble cod of sludge liquor results of zahn wellens tests of liquors from digesters a and b are depicted in fig 7 fig 7a shows the scod elimination degrees during 7 day zahn wellens test period reference substance ethylene glycol was degraded more than 99 in less than 7 days this demonstrated the validity of the zahn wellens tests empa 1992 the average elimination degrees for digesters a and b after 7 days were 25 8 and 30 2 respectively this higher elimination degree of digester b could be attributed to an increase of aerobically biodegradable organics after implementing tap for predicting the increase in effluent cod of a wwtp after implementing tap the absolute residual scod concentrations should be used in conversion factor scod of liquors from digester a decreased from 400 to 299 mg l while scod of liquors from digester b decreased from 612 to 429 mg l average value out of three successive weeks fig 7b conclusively tap resulted in 30 3 increase in scodref this indicated that in spite of higher scod elimination degree from sludge liquors of digester b the scodref after aerobic treatment is still higher than that of digester a with lower elimination degree it should be noted that aerobic inoculum in batch zahn wellens tests were not adapted to liquors after ad hence long term biodegradation of sludge liquor could be better than batch wise aeration tests moreover results of this section may not be representative of the whole year as they were performed for three weeks nonetheless return load of refractory organic carbonaceous matter increased after implementing tap how much this scodref contributes to increase in effluent scod of a wwtp is presented and discussed in section 3 7 3 7 effluent soluble cod increase of wwtp to predict the effect of tap implementation on effluent scod increase of a wwtp real data from six wwtps in berlin were used these data and modelling results of effluent scod increase after tap implementation are presented in table 5 tap of was before ad is predicted to result in 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent scod of these wwtps a higher ps was production per inflow volume unit leads to a higher increase in effluent scod after tap implementation in a previous study authors predicted 2 15 mg l effluent scod increase for these six wwtps after implementing th 130 170 c toutian et al 2020 therefore tap has a less potential adverse impact on effluent scod than th this is an important deciding factor for wwtps which their effluent cod is not far below the regulated limits before implementation of pretreatments to the best of the authors knowledge there is no distinctive literature available regarding increase of effluent scod after implementation of tap for a comparison to results of this study according to the technical report of german association of water and wastewater on sewage sludge disintegration even thermal pretreatment of sludge at 70 c could lead to measurable scodref formation dwa 2016 however it suggests that this amount of scodref would be roughly 50 of that of high temperature pretreatment processes such as thermal hydrolysis i e below 2 5 mg l or 5 of effluent load this is very well in accordance with the results of the current study 4 conclusions thermal alkaline pretreatment of was was carried out in pilot scale over one year the following conclusions were drawn biogas yield of mixed sludge ps was showed a sinusoidal trend throughout seasons of a year showing up to 87 variation between winter highest and summer lowest tap led to higher biogas yield increase in summer 42 and a lower increase in winter 3 with an average value of 20 for the whole year strong seasonal variations of was composition could be a reason for a wide range of increase in biogas yield due to tap or th reported in literature digester showed long term stability with tap during one year of operation and potential for increase in organic loading rate dewaterability of digestate showed no increase in ts of sludge cake by tap in contrast to positive effects on dewaterability reported for th nh 4 n and po 4 3 p in sludge liquor increased by 34 6 and 17 0 indicating increase in return load and related treatment costs modelling results predicted 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent refractory scod of six wwtps in berlin after implementing tap which is lower than previously reported for th in summary tap of sludge showed potential in reducing disposal costs through reduction of volatile solids with a slight impact on the effluent cod of wwtp declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17814,thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activate sludge was was carried out in pilot scale over a year to investigate its seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and its impact on dewaterability sludge liquor quality and formation of soluble refractory cod scodref temperature of tap was set at 65 70 c and ph was increased by initial dosing of sodium hydroxide naoh 50 w w 1 2 5 ml l sludge as alkali agent following 2 2 5 h reaction time pilot digesters were fed with primary sludge ps and hydrolyzed was hwas and compared to a reference digester fed with ps and untreated was biogas yield increase due to tap of was showed a sinusoidal trend throughout the year with maximum in summer 42 minimum in winter 3 and average of 20 indicating a strong seasonal effect on tap efficiency ammonium nh 4 n orthophosphate po 4 3 p and sulphate so 4 2 in sludge liquor increased by 34 6 17 0 and 21 6 with tap respectively centrifugation tests showed no significant difference in dewaterability of both digestates with respect to total solids of sludge cake normalized capillary suction time of digestate increased due to tap indicating a lower capability for water release furthermore detected scodref after batch aerobic biodegradation tests showed an increase of 30 3 with tap hence implementation of tap of was in full scale will potentially lead to an increase of 0 8 1 1 mg l of scodref in effluent of six wastewater treatment plants wwtp in berlin in conclusion tap of was leads to increase in biogas production with a slighter negative impact on effluent cod quality than high temperature thermal hydrolysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords thermal alkaline pretreatment biogas yield dewatering return load zahn wellens test effluent cod 1 introduction activated sludge process is the most widely used treatment process on wwtps throughout the world waste activated sludge was as the unfavorable byproduct of this process puts wwtps under significant financial burden for its disposal appels et al 2008 therefore it is economically beneficial to reduce was amounts as much as possible anaerobic digestion ad as a well established process leads to reduction of organic matter of was while producing biogas as a renewable energy source however biodegradability of was in ad is relatively low 35 40 removal of volatile solids vs due to its complex microbial structure dwa 2014 besides was shows a low dewatering potential after ad dwa 2008 accordingly different pretreatment techniques have been investigated in order to enhance biodegradation and dewaterability of was carrere et al 2010 2016 neumann et al 2016 biogas produced in ad is often utilized on site in a combined heat and power chp plant to maximize energy recovery produced electrical energy can be used directly at the wwtp or be injected to the grid on the other hand produced thermal energy cannot be stored efficiently and thus must be used instantly most often for digester heating and auxiliary heat demand of the plant e g buildings hot water for modern wwtps with efficient digestion and chp heat production from chp exceeds actual heat demand at the wwtp leaving excess heat from the cooling cycle and exhaust gas that is wasted to the atmosphere by exploiting this readily available heat on site thermal pretreatment techniques have been more attractive to wwtp operators than alternative processes which operate only on electrical energy this is also reflected in the growing number of full scale installations of thermal pretreatment processes worldwide barber 2016 thermal hydrolysis th and low temperature thermal alkaline pretreatment tap are two pretreatment techniques which exploit thermal energy produced in a chp th 130 170 c with specific thermal energy demand of 130 190 kwh m3 is more energy intensive than tap 60 70 c with 40 50 kwh m3 dwa 2016 moreover tap could use even low temperature waste heat from a chp cooling cycle due to lower operating temperatures consequently operation of steam generators as in th with associated operational risks is omitted on the other hand tap needs a constant supply of alkali agent to compensate for lower temperatures to boost its effect hence it is of high interest to know for wwtp operators how tap acts as a competitive alternative to th on all relevant aspects of was pretreatment before ad along with benefits of th and tap in sludge handling there comes also drawback of increase in solubilized organic carbon nitrogen phosphorus and inorganic orthophosphate po 4 3 p ammonium nh 4 n fraction of sludge liquor after ad beside additional costs of treating this increased return load it could also lead to impairment of effluent quality of wwtp e g in terms of increase in effluent cod through soluble refractory cod scodref toutian et al 2020 with strict local and national regulations on effluent quality parameters including cod this is an important deciding factor before implementing pretreatment processes ec 1991 germany 1996 regarding tap effects of alkali agent and dosage treatment time and temperature on disintegration of was has already been investigated extensively in batch mode lab scale studies campo et al 2018 kim et al 2013a shehu et al 2012 vigueras carmona et al 2011 therefore change of tap operational parameters was not subject of current study instead other tap knowledge gaps in literature were addressed these studies mainly focus on one or two aspects such as cod solubilization degree biogas yield or dewaterability and do not consider tap effects on the whole process chain of sludge treatment moreover biochemical methane potential results from batch tests are subject to inoculums which are not adapted to pretreated was and may not be fully representative of continuous ad operation besides since was is normally mixed with primary sludge ps before ad on wwtps it is also important to investigate this potential synergistic effect on biogas and dewaterability instead of was or pretreated was alone furthermore whether long term tap poses a potential adverse impact on stability of ad has not been investigated yet finally due to seasonal changes of influent properties of a wwtp and subsequent varying operational parameters characteristics of was also alters resulting in different seasonal outcomes in biogas yield and dewatering potential denkert and reza tehrani 2017 hai et al 2014 this necessitates yearlong continuous pilot trials mimicking real conditions on wwtps for more rigorous conclusions on the effects of tap consequently the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of tap of was on characteristics change of was ph scod po 4 3 p nh 4 n etc seasonal biogas yield increase throughout one operational year long term stability of digester dewaterability of digestate return load increase of sludge liquor and scodref after aerobic biodegradation of sludge liquor to estimate the impact of tap implementation on wwtp effluent quality a conversion factor was defined to correlate formation of scodref to the amount of pretreated vs in was using this factor the effect of tap on effluent cod increase of six wwtps in berlin was predicted through modelling whenever possible results of this tap study were compared with authors previous study on th toutian et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge thickened was was taken from a large municipal wwtp in berlin operated with pre denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr this wwtp is referred to as reference wwtp wwtpref in this study was is thickened with centrifuges after polymer dosing 0 7 kg active substance per kg total solids ts ps was taken from the primary settling tanks activated sludge as inoculum for zahn wellens test was collected from the return activated sludge pipeline inoculum for anaerobic digesters was digestate taken from digestion tanks on wwtpref the characteristics of was and ps are summarized in table 1 the high concentrations of scod nh 4 n and po 4 3 p are due to a certain degree of pre hydrolysis between sampling and analysis time one to two days as explained in fig s1 of supplementary material 2 2 pilot scale thermal alkaline pretreatment tap was carried out batch wise in a pilot plant pondus verfahrenstechnik gmbh germany on site at the wwtpref during one day of the week in a 24 h continuous operation trials took place in time period of july 2018 june 2019 for one year week 1 to week 52 operational optimization and maintenance were carried out between week 26 to week 33 the process flow diagram of the tap pilot plant is shown in fig 1 a see fig s2 for a photo of pilot plant the operational parameters were suggested by process supplier pondus and are summarized in table 2 thickened was was first sieved through a stainless steel sieve with mesh size of 5 mm fig s3 to protect the influent pump against potential coarse material then was was mixed with alkali dosed at 1 2 5 ml sodium hydroxide naoh 50 w w l of was subsequently was was pumped through a spiral coil heat exchanger placed in a water bath which was heated up to 65 70 c by an electrical heating element after being heated was entered the reactor vessel through a nozzle applying 2 2 5 h hydraulic retention time hrt for the reaction afterwards was flowed into the second spiral coil heat exchanger which was intended to cool down the hydrolyzed was hwas after pretreatment cooling water of the wwtpref was used to continuously cool the hwas down to 22 24 c in the end hwas was collected in a 1 m3 container to be transported for ad in each tap run around 500 l was was hydrolyzed 2 3 transportation and storage of sludge as no parallel pilot digesters were available at the wwtpref ad was operated at another site dbi institute freiberg consequently weekly transport of freshly taken was ps and hwas was required by truck 3 h drive the sludges were then transferred to 3 containers each with 1 m3 volume each container was equipped with a mechanical stirrer to avoid settling an ambient air cooling system was used to minimize the inherent autolysis of sludge during one week storage time samples of digested sludge from two digesters were sent back weekly to berlin for further analyses 2 4 anaerobic digestion the specifications of anaerobic digesters are listed in table 3 and configuration of digesters and feedstock containers are depicted in fig 1b see fig s4 for a photo of digesters operational parameters similar to those of the digesters on the wwtpref were maintained accordingly mesophilic digestion at 37 c with 20 days hrt was implemented digester a was fed daily with ps and was and served as a reference digester b was fed with ps and hwas after tap the mixing ratio between ps and was or hwas for both digesters was 1 1 volume basis organic loading rate was comparable for both digesters 1 5 kg vs m3 d each digester was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and online measurement systems of biogas volume flow rate composition temperature and pressure data of biogas production were normalized to the standard temperature and pressure conditions 273 15 k 101 33 kpa vdi 2016 temperature ph redox potential and conductivity in fermentate were also monitored online in the beginning digesters were each fully inoculated with anaerobically digested sludge from digesters of the wwtpref to boost the initiation phase of biogas production 2 5 stability of digester ph volatile organic acids voa and total alkalinity of carbonate tac of fermentate were measured to assess stability of fermentation process in digesters voβ et al 2009 voa corresponds to volatile fatty acids content and is measured as equivalent mg l acetic acid tac represents buffer capacity and is measured as equivalent mg l calcium carbonate caco3 2 6 dewaterability test capillary suction time cst tests this test is typically used to determine the optimum polymer type and dosage in sludge dewatering units moreover it does not give direct information regarding final achievable ts of dewatered sludge in full scale dewatering units dwa 2008 nonetheless it could still be used as a comparison parameter of water release capability cst was measured using a cst meter type 304b triton electronics for each measurement circa 5 ml of sample was poured into the respective cylinder diameter 1 5 cm height 3 cm paper filter used was of type filtrak fn8 280 g m2 and size of 70 90 mm hego biotec gmbh before measurements paper filters were dried for 30 min in oven at 105 c and used after being cooled down to ambient temperature in desiccator to obtain normalized cst ncst cst value of each sample was divided by its respective ts apha and wpcf 1998 dwa 2008 centrifugation tests weekly samples of digestate were centrifuged at 25 000 g for 30 min avanti j e beckman coulter the sludge cakes were separated and used for determination of ts according to standard methods apha and wpcf 1998 dwa 2008 for the samples with polymer addition the digestate was dosed with 12 g polymer as active substance 0 5 w w solution polychemie gmbh per kg ts of sludge and mixed for 20 s at 600 rpm before centrifugation test using a mechanical stirrer hei torque value 100 heidolph gmbh the polymer used and the dosage were the same as in the dewatering unit of the wwtpref this test was performed over a period of 8 weeks weeks 41 48 2 7 zahn wellens test zahn wellens test was used as a batch simulation of activated sludge process on a wwtp to remove organic carbonaceous matter for zahn wellens test procedures of oecd guideline 302 b were followed empa 1992 details of zahn wellens test procedure in this study were previously described toutian et al 2020 the zahn wellens test period in current study was limited to 7 days as this short term biodegradation can be used to mimic aerobic degradation of organic substances in activated sludge germany 1996 the supernatant of the centrifugation test described in section 2 6 was taken as test substance tests were run in duplicate and biodegradation was monitored by scod measurement tests were carried out three times with samples from three successive weeks weeks 44 46 2 8 analytics ts and vs were measured according to standard methods apha and wpcf 1998 the ph was measured using a hach lange multimeter hq40d model intellical probes total cod tcod total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were determined after proper dilution of the sample by photometric measurements using test cuvettes hach lange dr 5000 to

phosphorus po 4 3 p was measured and deduced from measured soluble total phosphorus stp voa and tac were measured using method by nordmann 1977 sulphate so 4 2 was measured through the method suggested by sheen et al 1935 2 9 calculation methods 2 9 1 solubilization degrees to quantify the effect of tap on release of cod nh 4 n and po 4 3 p solubilization degrees sd after tap and before ad

scod in blank after 3 h final remaining scod after zahn wellens tests of sludge liquors of digesters were defined as scodref 2 9 4 conversion factor to predict refractory soluble cod scodref was used to model effluent scod increase of wwtp after implementing tap to do this a conversion factor cf was defined as following for each digester 6 c f s c o d r e f v v s i n 20 d 10 6 100 cf conversion factor of digester scodref mg l refractory scod concentration of digester v l volume of digester vs in 20d kg sum of volatile solids fed to digester during 20 days hrt before taking samples for zahn wellens test in fact cf shows how much scodref is produced per unit of vs fed to each digester 2 9 5 modelling effluent soluble cod increase of a wwtp cf relates the scodref to the volatile solids fed to the digesters therefore cf daily ps was production and daily flow rate of a wwtp could be used to predict the increase in effluent cod of a wwtp as following 7 s c o d e f f i n c c f 100 v s p s w

modelling approach based on average q and vs of a wwtp 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of was after tap to investigate effect of tap on was characteristics of was and hwas were determined as shown in fig 2 a ts of was and hwas were 6 75 and 6 67 respectively indicating no significant ts change during tap this is an advantage of tap over th since it removes necessity of pre dewatering of was to 16 before th and diluting it again afterwards to be fit for the following ad process vs ts of was and hwas were 80 28 and 79 24 respectively showing no significant loss of organics after tap fig 2b the ph of was directly after dosing of naoh was as high as 12 12 5 at extreme ph values extracellular polymeric substances eps solubilize and ionization of hydroxyl radicals leads to swelling of particulate substances neyens et al 2004 subsequently several reactions such as saponification of lipids in cell wall leads to release of intracellular organic matter neyens et al 2004 due to release of organic acids during tap through chemical and biological activities the ph drops down again in this study the applied naoh dosage caused ph of hwas to be not higher than 7 0 after tap fig 2c authors speculate that there also might be another reason for that which relates to configuration of tap in this study in fact in this pilot plant alkali is added to sludge before it is heated up to 70 c this leads to less alkali dosage needed to bring ph up to 12 0 afterwards heating sludge causes other part of organic acids to be released which bring the ph down to values lower than 7 0 but if sludge were first heated up to 70 c and then alkali were added part of alkali would be used by organic acids released by thermal effect this would not only increase the amount of naoh needed to bring ph up 12 0 but also would prevent ph of sludge to come down to 7 0 after tap since part of organic acids were already released by thermal effect accordingly process configuration of current study avoids the use of mineral acids to neutralize the ph after tap and thus saves costs on chemicals this is a very important techno economical aspect since many studies in literature have reported on neutralization required after tap in a study ruiz hernando et al 2014 estimated acid costs needed for post neutralization of alkaline pretreated was 157 g naoh kg ts to be almost half of the costs of alkali consumption the scod of was increased significantly from 2740 to 19 840 mg l after tap fig 2d this corresponded to sdcod equal to 20 3 regarding sdcod there is a wide range of values in literature demir 2018 reported 78 sdcod through tap of was conventional activated sludge process with naoh at 90 c for 25 min the same value was also reported by kim et al 2013a wang et al 2016a reached 30 50 sdcod after tap of was with naoh at 25 90 c for 1 h by increasing treatment time up to 24 h at 90 c sdcod increased to 49 57 wang et al 2016a in another study haigang et al 2016 reported only 9 15 sdcod even at higher temperatures of 105 135 c this wide range of sdcod is due to different pretreatment conditions and was characteristics authors have previously reported 20 6 41 5 sdcod after th 130 170 c of was from same wwtp as in current study which is above sdcod achieved here after tap toutian et al 2020 the po 4 3 p increased significantly from 560 to 1044 mg l which corresponded to sd po 4 3 p equal to 22 8 fig 2e the high values of po 4 3 p in was show a pre hydrolysis step between sampling time and analytical measurements since the was in this study was from an ebpr plant the increase in po 4 3 p of hwas could be attributed to two different mechanisms or a combination of them first mechanism could be thermal and chemical destruction of orthophosphate bonds of phospholipids in cell membranes the sd po 4 3 p up to 43 1 due to thermal destruction was previously reported after th of bio p was at significantly higher temperatures 130 170 c toutian et al 2020 the second mechanism could be due to biological release of po 4 3 p during tap where volatile fatty acids are available and redox potential is also in required functional range of polyphosphate accumulating organisms due to addition of naoh cheng nan et al 2001 the sporg which is soluble organic phosphorus also increased after tap from 28 to 232 mg l fig 2f the nh 4 n increased from 141 to 350 mg l after tap fig 2g this corresponded to sd nh 4 n equal to 3 9 considering usual high concentrations of nh 4 n in sludge liquor after ad this shows that most part of ammonification process still happens through microorganisms activity during ad in a previous study nh 4 n release was insignificant even after high temperatures of th 130 170 c indicating different chemical and biological reaction pathways for nh 4 n and po 4 3 p toutian et al 2020 3 2 specific biogas production and volatile solids reduction gliding sbps for digesters a and b are depicted in fig 3 a the gliding sbp of digester b was higher than in digester a a noticeable fact is that sbps of both digesters increased as temperature of activated sludge tanks of wwtpref decreased week 10 to week 37 i e october to march subsequently sbps started to decrease again as temperature of activated sludge tanks of wwtpref increased week 4 to week 10 and week 37 to week 50 i e april to september minimum gliding sbp was 248 nl kg vsadded while maximum gliding sbp raised to 464 nl kg vsadded showing 87 difference in biogas yield by ad of ps was at its lowest and highest values as a result effect of tap on sbp of was was also different in various seasons of the year as shown in fig 3a relative increase of gliding sbp varied widely from 3 minimum value during winter to 42 maximum value during summer before the maintenance period with restart of the tests after maintenance period relative increase of gliding sbp raised from 3 to 38 the average value of relative increase in gliding sbp was 20 for the whole test period this was quite in agreement with findings of hai et al 2014 who reported the same sinusoidal trend in water temperature of wwtp and methane production rate from ad of was throughout a year according to their study the difference was as high as nearly 100 with methane production rate being at its maximum during winter minimum temperature of wwtp 14 c and at its minimum during summer maximum temperature of wwtp 27 c this corresponds well with the 87 difference in current study hai et al 2014 also showed that this sinusoidal trend in temperature of water in wwtp throughout the year fitted the ratio of unbiodegradable particulates xu to total was organics xorg this ratio ranged from 40 to 65 between minimum and maximum temperatures showing more decay of was biomass in higher water temperatures this clearly implies that the significantly higher tap effect on biogas yield during summer in current study could be attributed to higher ratio of unbiodegradable organics in was which is more susceptible to destruction by pretreatment in another study wang et al 1997 have reported lower vsr of was in summer resulting in higher relative increase in bmp after thermal pretreatment at 60 100 c in their study for three hrts in ad and after thermal pretreatment at 60 c vsr relative increase decreased from 18 1 25 0 and 29 3 during summer to 11 8 16 4 and 15 6 during winter respectively sinusoidal trends in biomethane yield of microalgae and biohydrogen yield of sludge throughout a year has also been reported by adams et al 2011 and xu et al 2012 respectively griffin and wells 2017 reported that temperature is the principal factor which causes significant change of microbial community in activated sludge throughout different seasons furthermore kim et al 2013b investigated the effect of certain operational parameters on population of general and rare bacterial taxa in an activated sludge system over two years they concluded that temperature was a significant parameter for rare bacterial taxa on the other hand general bacterial taxa were affected more by influent and effluent biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen therefore microbial change of was throughout the year could be a reason for wide range of biomethane yield increase after tap or th reported in literature as a comparison to tap authors reported up to 27 increase in biomethane yield of only was after th 170 c in single batch biochemical methane tests toutian et al 2020 it was not investigated if this 27 increase changes throughout different seasons of the year and whether co digestion of ps has a synergistic positive effect on biogas yield gliding vsrs of digesters a and b are shown in fig 3b the gliding vsrs of digester b ranging from 48 2 to 60 3 with average of 52 8 were higher than those of digester a ranging from 40 4 to 56 6 with average of 48 5 relative increase of gliding vsr varied from 2 to 23 throughout whole test period characteristics of produced biogas and fermentates from two digesters are presented in table 4 co2 and ch4 contents of biogas from digesters a and b were 56 6 and 56 4 showing no effect of tap on methane content of biogas 3 3 stability of digester ph as shown in fig 4 a both digesters had same ph values 6 95 at the beginning of test period subsequently ph of both digesters increased steadily during first fourteen weeks and then fluctuated slightly at these increased levels as digesters were stabilized by feeding routine ph of digester a ranged from 6 88 to 7 54 with median value equal to 7 16 while ph of digester b was between 7 02 and 7 59 with median value equal to 7 35 fig 4b higher ph range of digester b was due to pretreatment of was with naoh resulting in presence of more hydroxyl ions oh this slight ph increase did not cause any operational problem for digester b and was regarded as no harm for anaerobic digestion performance voa voas measured as equivalent acetic acid are shown in fig 4c a slight increasing trend in voas concentration for both digesters during the test period could be seen nevertheless voas of digester a ranged from 918 to 2193 mg l with median value equal to 1401 mg l while voas of digester b were between 1056 and 2286 mg l with median value equal to 1522 mg l fig 4d this accounted for 8 6 increase in voas in digester b due to tap indicating positive effect of tap on fermentation tac tac of digesters during test period is shown in fig 4e tac of digester a ranged from 2732 to 5769 mg l with median value equal to 4021 mg l while tac of digester b was between 3646 and 7218 mg l with median value equal to 5451 mg l fig 4f therefore tap enhanced the buffer capacity of digester b by 35 6 this shows a potential for increasing organic loading rate of digester by implementing tap of was before ad since olr was in the order of 1 5 kg vs m3 d possibility of increasing olr combined with significant reduction of viscosity after tap could potentially reduce the size of digestion tanks even to half resulting in significant capital cost savings wang et al 2016b voa tac voa tac ratios of digesters a and b during test period are shown in fig 4g this ratio ranged from 0 23 to 0 50 mg l with median value equal to 0 35 for digester a while it was between 0 17 and 0 41 mg l with median value equal to 0 28 for digester b fig 4h the normal range for this parameter differs from one digester to another and is dependent of different parameters however ratios between 0 15 and 0 45 have been reported as reference values voβ et al 2009 higher ratios indicate tendency towards over acidification of digester and lower ratios indicate under loaded status of digester in both cases organic load should be adjusted in order that digester gets back to normal working condition conclusively both digesters in this study were stable throughout test period again lower ratio of digester b offers the potential of increasing organic loading rate as explained above 3 4 dewaterability of digestate cst test results of ncst tests are shown in fig 5 a ncst for both digestates increased in winter months and decreased again in spring months indicating worsening of dewaterability during winter the exacerbation of digestate dewaterability in winter is an already known problem for wwtp operators denkert and reza tehrani 2017 the digestate of digester b had a median ncst value of 22 s kg g while digester a had a median ncst value of 15 s kg g fig 5b therefore tap caused the digestate of digester b to show less capability for releasing water this could be attributed to addition of na cations in the sludge by tap which increases monovalent to divalent cation ratio in digestate of digester b leading to aggravation of dewatering higgins et al 1997 liu et al 2017 compared two tap scenarios a one stage tap 90 c ph 12 0 3 h with a four stage tap 60 90 c ph 6 0 12 0 3 6 h for dewaterability assessments in both scenarios cst increased directly after tap from below 100 s up to 1600 and 2500 s implying worsening water release capability they also showed that increase in loosely bound eps correlates well with increase in cst dogan and sanin 2009 also reported increase in cst of digested sludge pretreated with naoh ph 10 and 11 from 138 to 157 and 151 s centrifugation test fig 5c shows individual weekly results of centrifugation tests of the digestates ts of sludge cakes for digesters a and b had median values of 14 3 and 14 4 respectively fig 5d accordingly there was no significant difference between sludge cake ts of digesters a and b resulted from pretreatment insignificant improvement in ts of dewatered digestate after tap pondus was also reported in a full scale tap plant dünnebeil 2018 li et al 2013 has also reported no improvement in dewaterability after alkaline post treatment of pre digested sludge 5 of digester volume after 24 h digestion returned back to the digester on the contrary to tap authors have previously reported up to 4 increase in ts of digestate 14 3 18 6 after th 170 c toutian et al 2020 since dewaterability improvement leads to significant disposal cost savings on wwtps this should be taken into consideration when deciding between th and tap in techno economical assessments 3 5 sludge liquor load increase n h 4 n fig 6 a shows results of nh 4 n measurements during test period median nh 4 n concentrations of digesters a and b were 1338 and 1801 mg l respectively fig 6b this shows 34 6 higher nh 4 n concentration in digester b than in digester a which is attributed to higher degradation of organics resulted from tap this increase puts wwtps under extra burden of nitrogen removal in main or side stream treatment which reflects in additional costs of aeration and carbon source plus capacity shortages it also reduces the content of nutrients in dewatered sludge which lessens its value for agricultural utilization however it could be regarded as a potential positive effect of tap for new wwtp concepts with nutrients recovery units on side stream in the future p o 4 3 p results of po 4 3 p measurements during test period are shown in fig 6c po 4 3 p increased constantly in the initial thirteen weeks in sludge liquors of both digesters this was due to the fact that in the beginning both digesters were fully filled with digested sludge from the wwtpref this wwtp had a struvite precipitation unit airprex after digesters which caused significant reduction of po 4 3 p content in digestate heinzmann and engel 2006 from thirteenth week on the concentration of po 4 3 p in both digesters reached stabilized levels digester b had a median po 4 3 p concentration of 594 mg l while digester a had a median po 4 3 p concentration of 695 mg l fig 6d this 17 0 increase in po 4 3 p concentration is due to higher degradation of organics in digester b again this increase causes extra chemical costs for phosphorus removal plus potential capacity lack for wwtps and reduction of nutritional value of dewatered sludge for agricultural utilization however with increasing demands on phosphorus recovery as a vital non renewable resource this increase could lead to enhancing the recovery potential of renewable fertilizers such as struvite on wwtps s o 4 2 sulphate measurement results are shown in fig 6e sulphate concentration for both digesters increased constantly to the end of the test this may be attributed to a slight activity shift of sulphate reducing bacteria towards methanogenic bacteria throughout the test period nevertheless sludge liquor of digester b had 21 6 higher sulphate concentration than digester a due to higher degradation of organics in digester b when considering the whole test period fig 6f 3 6 refractory soluble cod of sludge liquor results of zahn wellens tests of liquors from digesters a and b are depicted in fig 7 fig 7a shows the scod elimination degrees during 7 day zahn wellens test period reference substance ethylene glycol was degraded more than 99 in less than 7 days this demonstrated the validity of the zahn wellens tests empa 1992 the average elimination degrees for digesters a and b after 7 days were 25 8 and 30 2 respectively this higher elimination degree of digester b could be attributed to an increase of aerobically biodegradable organics after implementing tap for predicting the increase in effluent cod of a wwtp after implementing tap the absolute residual scod concentrations should be used in conversion factor scod of liquors from digester a decreased from 400 to 299 mg l while scod of liquors from digester b decreased from 612 to 429 mg l average value out of three successive weeks fig 7b conclusively tap resulted in 30 3 increase in scodref this indicated that in spite of higher scod elimination degree from sludge liquors of digester b the scodref after aerobic treatment is still higher than that of digester a with lower elimination degree it should be noted that aerobic inoculum in batch zahn wellens tests were not adapted to liquors after ad hence long term biodegradation of sludge liquor could be better than batch wise aeration tests moreover results of this section may not be representative of the whole year as they were performed for three weeks nonetheless return load of refractory organic carbonaceous matter increased after implementing tap how much this scodref contributes to increase in effluent scod of a wwtp is presented and discussed in section 3 7 3 7 effluent soluble cod increase of wwtp to predict the effect of tap implementation on effluent scod increase of a wwtp real data from six wwtps in berlin were used these data and modelling results of effluent scod increase after tap implementation are presented in table 5 tap of was before ad is predicted to result in 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent scod of these wwtps a higher ps was production per inflow volume unit leads to a higher increase in effluent scod after tap implementation in a previous study authors predicted 2 15 mg l effluent scod increase for these six wwtps after implementing th 130 170 c toutian et al 2020 therefore tap has a less potential adverse impact on effluent scod than th this is an important deciding factor for wwtps which their effluent cod is not far below the regulated limits before implementation of pretreatments to the best of the authors knowledge there is no distinctive literature available regarding increase of effluent scod after implementation of tap for a comparison to results of this study according to the technical report of german association of water and wastewater on sewage sludge disintegration even thermal pretreatment of sludge at 70 c could lead to measurable scodref formation dwa 2016 however it suggests that this amount of scodref would be roughly 50 of that of high temperature pretreatment processes such as thermal hydrolysis i e below 2 5 mg l or 5 of effluent load this is very well in accordance with the results of the current study 4 conclusions thermal alkaline pretreatment of was was carried out in pilot scale over one year the following conclusions were drawn biogas yield of mixed sludge ps was showed a sinusoidal trend throughout seasons of a year showing up to 87 variation between winter highest and summer lowest tap led to higher biogas yield increase in summer 42 and a lower increase in winter 3 with an average value of 20 for the whole year strong seasonal variations of was composition could be a reason for a wide range of increase in biogas yield due to tap or th reported in literature digester showed long term stability with tap during one year of operation and potential for increase in organic loading rate dewaterability of digestate showed no increase in ts of sludge cake by tap in contrast to positive effects on dewaterability reported for th nh 4 n and po 4 3 p in sludge liquor increased by 34 6 and 17 0 indicating increase in return load and related treatment costs modelling results predicted 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent refractory scod of six wwtps in berlin after implementing tap which is lower than previously reported for th in summary tap of sludge showed potential in reducing disposal costs through reduction of volatile solids with a slight impact on the effluent cod of wwtp declaration of competing interest the authors declare
