9620,sustainable intensification si of agriculture combines the dual goals of increasing productivity while staying within safe limits of resource use in practice how can thresholds which operate at resource scale guide intensification driven by social economic and biophysical factors at the farm scale in this paper we present the case of agricultural intensification in the shallow hard rock aquifer region of western india to illustrate how cross scale feedback effects are crucial determinants of not only the resource sustainability and farm productivity but also of social dimensions of si such as equity and justice supported by private investment in plastic lined farm ponds the increasing shift to horticulture in the study area raises questions about the sustainability of the practice we use a socio hydrological lens and develop a system dynamics model to analyze how the growing technology mediated intensification may lead to si we find that from a static farm level view the plastic lined farm pond is beneficial in shielding farmers from droughts and in enhancing productivity however when within and across scale socio hydrological dynamics are considered the practice is found to instead aggravate the drought impact on the community this happens when intensification level accelerates driven by aspiration and vulnerability induced feedbacks resulting in groundwater demand exceeding the system threshold in practice si is complicated by the fact that this threshold for safe groundwater use is dynamic in drought years the carrying capacity falls significantly so that even a low level of intensification may tip the system resulting in a tragedy of the commons therefore achieving si requires seasonally agile intensification which retains the adaptive capacity of farmers instead of locking them into fixed annual irrigation requirement in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment we thus conclude that the recognition and translation of resource level thresholds to an actionable level is key to practicing si keywords sustainable intensification farm pond socio hydrology resource threshold system dynamics india 1 introduction sustainable intensification si of agriculture is a paradigm that integrates the twin goals of increasing agricultural productivity to achieve food security and staying within the safe limits of resource boundaries pretty and bharucha 2014 rockström et al 2017 while the notion of thresholds which indicates the safe limit for operation works at different resource scales steffen et al 2015 agricultural intensification decisions are generally taken by farmers at the farm scale in response to various biophysical social and economic drivers it is therefore of interest to analyze the dynamic interplay across scales häyhä et al 2016 between farm level actions and resource level behaviour and understand how in practice the safe operating limit at the resource scale may guide the process of intensification while ensuring sustainable and equitable resource use water is one of the key resources that directly impacts agricultural productivity sustainable agricultural water management is therefore core to si studies in si have a wide canvas and a large number of them focus on good farming practices that can produce high yield crops while maintaining or enhancing environmental sustainability dile et al 2015 pretty et al 2018 weltin et al 2018 examples include the use of precision agriculture kumar et al 2018 pretty et al 2018 integrated crop water and nutrient management to close yield gaps jägermeyr et al 2016 mueller et al 2012 rainwater harvesting and practices to increase water use efficiency jägermeyr et al 2016 and choice of crop varieties with resistance to water stress weltin et al 2018 a review of research on si häyhä et al 2016 shows that farm is the dominant scale at which practices are investigated while research on societal and regional interactions are under represented there are a few studies which link farm level practices with regional resource thresholds wilbanks and kates 1999 for example dearing et al 2014 evaluate the impact of agricultural intensification at a local scale in china with respect to regional environmental and social thresholds using a time series analysis there are calls by researchers macdonald et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 rockström and karlberg 2010 thomson et al 2019 wilbanks and kates 1999 for innovative studies on cross scale feedback interactions with due consideration of regional and situational context in this paper our objective is to illustrate that cross scale feedback effects are crucial determinants of not only the resource sustainability and farm productivity but also of social dimensions of si such as equity and justice in resource use helfenstein et al 2020 while field level assessments may find certain practices to be efficient and sustainable the analysis of feedbacks between human and water systems in time and space may result in contradictory findings an example of this is the use of micro irrigation for increased water use efficiency a good farm practice contributing to si jägermeyr et al 2016 which when analyzed through a coupled human water lens is shown to contribute in many situations to overexploitation of resources due to the jevon s paradox sears et al 2018 in our study we report a similar phenomenon uncovered through the analysis of the coupling of farm level intensification practice with resource level behaviour using a socio hydrological approach sivapalan et al 2014 our case study focuses on the ongoing intensification in the largely groundwater dependent semi arid regions of western india where intensification is mediated by private investments in a relatively new irrigation technology the plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm ponds these farm ponds are filled with abstracted groundwater in the wet season so as to assure irrigation in the dry season when groundwater is scarce kale 2017 the irrigation technology is promoted by the government as income enhancing and drought proofing technology goap 2016 in regions that experience long dry spells and frequent droughts and encourages farmers to shift to high value horticulture cultivation wide coverage of farmers success stories ansari 2016 pawar et al 2012 phadke et al 2018 and government subsidy has made the plgf farm ponds popular amongst farmers and at the same time there are reports of resource overexploitation kale 2017 thereby raising important questions about economic ecological and equity aspect of groundwater use traditionally farm ponds in the form of unlined pits have been used for rainwater harvesting in many parts of the world literature abounds with studies of their role in supporting si across different arid and semi arid regions dile et al 2015 fao 2009 fox and rockström 2000 gunnell and krishnamurthy 2003 ngigi et al 2005 rao et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 analysed the use of farm ponds for rain water harvesting in five states in india and found them to be beneficial in enhancing productivity and resilience to dry spells yet low in popularity amongst farmers farm ponds lined with plastic are promoted in many parts of africa and asia kiggundu et al 2018 rao et al 2017 un ocha 2003 to store rainfall runoff with minimal seepage losses for use in fisheries supplemental irrigation kimera et al 2018 or integrated agri aquaculture fao 2009 the plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm pond is a variation of this technology see appendix a for a note on their growth where the pond is constructed without an inlet outlet channel and serves as a storage structure for impounded groundwater kale 2017 that is primarily used for irrigation of high value crops the limited scientific studies of plgf farm ponds in the available literature are strongly divided in their assessment of impact studies that evaluate the impact at farm scale ansari 2016 yadav 2019 argue that plgf farm ponds are helpful in increasing farm productivity and enhancing water use efficiency manojkumar et al 2020 however those that view the impact at resource scale find these farm ponds to be exploitative duraisamy et al 2018 and unsustainable as they increase inequity in access to groundwater kumar and saleth 2018 misquitta and thatte 2018 prasad and sohoni 2020 and cause significant loss of stored water due to evaporation kale 2017 our work illustrates how this dichotomy can be resolved using a coupled human water system analysis our objective in this paper is thus to assess the role of feedback effects between farm and resource level behaviour in operationalizing sustainable intensification specific to our case study we aim to use a socio hydrological approach to assess if and how the plastic lined farm pond supported intensification can lead to si 2 material and methods 2 1 case study background our study area is the largely groundwater dependent region in western india comprising of shallow hard rock aquifers which are common to peninsular india and to other large parts of asia and africa shah 2012 the aquifers are recharged by the annual southwest monsoon that creates a seasonal cycle of water availability and scarcity which is increasingly disrupted by climate change singh et al 2014 swami et al 2018 groundwater is the main source for irrigation in post monsoon months and is primarily accessed through open dug wells excessive abstraction or poor rainfall leads to long periods of dry aquifers until monsoon arrives again in the following year plastic lined farm ponds were introduced by government programmes in the region as a way to increase agricultural productivity by assuring summer irrigation for orchard cultivation goap 2016 these ponds are constructed such that they rise above the ground with no inlet outlet gates to channel rainfall run off they are instead filled by pumping water from shallow wells see fig 1b fig 1 shows a schematic of the plgf farm pond based irrigation groundwater is abstracted during the wet season when the shallow aquifers are recharged and the water is stored in the farm pond to secure dry season irrigation the plastic lining 300 500 micron hdpe film prevents percolation of the water back into the aquifer and allows the stored groundwater to be carried forward in time but only at the cost of significant evaporation loss the high returns expected from orchards or a summer vegetable crop provides economic incentive for this practice prasad and sohoni 2020 the energy cost of two stage pumping of groundwater is insignificant for the farmers due to large state subsidy on agricultural electricity the use of plgf farm ponds underscores the ultimate competition for groundwater where shallow wells frequently become dry in summer and the only way to assure summer irrigation is to extract groundwater while it is still available and store it in private structures by design plgf farm ponds are most prevalent in drought prone regions where they are widely accepted as a way to secure irrigation for high value crops see fig 1c they are popular even with smallholding farmers who have access to capital prasad and sohoni 2020 government schemes provide partial or full subsidy but many farm ponds are constructed without any government support our study area in the semi arid parts of nashik ahmednagar jalna hingoli and akola districts in the state of maharashtra receives between 600 and 900 mm of rainfall in the monsoon months of june to september gunnell 1997 this period corresponds to the kharif cropping season which is largely rainfed it is followed by the rabi or winter cropping season typically november to february and the summer cropping season typically march to june if there is sufficient water for irrigation the main kharif crops in this region includes millets pulses and oilseeds rabi crops range from traditional drought resistant crops such as millets pulses and fodder crops to more water intensive crops such as wheat onion or seasonal vegetables pomegranate grapes and citrus fruit are multi year orchards which have gained great popularity manojkumar et al 2020 in the farm pond supported intensification because of higher productivity and market returns birthal et al 2008 goi 2017 roy and thorat 2008 2 2 methods we use a coupled socio hydrological sivapalan et al 2014 approach to analyze the cross scale feedbacks between farmer decisions and resource behaviour this approach allows consideration of the regional fresh water resource use limits to si which are rooted in the biophysical system and also the human agency pande and sivapalan 2017 through which intensification decisions are made there are multiple stakeholders involved in our case study such as traditional crop farmers horticulture farmers other water users in the community and state agencies these agents have diverse goals to be more drought resilient to raise farm incomes to make judicious use of a scarce resource and to maintain social welfare their decisions such as investment in technology land use change cropping choice and irrigation methods impact the regional hydrology the hydrological changes in turn impact different agents and their decisions there is also feedback amongst agents as one responds to the action of another say by way of cooperation or competition a coupled socio hydrological analysis allows us to capture these dynamics and to project the possible course of events in the presence of multiple non linear dynamic feedback loops we use system dynamics sd sterman 2012 to model the cross scale socio hydrological feedbacks fig 2 shows the data collection and modelling steps this work is based on rich qualitative and quantitative data gathered through farmer interviews conducted in a drought year and a good rainfall year prasad and sohoni 2020 in sinnar block of nashik district we first identify different socio hydrological drivers observed from farmer interviews that form the basis of our model a qualitative causal loop diagram is then developed to view how variables causally affect one another by following these causal links in time and space we identify the key feedback mechanisms this model was developed iteratively along with model validation activities in the form of farmer group discussions and interviews with village level agricultural assistants in selected villages of ahmednagar jalna hingoli and akola districts we build upon the conceptual model to develop a stylised stock and flow based quantitative model with the goal of simulating the current dynamics and conducting scenario analysis in sd the parts of the system that represent accumulation over long term such as aquifers are explicitly represented as stocks while the dynamic characteristics of the system such as annual rainfall and water extracted in a given year are represented as flows whose net accumulation characterizes stocks stock and flow based sd modelling is particularly suitable for a coupled socio hydrological approach since human decisions can be modelled endogenously 2 3 model 2 3 1 learnings from field work our model is developed on the basis of extensive field work carried out in the study area over good rainfall and drought years 2015 2017 and follow up discussions with farmer groups 2017 2018 in this section we present the key learnings that form the foundation of our model there are many drivers cultural economic and hydrological for growing investment in farm ponds and horticulture a shift to high value horticulture is considered desirable by most farmers in the region even if it is infeasible for many argade and narayanan 2019 find that this aspiration is linked to the imaginary of a better life and a notion of development that is associated with cultivation of better crops which are water intensive crops and require greater groundwater extraction this imaginary is propagated by the privileged farmers over time this has also become an aspiration for the water deprived farmers but a self defeating one vora et al 2021 describe different mental models in agricultural water management explored through trans disciplinary participatory exercises which further explain this participants expressed the desire to capture and use every drop of rain that falls on their land and emphasized importance of water storage to achieve agricultural and drinking water security success stories associated with horticulture cultivation are shared widely in the media advertisements offering services for construction of plastic lined farm ponds are found painted on village walls a thriving industry and network both formal and informal support horticulture by way of private advisors knowledge extension agents export market agents specialised input providers etc the market plays an important role in driving the dynamics horticulture offers high risk and high reward by virtue of being perishable horticulture crops face high fluctuations of market price and it is common for prices to crash in a good rainfall season when farmers have good harvests farmers believe that the highest and most stable market prices can be realized when vegetables or fruits can be harvested to meet the summer demand when supply is short hence there is a desire to access crucial irrigation in the dry months by way of investments such as farm ponds the aspiration is reinforced by state development policies that promote farm ponds for horticulture to enhance farm output while on one hand there is an aspiration for horticulture crops on the other hand there is a rising feeling amongst farmers that they can no longer rely on their traditional crops with shrinking landholding sizes and demands of a growing cash economy the unpredictability of weather pattern and high groundwater stress means that farmers routinely fall short of irrigation and suffer yield losses farmers struggle to have a reliable source of irrigation our interviews capture multiple investments made by farmers one after another in irrigation infrastructure prasad and sohoni 2020 multiple wells and borewells often with some failed attempts well deepening lateral bores pipeline transfer over large distances these struggles are common as farmers strive to access reliable irrigation building farm ponds is the next level of escalation some farmers who have the wherewithal to invest in a farm pond take this decision after experiencing repeated crop loss due to irrigation shortfall or high expense of purchasing tanker water to save their crops see appendix 6 in prasad and sohoni 2020 at the same time there are many farmers who are unable to continue this escalation in investments some others hope for one good rainfall year to recover their losses but invest with a delay if risk of irrigation shortfall continues many depend on loans to make the investment which feeds into the cycle of vulnerability and indebtedness thus we find that the decision to invest in farm ponds is driven by both aspiration and vulnerability of farmers and it is but one of the steps in the elusive quest for assured access to irrigation the rate of this escalation may be different for different regions in semi arid parts of maharashtra but the structural nature of the desire to shift to water intensive crops is the same argade and narayanan 2019 what balancing force can turn around or slow these dynamics there are several examples of effective participatory groundwater management and regulation foster et al 2009 kulkarni et al 2015 which have successfully dissuaded water intensive cropping and related investments while assuring stable farm incomes such institutions may emerge as a result of village specific social parameters and external stimuli zwarteveen et al 2021 a transformation may also be driven by a change in economic factors currently the escalation in investment is enabled by large farm energy subsidy which makes multi source multi stage pumping possible at very low cost to the farmer additionally the premium price that consumers are willing to pay for horticulture and more so in off season raises the extent to which farmers can escalate investments in irrigation these are some of the leverage points which may change the ongoing dynamics prasad and sohoni 2020 what factors may lead to the emergence of participatory groundwater management in a village to control the ongoing escalation is a subject for further research and our model does not capture it the changes in economic factors such as energy subsidy are exogenous to our study instead we model the slow down in the escalation of farm pond investments as a result of the limit to groundwater availability which constrains profitability of building new farm ponds 2 3 2 qualitative conceptual model as discussed in the previous section there are two main drivers for farmers to invest in plgf farm pond based irrigation and intensification these are aspiration and vulnerability the aspiration pathway refers to the situation when farmers with high risk taking ability choose to invest in the irrigation technology with the expectations to benefit from it vulnerability pathway on the other hand refers to the situation when farmers are induced to invest in the technology because of lack of other options as they experience the treadmill effect chatalova et al 2016 we develop a qualitative model fig 3 to show the causal relationships and feedbacks there are the two key reinforcing feedback loops 1 1 a reinforcing loop marked with has even number of negative links and it amplifies any perturbation introduced while a balancing loop marked with has odd number of negative links and it dampens the perturbation aspirational intensification and vulnerability induced intensification and one balancing feedback loop cost of assured water the aspirational intensification feedback loop indicates that farmers invest in plgf farm ponds and intensify by shifting from traditional crops to horticulture crops with the expectation of higher returns with the success of these initial farmers more farmers are attracted to follow suit this results in a reinforcing loop where more and more farmers are influenced to invest in farm ponds and greater area is shifted from traditional crops to horticulture however with every such intervention there is an impact on the hydrology of the region and a feedback to the human system in the form of increased groundwater stress the vulnerability induced intensification loop then captures the counter feedback from humans in response to this the vulnerability induced intensification loop indicates that the groundwater abstraction increases to meet the crop water requirement of the growing area under horticulture crops and to account for the evaporation loss from plgf farm ponds this increases the risk in access to groundwater for all and especially for the asset poor farmers and those whose farm plots are unfavourably located thereby leading to yield loss and crop failures as traditional crops become unviable due to the competitive groundwater extraction farmers are induced to invest in plgf farm pond based irrigation to get assured access to water and reduce the risk of falling short of water often this investment is made with financial loans the large investment in the structure necessitates a shift towards high value horticulture crops and the change in practice further impacts the hydrology resulting in a reinforcement feedback loop the two feedback loops together suggest that an initial introduction of the technology is likely to lead to an ever increasing investment and groundwater risk however the cost of assured water feedback is a balancing loop that suggests that there will be no incentive to invest in plgf farm ponds when groundwater risk increases to a level such that the cost of securing water for irrigation outweighs the benefit from shifting to horticulture when this happens the farm pond supported intensification is expected to stabilize however a qualitative model alone cannot help us determine if this stabilization is likely to lead to a sustainable level of intensification the level of risk in groundwater access is a function of the biophysical properties of the study region and important determinant of when the vulnerability induced intensification feedback starts to operate a quantitative system dynamics model is therefore useful to analyze the system behaviour with respect to the resource threshold 2 3 3 stock and flow model while the causal loop diagram gives us fundamental insights into feedback driven dynamics it does not help us in visualizing the evolution of the system for a given set of system parameters the system evolution depends on the relative strengths of reinforcing and balancing loops with time as the dominating loop changes the system transitions from one regime of operation to another these points of transition are dependent upon the underlying system parameters such as the aquifer properties market returns and risk perception a quantitative stock flow model allows us to simulate this a quantitative socio hydrological model however must go with some caveats humans are complex they are diverse inconsistent emotional purposive socially influenced on the other hand a formal approach such as modelling requires low dimensional representations leading to a tension as to what level of detail actors should be represented at melsen et al 2018 the more detailed an actor representation the more onerous is the data requirement to capture the required diversity effort to make realistic models leads to excessive complexity and may result in capturing too much noise leading to spurious correlation in our case quantification of qualitative parameters such as risk taking ability of humans has inherent limitations given these limitations a quantitative model must be considered successful if it aids understanding and helps expand the user s mental models to cross the limits imposed by bounded rationality while dealing with complex social biophysical systems in the presence of multiple competing feedback loops sd models are well suited to evaluate what if scenarios and provide important warnings they do not explore drivers at the level of the individual agent instead their power is in identifying general patterns that emerge due to the dynamic complexity in a coupled system structure in our stylised model defining the system boundary is an important step to bridge across different scales we select our boundary at the village community level a unit at which collective action is possible and one that shares a common fresh water resource pool this may not necessary align with the administrative boundary and the imagined community ferreyra et al 2008 may be in the form of multi level network of actors the watershed boundary and the aquifer boundary are typically much larger than the village boundary we account for this by modelling an open hydrological system which has surface and groundwater flows going into and out of the boundary to do this we use a lumped model approach mackay et al 2014 which discretizes the biophysical domain into homogenous lumps each with average properties thus we ignore spatial differences within the village and model it as a unit distinct from upstream and downstream lumped units fig 4 shows the main components of the hydrological and the social model and the feedbacks between them this is further elaborated in table 1 which relates the quantitative model with the conceptual model we model the community as being composed of different actor groups farmers with investments in farm ponds who practise horticulture a combination of seasonal vegetables and year round fruit orchards and farmers without investments in farm ponds who cultivate two seasons of traditional crops an important stakeholder group is that of asset poor farmers who practise rainfed farming only and the landless who depend upon shallow public wells to secure water for drinking and domestic use each group has a different water demand pattern through the year which is a function of its cropping pattern to model this the total cultivable land in the village is divided into four different stocks shown in social system of fig 4 the total water demand for each time step is based on irrigation and domestic demand and also considers the farm pond storage since part of it is lost to evaporation at any stage if available groundwater is unable to meet all water demand there is an allocation hierarchy based on which priority of access is assumed prasad and sohoni 2020 this allocation hierarchy is a significant aspect of the model which is developed from field level understanding of who has access to water during scarcity period when irrigation demand is not fulfilled for any group this leads to loss in its productivity non linear yield curves are used to compute yields as a function of irrigation provided a decision point is modelled every year before the start of the new monsoon when some farmers from a group may decide to make new investments in plgf farm pond driven intensification and hence shift to the group of farmers with farm ponds this is the key social parameterization in the model we use proxies to capture the two influencing drivers of aspiration and vulnerability as noted in table 1 the proxy that we use to model aspiration is the relative profitability of plgf farm pond owning farmer group to other farmers the greater the relative profitability the more number of farmers shift to the new irrigation technology to model vulnerability we use the proxy of groundwater risk i e the risk of irrigation shortfall by virtue of operating close to the resource level threshold this is computed as the ratio of net groundwater demand from all user groups to the total groundwater stock as this ratio increases it indicates increasing competition for groundwater which feeds into the number of farmers making the decision to invest in plgf farm ponds to assure water for irrigation the two factors are used together to model the number of new farm ponds built in each year which drives a shift in area under different cropping patterns and accordingly a change in the water demand this parameterization captures the observation that there are early adopters who are primarily driven by aspiration and followers who invest with a delay often after risk of irrigation shortfall rises further it also captures the reality that frequent droughts lead to an escalation in farm pond construction construction of new farm ponds is limited in the model by the profitability of farm ponds supported horticulture relative to traditional farm practice the yields of horticulture crop are modelled as highly sensitive to irrigation shortfall when farm pond farmers experience irrigation shortfall it reduces their profitability either due to lower output or higher cost of purchasing water tankers when this profitability becomes lower than that for the default crop choice no new farm ponds are constructed we design four scenarios see table 2 for analysing the impact of intensification at farm scale in contrast with its impact when viewed across scales with socio hydrological feedbacks we start with the baseline scenario the objective of the second scenario is to examine the socio hydrological impact of intensification at farm level with no feedback from other farmers or resource we then introduce the feedbacks to see the dynamics with no drought year scenario 3 and with periodic droughts scenario 4 to see the how the trend in intensification unfolds with respect to the resource threshold to evaluate if the practice leads to si the first two scenarios are static and hence have short model run duration the next two are dynamic scenarios which are run for 30 years in all scenarios except where explicitly stated we assume that there is one drought in five years and one instance of two consecutive drought years in a decade 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 baseline model we first model the scenario where there is no farm pond or water intensive farming in the region there is only single cropped area and traditional double cropped area requiring nominal irrigation the water level in the shallow wells is the key indicator of the health of the system and the one that can be visualised and monitored by all users results in fig 5 show the cyclic behaviour for average rainfall years and drought years years 3 6 and 7 water level in shallow wells rises from monsoon recharge and falls post monsoon due to water abstraction and groundwater flows in drought years the well may become completely dry e g in year 8 due to two consecutive droughts after a drought year it is possible for the groundwater level to recover fully if there is good rainfall as seen after year 4 and 8 monsoons there are baseflows flowing out of the system for a few months after the end of the monsoon season but they do not appear in drought years fig 5b it can be seen that in absence of investment in assured water access the cultivation of year round irrigated crops faces high risk of falling short of irrigation in poor rainfall years e g in year 7 as groundwater stock and the inflow together is not sufficient to meet the groundwater extraction demand this motivates investments in structures such as plgf farm ponds which we model in scenario 2 the validation of the hydrological model in the baseline scenario is done by comparing the hydrological behaviour in terms of shallow well level fluctuations and duration of baseflows to observations made by interviewed farmers in normal and drought years 3 2 scenario 2 farm level view of plgf farm pond we now model a scenario where we introduce ten private plgf farm ponds of 2 tcm thousand cubic meter capacity each fig 6a shows the farm pond operation groundwater is extracted in monsoon months to fill the plgf ponds this water is used during dry months of summer march to june for irrigation this is the time when well water levels drop and direct well irrigation is often not possible fig 6c the farm pond thus allows the farmer to practice year round irrigation each 2 tcm farm pond may assure dry season irrigation of about 0 4 ha of orchard using micro irrigation depending upon the specific crop choice and irrigation practice the average annual profitability per unit area of orchards is three times compared to that of traditional double cropping practice fig 6d from the point of view of the farmer even having secure access to only half of the stored water fig 6a in the driest months provides sufficient economic incentive to motivate plgf farm pond based intensification results shows that at the end of the drought year 3 horticulture cultivation continues to be profitable while profits from traditional farming fall due to insufficient irrigation fig 6b shows the increase in the overall groundwater demand as a result of the farm pond operation and intensification comparing year 0 with year 1 when ponds are introduced the change is seen in two ways i groundwater is extracted in monsoon months jun sep to fill farm ponds this is the time when the shallow aquifers are full and groundwater flows out from the system boundary as baseflows as seen in scenario 1 ii there is an increase in post monsoon irrigation demand when groundwater from shallow wells is used to irrigate the horticulture crop as long as the practice is limited to a small number of farms the scenario results show that farmers are able to intensify their practice within the resource envelope 3 3 scenario 3 multi year dynamics with no droughts we now incorporate the aspiration and vulnerability induced feedbacks in the model and observe the socio hydrological system dynamics for 30 years with no drought years droughts are incorporated in scenario 4 as seen in the results shown in fig 7 when the initial 10 plgf farm ponds are introduced perhaps as part of a government program it triggers a cycle of investments and intensification fig 7a b initially with increasing intensification well levels fall to greater depth fig 7c in the dry season but bounce back up to full in monsoon at one stage there is an exponential rise in the number of farm ponds and the area under intensification and by the time the level of intensification stabilizes the water table collapses and does not recover even during monsoon season the transitions observed are as a result of the relative strength of the feedback loops in action at first the aspirational investment feedback dominates as more farmers are encouraged to intensify due to relative profitability and everyone benefits as long as the total water use remains within resource threshold but increasing intensification leads to greater groundwater demand the impact of which is seen in lesser baseflows flowing out of the village post monsoon and well water levels falling to greater depths in summer though recovering during rainy season fig 7c these are early signs of groundwater stress after year 21 baseflows dry up completely and wells no longer fill up to the top in the monsoon season with every incremental rise in risk to groundwater access the vulnerability induced feedback mechanism gains more strength even as aspirational investment continues to dominate by year 24 intensification is at such a level that the groundwater demand is now greater than the available stock i e the carrying capacity of the system is exceeded the vulnerability induced investment in farm ponds becomes the dominating force as there is irrigation shortfall and farmers with poor access experience crop failures fig 7c shows that the first impact of unmet water demand is on domestic water needs followed by the traditional farmers who experience irrigation deficit while farmers with plgf farm ponds continue to meet their irrigation needs frequent crop failures of traditional double cropping farmers induce them to invest in plgf farm ponds to assure irrigation along with a shift to horticulture crops to recoup this investment as horticulture cultivation continues to be profitable fig 7d with the combined force of both feedback loops there is a larger increase in the rate of new farm ponds and area under water intensive crops finally by year 26 the groundwater stock falls so much that even farm pond owners are unable to meet their irrigation requirement and incur loss fig 7d it is at this point that the balancing loop gets activated and there is no longer any incentive to invest in any more new farm ponds however by the time this happens every single farmer is worse off compared to the situation from where they began economically each farmer group has lower profitability compared to the initial state in terms of their resources there is a catastrophic crisis in groundwater socially there is a crisis as well due to the poor state of shallow wells and drinking water stress experienced by the asset poor it is clear that the dynamics between the reinforcing and balancing loops shown in the causal loop diagram is such that by the time the balancing loop stops the increase in farm ponds significant damage is already done the result is the tragedy of the commons 3 4 scenario 4 multi year dynamics with droughts in the above section we simulated the dynamic situation assuming there were no droughts in this scenario we assume droughts appear in years 3 6 and 7 of every decade fig 8 shows that in the presence of droughts the same dynamic behaviour repeats but in an accelerated manner we see that in drought years even when the number of plgf farm ponds is low and therefore area under intensive cropping is also low for example in year 3 the poor groundwater availability due to the drought causes the demand to be in excess fig 8b thereby breaching the threshold for safe resource use and triggering the vulnerability induced intensification feedback fig 8c highlights the equity aspect in water access by showing that it is the users who depend upon shallow public wells for drinking water who first experience the scarcity after the drought in year 3 as intensification continues the traditional farmers become more vulnerable while the plgf farm pond supported farmers are the last to suffer water scarcity this is by design this drought proofing effect of the farm ponds and the comparative asset richness of farm pond owners effectively prioritizes the irrigation demand of the plgf farm pond supported farms before any other use as a trade off the burden of scarcity is entirely felt by the non farm pond owning farmers and other users of groundwater 4 discussion in situ farm ponds are generally considered to be a good farm practice that is recommended for sustainable intensification dile et al 2015 rao et al 2017 rockström et al 2017 our case study analyzes the use of plastic lined farm ponds which is being promoted in large parts of the shallow hard rock aquifer region of peninsular india and also in many parts of africa for drought proofing and supporting agricultural intensification our analysis shows that when viewed at the farm level without cross scale feedback effects the practice of using plastic lined ponds appears to be beneficial in enhancing farm output and shielding the farmer from droughts this is consistent with studies ansari 2016 kumar et al 2016 manojkumar et al 2020 yadav 2019 that recommend the use of lined farm ponds for securing dry spell irrigation and improved farm productivity however if we evaluate the impact over time and space by accounting for the feedbacks within and across scales we find a contradictory situation our modelling results show that in absence of any collective action and community control on intensification the reinforcing feedbacks lead to the system tipping over its resource threshold causing increased inequity in access to groundwater fall in agricultural productivity and ultimately the tragedy of the commons these dynamics are accelerated by frequent droughts the drought proofing characteristic of the plastic lined farm ponds is thus a paradox which can be unravelled by examining the cross scale effects while the farm ponds protect farmers from the impact of droughts an over reliance on them and the accompanying increase in irrigation demand due to intensification in fact results in aggravating the impact of droughts for the larger community this counter intuitive dynamics may be compared to the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018 that points to a similar contradiction which plays out at a larger scale in the use of dams and reservoirs which are constructed to alleviate water shortages but may in fact lead to worsening the impact of water shortages due to an increased water demand we find that this holds not only for big reservoirs at catchment scale but also as an aggregated effect of many small ponds at the smaller farm scale when constructed without coordination in practice ensuring sustainable intensification in shallow aquifers is further complicated by the fact that the threshold for safe water use is not a static one instead it is sensitive to short term fluctuations caused by variability in rainfall fishman et al 2011 we find that even if the intensification levels are such that groundwater use is below the carrying capacity of the system in an average rainfall year a drought year can cause the system to tip over initiating the dynamics of competitive investment and intensification thereby leading to high groundwater risk even in subsequent good rainfall years therefore sustainable intensification must necessarily be seasonally agile and one that responds to the changing threshold of safe groundwater use caused by rainfall variability increasing intensification in good rainfall years and scaling back in drought years thus always staying below the resource limit as pointed out by lankford 2004 ogilvie et al 2019 resource scarce and dynamically variable environments call for a shift from crop water requirement based irrigation centred thinking to a flexible resource centred thinking orchard cultivation reduces the adaptive capacity of farmers by locking them into fixed year round irrigation requirements in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment hence to practice si by remaining within the resource threshold it is recommended that seasonal horticulture crops are cultivated in good rainfall years possibly with the help of plastic lined farm ponds that transfer excess water from the wet to the dry season only in these years while the traditional low water intensity crops continue to be the default crop choice in other years such seasonally adaptive intensification will benefit from use of farm ponds in good years and ensure more equitable distribution of water in bad rainfall years while a detailed discussion on how to implement seasonally adaptive intensification is outside the scope of this paper it may be achieved by a bottom up community effort and co production of processes which enable the community to better recognize the limits of its common pool resource base and the costs of competition this means regular monitoring of water availability preparation of seasonal water budgets and agreements on adaptive cropping patterns so as to ensure that groundwater demand always remains below the available supply it would also require taking a hard stance against multi year crops that require fixed summer irrigation such as orchards there are examples of villages where such seasonally adaptive intensification is practiced through community action foster et al 2007 these examples are few on the contrary there are growing examples of villages with increasing investments in farm ponds and horticulture a very popular example is that of kadwanchi village in jalna district which is considered to be a role model by many with 700 mm of average annual rainfall and 1100 ha of cultivable land kadwanchi has more than 600 farm ponds that are filled through open wells and 540 ha of grape cultivation which continues to expand belsare 2020 media reports highlight that the per capita income has increased from inr 3000 in 1999 to inr 130 000 in less than two decades financial express 2017 belsare 2020 analysed the crop water demand for kadwanchi with respect to resource availability and found that the demand operates very close to the threshold in normal rainfall years when most rainfall in the village boundary is impounded and used but the demand far exceeds the threshold in poor rainfall years in such years water tankers are bought by villagers to meet drinking water and irrigation needs our model is a good representation for the developing situation in kadwanchi a direct impact is already observed in the downstream pirkalyan dam which villagers claim has not filled in last 10 years due to reduced flows belsare 2020 the economics of grape farming has so far allowed the farmers to remain profitable and for the intensification to continue despite signs of water stress will there be a limit to this growth and will a tragedy of the commons be experienced while this is yet to be seen our model suggests this is likely unless community action is taken to ensure adaptive intensification the growth of farm pond based intensification may be analysed in terms of the pendulum swing effect kandasamy et al 2014 the pendulum swing is seen as a combination of two feedback loops between people and the environment elshafei et al 2014 the first feedback is from exploitation of water resources to increase in economic output as this exploitation becomes excessive and there is a risk of a collapse this may create a feedback to the human agency communities may become more sensitive to the changing environment which may translate to changes in norms practices and regulations say by way of participatory groundwater management so as to swing the pendulum back and ensure that intensification levels remain sustainable in this paper our model captures only the first swing of this pendulum that culminates in a system collapse it does not capture a community response that may result due to triggered social sensitivity however our use of a socio hydrological lens in itself is reflexive and a way to exercise human agency through science that may potentially lead to greater community sensitivity and institutional changes then we may be able to move away from sweeping pendulum swings and instead co evolve as balanced coupled human water systems there are several directions for future work cross scale socio hydrological case studies of villages that are on the path of intensive horticulture and its feedback at the catchment scale will add further insight the use of remote sensing technology such as gramdrishti tundia et al 2020 which uses satellite images to identify farm ponds can be very powerful to track growth in farm pond density and validate or warn of emergent dynamics implementation of our recommendations requires participatory action research with stakeholders to motivate the practice of seasonal adaptive intensification and develop supporting processes and tools in the same vein there is also a need to co produce policy inputs for government programs that currently promote farm ponds and horticulture without cognizance of their relation with the resource limit 5 conclusions in this paper we analyze how inter connections between resource level thresholds and farm level decisions are important for achieving sustainable intensification we use the case study of ongoing intensification in the shallow hard rock aquifers of western india which is driven by a relative new irrigation technology the plastic lined groundwater filled farm pond we find that from a static farm level view the farm pond is beneficial in shielding farmers from effects of drought and in increasing farm productivity however a system dynamics analysis shows that the result is in fact contradictory when within and across scale socio hydrological feedbacks are considered this happens as intensification levels rise driven by aspiration and vulnerability induced pathways resulting in groundwater demand exceeding the threshold of safe use practicing si is complicated by the fact that the limit for safe groundwater use in shallow aquifers is not a static one but one that changes every year due to variability in rainfall our model shows that in drought years the carrying capacity of water resource falls significantly so that even a low level of intensification may tip the system above its threshold resulting in a tragedy of the commons achieving si in this context requires a seasonally adaptive intensification practice which retains the adaptive capacity of farmers instead of locking them into fixed annual irrigation requirement in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment we thus conclude that the recognition and translation of resource level thresholds to an actionable level is key to practicing si declaration of competing interest the

colleagues hemant belsare and gopal chavan from iit bombay for many detailed discussions we are grateful to charlotte de fraiture and pieter van der zaag ihe delft for their valuable comments on the manuscript appendix a growth of plastic lined farm ponds there is no official data available on the total number of plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm ponds that are in use in the country here we estimate the number of farm ponds in one block of our study area by using data collected from different government departments and using gramdrishti tundia et al 2020 sinnar is a semi arid block in nashik district which has been classified as semi critical in terms of groundwater development by the state groundwater authority the block is made up of 130 villages and has a total cultivable area of 98 225 ha the first plastic lined farm ponds in the block were introduced in the state of maharashtra by the national horticulture mission nhm in 2005 farm ponds were subsequently subsidized under different government programs such as rashtriya krishi vikas yojna rkvy between 2007 and 12 maharashtra rural employment guarantee scheme mregs between 2009 and 12 magel tyala shettale scheme from 2016 to 18 and world bank funded project on climate resilient agriculture pocra from 2018 onwards the farm ponds implemented under nhm are plastic lined and for the explicit use of irrigating horticulture crops the farm ponds subsidized in other schemes are unlined farm ponds some with provision of inlet and outlet openings to channel stream water in to fill the farm ponds however field work shows that most farm ponds in the area are used as storage tanks which the farmers line with plastic sheets at their own cost and use to store groundwater or water from wells adjoining canals and reservoirs the most common size of farm ponds in government schemes are 30mx30mx3m except for farm ponds constructed under nhm which are significantly larger but the actual size depends upon the area available to the farmer and the area to be irrigated table a1 provides the official figures of farm ponds approved under different schemes in sinnar block between the years 2006 and 2017 it must be noted that the actual number of farm ponds is significantly larger as many farm ponds are built by farmers without any government subsidy to estimate the total number we use gramdrishti a system to detect objects using satellite images gramdrishti was able to detect 3041 farm ponds in sinnar block majority of which is expected to be used as plastic lined farm ponds fig a1 shows a village wise map of the number of farm ponds detected using gramdrishti in sinnar block the map also marks villages which face severe drinking water scarcity and repeatedly depend upon state tankers for delivery

9620,sustainable intensification si of agriculture combines the dual goals of increasing productivity while staying within safe limits of resource use in practice how can thresholds which operate at resource scale guide intensification driven by social economic and biophysical factors at the farm scale in this paper we present the case of agricultural intensification in the shallow hard rock aquifer region of western india to illustrate how cross scale feedback effects are crucial determinants of not only the resource sustainability and farm productivity but also of social dimensions of si such as equity and justice supported by private investment in plastic lined farm ponds the increasing shift to horticulture in the study area raises questions about the sustainability of the practice we use a socio hydrological lens and develop a system dynamics model to analyze how the growing technology mediated intensification may lead to si we find that from a static farm level view the plastic lined farm pond is beneficial in shielding farmers from droughts and in enhancing productivity however when within and across scale socio hydrological dynamics are considered the practice is found to instead aggravate the drought impact on the community this happens when intensification level accelerates driven by aspiration and vulnerability induced feedbacks resulting in groundwater demand exceeding the system threshold in practice si is complicated by the fact that this threshold for safe groundwater use is dynamic in drought years the carrying capacity falls significantly so that even a low level of intensification may tip the system resulting in a tragedy of the commons therefore achieving si requires seasonally agile intensification which retains the adaptive capacity of farmers instead of locking them into fixed annual irrigation requirement in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment we thus conclude that the recognition and translation of resource level thresholds to an actionable level is key to practicing si keywords sustainable intensification farm pond socio hydrology resource threshold system dynamics india 1 introduction sustainable intensification si of agriculture is a paradigm that integrates the twin goals of increasing agricultural productivity to achieve food security and staying within the safe limits of resource boundaries pretty and bharucha 2014 rockström et al 2017 while the notion of thresholds which indicates the safe limit for operation works at different resource scales steffen et al 2015 agricultural intensification decisions are generally taken by farmers at the farm scale in response to various biophysical social and economic drivers it is therefore of interest to analyze the dynamic interplay across scales häyhä et al 2016 between farm level actions and resource level behaviour and understand how in practice the safe operating limit at the resource scale may guide the process of intensification while ensuring sustainable and equitable resource use water is one of the key resources that directly impacts agricultural productivity sustainable agricultural water management is therefore core to si studies in si have a wide canvas and a large number of them focus on good farming practices that can produce high yield crops while maintaining or enhancing environmental sustainability dile et al 2015 pretty et al 2018 weltin et al 2018 examples include the use of precision agriculture kumar et al 2018 pretty et al 2018 integrated crop water and nutrient management to close yield gaps jägermeyr et al 2016 mueller et al 2012 rainwater harvesting and practices to increase water use efficiency jägermeyr et al 2016 and choice of crop varieties with resistance to water stress weltin et al 2018 a review of research on si häyhä et al 2016 shows that farm is the dominant scale at which practices are investigated while research on societal and regional interactions are under represented there are a few studies which link farm level practices with regional resource thresholds wilbanks and kates 1999 for example dearing et al 2014 evaluate the impact of agricultural intensification at a local scale in china with respect to regional environmental and social thresholds using a time series analysis there are calls by researchers macdonald et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 rockström and karlberg 2010 thomson et al 2019 wilbanks and kates 1999 for innovative studies on cross scale feedback interactions with due consideration of regional and situational context in this paper our objective is to illustrate that cross scale feedback effects are crucial determinants of not only the resource sustainability and farm productivity but also of social dimensions of si such as equity and justice in resource use helfenstein et al 2020 while field level assessments may find certain practices to be efficient and sustainable the analysis of feedbacks between human and water systems in time and space may result in contradictory findings an example of this is the use of micro irrigation for increased water use efficiency a good farm practice contributing to si jägermeyr et al 2016 which when analyzed through a coupled human water lens is shown to contribute in many situations to overexploitation of resources due to the jevon s paradox sears et al 2018 in our study we report a similar phenomenon uncovered through the analysis of the coupling of farm level intensification practice with resource level behaviour using a socio hydrological approach sivapalan et al 2014 our case study focuses on the ongoing intensification in the largely groundwater dependent semi arid regions of western india where intensification is mediated by private investments in a relatively new irrigation technology the plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm ponds these farm ponds are filled with abstracted groundwater in the wet season so as to assure irrigation in the dry season when groundwater is scarce kale 2017 the irrigation technology is promoted by the government as income enhancing and drought proofing technology goap 2016 in regions that experience long dry spells and frequent droughts and encourages farmers to shift to high value horticulture cultivation wide coverage of farmers success stories ansari 2016 pawar et al 2012 phadke et al 2018 and government subsidy has made the plgf farm ponds popular amongst farmers and at the same time there are reports of resource overexploitation kale 2017 thereby raising important questions about economic ecological and equity aspect of groundwater use traditionally farm ponds in the form of unlined pits have been used for rainwater harvesting in many parts of the world literature abounds with studies of their role in supporting si across different arid and semi arid regions dile et al 2015 fao 2009 fox and rockström 2000 gunnell and krishnamurthy 2003 ngigi et al 2005 rao et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 analysed the use of farm ponds for rain water harvesting in five states in india and found them to be beneficial in enhancing productivity and resilience to dry spells yet low in popularity amongst farmers farm ponds lined with plastic are promoted in many parts of africa and asia kiggundu et al 2018 rao et al 2017 un ocha 2003 to store rainfall runoff with minimal seepage losses for use in fisheries supplemental irrigation kimera et al 2018 or integrated agri aquaculture fao 2009 the plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm pond is a variation of this technology see appendix a for a note on their growth where the pond is constructed without an inlet outlet channel and serves as a storage structure for impounded groundwater kale 2017 that is primarily used for irrigation of high value crops the limited scientific studies of plgf farm ponds in the available literature are strongly divided in their assessment of impact studies that evaluate the impact at farm scale ansari 2016 yadav 2019 argue that plgf farm ponds are helpful in increasing farm productivity and enhancing water use efficiency manojkumar et al 2020 however those that view the impact at resource scale find these farm ponds to be exploitative duraisamy et al 2018 and unsustainable as they increase inequity in access to groundwater kumar and saleth 2018 misquitta and thatte 2018 prasad and sohoni 2020 and cause significant loss of stored water due to evaporation kale 2017 our work illustrates how this dichotomy can be resolved using a coupled human water system analysis our objective in this paper is thus to assess the role of feedback effects between farm and resource level behaviour in operationalizing sustainable intensification specific to our case study we aim to use a socio hydrological approach to assess if and how the plastic lined farm pond supported intensification can lead to si 2 material and methods 2 1 case study background our study area is the largely groundwater dependent region in western india comprising of shallow hard rock aquifers which are common to peninsular india and to other large parts of asia and africa shah 2012 the aquifers are recharged by the annual southwest monsoon that creates a seasonal cycle of water availability and scarcity which is increasingly disrupted by climate change singh et al 2014 swami et al 2018 groundwater is the main source for irrigation in post monsoon months and is primarily accessed through open dug wells excessive abstraction or poor rainfall leads to long periods of dry aquifers until monsoon arrives again in the following year plastic lined farm ponds were introduced by government programmes in the region as a way to increase agricultural productivity by assuring summer irrigation for orchard cultivation goap 2016 these ponds are constructed such that they rise above the ground with no inlet outlet gates to channel rainfall run off they are instead filled by pumping water from shallow wells see fig 1b fig 1 shows a schematic of the plgf farm pond based irrigation groundwater is abstracted during the wet season when the shallow aquifers are recharged and the water is stored in the farm pond to secure dry season irrigation the plastic lining 300 500 micron hdpe film prevents percolation of the water back into the aquifer and allows the stored groundwater to be carried forward in time but only at the cost of significant evaporation loss the high returns expected from orchards or a summer vegetable crop provides economic incentive for this practice prasad and sohoni 2020 the energy cost of two stage pumping of groundwater is insignificant for the farmers due to large state subsidy on agricultural electricity the use of plgf farm ponds underscores the ultimate competition for groundwater where shallow wells frequently become dry in summer and the only way to assure summer irrigation is to extract groundwater while it is still available and store it in private structures by design plgf farm ponds are most prevalent in drought prone regions where they are widely accepted as a way to secure irrigation for high value crops see fig 1c they are popular even with smallholding farmers who have access to capital prasad and sohoni 2020 government schemes provide partial or full subsidy but many farm ponds are constructed without any government support our study area in the semi arid parts of nashik ahmednagar jalna hingoli and akola districts in the state of maharashtra receives between 600 and 900 mm of rainfall in the monsoon months of june to september gunnell 1997 this period corresponds to the kharif cropping season which is largely rainfed it is followed by the rabi or winter cropping season typically november to february and the summer cropping season typically march to june if there is sufficient water for irrigation the main kharif crops in this region includes millets pulses and oilseeds rabi crops range from traditional drought resistant crops such as millets pulses and fodder crops to more water intensive crops such as wheat onion or seasonal vegetables pomegranate grapes and citrus fruit are multi year orchards which have gained great popularity manojkumar et al 2020 in the farm pond supported intensification because of higher productivity and market returns birthal et al 2008 goi 2017 roy and thorat 2008 2 2 methods we use a coupled socio hydrological sivapalan et al 2014 approach to analyze the cross scale feedbacks between farmer decisions and resource behaviour this approach allows consideration of the regional fresh water resource use limits to si which are rooted in the biophysical system and also the human agency pande and sivapalan 2017 through which intensification decisions are made there are multiple stakeholders involved in our case study such as traditional crop farmers horticulture farmers other water users in the community and state agencies these agents have diverse goals to be more drought resilient to raise farm incomes to make judicious use of a scarce resource and to maintain social welfare their decisions such as investment in technology land use change cropping choice and irrigation methods impact the regional hydrology the hydrological changes in turn impact different agents and their decisions there is also feedback amongst agents as one responds to the action of another say by way of cooperation or competition a coupled socio hydrological analysis allows us to capture these dynamics and to project the possible course of events in the presence of multiple non linear dynamic feedback loops we use system dynamics sd sterman 2012 to model the cross scale socio hydrological feedbacks fig 2 shows the data collection and modelling steps this work is based on rich qualitative and quantitative data gathered through farmer interviews conducted in a drought year and a good rainfall year prasad and sohoni 2020 in sinnar block of nashik district we first identify different socio hydrological drivers observed from farmer interviews that form the basis of our model a qualitative causal loop diagram is then developed to view how variables causally affect one another by following these causal links in time and space we identify the key feedback mechanisms this model was developed iteratively along with model validation activities in the form of farmer group discussions and interviews with village level agricultural assistants in selected villages of ahmednagar jalna hingoli and akola districts we build upon the conceptual model to develop a stylised stock and flow based quantitative model with the goal of simulating the current dynamics and conducting scenario analysis in sd the parts of the system that represent accumulation over long term such as aquifers are explicitly represented as stocks while the dynamic characteristics of the system such as annual rainfall and water extracted in a given year are represented as flows whose net accumulation characterizes stocks stock and flow based sd modelling is particularly suitable for a coupled socio hydrological approach since human decisions can be modelled endogenously 2 3 model 2 3 1 learnings from field work our model is developed on the basis of extensive field work carried out in the study area over good rainfall and drought years 2015 2017 and follow up discussions with farmer groups 2017 2018 in this section we present the key learnings that form the foundation of our model there are many drivers cultural economic and hydrological for growing investment in farm ponds and horticulture a shift to high value horticulture is considered desirable by most farmers in the region even if it is infeasible for many argade and narayanan 2019 find that this aspiration is linked to the imaginary of a better life and a notion of development that is associated with cultivation of better crops which are water intensive crops and require greater groundwater extraction this imaginary is propagated by the privileged farmers over time this has also become an aspiration for the water deprived farmers but a self defeating one vora et al 2021 describe different mental models in agricultural water management explored through trans disciplinary participatory exercises which further explain this participants expressed the desire to capture and use every drop of rain that falls on their land and emphasized importance of water storage to achieve agricultural and drinking water security success stories associated with horticulture cultivation are shared widely in the media advertisements offering services for construction of plastic lined farm ponds are found painted on village walls a thriving industry and network both formal and informal support horticulture by way of private advisors knowledge extension agents export market agents specialised input providers etc the market plays an important role in driving the dynamics horticulture offers high risk and high reward by virtue of being perishable horticulture crops face high fluctuations of market price and it is common for prices to crash in a good rainfall season when farmers have good harvests farmers believe that the highest and most stable market prices can be realized when vegetables or fruits can be harvested to meet the summer demand when supply is short hence there is a desire to access crucial irrigation in the dry months by way of investments such as farm ponds the aspiration is reinforced by state development policies that promote farm ponds for horticulture to enhance farm output while on one hand there is an aspiration for horticulture crops on the other hand there is a rising feeling amongst farmers that they can no longer rely on their traditional crops with shrinking landholding sizes and demands of a growing cash economy the unpredictability of weather pattern and high groundwater stress means that farmers routinely fall short of irrigation and suffer yield losses farmers struggle to have a reliable source of irrigation our interviews capture multiple investments made by farmers one after another in irrigation infrastructure prasad and sohoni 2020 multiple wells and borewells often with some failed attempts well deepening lateral bores pipeline transfer over large distances these struggles are common as farmers strive to access reliable irrigation building farm ponds is the next level of escalation some farmers who have the wherewithal to invest in a farm pond take this decision after experiencing repeated crop loss due to irrigation shortfall or high expense of purchasing tanker water to save their crops see appendix 6 in prasad and sohoni 2020 at the same time there are many farmers who are unable to continue this escalation in investments some others hope for one good rainfall year to recover their losses but invest with a delay if risk of irrigation shortfall continues many depend on loans to make the investment which feeds into the cycle of vulnerability and indebtedness thus we find that the decision to invest in farm ponds is driven by both aspiration and vulnerability of farmers and it is but one of the steps in the elusive quest for assured access to irrigation the rate of this escalation may be different for different regions in semi arid parts of maharashtra but the structural nature of the desire to shift to water intensive crops is the same argade and narayanan 2019 what balancing force can turn around or slow these dynamics there are several examples of effective participatory groundwater management and regulation foster et al 2009 kulkarni et al 2015 which have successfully dissuaded water intensive cropping and related investments while assuring stable farm incomes such institutions may emerge as a result of village specific social parameters and external stimuli zwarteveen et al 2021 a transformation may also be driven by a change in economic factors currently the escalation in investment is enabled by large farm energy subsidy which makes multi source multi stage pumping possible at very low cost to the farmer additionally the premium price that consumers are willing to pay for horticulture and more so in off season raises the extent to which farmers can escalate investments in irrigation these are some of the leverage points which may change the ongoing dynamics prasad and sohoni 2020 what factors may lead to the emergence of participatory groundwater management in a village to control the ongoing escalation is a subject for further research and our model does not capture it the changes in economic factors such as energy subsidy are exogenous to our study instead we model the slow down in the escalation of farm pond investments as a result of the limit to groundwater availability which constrains profitability of building new farm ponds 2 3 2 qualitative conceptual model as discussed in the previous section there are two main drivers for farmers to invest in plgf farm pond based irrigation and intensification these are aspiration and vulnerability the aspiration pathway refers to the situation when farmers with high risk taking ability choose to invest in the irrigation technology with the expectations to benefit from it vulnerability pathway on the other hand refers to the situation when farmers are induced to invest in the technology because of lack of other options as they experience the treadmill effect chatalova et al 2016 we develop a qualitative model fig 3 to show the causal relationships and feedbacks there are the two key reinforcing feedback loops 1 1 a reinforcing loop marked with has even number of negative links and it amplifies any perturbation introduced while a balancing loop marked with has odd number of negative links and it dampens the perturbation aspirational intensification and vulnerability induced intensification and one balancing feedback loop cost of assured water the aspirational intensification feedback loop indicates that farmers invest in plgf farm ponds and intensify by shifting from traditional crops to horticulture crops with the expectation of higher returns with the success of these initial farmers more farmers are attracted to follow suit this results in a reinforcing loop where more and more farmers are influenced to invest in farm ponds and greater area is shifted from traditional crops to horticulture however with every such intervention there is an impact on the hydrology of the region and a feedback to the human system in the form of increased groundwater stress the vulnerability induced intensification loop then captures the counter feedback from humans in response to this the vulnerability induced intensification loop indicates that the groundwater abstraction increases to meet the crop water requirement of the growing area under horticulture crops and to account for the evaporation loss from plgf farm ponds this increases the risk in access to groundwater for all and especially for the asset poor farmers and those whose farm plots are unfavourably located thereby leading to yield loss and crop failures as traditional crops become unviable due to the competitive groundwater extraction farmers are induced to invest in plgf farm pond based irrigation to get assured access to water and reduce the risk of falling short of water often this investment is made with financial loans the large investment in the structure necessitates a shift towards high value horticulture crops and the change in practice further impacts the hydrology resulting in a reinforcement feedback loop the two feedback loops together suggest that an initial introduction of the technology is likely to lead to an ever increasing investment and groundwater risk however the cost of assured water feedback is a balancing loop that suggests that there will be no incentive to invest in plgf farm ponds when groundwater risk increases to a level such that the cost of securing water for irrigation outweighs the benefit from shifting to horticulture when this happens the farm pond supported intensification is expected to stabilize however a qualitative model alone cannot help us determine if this stabilization is likely to lead to a sustainable level of intensification the level of risk in groundwater access is a function of the biophysical properties of the study region and important determinant of when the vulnerability induced intensification feedback starts to operate a quantitative system dynamics model is therefore useful to analyze the system behaviour with respect to the resource threshold 2 3 3 stock and flow model while the causal loop diagram gives us fundamental insights into feedback driven dynamics it does not help us in visualizing the evolution of the system for a given set of system parameters the system evolution depends on the relative strengths of reinforcing and balancing loops with time as the dominating loop changes the system transitions from one regime of operation to another these points of transition are dependent upon the underlying system parameters such as the aquifer properties market returns and risk perception a quantitative stock flow model allows us to simulate this a quantitative socio hydrological model however must go with some caveats humans are complex they are diverse inconsistent emotional purposive socially influenced on the other hand a formal approach such as modelling requires low dimensional representations leading to a tension as to what level of detail actors should be represented at melsen et al 2018 the more detailed an actor representation the more onerous is the data requirement to capture the required diversity effort to make realistic models leads to excessive complexity and may result in capturing too much noise leading to spurious correlation in our case quantification of qualitative parameters such as risk taking ability of humans has inherent limitations given these limitations a quantitative model must be considered successful if it aids understanding and helps expand the user s mental models to cross the limits imposed by bounded rationality while dealing with complex social biophysical systems in the presence of multiple competing feedback loops sd models are well suited to evaluate what if scenarios and provide important warnings they do not explore drivers at the level of the individual agent instead their power is in identifying general patterns that emerge due to the dynamic complexity in a coupled system structure in our stylised model defining the system boundary is an important step to bridge across different scales we select our boundary at the village community level a unit at which collective action is possible and one that shares a common fresh water resource pool this may not necessary align with the administrative boundary and the imagined community ferreyra et al 2008 may be in the form of multi level network of actors the watershed boundary and the aquifer boundary are typically much larger than the village boundary we account for this by modelling an open hydrological system which has surface and groundwater flows going into and out of the boundary to do this we use a lumped model approach mackay et al 2014 which discretizes the biophysical domain into homogenous lumps each with average properties thus we ignore spatial differences within the village and model it as a unit distinct from upstream and downstream lumped units fig 4 shows the main components of the hydrological and the social model and the feedbacks between them this is further elaborated in table 1 which relates the quantitative model with the conceptual model we model the community as being composed of different actor groups farmers with investments in farm ponds who practise horticulture a combination of seasonal vegetables and year round fruit orchards and farmers without investments in farm ponds who cultivate two seasons of traditional crops an important stakeholder group is that of asset poor farmers who practise rainfed farming only and the landless who depend upon shallow public wells to secure water for drinking and domestic use each group has a different water demand pattern through the year which is a function of its cropping pattern to model this the total cultivable land in the village is divided into four different stocks shown in social system of fig 4 the total water demand for each time step is based on irrigation and domestic demand and also considers the farm pond storage since part of it is lost to evaporation at any stage if available groundwater is unable to meet all water demand there is an allocation hierarchy based on which priority of access is assumed prasad and sohoni 2020 this allocation hierarchy is a significant aspect of the model which is developed from field level understanding of who has access to water during scarcity period when irrigation demand is not fulfilled for any group this leads to loss in its productivity non linear yield curves are used to compute yields as a function of irrigation provided a decision point is modelled every year before the start of the new monsoon when some farmers from a group may decide to make new investments in plgf farm pond driven intensification and hence shift to the group of farmers with farm ponds this is the key social parameterization in the model we use proxies to capture the two influencing drivers of aspiration and vulnerability as noted in table 1 the proxy that we use to model aspiration is the relative profitability of plgf farm pond owning farmer group to other farmers the greater the relative profitability the more number of farmers shift to the new irrigation technology to model vulnerability we use the proxy of groundwater risk i e the risk of irrigation shortfall by virtue of operating close to the resource level threshold this is computed as the ratio of net groundwater demand from all user groups to the total groundwater stock as this ratio increases it indicates increasing competition for groundwater which feeds into the number of farmers making the decision to invest in plgf farm ponds to assure water for irrigation the two factors are used together to model the number of new farm ponds built in each year which drives a shift in area under different cropping patterns and accordingly a change in the water demand this parameterization captures the observation that there are early adopters who are primarily driven by aspiration and followers who invest with a delay often after risk of irrigation shortfall rises further it also captures the reality that frequent droughts lead to an escalation in farm pond construction construction of new farm ponds is limited in the model by the profitability of farm ponds supported horticulture relative to traditional farm practice the yields of horticulture crop are modelled as highly sensitive to irrigation shortfall when farm pond farmers experience irrigation shortfall it reduces their profitability either due to lower output or higher cost of purchasing water tankers when this profitability becomes lower than that for the default crop choice no new farm ponds are constructed we design four scenarios see table 2 for analysing the impact of intensification at farm scale in contrast with its impact when viewed across scales with socio hydrological feedbacks we start with the baseline scenario the objective of the second scenario is to examine the socio hydrological impact of intensification at farm level with no feedback from other farmers or resource we then introduce the feedbacks to see the dynamics with no drought year scenario 3 and with periodic droughts scenario 4 to see the how the trend in intensification unfolds with respect to the resource threshold to evaluate if the practice leads to si the first two scenarios are static and hence have short model run duration the next two are dynamic scenarios which are run for 30 years in all scenarios except where explicitly stated we assume that there is one drought in five years and one instance of two consecutive drought years in a decade 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 baseline model we first model the scenario where there is no farm pond or water intensive farming in the region there is only single cropped area and traditional double cropped area requiring nominal irrigation the water level in the shallow wells is the key indicator of the health of the system and the one that can be visualised and monitored by all users results in fig 5 show the cyclic behaviour for average rainfall years and drought years years 3 6 and 7 water level in shallow wells rises from monsoon recharge and falls post monsoon due to water abstraction and groundwater flows in drought years the well may become completely dry e g in year 8 due to two consecutive droughts after a drought year it is possible for the groundwater level to recover fully if there is good rainfall as seen after year 4 and 8 monsoons there are baseflows flowing out of the system for a few months after the end of the monsoon season but they do not appear in drought years fig 5b it can be seen that in absence of investment in assured water access the cultivation of year round irrigated crops faces high risk of falling short of irrigation in poor rainfall years e g in year 7 as groundwater stock and the inflow together is not sufficient to meet the groundwater extraction demand this motivates investments in structures such as plgf farm ponds which we model in scenario 2 the validation of the hydrological model in the baseline scenario is done by comparing the hydrological behaviour in terms of shallow well level fluctuations and duration of baseflows to observations made by interviewed farmers in normal and drought years 3 2 scenario 2 farm level view of plgf farm pond we now model a scenario where we introduce ten private plgf farm ponds of 2 tcm thousand cubic meter capacity each fig 6a shows the farm pond operation groundwater is extracted in monsoon months to fill the plgf ponds this water is used during dry months of summer march to june for irrigation this is the time when well water levels drop and direct well irrigation is often not possible fig 6c the farm pond thus allows the farmer to practice year round irrigation each 2 tcm farm pond may assure dry season irrigation of about 0 4 ha of orchard using micro irrigation depending upon the specific crop choice and irrigation practice the average annual profitability per unit area of orchards is three times compared to that of traditional double cropping practice fig 6d from the point of view of the farmer even having secure access to only half of the stored water fig 6a in the driest months provides sufficient economic incentive to motivate plgf farm pond based intensification results shows that at the end of the drought year 3 horticulture cultivation continues to be profitable while profits from traditional farming fall due to insufficient irrigation fig 6b shows the increase in the overall groundwater demand as a result of the farm pond operation and intensification comparing year 0 with year 1 when ponds are introduced the change is seen in two ways i groundwater is extracted in monsoon months jun sep to fill farm ponds this is the time when the shallow aquifers are full and groundwater flows out from the system boundary as baseflows as seen in scenario 1 ii there is an increase in post monsoon irrigation demand when groundwater from shallow wells is used to irrigate the horticulture crop as long as the practice is limited to a small number of farms the scenario results show that farmers are able to intensify their practice within the resource envelope 3 3 scenario 3 multi year dynamics with no droughts we now incorporate the aspiration and vulnerability induced feedbacks in the model and observe the socio hydrological system dynamics for 30 years with no drought years droughts are incorporated in scenario 4 as seen in the results shown in fig 7 when the initial 10 plgf farm ponds are introduced perhaps as part of a government program it triggers a cycle of investments and intensification fig 7a b initially with increasing intensification well levels fall to greater depth fig 7c in the dry season but bounce back up to full in monsoon at one stage there is an exponential rise in the number of farm ponds and the area under intensification and by the time the level of intensification stabilizes the water table collapses and does not recover even during monsoon season the transitions observed are as a result of the relative strength of the feedback loops in action at first the aspirational investment feedback dominates as more farmers are encouraged to intensify due to relative profitability and everyone benefits as long as the total water use remains within resource threshold but increasing intensification leads to greater groundwater demand the impact of which is seen in lesser baseflows flowing out of the village post monsoon and well water levels falling to greater depths in summer though recovering during rainy season fig 7c these are early signs of groundwater stress after year 21 baseflows dry up completely and wells no longer fill up to the top in the monsoon season with every incremental rise in risk to groundwater access the vulnerability induced feedback mechanism gains more strength even as aspirational investment continues to dominate by year 24 intensification is at such a level that the groundwater demand is now greater than the available stock i e the carrying capacity of the system is exceeded the vulnerability induced investment in farm ponds becomes the dominating force as there is irrigation shortfall and farmers with poor access experience crop failures fig 7c shows that the first impact of unmet water demand is on domestic water needs followed by the traditional farmers who experience irrigation deficit while farmers with plgf farm ponds continue to meet their irrigation needs frequent crop failures of traditional double cropping farmers induce them to invest in plgf farm ponds to assure irrigation along with a shift to horticulture crops to recoup this investment as horticulture cultivation continues to be profitable fig 7d with the combined force of both feedback loops there is a larger increase in the rate of new farm ponds and area under water intensive crops finally by year 26 the groundwater stock falls so much that even farm pond owners are unable to meet their irrigation requirement and incur loss fig 7d it is at this point that the balancing loop gets activated and there is no longer any incentive to invest in any more new farm ponds however by the time this happens every single farmer is worse off compared to the situation from where they began economically each farmer group has lower profitability compared to the initial state in terms of their resources there is a catastrophic crisis in groundwater socially there is a crisis as well due to the poor state of shallow wells and drinking water stress experienced by the asset poor it is clear that the dynamics between the reinforcing and balancing loops shown in the causal loop diagram is such that by the time the balancing loop stops the increase in farm ponds significant damage is already done the result is the tragedy of the commons 3 4 scenario 4 multi year dynamics with droughts in the above section we simulated the dynamic situation assuming there were no droughts in this scenario we assume droughts appear in years 3 6 and 7 of every decade fig 8 shows that in the presence of droughts the same dynamic behaviour repeats but in an accelerated manner we see that in drought years even when the number of plgf farm ponds is low and therefore area under intensive cropping is also low for example in year 3 the poor groundwater availability due to the drought causes the demand to be in excess fig 8b thereby breaching the threshold for safe resource use and triggering the vulnerability induced intensification feedback fig 8c highlights the equity aspect in water access by showing that it is the users who depend upon shallow public wells for drinking water who first experience the scarcity after the drought in year 3 as intensification continues the traditional farmers become more vulnerable while the plgf farm pond supported farmers are the last to suffer water scarcity this is by design this drought proofing effect of the farm ponds and the comparative asset richness of farm pond owners effectively prioritizes the irrigation demand of the plgf farm pond supported farms before any other use as a trade off the burden of scarcity is entirely felt by the non farm pond owning farmers and other users of groundwater 4 discussion in situ farm ponds are generally considered to be a good farm practice that is recommended for sustainable intensification dile et al 2015 rao et al 2017 rockström et al 2017 our case study analyzes the use of plastic lined farm ponds which is being promoted in large parts of the shallow hard rock aquifer region of peninsular india and also in many parts of africa for drought proofing and supporting agricultural intensification our analysis shows that when viewed at the farm level without cross scale feedback effects the practice of using plastic lined ponds appears to be beneficial in enhancing farm output and shielding the farmer from droughts this is consistent with studies ansari 2016 kumar et al 2016 manojkumar et al 2020 yadav 2019 that recommend the use of lined farm ponds for securing dry spell irrigation and improved farm productivity however if we evaluate the impact over time and space by accounting for the feedbacks within and across scales we find a contradictory situation our modelling results show that in absence of any collective action and community control on intensification the reinforcing feedbacks lead to the system tipping over its resource threshold causing increased inequity in access to groundwater fall in agricultural productivity and ultimately the tragedy of the commons these dynamics are accelerated by frequent droughts the drought proofing characteristic of the plastic lined farm ponds is thus a paradox which can be unravelled by examining the cross scale effects while the farm ponds protect farmers from the impact of droughts an over reliance on them and the accompanying increase in irrigation demand due to intensification in fact results in aggravating the impact of droughts for the larger community this counter intuitive dynamics may be compared to the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018 that points to a similar contradiction which plays out at a larger scale in the use of dams and reservoirs which are constructed to alleviate water shortages but may in fact lead to worsening the impact of water shortages due to an increased water demand we find that this holds not only for big reservoirs at catchment scale but also as an aggregated effect of many small ponds at the smaller farm scale when constructed without coordination in practice ensuring sustainable intensification in shallow aquifers is further complicated by the fact that the threshold for safe water use is not a static one instead it is sensitive to short term fluctuations caused by variability in rainfall fishman et al 2011 we find that even if the intensification levels are such that groundwater use is below the carrying capacity of the system in an average rainfall year a drought year can cause the system to tip over initiating the dynamics of competitive investment and intensification thereby leading to high groundwater risk even in subsequent good rainfall years therefore sustainable intensification must necessarily be seasonally agile and one that responds to the changing threshold of safe groundwater use caused by rainfall variability increasing intensification in good rainfall years and scaling back in drought years thus always staying below the resource limit as pointed out by lankford 2004 ogilvie et al 2019 resource scarce and dynamically variable environments call for a shift from crop water requirement based irrigation centred thinking to a flexible resource centred thinking orchard cultivation reduces the adaptive capacity of farmers by locking them into fixed year round irrigation requirements in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment hence to practice si by remaining within the resource threshold it is recommended that seasonal horticulture crops are cultivated in good rainfall years possibly with the help of plastic lined farm ponds that transfer excess water from the wet to the dry season only in these years while the traditional low water intensity crops continue to be the default crop choice in other years such seasonally adaptive intensification will benefit from use of farm ponds in good years and ensure more equitable distribution of water in bad rainfall years while a detailed discussion on how to implement seasonally adaptive intensification is outside the scope of this paper it may be achieved by a bottom up community effort and co production of processes which enable the community to better recognize the limits of its common pool resource base and the costs of competition this means regular monitoring of water availability preparation of seasonal water budgets and agreements on adaptive cropping patterns so as to ensure that groundwater demand always remains below the available supply it would also require taking a hard stance against multi year crops that require fixed summer irrigation such as orchards there are examples of villages where such seasonally adaptive intensification is practiced through community action foster et al 2007 these examples are few on the contrary there are growing examples of villages with increasing investments in farm ponds and horticulture a very popular example is that of kadwanchi village in jalna district which is considered to be a role model by many with 700 mm of average annual rainfall and 1100 ha of cultivable land kadwanchi has more than 600 farm ponds that are filled through open wells and 540 ha of grape cultivation which continues to expand belsare 2020 media reports highlight that the per capita income has increased from inr 3000 in 1999 to inr 130 000 in less than two decades financial express 2017 belsare 2020 analysed the crop water demand for kadwanchi with respect to resource availability and found that the demand operates very close to the threshold in normal rainfall years when most rainfall in the village boundary is impounded and used but the demand far exceeds the threshold in poor rainfall years in such years water tankers are bought by villagers to meet drinking water and irrigation needs our model is a good representation for the developing situation in kadwanchi a direct impact is already observed in the downstream pirkalyan dam which villagers claim has not filled in last 10 years due to reduced flows belsare 2020 the economics of grape farming has so far allowed the farmers to remain profitable and for the intensification to continue despite signs of water stress will there be a limit to this growth and will a tragedy of the commons be experienced while this is yet to be seen our model suggests this is likely unless community action is taken to ensure adaptive intensification the growth of farm pond based intensification may be analysed in terms of the pendulum swing effect kandasamy et al 2014 the pendulum swing is seen as a combination of two feedback loops between people and the environment elshafei et al 2014 the first feedback is from exploitation of water resources to increase in economic output as this exploitation becomes excessive and there is a risk of a collapse this may create a feedback to the human agency communities may become more sensitive to the changing environment which may translate to changes in norms practices and regulations say by way of participatory groundwater management so as to swing the pendulum back and ensure that intensification levels remain sustainable in this paper our model captures only the first swing of this pendulum that culminates in a system collapse it does not capture a community response that may result due to triggered social sensitivity however our use of a socio hydrological lens in itself is reflexive and a way to exercise human agency through science that may potentially lead to greater community sensitivity and institutional changes then we may be able to move away from sweeping pendulum swings and instead co evolve as balanced coupled human water systems there are several directions for future work cross scale socio hydrological case studies of villages that are on the path of intensive horticulture and its feedback at the catchment scale will add further insight the use of remote sensing technology such as gramdrishti tundia et al 2020 which uses satellite images to identify farm ponds can be very powerful to track growth in farm pond density and validate or warn of emergent dynamics implementation of our recommendations requires participatory action research with stakeholders to motivate the practice of seasonal adaptive intensification and develop supporting processes and tools in the same vein there is also a need to co produce policy inputs for government programs that currently promote farm ponds and horticulture without cognizance of their relation with the resource limit 5 conclusions in this paper we analyze how inter connections between resource level thresholds and farm level decisions are important for achieving sustainable intensification we use the case study of ongoing intensification in the shallow hard rock aquifers of western india which is driven by a relative new irrigation technology the plastic lined groundwater filled farm pond we find that from a static farm level view the farm pond is beneficial in shielding farmers from effects of drought and in increasing farm productivity however a system dynamics analysis shows that the result is in fact contradictory when within and across scale socio hydrological feedbacks are considered this happens as intensification levels rise driven by aspiration and vulnerability induced pathways resulting in groundwater demand exceeding the threshold of safe use practicing si is complicated by the fact that the limit for safe groundwater use in shallow aquifers is not a static one but one that changes every year due to variability in rainfall our model shows that in drought years the carrying capacity of water resource falls significantly so that even a low level of intensification may tip the system above its threshold resulting in a tragedy of the commons achieving si in this context requires a seasonally adaptive intensification practice which retains the adaptive capacity of farmers instead of locking them into fixed annual irrigation requirement in a highly uncertain and resource scarce environment we thus conclude that the recognition and translation of resource level thresholds to an actionable level is key to practicing si declaration of competing interest the

colleagues hemant belsare and gopal chavan from iit bombay for many detailed discussions we are grateful to charlotte de fraiture and pieter van der zaag ihe delft for their valuable comments on the manuscript appendix a growth of plastic lined farm ponds there is no official data available on the total number of plastic lined groundwater filled plgf farm ponds that are in use in the country here we estimate the number of farm ponds in one block of our study area by using data collected from different government departments and using gramdrishti tundia et al 2020 sinnar is a semi arid block in nashik district which has been classified as semi critical in terms of groundwater development by the state groundwater authority the block is made up of 130 villages and has a total cultivable area of 98 225 ha the first plastic lined farm ponds in the block were introduced in the state of maharashtra by the national horticulture mission nhm in 2005 farm ponds were subsequently subsidized under different government programs such as rashtriya krishi vikas yojna rkvy between 2007 and 12 maharashtra rural employment guarantee scheme mregs between 2009 and 12 magel tyala shettale scheme from 2016 to 18 and world bank funded project on climate resilient agriculture pocra from 2018 onwards the farm ponds implemented under nhm are plastic lined and for the explicit use of irrigating horticulture crops the farm ponds subsidized in other schemes are unlined farm ponds some with provision of inlet and outlet openings to channel stream water in to fill the farm ponds however field work shows that most farm ponds in the area are used as storage tanks which the farmers line with plastic sheets at their own cost and use to store groundwater or water from wells adjoining canals and reservoirs the most common size of farm ponds in government schemes are 30mx30mx3m except for farm ponds constructed under nhm which are significantly larger but the actual size depends upon the area available to the farmer and the area to be irrigated table a1 provides the official figures of farm ponds approved under different schemes in sinnar block between the years 2006 and 2017 it must be noted that the actual number of farm ponds is significantly larger as many farm ponds are built by farmers without any government subsidy to estimate the total number we use gramdrishti a system to detect objects using satellite images gramdrishti was able to detect 3041 farm ponds in sinnar block majority of which is expected to be used as plastic lined farm ponds fig a1 shows a village wise map of the number of farm ponds detected using gramdrishti in sinnar block the map also marks villages which face severe drinking water scarcity and repeatedly depend upon state tankers for delivery

9621,a significant increase in surface water salinization in low lying deltas is expected globally due to saline groundwater exfiltration driven by rising sea levels and decreasing freshwater availability sustaining fresh water dependent agriculture in such areas will entail an increased demand for fresh water flushing unfortunately the flushing of surface water is not operationally optimised and results in excessive use of scarce freshwater to meet the increased demand for flushing while minimizing the need for diverted freshwater new operational designs are required this paper presents a novel network model based approach that uses de saint venant sv and advection dispersion ad equations to optimize multiple objectives on water level and salinity control using a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc the resulting nmpc problem is solved with a receding horizon implementation where the nonlinear program nlp at each iteration is solved using state of the art large scale interior point solver ipopt we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the traditional fixed flushing for a representative dutch polder firstly the approach is shown to be capable of controlling the water level and salinity level in the polder secondly the results highlight that the network of canals which were originally made for drainage could not be made sufficiently fresh with current intake capacity a simple design approach was used to identify appropriate new capacities for two of the gates that allow optimal flushing to guarantee the required water level and salinity constraints keywords groundwater exfiltration irrigation nonlinear model predictive control nmpc nonlinear optimization polder salinity water quality control 1 introduction polders are low lying artificially drained embanked lands surrounded by storage canals fig 1 although the netherlands is associated with polders totaling around 4000 nationwide polders are found in coastal areas across the world delsman 2015 dominant land use in polders is mostly agriculture elevations of polders are generally below the surrounding area resulting in a necessity for continuous drainage of excess water using a dense network of water canals or ditches in the polder delsman 2015 water levels in polder networks are kept within a predefined narrow margin using both intake structures and pumping stations accumulated storm water in the polder is transported to the pumping station and is pumped out of the polder onto the surrounding water storage canals the so called boezems water storage canals are used for providing extra freshwater during dry periods to replenish precipitation deficits and for creating storage space for the surplus water from polders during wet periods schoubroeck and kool 2010 agricultural activities as well as the freshwater ecosystem in the polders are threatened by surface water salinization due to saline groundwater exfiltration de louw et al 2011 raats 2015 land subsidence climate change and sea level rise increase the salinization of polders by enhancing the salt water intrusion rate oude essink et al 2010 to maintain an acceptable salinity level freshwater diverted from rivers is used to flush the polder and keep the surface water salinity levels below a certain threshold while not violating the water level constraints of the system current practice of flushing control generally relies on constant flushing where the inlet culverts are kept open while the resulting excess water is pumped out from the other side of the polder typically this lasts from the beginning until the end of the crop growing season resulting in excess use of freshwater and unnecessary pumping delsman 2015 de louw et al 2011 alfonso et al 2010 in the netherlands 15 of total freshwater supply is currently used for surface water flushing klijn et al 2012 and efficient surface water flushing is listed as a necessity to decrease surface water demand delta programme commissioner 2019 efficient water management in polders should aim to regulate water levels salinity levels and fresh water usage by manipulating the intake and pump flows therefore the operational control objectives for this case study implemented in this manuscript is selected as water level needs to stay between predetermined thresholds always for safety demand satisfaction and to maintain groundwater levels in operational limits for the drainage system salinity level needs to be below a certain threshold when necessary for agricultural and ecological usage and feshwater use and pumping cost should be minimized the relation between these sub objectives may be conflicting additional freshwater from the intakes is necessary to satisfy the salinity level objective which will result in increased usage of freshwater and pump flows this may result in violations of water levels resulting in a complex multi objective control problem an advanced control algorithm for polder flushing to control salinity level and water quantity will increase the efficiency of the system model predictive control mpc is a popular technique and has been used in the control of water systems including drinking water networks sampathirao et al 2017 irrigation systems shang et al 2019 delgoda et al 2016 aydin et al 2016 romero et al 2012 hassani et al 2019 flood control tian et al 2015 and polders aydin et al 2019b xu et al 2013 if the processes that are controlled are regulated around a fixed operating point the process models can be linearized this allows the application of linear mpc kayacan et al 2014 as applied in aydin et al 2019b for optimal salinity and water level control of water courses however in operation of a polder network different salinity thresholds can be considered according to the farmer needs depending on the type and salt tolerance of the crop cultivated a crop with low salt tolerance will require better water quality low salinity concentration in the polder than a crop with high salinity tolerance to achieve sustainable irrigation water management the possible variation in time and space of salinity threshold should be considered in the design of the controller moreover spatial and temporal variation of saline groundwater disturbances make local linearization inefficient in terms of future system behaviour predictions here we consider a nmpc strategy that is based on the receding horizon principle it can optimize the predicted future system behaviour by solving a nonlinear program nlp on line at each control time step tavernini et al 2018 and has been used for water systems in nederkoorn et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the main advantage of nmpc is the ability to explicitly implement the constraints on inputs outputs and states in the optimization problem kayacan et al 2014 for water quality salinity and quantity control model based approaches have also been used in literature where an mpc strategy to control the average salinity concentration in a ditch using a reservoir model have been considered in xu et al 2013 2010 this study was followed by applying a model reduction technique for an internal model to control downstream salinity concentration in open channels in a recent study we achieved point salinity control in a single pool by explicitly considering freshwater conservation using linearized saint venant sv and advection dispersion ad equations as the internal model of the mpc scheme aydin et al 2019b we used real saline groundwater exfiltration data for the first time to test the developed mpc scheme although the results were promising the formulations of the previous studies were limited to either control of channels connected in series or controlling the average salinity at one location only our previous study aydin et al 2019b was the first attempt to minimize the freshwater usage but it was limited to the control of single channel in a real polder network multiple channels with different salinity concentrations are connected with or without hydraulic structures in between them mixing at the connection nodes is very important since the inflow concentration of downstream channels depend on the concentration of the upstream channels therefore mixing at the connection nodes and the spatially varying salinity concentrations in a polder should be considered in optimization for polder flushing motivated by the above mentioned arguments we propose in this study a novel nmpc framework for efficient flushing control in low lying polders to the best knowledge of the authors this is the first case where a real world polder network is controlled with a nmpc framework to achieve the dynamic control that respects water quality salinty needs in time and space we first formulate the nmpc problem based on sv and ad equations to model the dynamics of the water and salt transport in the polder for flushing subsequently parameters and constraints of the model are defined in this work we follow the direct collocation approach of first discretize and then optimize for dynamical systems betts 2010 where the optimal control problem is discretized and parametrized resulting in a nonlinear programming nlp problem at each control time step the nlp problem is solved over the prediction horizon and only the control action for the first time step is implemented with a receding horizon principle where the prediction and optimal control calculations are repeated as the prediction horizon slides along in this study we use a state of the art open source optimization software ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 to solve the resulting nlps simulation examples of flushing control of a representative dutch polder the lissertocht catchment are presented to illustrate the closed loop performance of the developed nmpc scheme as a case study finally we investigate the results and suggest an improvement to the performance of the controller by upgrading the fresh water intake capacities of the polder 2 system model transport of water and dissolved matter have to be considered to model the flushing of a polder hof and schuurmans 2000 for a single

appendix a eq 4 is defined for a single channel and needs to be extended to a network of channels in order to represent the system dynamics of a polder network to explain the method we consider the simple network of three channels with 2 inflows and 1 outflow shown in fig 2 where the eqs 1 and 2 are discretized as in eq 4 the full system dynamics of the simple three channel network shown is

channel u r n u is the input vector for the network that has all of the inflow and outflow discharges of the individual channels the number of states n x is the sum of the number of states for each channel and depends on the discretization spacing chosen and the length of channels on the other hand the total number of the inputs n u is two times the total number of channels which is 6 for the network given in fig 2 having one pair of inflow and outflow for each channel in addition to the system dynamics given in eq 5 mass conservation at connection nodes has to be considered as a

are represented by q j o u t and c j o u t j 1 2 3 together the system dynamics given in eq 5 and the mass conservation constraints given in eqs 6 7 can be extended to model the dynamics of any polder network for flushing the size of the resulting state space model and number of constraints will depend on the number of channels and how they are connected to each other for the real case study of

constraint is implemented using the existing maximum h and minimum h allowable water levels of the polder however using a hard constraint is not feasible for salinity control due to the salinity characteristics of the polder system at certain times salinity concentrations higher than the set point can be observed which sometimes may not be possible to flush out depending on the capacity of the system on the other hand salinity concentrations below the salinity threshold are fresher than what is required and thus they are not a problem in terms of salinity control to penalize only the positive violations above the salinity threshold we introduce a soft constraint as explained in maciejowski et al 2002 for salinity control and depicted in fig 3 soft constraints on salinity concentration are implemented using a combination of a virtual input u and a virtual state e c virtual state e c has a very high penalty in the objective function and is activated only if there is a positive violation of the salinity concentration fig 3 illustrates a trajectory of salinity concentration solid blue line an upper threshold for salinity levels black dashed line virtual input red

saline groundwater exfiltration data we performed simulations for controlling the flushing operation of the lissertocht catchment the catchment is located approximately 25 km southwest of the city of amsterdam fig 4 it can be considered as a representative deep polder in the netherlands where the main source of salinity is deep saline groundwater exfiltration through boils that are preferential flow paths intersecting the holocene cover layer de louw et al 2010 the discharge and concentration of the boils are rather constant while the other sources of salt ditch and drain exfiltration have temporal variations different sources of the saline groundwater exfiltration in the lissertocht catchment have been studied and modelled in delsman et al 2013 spatial variation of boils in the lissertocht catchment see red dots in fig 4 results in heterogeneity in salinity disturbance salinity concentration variation in the ditches of the lissertocht catchment is given in between 0 136 and 5 453 kg m3 delsman et al 2013 upstream main channels close to the intakes have fresh water while the downstream main channels are affected by the boils and higher salinity concentrations are observed to decrease the surface water salinity freshwater is supplied through five inlets with a total capacity of 0 0956 m3 s see table 1 for the capacity of each intake a main pumping station with a capacity of 1 48 m3 s is used to maintain the water level around the set point h ref in this study we focused on these five intakes and the main pumping station as the control structures used to regulate the water level and salinity concentration in the polder the main land use in the area is agriculture and the salinity concentration and water quantity requirement of the farmers varies depending on the crop cultivated in aydin et al 2019a we optimized the salinity sensor placement for real time control of polder flushing in the main channels using salinity data set of the lissertocht catchment the details of the models used and the data set is not the focus of this manuscript and can be found in aydin et al 2019a similarly in this study we focused on controlling the salinity concentration and water quantity of the main channels of the lissertocht catchment fig 4 that transfer the freshwater from intakes to the pumping station to test the performance of the nmpc scheme we selected a 30 day dry period 8 may 2013 6 june 2013 shown in fig 5 with a very intense rainfall in between aydin et al 2019a we model the lissertocht catchment with 14 main channels depicted with numbers in fig 4 aggregating a number of connected main ditches drainage channels with a connection to the main channels are represented as lateral flows to the main channels transporting the excessive water in the polder parcels collected by the drainage system drainage channels can provide a buffer for water level variations and salt load in the polder and during severe drought flow from main channels to the drainage channels can be observed however in accordance with the characteristics of the selected test period in this study water flows and the associated inflow concentrations from these drainage channels to the main channels are used as known disturbances based on real world saline exfiltration data of the catchment as modelled in aydin et al 2019a table 2 4 2 parameters for modelling and control in this work our control goal is to maintain the water level around the set point of 6 45 m in the polder with a maximum deviation of 0 05 m for salinity level control a salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 1500 mg l is imposed in accordance with the requirements of the responsible water authority of the area the rijnland district water control board we controlled the water level and salinity concentration at the end of each main channel for the spatial discretization of eq 10 we used a discretization spacing of 50 m and for the temporal discretization we used 1 min as the simulation time step and 1 h as the control time interval t c to capture the slow dynamics of the salt transport we implement a prediction horizon of 24 h resulting in 24 prediction steps n c for the controller the system model consists of 12528 states water level and salinity concentration deviations and the virtual states 1008 control inputs inflows outflows and the virtual inputs 9 connection nodes and 28 water level and salinity concentration control points weight used in eq 10 are filled with the values given in table 3 for each channel of the network depending on the state or input penalized as an initial guess for the weights penalizing the states and the inputs used in this study we used the maximum allowed value estimate mave described in van overloop 2006 an estimate of how much a state or a control input may vary is selected as the mave of that variable for example a mave of 0 05 m was used for the water level deviation which is equal to the allowed deviation from the water level set point and the weight in the objective function is calculated as the reciprocal of the square of the mave as 1 0 05 2 400 following similar approaches for the other states and inputs penalized and analyzing results of different settings we decided on the values given in table 3 that ensures no violation of the water level constraints 4 3 results the described nmpc framework is used to control the water level and the salinity concentration of the lissetrocht catchment the simulation results are presented in figs 7 8 to illustrate the difference between the current flushing practice in the lissertocht catchment fixed flushing during the crop growing season the results of the nmpc scheme is compared with fixed flushing all computations were performed within matlab r2019a installed on a 3 50 ghz intel xeon machine with 16 gb of ram running windows 10 the acceptable tolerance of constraint violation option of ipopt was set to 10 3 we limited the maximum number of iterations to 100 and the average control computation time resulted in 120 s which is much smaller than the control time step of 1 h fig 6 shows the controlled water level at the downstream end of the catchment close to the pumping station as can be seen nmpc keeps the water level around the set point of 6 45 m due to the hard constraint introduced for the water level control and the high penalty for water level deviation table 3 in the optimization problem water levels in all channels stay around the water level set point the fluctuations in the water level are in the order of millimeters and they are within the predefined upper and lower bounds of water level the nmpc scheme successfully controls the water level by reacting to the disturbances from groundwater exfiltration shown in fig 5 the controlled discharges of the inlet gates are shown in fig 7 for the whole test period a moving average over 24 h for better visualization all of the gates have an initial flow of 0 05 m3 s and the nmpc scheme immediately increases the flows at the beginning of the test period this behavior is a reaction to the increasing salinity concentrations in the main channels of the polder as can be seen in fig 8 a c d f the salinity concentration at these channels increases due to the mixing of the boils in those channels nmpc uses a 24 h prediction horizon and therefore reacts to these predicted violations of salinity concentrations as soon as possible and increases the intake discharge maximum capacities of the intakes which are used by the fixed flushing strategy over the whole simulation period are shown with dashed red horizontal lines in fig 7 a e as can be seen the nmpc scheme operates the system using flushing discharges close to the individual capacities of the intakes except intake i 4 fig 7 d which has the lowest capacity compared to the other intakes the pumping discharge shown in fig 7 f shows similar behaviour for both options fixed flushing resulting in a slightly higher pumping as expected the total volume of water used by each intake and the total volume of flushing and pumping are reported in table 4 the total freshwater savings compared to the fixed flushing is 19 5 while the savings in pumping volume is lower at 11 9 since the system also pumps out later inflows that drain into the channels the individual savings from each intake varied between 12 0 and 35 5 fig 8 shows the salinity concentrations at the downstream end for six main channels these six main channels either have saline boils in them eg main channel 14 in fig 4 or have a direct connection to drainage channels with saline boils eg main channels 2 6 11 12 and 13 therefore the salinity concentration in these channels exceeds the salinity concentration threshold set by irrigation requirements moreover depending on the location of the channel in the polder one or more intakes can provide freshwater to these main channels for example main channel 2 can only be flushed using the intake i 1 while intakes i 1 to i 3 can provide freshwater for main channel 11 as can be seen in fig 4 making this main channel fresh for the most of the considered time the remaining eight main channels in the catchment main channels 1 10 except 2 and 6 have no boils connected to them and the ditch exfiltration into these channels is fresh therefore salinity in these channels remains fresher and within constraints in terms of salinity control in this model run it is clear that the nmpc scheme does not perform as well as the water level control however comparison with the fixed flushing gives much more information in terms of the capacity of the system and therefore the performance of the nmpc scheme the dashed lines in fig 8 a f show the salinity concentrations at the end of each channel with fixed flushing this is a benchmark for the nmpc scheme since the nmpc uses values close to the flushing capacity for most intakes salinity concentration at these points cannot drop below this level with the given flushing capacity of intakes for example as can be seen in fig 8 a the salinity concentration drops below the threshold of 1 5 kg m3 only around the date 20 05 13 this corresponds to the period of the simulation when the intensive rainfall results in a peak in fresh groundwater exfiltration which flushes the catchment naturally the nmpc scheme achieves the salinity level control goal in the main channels 11 and 13 fig 8 c and e on the other hand the nmpc scheme fails to drop the salinity concentration below the threshold for the other four main channels presented in fig 8 main channels 12 and 14 are at the downstream end of the network and they carry most of the high saline water to the pumping station therefore higher salinity concentrations are observed in these two main channels moreover as can be seen in fig 8 d f the performance of the fixed flushing is also not good for main channels 12 and 14 and the salinity concentrations are close to the values achieved by the nmpc the biggest difference in terms of salinity control performance between fixed flushing and nmpc is observed in main channels 2 and 6 fig 8 a b these two main channels are on the upstream side of the catchment where main channel 6 can only be flushed by intake i 4 directly connected to main channel 6 and main channel 2 can only be flushed by intake i 1 freshwater should first be transported through main channel 1 see also fig 4 the nmpc scheme prefers not to use the full capacity of intakes i 1 and i 4 and saves water in exchange for higher salinity in two main channels this is a trade off between salinity and freshwater usage and it is further elaborated in the next paragraph salinity control performance is directly related to the amount of freshwater usage combining the information given in table 4 and fig 8 it can be concluded that there is more freshwater availability for intakes i 1 and i 4 that should be able to dilute the salinity concentration in main channels 2 and 6 respectively however as can be seen in table 4 the capacities of intake i 1 and i 4 are utilized the least compared to the other intakes at first the reason why the nmpc does not utilize the maximum capacities of intakes i 1 and i 4 to decrease the higher concentrations in the upstream main channels 2 and 6 was not apparent a posteriori analysis of the polder network and the results reveal a possible reason related to the flushing capacities and the salt transport dynamics described by the ad equations when a channel is flushed water with high salinity concentration in the channel is transferred to the downstream channels of the polder and finally pumped out of the system if a channel is not flushed salinity concentration in that channel will increase locally and later through very slow dispersive mechanism will spread to the rest of the polder the nmpc makes use of this behaviour defined by the system dynamics in the constraints and decides to transport less salt water from main channels 2 and 6 to the downstream channels by carrying less salt water downstream it decreases the need for freshwater usage in the remainder of the polder alternative routes that carry fresher water are preferred to flush the downstream channels for example downstream of main channel 2 and 6 are main channels 11 and 13 respectively as shown in fig 8 salinity concentrations in these two downstream main channels are most of the time below the salinity threshold freshwater necessary to decrease the salinity is mostly provided by alternative routes through intakes i 2 i 3 and i 5 freshwater provided by these three intakes travels without mixing with saline groundwater through at least one main channel and reaches downstream as a fresher water source in the considered case here since the salinity concentrations are controlled in all main channels with equal weighting the nmpc scheme allows higher concentrations in channels 2 and 6 in exchange for saving freshwater use which is one of three weighted objectives for the controller in the next section we consider upgrading intake capacity as a future possibility for the stakeholders to guarantee lower salinity levels based on simplistic mixing we propose potential upgrades in intake capacity and test their performance both under fixed flushing and under the advanced nmpc schemes 4 4 system update to improve the salinity control performance results presented in the previous section showed that the salinity control performance was hampered by insufficient capacity of intakes i 1 and i 4 as described in detail in the previous section main canals 2 and 6 had very large salt loads draining into them but were serviced by intakes i 1 and i 4 respectively which did not have high enough capacities to dilute them sufficiently therefore in this section we provide a simple system update by increasing the capacities of these intakes to improve the salinity control performance of the nmpc framework we focus on decreasing the salinity concentration in main channels 2 and 6 so that the nmpc could choose to flush them to downstream channels when favorable to allow the nmpc to flush these channels we calculated the maximum salt loads summation of the multiplication of all saline groundwater exfiltration discharges with its concentration discharging to these channels we then used this maximum salt load to calculate the minimum freshwater intake levels from i 1 and i 4 respectively required to dilute these channels to the salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 summation of all the salt load of all fresh and saline flows equal to the threshold of course the capacities could be further increased to trade off water quality levels with freshwater use by considering the worst scenario of no rain to naturally flush the system and the number of existing boils discharging directly or through drainage channels to these two main channels we estimated the necessary freshwater intake to dilute the high saline water in these main channels using eqs 6 7 we increased the capacities of intake i 1 from 0 0162 m3 s to 0 0342 m3 s and of intake i 4 from 0 0097 m3 s to 0 0136 m3 s respectively to bring average salinity levels to below the threshold of 1 5 kg m3 keeping the rest of the parameters as the original setting we simulated the system and the results are presented in figs 9 10 where also results of the original configuration and fixed flushing with the updated capacities are included for comparison fig 9 presents the controlled discharges of the intakes and the pumping station full capacity of all intakes were used by the fixed flushing and are shown with a dashed line similar to fig 7 all of the intakes start with an initial flow and the nmpc immediately increases the flushing from all of the intakes due to the increased capacities flushing through intakes i 1 and i 4 is increased as expected for the upgraded case where the nmpc scheme is applied the rest of the intakes behave similarly to the original setting i e fig 7 the salinity control performance of the updated system both fixed flushing and nmpc compared with the original configuration nmpc is shown in fig 10 compared to the original configuration blue lines in fig 10 both fixed flushing red dashed line in fig 10 and the nmpc black dotted line in fig 10 of the updated system brings the salinity concentrations in main channels 2 and 6 below salinity threshold see between the dates 12 5 2013 and 17 5 2013 in figs 10 a b as expected due to the increased intake capacities fixed flushing resulted in the lowest salinity concentrations in all channels using the full capacity of the intakes salinity concentrations in all channels dropped below the salinity threshold i e it is possible to intake the maximum freshwater possible and so reduce peak salt loads in the whole system albeit using more freshwater than necessary the nmpc scheme utilized the increased capacities of intakes i 1 and i 4 and additional freshwater from these intakes to dilute and flush the high saline water in the main channels 2 and 6 see figs 10 a b in comparison to the fixed flushing nmpc did not use the full capacity of the intakes but only the necessary amount calculated by the optimization to bring the salinity concentration to the salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 in the upstream channels as a result of additional flushing water used salinity control performance of the nmpc scheme significantly improved in all channels for the updated system the nmpc scheme used around 20 less freshwater compared to the fixed flushing 2 46 105 m3 for the nmpc and 3 05 105 m3 for fixed flushing for both fixed flushing and nmpc the better salinity performance comes at the price of using more freshwater from the increased capacities around 19 increase 5 conclusion in this paper we propose a novel nmpc framework for optimal flushing control in polders we presented a network model to optimize multiple objectives and tested the controller in a low lying dutch polder the lissertocht catchment as a case study the proposed nmpc scheme is mathematically explained implemented and used for this case study to control salinity concentration and water quantity in all main channels of the network in simulation experiments sufficient performance for water level control was achieved by keeping the water level always within set boundaries salinity control performance of the nmpc however appeared to be unsatisfactory due to the limited intake capacity post analysis of the network and the nmpc results allowed us to determine a simple design update of the system we achieved a satisfactory salinity control performance by updating the intake capacity of two intake gates both in the original and updated system freshwater usage is reduced by around 20 using the nmpc compared to the fixed flushing strategy presently in operation in the lissertocht catchment we believe that the framework presented in this paper is one of the first steps towards the application of nmpc schemes for better management of freshwater resources in irrigation polders it is useful for irrigation water management in low lying delta areas with shallow saline groundwater further research on coupling this nmpc scheme with irrigation scheduling optimization frameworks will provide valuable information

9621,a significant increase in surface water salinization in low lying deltas is expected globally due to saline groundwater exfiltration driven by rising sea levels and decreasing freshwater availability sustaining fresh water dependent agriculture in such areas will entail an increased demand for fresh water flushing unfortunately the flushing of surface water is not operationally optimised and results in excessive use of scarce freshwater to meet the increased demand for flushing while minimizing the need for diverted freshwater new operational designs are required this paper presents a novel network model based approach that uses de saint venant sv and advection dispersion ad equations to optimize multiple objectives on water level and salinity control using a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc the resulting nmpc problem is solved with a receding horizon implementation where the nonlinear program nlp at each iteration is solved using state of the art large scale interior point solver ipopt we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the traditional fixed flushing for a representative dutch polder firstly the approach is shown to be capable of controlling the water level and salinity level in the polder secondly the results highlight that the network of canals which were originally made for drainage could not be made sufficiently fresh with current intake capacity a simple design approach was used to identify appropriate new capacities for two of the gates that allow optimal flushing to guarantee the required water level and salinity constraints keywords groundwater exfiltration irrigation nonlinear model predictive control nmpc nonlinear optimization polder salinity water quality control 1 introduction polders are low lying artificially drained embanked lands surrounded by storage canals fig 1 although the netherlands is associated with polders totaling around 4000 nationwide polders are found in coastal areas across the world delsman 2015 dominant land use in polders is mostly agriculture elevations of polders are generally below the surrounding area resulting in a necessity for continuous drainage of excess water using a dense network of water canals or ditches in the polder delsman 2015 water levels in polder networks are kept within a predefined narrow margin using both intake structures and pumping stations accumulated storm water in the polder is transported to the pumping station and is pumped out of the polder onto the surrounding water storage canals the so called boezems water storage canals are used for providing extra freshwater during dry periods to replenish precipitation deficits and for creating storage space for the surplus water from polders during wet periods schoubroeck and kool 2010 agricultural activities as well as the freshwater ecosystem in the polders are threatened by surface water salinization due to saline groundwater exfiltration de louw et al 2011 raats 2015 land subsidence climate change and sea level rise increase the salinization of polders by enhancing the salt water intrusion rate oude essink et al 2010 to maintain an acceptable salinity level freshwater diverted from rivers is used to flush the polder and keep the surface water salinity levels below a certain threshold while not violating the water level constraints of the system current practice of flushing control generally relies on constant flushing where the inlet culverts are kept open while the resulting excess water is pumped out from the other side of the polder typically this lasts from the beginning until the end of the crop growing season resulting in excess use of freshwater and unnecessary pumping delsman 2015 de louw et al 2011 alfonso et al 2010 in the netherlands 15 of total freshwater supply is currently used for surface water flushing klijn et al 2012 and efficient surface water flushing is listed as a necessity to decrease surface water demand delta programme commissioner 2019 efficient water management in polders should aim to regulate water levels salinity levels and fresh water usage by manipulating the intake and pump flows therefore the operational control objectives for this case study implemented in this manuscript is selected as water level needs to stay between predetermined thresholds always for safety demand satisfaction and to maintain groundwater levels in operational limits for the drainage system salinity level needs to be below a certain threshold when necessary for agricultural and ecological usage and feshwater use and pumping cost should be minimized the relation between these sub objectives may be conflicting additional freshwater from the intakes is necessary to satisfy the salinity level objective which will result in increased usage of freshwater and pump flows this may result in violations of water levels resulting in a complex multi objective control problem an advanced control algorithm for polder flushing to control salinity level and water quantity will increase the efficiency of the system model predictive control mpc is a popular technique and has been used in the control of water systems including drinking water networks sampathirao et al 2017 irrigation systems shang et al 2019 delgoda et al 2016 aydin et al 2016 romero et al 2012 hassani et al 2019 flood control tian et al 2015 and polders aydin et al 2019b xu et al 2013 if the processes that are controlled are regulated around a fixed operating point the process models can be linearized this allows the application of linear mpc kayacan et al 2014 as applied in aydin et al 2019b for optimal salinity and water level control of water courses however in operation of a polder network different salinity thresholds can be considered according to the farmer needs depending on the type and salt tolerance of the crop cultivated a crop with low salt tolerance will require better water quality low salinity concentration in the polder than a crop with high salinity tolerance to achieve sustainable irrigation water management the possible variation in time and space of salinity threshold should be considered in the design of the controller moreover spatial and temporal variation of saline groundwater disturbances make local linearization inefficient in terms of future system behaviour predictions here we consider a nmpc strategy that is based on the receding horizon principle it can optimize the predicted future system behaviour by solving a nonlinear program nlp on line at each control time step tavernini et al 2018 and has been used for water systems in nederkoorn et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the main advantage of nmpc is the ability to explicitly implement the constraints on inputs outputs and states in the optimization problem kayacan et al 2014 for water quality salinity and quantity control model based approaches have also been used in literature where an mpc strategy to control the average salinity concentration in a ditch using a reservoir model have been considered in xu et al 2013 2010 this study was followed by applying a model reduction technique for an internal model to control downstream salinity concentration in open channels in a recent study we achieved point salinity control in a single pool by explicitly considering freshwater conservation using linearized saint venant sv and advection dispersion ad equations as the internal model of the mpc scheme aydin et al 2019b we used real saline groundwater exfiltration data for the first time to test the developed mpc scheme although the results were promising the formulations of the previous studies were limited to either control of channels connected in series or controlling the average salinity at one location only our previous study aydin et al 2019b was the first attempt to minimize the freshwater usage but it was limited to the control of single channel in a real polder network multiple channels with different salinity concentrations are connected with or without hydraulic structures in between them mixing at the connection nodes is very important since the inflow concentration of downstream channels depend on the concentration of the upstream channels therefore mixing at the connection nodes and the spatially varying salinity concentrations in a polder should be considered in optimization for polder flushing motivated by the above mentioned arguments we propose in this study a novel nmpc framework for efficient flushing control in low lying polders to the best knowledge of the authors this is the first case where a real world polder network is controlled with a nmpc framework to achieve the dynamic control that respects water quality salinty needs in time and space we first formulate the nmpc problem based on sv and ad equations to model the dynamics of the water and salt transport in the polder for flushing subsequently parameters and constraints of the model are defined in this work we follow the direct collocation approach of first discretize and then optimize for dynamical systems betts 2010 where the optimal control problem is discretized and parametrized resulting in a nonlinear programming nlp problem at each control time step the nlp problem is solved over the prediction horizon and only the control action for the first time step is implemented with a receding horizon principle where the prediction and optimal control calculations are repeated as the prediction horizon slides along in this study we use a state of the art open source optimization software ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 to solve the resulting nlps simulation examples of flushing control of a representative dutch polder the lissertocht catchment are presented to illustrate the closed loop performance of the developed nmpc scheme as a case study finally we investigate the results and suggest an improvement to the performance of the controller by upgrading

appendix a eq 4 is defined for a single channel and needs to be extended to a network of channels in order to represent the system dynamics of a polder network to explain the method we consider the simple network of three channels with 2 inflows and 1 outflow shown in fig 2 where the eqs 1 and 2 are discretized as in eq 4 the full system dynamics of the simple three channel network shown is

channel u r n u is the input vector for the network that has all of the inflow and outflow discharges of the individual channels the number of states n x is the sum of the number of states for each channel and depends on the discretization spacing chosen and the length of channels on the other hand the total number of the inputs n u is two times the total number of channels which is 6 for the network given in fig 2 having one pair of inflow and outflow for each channel in addition to the system dynamics given in eq 5 mass conservation at connection nodes has to be considered as a

network for flushing the size of the resulting state space model and number of constraints will depend on the number of channels and how they are connected to each other for the real case study of lissertocht catchment shown in fig 4 mass balance constraints are created from the polder network graph 3 problem formulation and objective function for polder flushing the nmpc controller developed in this study aims to keep the water level and salinity concentrations around their predefined set points h ref and c ref respectively for any discretization point i in channel j described in eq 4

constraint is implemented using the existing maximum h and minimum h allowable water levels of the polder however using a hard constraint is not feasible for salinity control due to the salinity characteristics of the polder system at certain times salinity concentrations higher than the set point can be observed which sometimes may not be possible to flush out depending on the capacity of the system on the other hand salinity concentrations below the salinity threshold are fresher than what is required and thus they are not a problem in terms of salinity control to penalize only the positive violations above the salinity threshold we introduce a soft constraint as explained in maciejowski et al 2002 for salinity control and depicted in fig 3 soft constraints on salinity concentration are implemented using a combination of a virtual input u and a virtual state e c virtual state e c has a very high penalty in the objective function and is activated only if there is a positive violation of the salinity concentration fig 3 illustrates a trajectory of salinity concentration solid blue line an upper threshold for salinity levels black dashed line virtual input red

saline groundwater exfiltration data we performed simulations for controlling the flushing operation of the lissertocht catchment the catchment is located approximately 25 km southwest of the city of amsterdam fig 4 it can be considered as a representative deep polder in the netherlands where the main source of salinity is deep saline groundwater exfiltration through boils that are preferential flow paths intersecting the holocene cover layer de louw et al 2010 the discharge and concentration of the boils are rather constant while the other sources of salt ditch and drain exfiltration have temporal variations different sources of the saline groundwater exfiltration in the lissertocht catchment have been studied and modelled in delsman et al 2013 spatial variation of boils in the lissertocht catchment see red dots in fig 4 results in heterogeneity in salinity disturbance salinity concentration variation in the ditches of the lissertocht catchment is given in between 0 136 and 5 453 kg m3 delsman et al 2013 upstream main channels close to the intakes have fresh water while the downstream main channels are affected by the boils and higher salinity concentrations are observed to decrease the surface water salinity freshwater is supplied through five inlets with a total capacity of 0 0956 m3 s see table 1 for the capacity of each intake a main pumping station with a capacity of 1 48 m3 s is used to maintain the water level around the set point h ref in this study we focused on these five intakes and the main pumping station as the control structures used to regulate the water level and salinity concentration in the polder the main land use in the area is agriculture and the salinity concentration and water quantity requirement of the farmers varies depending on the crop cultivated in aydin et al 2019a we optimized the salinity sensor placement for real time control of polder flushing in the main channels using salinity data set of the lissertocht catchment the details of the models used and the data set is not the focus of this manuscript and can be found in aydin et al 2019a similarly in this study we focused on controlling the salinity concentration and water quantity of the main channels of the lissertocht catchment fig 4 that transfer the freshwater from intakes to the pumping station to test the performance of the nmpc scheme we selected a 30 day dry period 8 may 2013 6 june 2013 shown in fig 5 with a very intense rainfall in between aydin et al 2019a we model the lissertocht catchment with 14 main channels depicted with numbers in fig 4 aggregating a number of connected main ditches drainage channels with a connection to the main channels are represented as lateral flows to the main channels transporting the excessive water in the polder parcels collected by the drainage system drainage channels can provide a buffer for water level variations and salt load in the polder and during severe drought flow from main channels to the drainage channels can be observed however in accordance with the characteristics of the selected test period in this study water flows and the associated inflow concentrations from these drainage channels to the main channels are used as known disturbances based on real world saline exfiltration data of the catchment as modelled in aydin et al 2019a table 2 4 2 parameters for modelling and control in this work our control goal is to maintain the water level around the set point of 6 45 m in the polder with a maximum deviation of 0 05 m for salinity level control a salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 1500 mg l is imposed in accordance with the requirements of the responsible water authority of the area the rijnland district water control board we controlled the water level and salinity concentration at the end of each main channel for the spatial discretization of eq 10 we used a discretization spacing of 50 m and for the temporal discretization we used 1 min as the simulation time step and 1 h as the control time interval t c to capture the slow dynamics of the salt transport we implement a prediction horizon of 24 h resulting in 24 prediction steps n c for the controller the system model consists of 12528 states water level and salinity concentration deviations and the virtual states 1008 control inputs inflows outflows and the virtual inputs 9 connection nodes and 28 water level and salinity concentration control points weight used in eq 10 are filled with the values given in table 3 for each channel of the network depending on the state or input penalized as an initial guess for the weights penalizing the states and the inputs used in this study we used the maximum allowed value estimate mave described in van overloop 2006 an estimate of how much a state or a control input may vary is selected as the mave of that variable for example a mave of 0 05 m was used for the water level deviation which is equal to the allowed deviation from the water level set point and the weight in the objective function is calculated as the reciprocal of the square of the mave as 1 0 05 2 400 following similar approaches for the other states and inputs penalized and analyzing results of different settings we decided on the values given in table 3 that ensures no violation of the water level constraints 4 3 results the described nmpc framework is used to control the water level and the salinity concentration of the lissetrocht catchment the simulation results are presented in figs 7 8 to illustrate the difference between the current flushing practice in the lissertocht catchment fixed flushing during the crop growing season the results of the nmpc scheme is compared with fixed flushing all computations were performed within matlab r2019a installed on a 3 50 ghz intel xeon machine with 16 gb of ram running windows 10 the acceptable tolerance of constraint violation option of ipopt was set to 10 3 we limited the maximum number of iterations to 100 and the average control computation time resulted in 120 s which is much smaller than the control time step of 1 h fig 6 shows the controlled water level at the downstream end of the catchment close to the pumping station as can be seen nmpc keeps the water level around the set point of 6 45 m due to the hard constraint introduced for the water level control and the high penalty for water level deviation table 3 in the optimization problem water levels in all channels stay around the water level set point the fluctuations in the water level are in the order of millimeters and they are within the predefined upper and lower bounds of water level the nmpc scheme successfully controls the water level by reacting to the disturbances from groundwater exfiltration shown in fig 5 the controlled discharges of the inlet gates are shown in fig 7 for the whole test period a moving average over 24 h for better visualization all of the gates have an initial flow of 0 05 m3 s and the nmpc scheme immediately increases the flows at the beginning of the test period this behavior is a reaction to the increasing salinity concentrations in the main channels of the polder as can be seen in fig 8 a c d f the salinity concentration at these channels increases due to the mixing of the boils in those channels nmpc uses a 24 h prediction horizon and therefore reacts to these predicted violations of salinity concentrations as soon as possible and increases the intake discharge maximum capacities of the intakes which are used by the fixed flushing strategy over the whole simulation period are shown with dashed red horizontal lines in fig 7 a e as can be seen the nmpc scheme operates the system using flushing discharges close to the individual capacities of the intakes except intake i 4 fig 7 d which has the lowest capacity compared to the other intakes the pumping discharge shown in fig 7 f shows similar behaviour for both options fixed flushing resulting in a slightly higher pumping as expected the total volume of water used by each intake and the total volume of flushing and pumping are reported in table 4 the total freshwater savings compared to the fixed flushing is 19 5 while the savings in pumping volume is lower at 11 9 since the system also pumps out later inflows that drain into the channels the individual savings from each intake varied between 12 0 and 35 5 fig 8 shows the salinity concentrations at the downstream end for six main channels these six main channels either have saline boils in them eg main channel 14 in fig 4 or have a direct connection to drainage channels with saline boils eg main channels 2 6 11 12 and 13 therefore the salinity concentration in these channels exceeds the salinity concentration threshold set by irrigation requirements moreover depending on the location of the channel in the polder one or more intakes can provide freshwater to these main channels for example main channel 2 can only be flushed using the intake i 1 while intakes i 1 to i 3 can provide freshwater for main channel 11 as can be seen in fig 4 making this main channel fresh for the most of the considered time the remaining eight main channels in the catchment main channels 1 10 except 2 and 6 have no boils connected to them and the ditch exfiltration into these channels is fresh therefore salinity in these channels remains fresher and within constraints in terms of salinity control in this model run it is clear that the nmpc scheme does not perform as well as the water level control however comparison with the fixed flushing gives much more information in terms of the capacity of the system and therefore the performance of the nmpc scheme the dashed lines in fig 8 a f show the salinity concentrations at the end of each channel with fixed flushing this is a benchmark for the nmpc scheme since the nmpc uses values close to the flushing capacity for most intakes salinity concentration at these points cannot drop below this level with the given flushing capacity of intakes for example as can be seen in fig 8 a the salinity concentration drops below the threshold of 1 5 kg m3 only around the date 20 05 13 this corresponds to the period of the simulation when the intensive rainfall results in a peak in fresh groundwater exfiltration which flushes the catchment naturally the nmpc scheme achieves the salinity level control goal in the main channels 11 and 13 fig 8 c and e on the other hand the nmpc scheme fails to drop the salinity concentration below the threshold for the other four main channels presented in fig 8 main channels 12 and 14 are at the downstream end of the network and they carry most of the high saline water to the pumping station therefore higher salinity concentrations are observed in these two main channels moreover as can be seen in fig 8 d f the performance of the fixed flushing is also not good for main channels 12 and 14 and the salinity concentrations are close to the values achieved by the nmpc the biggest difference in terms of salinity control performance between fixed flushing and nmpc is observed in main channels 2 and 6 fig 8 a b these two main channels are on the upstream side of the catchment where main channel 6 can only be flushed by intake i 4 directly connected to main channel 6 and main channel 2 can only be flushed by intake i 1 freshwater should first be transported through main channel 1 see also fig 4 the nmpc scheme prefers not to use the full capacity of intakes i 1 and i 4 and saves water in exchange for higher salinity in two main channels this is a trade off between salinity and freshwater usage and it is further elaborated in the next paragraph salinity control performance is directly related to the amount of freshwater usage combining the information given in table 4 and fig 8 it can be concluded that there is more freshwater availability for intakes i 1 and i 4 that should be able to dilute the salinity concentration in main channels 2 and 6 respectively however as can be seen in table 4 the capacities of intake i 1 and i 4 are utilized the least compared to the other intakes at first the reason why the nmpc does not utilize the maximum capacities of intakes i 1 and i 4 to decrease the higher concentrations in the upstream main channels 2 and 6 was not apparent a posteriori analysis of the polder network and the results reveal a possible reason related to the flushing capacities and the salt transport dynamics described by the ad equations when a channel is flushed water with high salinity concentration in the channel is transferred to the downstream channels of the polder and finally pumped out of the system if a channel is not flushed salinity concentration in that channel will increase locally and later through very slow dispersive mechanism will spread to the rest of the polder the nmpc makes use of this behaviour defined by the system dynamics in the constraints and decides to transport less salt water from main channels 2 and 6 to the downstream channels by carrying less salt water downstream it decreases the need for freshwater usage in the remainder of the polder alternative routes that carry fresher water are preferred to flush the downstream channels for example downstream of main channel 2 and 6 are main channels 11 and 13 respectively as shown in fig 8 salinity concentrations in these two downstream main channels are most of the time below the salinity threshold freshwater necessary to decrease the salinity is mostly provided by alternative routes through intakes i 2 i 3 and i 5 freshwater provided by these three intakes travels without mixing with saline groundwater through at least one main channel and reaches downstream as a fresher water source in the considered case here since the salinity concentrations are controlled in all main channels with equal weighting the nmpc scheme allows higher concentrations in channels 2 and 6 in exchange for saving freshwater use which is one of three weighted objectives for the controller in the next section we consider upgrading intake capacity as a future possibility for the stakeholders to guarantee lower salinity levels based on simplistic mixing we propose potential upgrades in intake capacity and test their performance both under fixed flushing and under the advanced nmpc schemes 4 4 system update to improve the salinity control performance results presented in the previous section showed that the salinity control performance was hampered by insufficient capacity of intakes i 1 and i 4 as described in detail in the previous section main canals 2 and 6 had very large salt loads draining into them but were serviced by intakes i 1 and i 4 respectively which did not have high enough capacities to dilute them sufficiently therefore in this section we provide a simple system update by increasing the capacities of these intakes to improve the salinity control performance of the nmpc framework we focus on decreasing the salinity concentration in main channels 2 and 6 so that the nmpc could choose to flush them to downstream channels when favorable to allow the nmpc to flush these channels we calculated the maximum salt loads summation of the multiplication of all saline groundwater exfiltration discharges with its concentration discharging to these channels we then used this maximum salt load to calculate the minimum freshwater intake levels from i 1 and i 4 respectively required to dilute these channels to the salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 summation of all the salt load of all fresh and saline flows equal to the threshold of course the capacities could be further increased to trade off water quality levels with freshwater use by considering the worst scenario of no rain to naturally flush the system and the number of existing boils discharging directly or through drainage channels to these two main channels we estimated the necessary freshwater intake to dilute the high saline water in these main channels using eqs 6 7 we increased the capacities of intake i 1 from 0 0162 m3 s to 0 0342 m3 s and of intake i 4 from 0 0097 m3 s to 0 0136 m3 s respectively to bring average salinity levels to below the threshold of 1 5 kg m3 keeping the rest of the parameters as the original setting we simulated the system and the results are presented in figs 9 10 where also results of the original configuration and fixed flushing with the updated capacities are included for comparison fig 9 presents the controlled discharges of the intakes and the pumping station full capacity of all intakes were used by the fixed flushing and are shown with a dashed line similar to fig 7 all of the intakes start with an initial flow and the nmpc immediately increases the flushing from all of the intakes due to the increased capacities flushing through intakes i 1 and i 4 is increased as expected for the upgraded case where the nmpc scheme is applied the rest of the intakes behave similarly to the original setting i e fig 7 the salinity control performance of the updated system both fixed flushing and nmpc compared with the original configuration nmpc is shown in fig 10 compared to the original configuration blue lines in fig 10 both fixed flushing red dashed line in fig 10 and the nmpc black dotted line in fig 10 of the updated system brings the salinity concentrations in main channels 2 and 6 below salinity threshold see between the dates 12 5 2013 and 17 5 2013 in figs 10 a b as expected due to the increased intake capacities fixed flushing resulted in the lowest salinity concentrations in all channels using the full capacity of the intakes salinity concentrations in all channels dropped below the salinity threshold i e it is possible to intake the maximum freshwater possible and so reduce peak salt loads in the whole system albeit using more freshwater than necessary the nmpc scheme utilized the increased capacities of intakes i 1 and i 4 and additional freshwater from these intakes to dilute and flush the high saline water in the main channels 2 and 6 see figs 10 a b in comparison to the fixed flushing nmpc did not use the full capacity of the intakes but only the necessary amount calculated by the optimization to bring the salinity concentration to the salinity threshold of 1 5 kg m3 in the upstream channels as a result of additional flushing water used salinity control performance of the nmpc scheme significantly improved in all channels for the updated system the nmpc scheme used around 20 less freshwater compared to the fixed flushing 2 46 105 m3 for the nmpc and 3 05 105 m3 for fixed flushing for both fixed flushing and nmpc the better salinity performance comes at the price of using more freshwater from the increased capacities around 19 increase 5 conclusion in this paper we propose a novel nmpc framework for optimal flushing control in polders we presented a network model to optimize multiple objectives and tested the controller in a low lying dutch polder the lissertocht catchment as a case study the proposed nmpc scheme is mathematically explained implemented and used for this case study to control salinity concentration and water quantity in all main channels of the network in simulation experiments sufficient performance for water level control was achieved by keeping the water level always within set boundaries salinity control performance of the nmpc however appeared to be unsatisfactory due to the limited intake capacity post analysis of the network and the nmpc results allowed us to determine a simple design update of the system we achieved a satisfactory salinity control performance by updating the intake capacity of two intake gates both in the original and updated system freshwater usage is reduced by around 20 using the nmpc compared to the fixed flushing strategy presently in operation in the lissertocht catchment we believe that the framework presented in this paper is one of the first steps towards the application of nmpc schemes for better management of freshwater resources in irrigation polders it is useful for irrigation water management in low lying delta areas with shallow saline groundwater further research on coupling this nmpc scheme with irrigation scheduling optimization frameworks will provide valuable information

9622,accurate estimation of the spatial temporal distribution of phreatic evapotranspiration et is critical for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization in arid and semiarid agricultural areas where substantial water saving efforts are needed traditional phreatic et estimation approaches either are for small scales or cannot consider spatial and or temporal variations in phreatic et this study developed a new approach for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and measured water table depths the ndvi was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration etc act by scaling it with the reference crop evapotranspiration eto the water table depths measured during the periods of no other factors i e precipitation irrigation and groundwater extraction were used to establish an equation used to estimate the phreatic et contribution coefficient defined as the ratio of phreatic et to the corresponding etc act to improve estimation accuracy a time related correction factor was considered in the equation for estimating the phreatic et the new approach was used to estimate monthly phreatic et with a spatial resolution of 250 m in the hetao irrigation district located in arid northwest china the estimated phreatic et at different spatial and temporal scales matched well with the groundwater balance model results the results show that the spatial distribution of phreatic et is affected by both natural factors e g land cover types and human activities e g groundwater extraction planted crops in the hetao irrigation district phreatic et contributes an average of 24 4 to etc act during the non freezing thawing period from june to november demonstrating the essential role of phreatic et in supporting crop growth and the general ecological environment in arid areas with shallow water table depths the new approach of estimating spatial temporal phreatic et may be used for designing effective and efficient water resource management policies at the regional scale keywords phreatic evapotranspiration estimation shallow groundwater remote sensing irrigation district 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource to sustain social and economic development in arid and semiarid areas with limited precipitation and surface water resources and these regions are widespread worldwide rodell et al 2009 peña arancibia et al 2016 ge et al 2017 sebai et al 2017 liu et al 2017 chen et al 2018 bierkens and wada 2019 ahmad et al 2021 in agricultural areas shallow groundwater moves upward to enter unsaturated zones overlying a superficial aquifer by phreatic evapotranspiration et for crop growth kahlown et al 2005 wu et al 2015 xue et al 2017 phreatic et occurs when groundwater moves through capillary rise to replenish soil water storage which has been depleted by crop uptake and soil evaporation phreatic et contributes to supplying water for crop and natural ecosystems wang et al 2016a making it an important source of actual evapotranspiration etc act driven by capillary rise salt moves upward with groundwater which may cause soil salinity problems hillel 2000 northey et al 2006 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 estimating phreatic et is important for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization especially in arid and semiarid regions salama et al 1999 chen and hu 2004 zipper et al 2015 the hetao irrigation district is located in arid northwest china and agricultural irrigation relies heavily on water resources diverted from the yellow river mao et al 2017 the shallow water table depth and the large amount of evapotranspiration are the two major factors for soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district li et al 2012 salts from the groundwater aquifer will move upwards to the soil layer along with the phreatic et due to the strong variation in land cover types soil characteristics and water table depths it is important to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of phreatic et to design effective water resource management policies to prevent soil salinization in this area many approaches have been developed to estimate phreatic et using lysimeter experiments yang et al 2007 fahle and dietrich 2014 tracer experiments costelloe et al 2014 shanafield et al 2015 and simplified approaches based on field observations and experimental data harbaugh et al 2000 shah et al 2007 yang et al 2007 investigated the phreatic et of wheat water use by conducting a large weighing lysimeter experiment fahle and dietrich 2014 reviewed the available methods for estimating phreatic et and compared the results with those measured values from lysimeter experiments costelloe et al 2014 revisited and extended the general advection diffusion equation to calculate the phreatic et with soil solute concentration profiles shanafield et al 2015 investigated the evaporative and evapotranspirative fluxes measured by using the chloride and stable isotope profiling method at stirling swamp a playa in central australia lysimeter experiments and tracer experiments can yield accurate phreatic et estimations at small scales but are expensive and time consuming liu et al 2016 based on field observations and experimental data different types of simplified approaches have been developed to estimate phreatic et under bare or vegetation covered ground conditions by using water table depth and evaporation data i e water surface evaporation pan evaporation and potential evaporation these approaches estimate phreatic et by developing calculation functions including linear harbaugh et al 2000 linear segment banta 2000 power zammouri 2001 hu et al 2008 and exponential functions shah et al 2007 all the above approaches are effective on small scales but have limitations when they are used on a regional scale brunner et al 2008 liu et al 2016 one limitation of the above approaches is that they cannot estimate the spatial temporal variability in phreatic et at a regional scale which is important for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization in space salama et al 1999 chen and hu 2004 zipper et al 2015 there are many factors impacting phreatic et including topography water table depth climate information soil types and land cover types sepaskhah et al 2003 and they vary spatially and or temporally at the regional scale thus phreatic et is often heterogeneous the existing approaches for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et include numerical models based on richards equation ahmad et al 2002 pozdniakov et al 2013 numerical models based on simplified approaches liu and luo 2012 liu et al 2015 and remote sensing approaches combined with simplified approaches nichols 1994 beamer et al 2013 numerical models based on richards equation are soil water flux models with the presence of water table depth wang et al 2016a such as hydrus 1d luo and sophocleous 2010 pozdniakov et al 2013 wave liu et al 2006 upflow raes and deproost 2003 and swap ahmad et al 2002 xu et al 2012 luo and sophocleous 2010 employed the hydrus 1d model with weighing lysimeter data to assess the seasonal groundwater contribution to crop etc act raes and deproost 2003 simulated capillary rise to the root zone by upflow software and the simulation results and corresponding field measurements were of the same order of magnitude xu et al 2012 coupled the swap package with modflow 2000 to estimate groundwater recharge and et however these models have practical limitations because the required hydraulic parameters are difficult to obtain liu and luo 2012 modflow harbaugh et al 2000 liu and luo 2012 and swat arnold et al 1993 liu et al 2015 are typical numerical models based on simplified approaches for estimating regional phreatic et these models cannot consider the impact of land cover types which limits their applications at regional scales remote sensing is a useful tool in the acquisition of spatially distributed data brunner et al 2007 remotely sensed vegetation indices corresponding to canopy vigor and cover have been successfully used to estimate phreatic et over large spatial and temporal scales nichols 1994 2000 brunner et al 2008 beamer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 nichols 2000 developed a method for estimating the spatial distribution of phreatic et in the great basin nevada usa as a function of plant cover using landsat data derived vegetation indices brunner et al 2008 established a function to estimate the vadose etc act by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi carlson and ripley 1997 and then obtained the regional phreatic et by subtracting the vadose component from the etc act in the studies of nichols 2000 and brunner et al 2008 the data used to establish equations for estimating phreatic et were from only two field sites and seven stations respectively these data may be insufficient for estimating the phreatic et in a large area the phreatic et is highly related with etc act brunner et al 2008 which means that the spatial temporal phreatic et can be obtained by calculating the spatial temporal etc act the spatial and temporal etc act can be calculated by a remote sensing approach combined with the traditional fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2011 which is a function of the actual crop coefficient k c act calculated by vegetation index derived from remote sensing and reference crop evapotranspiration eto yebra et al 2013 recommended that ndvi was preferred over other vegetation indices in the cropland according to the research of 16 fluxnet sites around the world ndvi is used to calculate k c act due to the high correlation between ndvi and k c act ray and dadhwal 2001 glenn et al 2010 2011 mutiibwa and irmak 2013 yebra et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 mahmoud and gan 2019 since both k c act and ndvi or vegetation indices are affected by the leaf area index and fractional ground cover heilman et al 1982 choudhury et al 1994 glenn et al 2007 the method is effective in most landscape types when transpiration dominates over soil evaporation in determining etc act glenn et al 2010 and is especially suitable for agricultural and natural ecosystems where transpiration is reported to generally account for 70 to 90 of etc act huxman et al 2004 williams et al 2004 the method of using ndvi to calculate k c act has been successfully applied in northwest china lei and yang 2014 hao and yang 2016 liu 2016 a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et was developed based on the spatial temporal etc act and the phreatic et contribution coefficient ndvi was used to calculate the k c act for obtaining the spatial and temporal etc act the water table fluctuation wtf method white 1932 diouf et al 2020 was adopted to obtain the phreatic et for establishing the corresponding function of the phreatic et contribution coefficient with the water table depth by using observations of the water table depth from 227 groundwater monitoring wells in the hetao irrigation district over a period of 9 years a time related correction factor was included to improve the accuracy of the method the main objectives were to 1 establish a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et 2 calculate the 5 day spatial phreatic et from 2000 to 2017 in the hetao irrigation district 3 discuss the temporal and spatial variations in phreatic et on different time scales and 4 apply the developed approach for predicting phreatic et under future conditions 2 study area and observation data 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district is located in the west inner mongolia autonomous region and has five subareas ulanbuh jiefangzha yongji yichang and urad based on irrigation management practices as shown in fig 1 the district is located in an arid continental climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 152 mm and an average annual pan evaporation of 2400 mm zhao et al 2020a the groundwater dynamics follow the vertical infiltration evaporation type due to the gentle land surface and the slight spatial variation in the water table depth yu et al 2010 ren et al 2016 thus hydrological processes e g infiltration evapotranspiration groundwater evapotranspiration and deep percolation mainly occur in the vertical direction furthermore this district has a freezing thawing period longer than five months i e from december to may of the next year considering the special physical process in the freezing thawing period the developed phreatic et estimation approach was applied from june to november marked as the non freezing thawing period including the autumn irrigation period from mid september to mid november sunflower wheat and maize are the predominant crops in this area and their growing seasons are from late may to late september late march to late july and late april to late september respectively although the autumn irrigation causes a shallow groundwater table depth the upward groundwater movement mechanism is also associated with phreatic et and the developed approach is suitable for this period 2 2 data description in the current study the spatial temporal water table depth ndvi and eto from 2000 to 2017 were used to estimate the spatial temporal phreatic et as shown in fig 1 227 groundwater observation wells are distributed across the district and the water table depth is measured every 5 days the spatial distribution of the water table depth was obtained by interpolating the hydraulic head and then obtaining the water table depth as the terrain elevation minus the head the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used in the current study the monthly measurements of the water table depth in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas are displayed in fig 2 a the adopted ndvi dataset was the product of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instrument the 16 day terra modis vegetation index product with a spatial resolution of 250 m mod13q1 kamel et al 2015 since february 2000 was downloaded from the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac http ladsweb nascom nasa gov the downloaded ndvi data were collated into monthly average data fig 2 b shows the monthly time series ndvi in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas eto was calculated by the fao penman monteith method according to the daily observed meteorological data from the five meteorological stations which are located in the five subareas as shown in fig 1 the daily observed meteorological data from 2000 to 2017 at each station were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and these data included the daily values of maximum and minimum temperature average temperature relative humidity average wind speed average air pressure and sunshine hours fig 2 c shows the monthly time series eto in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas the monthly values of eto in different subareas were very similar thus the eto of any pixel in the space adopted the value of the meteorological station in the subarea where the pixel was located the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district in 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained from the global geo information public product of national geomatics center of china http www globallandcover com doi 10 11769 monthly and yearly data for the water balance model were provided by the hetao administration and the data included precipitation water diversion equal to the irrigation water and drainage data domestic water data industrial water data livestock water data and lateral water data the monthly and yearly data were from 2000 to 2013 and 2000 2016 respectively the amount of water diversion and drainage data were measured from the diversion sluice and surface drains as shown in fig 1 the main time series inputs of the water balance model including precipitation water diversion and drainage are displayed in fig 2 d 2 f etc act is an important intermediate variable for estimating phreatic et to evaluate the accuracy of the etc act obtained by this study the etc act results of a field experiment and a 10 day public product ssebop with a spatial resolution of 1000 m were collected for comparison with the simulated etc act using the developed approach dai et al 2011 measured the daily average etc act in time intervals of 5 7 days at the dengkou agricultural experiment station in 2009 by the lysimeter experiment and water balance model the public etc act product of ssebop used the simplified surface energy balance model and was obtained from the usgs fews net data portal https earlywarning usgs gov fews senay et al 2020 3 methodologies the new approach for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et as further described in section 3 1 was a function of the water table depth ndvi and eto the phreatic et contribution coefficient and etc act are the important intermediate variables for estimating phreatic et as further described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively the water balance model was used to calibrate the parameters of the developed approach and validate the accuracy of the approach and is described in section 3 4 3 1 the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach in the current study phreatic et was the product of the phreatic et contribution coefficient and etc act the equations are as follows 1 e t g c e t c act 2 c f m h m i p exp q h 3 e t c act k c act e t o 4 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 5 k c act a n d v i b where et g is the phreatic et mm c is the phreatic et contribution coefficient et c act is the actual evapotranspiration mm h is the water table depth m m represents month m is a correction factor which varies with time m i is a correction factor of the i th month in the non freezing thawing period et o is the reference crop et mm k c act is the actual crop coefficient which is relative to the actual crop conditions including water and salinity stress impacts δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and p q a and b are parameters to be estimated the parameters p and q are constant along time and space for any pixel phreatic et was estimated by using the dataset of the water table depth ndvi and eto and the calculation scheme can be found in fig 3 a the equation for calculating the phreatic et in each pixel is given in eq 6 and the regional phreatic et is estimated by eq 7 6 e t g m i p exp q h a n d v i b e t o 7 e t g s j 1 n m i p exp q h j a n d v i j b e t o j where et g s is the regional phreatic et mm n is the number of pixels in the study area and h j ndvi j and et o j are the water table depth ndvi and eto in the j th pixel respectively it should be noted that all the input data water table depth ndvi and eto vary in both space and time in the process of calculation the average value of the two adjacent measurements of water table depth was used the average ndvi was adopted for the current month the used eto value was the sum of the daily eto between two adjacent monitoring dates the time scale of the estimated regional phreatic et et g s by eq 7 was five days in the current study which corresponded to the measurement frequency of the water table depth the monthly regional phreatic et was the sum of the six regional phreatic et values in a month and the regional phreatic et of the non freezing thawing period was the sum of the monthly regional phreatic et values 3 2 the phreatic et contribution coefficient estimation method the phreatic et contribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the phreatic et to the corresponding etc act there are two unknown parameters p and q and the time dependent correction factor m i must be determined to calculate the phreatic et contribution coefficient the unknown parameters p and q were determined by fitting the dataset of the phreatic et contribution coefficient with the water table depth by the exponential equation the series of phreatic et contribution coefficients were obtained based on the calculated phreatic et and etc act data the etc act was calculated using the approach introduced in section 3 3 and the phreatic et was calculated by using the wtf method the water table depth fluctuates in response to many hydraulic processes including precipitation irrigation groundwater extraction and phreatic et healy and cook 2002 the wtf method is applicable for the fluctuation caused by a single factor this method has been widely used for estimating phreatic et gribovszki et al 2010 and specific yield delin et al 2007 when abundant water table depth data are available in the plain area where the horizontal groundwater flow could be neglected the phreatic et was calculated as follows wang and li 2007 schilling 2007 schilling and kiniry 2007 gribovszki et al 2010 diouf et al 2020 8 e t g μ δ h where μ is the specific yield and δh is the change in water table depth mm the increase in water table depth was mainly caused by phreatic et when there were no other factors i e precipitation irrigation and groundwater extraction causing the fluctuation of the water table depth in the plain area fig 3 b shows three chosen stages of water table depth increase when the wtf method could be applied during the a b and c stages as shown in fig 3 b the phreatic et could be calculated by the wtf method at the point scale the water table depth data for 9 years i e 2000 2005 2006 2009 2011 2012 2013 2015 and 2017 from 227 observation wells at the stage with no precipitation and irrigation were selected for calculating the phreatic et by using the wtf method there were 8965 phreatic et data points obtained and then the corresponding etc act and the phreatic et contribution coefficient were calculated next the relationship of the calculated phreatic et contribution coefficient and the measured water table depth was analysed and the parameters could be obtained from the fitted relationship 3 3 the spatial temporal etc act estimation approach for any pixel etc act was calculated by using the ndvi and the eto datasets and eq 3 to eq 5 as also shown in fig 3 a the etc act for the whole region was the sum of the values of all pixels as shown in eq 9 9 e t c act s a j 1 n n d v i j e t o j b j 1 n e t o j where et c act s is the regional actual evapotranspiration mm n is the number of pixels in the study area and ndvi j and et o j are the ndvi and the reference crop evapotranspiration in the j th pixel respectively then the etc act for the whole region within a year was the sum of the et c act s values in a year additionally the yearly regional etc act could be calculated by the water balance model described in section 3 4 and this value could be used to determine the unknown parameters a and b in eq 9 3 4 water balance model to calibrate the parameters of the spatial temporal etc act estimation approach and evaluate the approach the water balance model was used in the current study yang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the components of the water balance model are shown in fig 3 c and 3 d the water balance of the whole region was used to estimate the yearly regional etc act which can be expressed as follows 10 e t c act y p y i y d y q d y q i y q l y c s y δ w y where et c act y is the actual evapotranspiration of the y th year mm p y is the precipitation of the y th year mm i y is the irrigation amount of the y th year mm d y is the water drainage amount of the y th year mm q d y is the domestic water use of the y th year mm q i y is the industrial water use of the y th year mm q l y is the livestock water use of the y th year mm cs y is the lateral recharge of the y th year mm lateral recharge was ignored due to its very small value δw y is the change in the water storage in the whole region mm the change in the water storage in the whole region was considered small enough to be ignored at the annual scale chang 2003 senay et al 2011 du et al 2016 to obtain the parameters a and b of the etc act estimation approach eq 10 i e for the water balance of the whole region was used to calculate the yearly etc act from 2000 2016 in the hetao irrigation district the known ndvi and the reference crop evapotranspiration eto were used to calculate the two items j 1 n ndvi j et o j and j 1 n et o j in eq 9 and then the parameters a and b can be obtained by applying the least square method the groundwater balance model of the saturated zone was established to estimate the monthly phreatic et as follows 11 e t g m α i m β p m c s m λ d m q d m q i m μ δ h m where et g m is the monthly phreatic et mm the meanings of i p cs d q d and q i are the same as those in eq 10 and the subscript m represents the m th month α is the recharge coefficient of irrigation dimensionless β is the recharge coefficient of precipitation dimensionless λ is the proportion of the groundwater drainage amount to the total drainage amount μ is the specific yield dimensionless and μδh m is the monthly change in the groundwater storage of the m th month mm 3 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the simulation accuracy between the simulated and observed values five evaluation metrics including the coefficient of determination r 2 moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 the mean error me nelson et al 2011 and the mean relative error mre fang et al 2008 were used in the current study r 2 and nse values close to 1 0 indicate good model performance for rmse me and mre values closest to 0 indicate good model performance these evaluation indicators are defined as follows 12 r 2 i 1 n m o i o p i p 2 i 1 n m o i o 2 i 1 n m p i p 2 13 n s e 1 i 1 n m o i p i 2 i 1 n m o i o

is the number of measurements 3 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis plays an essential role in understanding the impact of input variables and parameters on model output and helps understand the mechanisms of error propagation and uncertainty of the model long and singh 2012 yang and shang 2013 the sensitivity of the estimated phreatic et by the developed approach to the four parameters including a b p and q was analysed as follows xue et al 2017 17 s n δ e t g e t g δ v n v n where s n represents the sensitivity of parameter n δet g is the variation in the simulated phreatic et when the variation in the value of parameter n is δv n v n is the value of the parameter n the parameter m i is a correction factor of the i th month in the non freezing thawing period for the parameter p which has a similar effect as parameter p so the sensitivity of the estimated phreatic et to parameter m i was not analysed the perturbations of the parameters ranged from 20 20 with a variation step of 5 4 results and discussion in this section the parameters for calculating etc act a and b and the phreatic et contribution coefficient m i p and q were calculated then the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach was calibrated and validated for the entire hetao irrigation district to verify the applicability of the developed spatial phreatic et estimation approach the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district were extracted and compared with the values calculated from the groundwater balance model according to the validated phreatic et estimation approach the spatial temporal phreatic et was calculated from 2000 to 2017 in the hetao irrigation district then the temporal and spatial variations in phreatic et on different time scales month and non freezing thawing period were analysed in addition the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act were discussed finally nine prediction scenarios were analysed by using the developed approach 4 1 the results of parameters for estimating the etc act the estimated values of parameters a and b were 1 25 and 0 16 respectively there have been many studies on modelling the actual crop coefficient as a function of ndvi parameters a and b of the relationship between the actual crop coefficient and ndvi are displayed in table 1 according to previous studies parameter a ranges from 0 918 to 1 580 and parameter b ranges from 0 111 0 303 thus the obtained parameters in the current study were within the range reported in previous studies moreover parameters a and b obtained in the current study were very similar to the values recommended by belmonte et al 2005 cuesta et al 2005 rubio et al 2006 allen et al 2011 and rocha et al 2012 who reported parameters a and b of 1 25 and 0 20 respectively the comparison result of actual crop coefficients provided by previous studies and this study is shown in fig 4 the actual crop coefficients calculated by this study were within the range reported in previous studies which demonstrated that the parameters obtained by this study are convincing in the current study the accuracy of the etc act produced by the developed approach was evaluated at both the field and regional scales the comparison results of the yearly etc act calculated by the water balance model and the developed approach in the current study from 2000 to 2016 are shown in fig 5 a the evaluation metrics rmse me and mre were 40 98 mm 2 23 mm and 0 77 respectively which demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the adopted spatial temporal etc act estimation approach compared with other studies in the hetao irrigation district the mre of this study was slightly smaller than that 5 2 5 6 reported by yang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 and yu et al 2019 the rmse of this study was consistent with the study of yebra et al 2013 who found that the rmse ranged from 26 mm year to 48 mm year when using the potential et scaling approach in 16 eddy covariance flux tower sites around the world fig 5 b shows results from comparing the developed approach and the field experiment at the dengkou agricultural experiment station in 2009 dai et al 2011 the rmse me and mre were 1 06 mm 0 40 mm and 19 30 respectively which demonstrated that the estimated etc act using the developed approach matched the observed data by lysimeter experiments at the field scale the simulated accuracy of the developed approach at the regional scale was better than that at the field scale which was consistent with the results of bai et al 2017 and yu et al 2019 who showed that the mre values of the simulated etc act were 5 2 6 0 at the regional scale while the mre values were 13 16 at the field scale then the public etc act product of ssebop was compared with the simulated etc act using the developed approach from the time period of 2003 2016 fig 6 a shows the comparison results of the annual etc act for the water balance model the developed approach and ssebop and the annual average values which were 558 mm 566 mm and 524 mm respectively the developed approach and ssebop obtained values close to the annual etc act calculated by the water balance model the monthly etc act values of the developed approach and ssebop were compared shown in fig 6 b the nse rmse and me were 0 897 13 990 mm and 3 527 mm respectively which proved that the developed approach could obtain monthly etc act values that were consistent with those of ssebop compared with the surface energy balance seb e g ssebop models based on thermal infrared data the etc act simulation approach based on the ndvi and eto is often preferred for operational applications because of its simplicity duchemin et al 2006 tasumi et al 2006 it is challenging for the etc act estimation approach used in the current study to estimate evaporation from bare soil following precipitation events reported by previous studies allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2015 however this condition is not usual in arid and semiarid agricultural regions huang et al 2016 and the average annual precipitation was only 152 mm in the current study which implies that the etc act estimation approach in the current study can serve as an alternative approach to estimate etc act in these regions hornbuckle et al 2016 water salt stress is reflected by parameters a and b using this approach however it should be mentioned that there was no water stress during the primary growth period or the water salt stress was less than 9 in the current study area according to previous studies miao 2015 miao et al 2016 ren et al 2016 huang et al 2019 these are reasons why the developed approach can obtain etc act values consistent with ssebop therefore the developed approach is valid in irrigated regions with less water salt stress according to this study the applicability of the approach for estimating the reduction in etc act caused by acute water or salinity stress is still challenging 4 2 the results of parameters for estimating the phreatic et contribution coefficient the value of specific yield is vital to obtain the phreatic et by using the wtf method healy and cook 2002 loheide et al 2005 specific yield is known to vary with water table depth duke 1972 loheide et al 2005 reported that specific yield was mainly related to the soil structure when the water table depth was deeper than 1 m a total of 8965 datasets were used in the wtf method in the current study and the water table depths of 99 5 of the datasets were deeper than 1 m therefore the specific yield was set at a constant value following common practice in the current study delin et al 2007 table 2 shows the values of specific yield in the hetao irrigation district according to previous studies the specific yield obtained by the volume balance method in our previous study was 0 026 0 028 zhao et al 2020b which was consistent with the results of yue 2004 and ren et al 2019 the recommended specific yield was 0 02 0 04 according to the pumping test data and soil textures in this area yu 2017 wu et al 2018 considering the volume balance data and pumping test data the adopted specific yield was 0 03 the relationship between the phreatic et contribution coefficient and the water table depth with the 8965 datasets is shown in fig 7 a most of the phreatic et contribution coefficient data were concentrated in a triangular region and there was a pattern that showed that the deeper the water table depth was the smaller the phreatic et contribution coefficient was the frequency distribution of the water table depth corresponding to the 8965 datasets of the phreatic et contribution coefficient is shown in fig 7 b the water table depth from 0 3 m to 4 8 m in fig 7 b was spaced at the 0 3 m interval considering that the number of datasets in the different water table depth intervals varied greatly the average phreatic et contribution coefficient and the average water table depth were calculated in each interval then the relationship between the phreatic et contribution coefficient of each interval and the water table depth is shown in fig 7 c and the fitted parameters p and q of the whole non freezing thawing period are displayed in table 3 the parameter p was 0 731 q was 0 639 and the coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 976 the phreatic et contribution coefficient was close to 0 when the water table depth was deeper than 5 m as shown in fig 7 a and c therefore the phreatic et contribution coefficient was set as 0 when the water table depth exceeded 5 m in the current study to verify the rationality of the fitted parameters of the phreatic et contribution coefficient equation the result was compared with the equation developed by wang 2002 obtained from the lysimeter experiment with natural vegetation as shown in fig 7 c the phreatic et contribution coefficient values obtained in the current study were close to those provided by wang 2002 within the water table depth interval of 0 5 1 5 m while the results of this study were larger than those from wang 2002 when the water table depth was deeper than 1 5 m a potential explanation is that the results of wang 2002 are suitable under natural vegetation with shallow roots zhang et al 1995 analysed the law of phreatic et in bare land and cropland through lysimeter experiments they reported that the phreatic et was almost 0 mm d with a water table depth of 2 5 m for bare land while it was 0 327 mm d for cropland kang et al 2001 provided the etc act for this experiment the phreatic et contribution coefficient was approximately 0 13 for cropland with a water table depth of 2 5 m the phreatic et contribution coefficient was approximately 0 16 with a water table depth of 2 5 m in the current study which was similar to the results of zhang et al 1995 and kang et al 2001 in general the fitted phreatic et contribution coefficient equation of this study was reasonable furthermore the exponential relationships between the phreatic et contribution coefficient values of different months and the water table depths were analysed as shown in fig 7 d the exponential fitting curves in different months were different which implied the necessity to induce the correction parameter m i due to the different number of datasets in different months as shown in table 3 the m i values were not obtained directly by fitting the datasets shown in fig 7 d but they were determined by calibrating and validating the groundwater balance model as shown in eq 11 the groundwater balance model was used to calculate the monthly phreatic et from 2000 to 2013 in the hetao irrigation district with the first 11 years of data for calibration and the subsequent 3 years of data for validation the recharge coefficient of irrigation α was 0 30 the recharge coefficient of precipitation β was 0 13 and the proportion of the groundwater drainage amount to the total drainage amount λ was 0 30 in eq 11 all of which were validated by several studies wang et al 2016b yue et al 2016 xue et al 2017 yu 2017 sun et al 2019 the comparison results of the phreatic et calculated by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach in the calibration and validation periods are displayed in fig 8 the results of the phreatic et estimated by the developed approach matched well with those from the groundwater balance model the evaluation metrics nse rmse and me of the monthly phreatic et reflect the good performance of the developed approach in the calibration nse 0 875 rmse 2 862 mm me 0 663 mm and validation nse 0 687 rmse 5 631 mm me 0 219 mm periods as shown in fig 8 b and 8 c the evaluation metrics rmse me and mre of the total phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period also demonstrate the good performance of the developed approach in the calibration rmse 8 013 mm me 3 976 mm mre 3 44 and validation rmse 11 464 mm me 1 314 mm mre 0 81 periods as shown in fig 8 d the results of the calibrated m i are shown in table 3 the m i values of june july and august were smaller than 1 and those of september october and november were larger than 1 which was in good agreement with the law reflected in fig 7 d furthermore the m i value had a significant negative relationship with the ndvi correlation coefficient r 0 909 significance level p 0 012 when the ndvi was smaller than the average ndvi the etc act decreased rapidly and the calculated phreatic et contribution coefficient was smaller than the real value without considering m i the results of the sensitivity analysis of the four input parameters a b p and q are shown in fig 9 the results of sensitivity analysis showed that phreatic et was most sensitive to changes in parameter q followed by changes in parameters p and a and it was least sensitive to b a 10 increase in parameters a b p and q could result in 7 22 2 78 10 00 and 10 22 increases in phreatic et respectively these results indicate that phreatic et is mainly affected by the water table depth because phreatic et comes from shallow groundwater sufficient datasets are needed to obtain parameters p and q to ensure applicability as 8965 datasets over 9 years from 227 observation wells were used in the current study 4 3 validation of the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach in the five subareas of the hetao irrigation district to verify the applicability of the developed phreatic et estimation approach in space the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district were extracted and compared with the values of the groundwater balance model from 2000 to 2013 the comparison results of the monthly phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district calculated by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach are displayed in fig 10 a 10 j the evaluation metrics showed that ulanbuh nse 0 714 rmse 5 044 mm me 0 172 mm and jiefangzha nse 0 687 rmse 5 023 mm me 2 846 mm had the best performance followed by yichang nse 0 624 rmse 5 595 mm me 1 129 mm yongji nse 0 517 rmse 5 878 mm me 2 427 mm and urad nse 0 539 rmse 7 066 mm me 0 977 mm in urad there were 4 and 11 fewer monitoring wells that could provide water table depth in 2012 and 2013 relative to the period before 2012 respectively causing a larger deviation when interpolating the spatial water table depth overall the developed phreatic et estimation approach in the current study was able to obtain reasonable monthly phreatic et in space compared with the groundwater balance model the comparison results of the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district during the non freezing thawing period by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach are shown in fig 10 k 10 o the rmse values were 7 959 mm 19 236 mm 16 496 mm 13 884 mm and 22 933 mm the me values were 1 035 mm 17 073 mm 14 561 mm 6 773 mm and 5 863 mm and the mre values were 0 893 13 092 12 508 5 441 and 10 315 which demonstrate the good applicability of the developed phreatic et estimation approach thus the developed phreatic et estimation approach is effective in calculating the spatial temporal phreatic et in the hetao irrigation district during the non freezing thawing period 4 4 the spatial temporal phreatic et on the time scale of the non freezing thawing period to analyse the spatial distribution of the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period the results from 2000 2003 2007 2010 2013 and 2017 were selected for analysis the spatial variations of which are displayed in fig 11 the corresponding ndvi and water table depth of these years are shown in fig 12 a 12 f and g 12 l respectively the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period was concentrated within 80 140 mm accounting for more than 60 of the total area the proportion of the spatial phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period exceeding 170 mm was very small and was mainly located in the area with a high ndvi as shown in fig 12 a 12 f the proportion of the spatial phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period less than 50 mm increased from 3 41 in 2000 to 10 05 in 2017 the reason for this increase was that the proportion of area with a water table depth deeper than 3 m in the study area increased from 0 93 to 12 90 from 2000 to 2017 as shown in fig 12 g 12 l due to the development of industry and agriculture causing more severe water resource shortages overall the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period was obviously lower in the southwest middle northern border and southeast regions the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district are shown in fig 12 m 12 n the lower phreatic et in the southwest was caused by the wide ranging areas of desert as shown in fig 12 m 12 n because of the lower ndvi as shown in fig 12 a 12 f while it was caused by the deeper water table depth due to groundwater extraction for industry and agriculture in the middle northern border and southeast as shown in fig 12 g 12 l the phreatic et has a decreasing pattern from west to east which is consistent with the spatial distribution of the ndvi caused by the spatial distribution of the planted crops 4 5 the results of the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act during the non freezing thawing period the results of the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act marked as etg etc act phreatic et contribution coefficient c during the non freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2017 are shown in fig 13 a the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period had a slight decreasing tendency the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of phreatic et were 95 3 mm 118 8 mm 102 7 mm and 6 3 mm respectively the average value of etg etc act from 2000 to 2017 was 24 4 with a range of 20 30 which was compatible with previous studies the etg etc act results from previous studies are summarized in table 4 miao et al 2016 reported that etg etc act was 21 33 by using the parametric approaches proposed by liu et al 2006 in a study area in the hetao irrigation district with a water table depth ranging from 0 73 m to 2 29 m yu et al 2016 obtained an etg etc act value of 25 5 by using the remote sensing model and the groundwater balance model and the values ranged within 16 28 based on a parametric equation in the hetao irrigation district xue et al 2017 in addition xu et al 2013 reported that etg etc act was 20 30 when the water table depth varied from 0 5 m to 2 0 m in the huinong irrigation district which is close to the hetao irrigation district these studies demonstrate that phreatic et plays an essential role in crop growth in arid areas with shallow water table depths there was a decreasing tendency of etg etc act from 2000 to 2017 as shown in fig 13 a the results of the water table depth the water supply the planting area the ndvi and crops production during the non freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2017 are displayed in fig 13 b 13 f the direct reason for the decreasing tendency of etg etc act was the increasing water table depth as shown in fig 13 b which was mainly caused by the decreasing water supply i e the sum of irrigation amount and precipitation i p and the increasing planting area as shown in fig 13 c and 13 d the decrease in water supply leads to a decrease in groundwater recharge and further increases the water table depth the increasing planting area results in an increase in the ndvi during the non freezing thawing period as shown in fig 13 e which causes higher water consumption and further increases the water table depth the higher water consumption during the non freezing thawing period can be confirmed from the increase in grain production and oil bearing crops production in the hetao irrigation district http tjj bynr gov cn as shown in fig 13 f xu et al 2010 concluded that phreatic et decreases with increasing water table depth sepaskhah et al 2003 and huo et al 2012 found a negative linear descending relationship between etg etc act and water table depth these studies were consistent with the decreasing tendency of etg etc act found in the current study 4 6 the phreatic et in different land cover types during the non freezing thawing period in the current study the land cover types from 2000 2010 and 2020 were used to represent the land cover types of 2000 2005 2006 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively as shown fig 12 m 12 o this is reasonable since the land cover types in adjacent years are similar yang et al 2012 yu et al 2019 the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district could be further divided into two categories cropland and non cropland non cropland includes forest grassland shrubland artificial surfaces bare land e g desert etc the comparison results of phreatic et and etc act during the non freezing thawing period in the cropland and non cropland are shown in fig 14 a and fig 14 b respectively the minimum maximum and average phreatic et values of cropland were 97 7 mm 122 9 mm and 106 2 mm respectively the average phreatic et of non cropland was 88 9 mm which was smaller than that of cropland the crop water demand was larger in cropland than in non cropland and the etc act was also larger in cropland as shown in fig 14 b the law of phreatic et in cropland and non cropland was consistent with the results of yue et al 2004 and yu et al 2016 4 7 the monthly variation in the spatial phreatic et the spatial variations in the monthly average phreatic et from june to november from 2000 to 2017 are displayed in fig 15 and the corresponding ndvi and water table depth are shown in fig 16 similar to the spatial distribution of the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period the monthly average phreatic et was obviously lower in the southwest middle northern border and southeast regions in each month due to the lower ndvi as shown in fig 16 a 16 f and the deeper water table depth as shown in fig 16 g 16 l the density distribution of the spatial monthly average phreatic et from june to november is displayed in fig 17 and the spatial distribution statistics of the monthly average phreatic et are shown in fig 15 the peak of the density distribution curve decreased from june to july and the corresponding phreatic et increased from july to november the peak of the density distribution curve increased and the corresponding phreatic et decreased the spatial monthly average phreatic et was concentrated around a smaller value and within a narrower range from july to november showing smaller spatial variability the spatial monthly average phreatic et from july to november was concentrated at 20 50 mm 10 30 mm 10 20 mm 5 10 mm and 5 10 mm respectively all the areas of the concentrated range in different months accounted for more than 65 of the regional area the monthly average phreatic et and its contribution to etc act are shown in table 5 the monthly phreatic et values were 23 2 mm 29 4 mm 20 9 mm 13 7 mm 9 0 mm and 6 6 mm in june july august september october and november respectively since crops gradually transition from the crop booming period to the harvest period from july to november the ndvi of the region decreases as shown in fig 16 b 16 f and table 5 which results in a decrease in phreatic et the decreasing trend of phreatic et was similar to that found by jiang et al 2017 in the ordos basin located in northwest china the contribution of phreatic et to etc act decreased slowly and then increased rapidly from june to november as shown in table 5 the water table depth gradually increased from june to august due to crop water consumption causing a decrease in the contribution of phreatic et to etc act june 22 8 july 21 7 august 19 8 then the crop water consumption decreased rapidly from september to november and the water table depth decreased rapidly due to the existence of autumn irrigation in this area which increased the contribution of phreatic et to etc act with values of 28 5 in september 41 1 in october and 67 3 in november the variation law of the contribution of the phreatic et to etc act from june to november was consistent with the result of chen et al 2020 found in this area 4 8 model application the values of water table depth eto and ndvi were the basis of the model prediction the main sources of groundwater recharge in this area are water diversion and precipitation therefore different scenarios of water diversion and precipitation were used to obtain the predicted water table depth considering the policy of reducing the water diversion from the yellow river three scenarios of annual water diversion were designed in the prediction marked as w1 with the current water diversion of 4 60 billion m3 i e 429 mm w2 4 00 billion m3 i e 373 mm and w3 3 64 billion m3 i e 339 mm three different levels of precipitation assurance were considered including rainy medium and drought hydrological years 25 p1 i e 193 mm 50 p2 i e 158 mm and 75 p3 i e 126 mm therefore nine prediction scenarios were used and marked as s1 w1p1 s2 w1p2 s3 w1p3 s4 w2p1 s5 w2p2 s6 w2p3 s7 w3p1 s8 w3p2 and s9 w3p3 as described in section 4 2 the recharge coefficient of irrigation water diversion was 0 30 the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 13 and the groundwater recharge was the sum of irrigation recharge and precipitation recharge fig 18 shows the relationship of the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge there was a significant negative relationship between the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge with a correlation coefficient r of 0 809 and a significance level p of 0 000 then the annual average water table depth of each of the nine scenarios was obtained by the relationship shown in fig 18 the spatial temporal water table depths of the nine scenarios expanded from that of 2007 because the relationship of the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge in 2007 was very consistent with the relationship shown in fig 18 eto is mainly related to the meteorological factors in this region the annual average eto ranged from 1000 mm to 1150 mm in 1961 2017 with a coefficient of variation of only 0 03 because of the small coefficient of variation for the annual average eto the spatial temporal eto values of the nine scenarios adopted the value from 2001 which was close to the average eto the ndvi reflects vegetation growth and activity and is influenced by irrigation area nutritional condition and irrigation water the irrigated area and nutrient conditions of the nine scenarios were considered the same as those in 2017 the spatial temporal ndvi values of the nine scenarios were expanded from that of 2017 and ensured that the etc act obtained by the new ndvi and eto was consistent with that obtained by the water balance model fig 19 shows the spatial variations in the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period of the nine scenarios and the results of the nine scenarios are displayed in table 6 the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period of s1 had a maximum value of 138 1 mm and that of s9 had a minimum value of 79 5 mm with the decrease in water diversion the water table depth increased and the phreatic et decreased which was consistent with previous study guo et al 2018 lin 2020 calculated the phreatic et using modflow and reported that the annual phreatic et was 109 mm under the same condition of s5 and the annual phreatic et was 100 mm under the same condition of s8 the phreatic et values obtained with the developed approach during the non freezing thawing period of s5 and s8 were 100 8 mm and 87 7 mm respectively the difference between our results and those of lin 2020 was 8 13 mm the phreatic et during the freezing thawing period was not calculated in the current study and was small due to the small etc act therefore the developed etc act approach had good performance during the forecasting period phreatic et was closely related to soil salinization areas or periods with high phreatic et red areas in fig 19 could be found according to the spatial temporal phreatic et produced by the developed approach these areas and periods with high phreatic et are more likely to be affected by soil salinization therefore targeted measures can be adopted in these areas and periods 5 conclusions this study developed a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et at the regional scale by using the ndvi water table depth and meteorological data the approach has several parameters that can be obtained by model calibration based on water balance models the new approach was used to estimate the spatial temporal phreatic et in the hetao irrigation district located in arid northwest china the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the new approach can yield reasonable phreatic et estimates at different spatial irrigation district and subareas and temporal month and non freezing thawing period scales the estimations match well with the results of the groundwater balance model 2 the spatial distribution of phreatic et is mainly affected by natural variation e g land cover types and human activities e g groundwater extraction planted crops at regional scales 3 in more than 60 of the hetao irrigation district the estimated phreatic et values during the non freezing thawing period range between 80 and 140 mm with an average value of 102 7 mm the phreatic et is approximately 24 4 of the etc act indicating the essential role of phreatic et in crop growth in arid areas with shallow water table depths 4 the phreatic et value of the hetao irrigation district in cropland is 106 2 mm which is larger than the 88 9 mm in non cropland 5 the monthly average phreatic et values from july to november are concentrated around a small value indicating small spatial variability of phreatic et the contribution of the phreatic et to etc act decreases slowly and then increases rapidly from june to november due to the variation in water table depth caused by crop growth and irrigation events declaration of competing interest the authors

9622,accurate estimation of the spatial temporal distribution of phreatic evapotranspiration et is critical for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization in arid and semiarid agricultural areas where substantial water saving efforts are needed traditional phreatic et estimation approaches either are for small scales or cannot consider spatial and or temporal variations in phreatic et this study developed a new approach for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and measured water table depths the ndvi was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration etc act by scaling it with the reference crop evapotranspiration eto the water table depths measured during the periods of no other factors i e precipitation irrigation and groundwater extraction were used to establish an equation used to estimate the phreatic et contribution coefficient defined as the ratio of phreatic et to the corresponding etc act to improve estimation accuracy a time related correction factor was considered in the equation for estimating the phreatic et the new approach was used to estimate monthly phreatic et with a spatial resolution of 250 m in the hetao irrigation district located in arid northwest china the estimated phreatic et at different spatial and temporal scales matched well with the groundwater balance model results the results show that the spatial distribution of phreatic et is affected by both natural factors e g land cover types and human activities e g groundwater extraction planted crops in the hetao irrigation district phreatic et contributes an average of 24 4 to etc act during the non freezing thawing period from june to november demonstrating the essential role of phreatic et in supporting crop growth and the general ecological environment in arid areas with shallow water table depths the new approach of estimating spatial temporal phreatic et may be used for designing effective and efficient water resource management policies at the regional scale keywords phreatic evapotranspiration estimation shallow groundwater remote sensing irrigation district 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource to sustain social and economic development in arid and semiarid areas with limited precipitation and surface water resources and these regions are widespread worldwide rodell et al 2009 peña arancibia et al 2016 ge et al 2017 sebai et al 2017 liu et al 2017 chen et al 2018 bierkens and wada 2019 ahmad et al 2021 in agricultural areas shallow groundwater moves upward to enter unsaturated zones overlying a superficial aquifer by phreatic evapotranspiration et for crop growth kahlown et al 2005 wu et al 2015 xue et al 2017 phreatic et occurs when groundwater moves through capillary rise to replenish soil water storage which has been depleted by crop uptake and soil evaporation phreatic et contributes to supplying water for crop and natural ecosystems wang et al 2016a making it an important source of actual evapotranspiration etc act driven by capillary rise salt moves upward with groundwater which may cause soil salinity problems hillel 2000 northey et al 2006 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 estimating phreatic et is important for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization especially in arid and semiarid regions salama et al 1999 chen and hu 2004 zipper et al 2015 the hetao irrigation district is located in arid northwest china and agricultural irrigation relies heavily on water resources diverted from the yellow river mao et al 2017 the shallow water table depth and the large amount of evapotranspiration are the two major factors for soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district li et al 2012 salts from the groundwater aquifer will move upwards to the soil layer along with the phreatic et due to the strong variation in land cover types soil characteristics and water table depths it is important to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of phreatic et to design effective water resource management policies to prevent soil salinization in this area many approaches have been developed to estimate phreatic et using lysimeter experiments yang et al 2007 fahle and dietrich 2014 tracer experiments costelloe et al 2014 shanafield et al 2015 and simplified approaches based on field observations and experimental data harbaugh et al 2000 shah et al 2007 yang et al 2007 investigated the phreatic et of wheat water use by conducting a large weighing lysimeter experiment fahle and dietrich 2014 reviewed the available methods for estimating phreatic et and compared the results with those measured values from lysimeter experiments costelloe et al 2014 revisited and extended the general advection diffusion equation to calculate the phreatic et with soil solute concentration profiles shanafield et al 2015 investigated the evaporative and evapotranspirative fluxes measured by using the chloride and stable isotope profiling method at stirling swamp a playa in central australia lysimeter experiments and tracer experiments can yield accurate phreatic et estimations at small scales but are expensive and time consuming liu et al 2016 based on field observations and experimental data different types of simplified approaches have been developed to estimate phreatic et under bare or vegetation covered ground conditions by using water table depth and evaporation data i e water surface evaporation pan evaporation and potential evaporation these approaches estimate phreatic et by developing calculation functions including linear harbaugh et al 2000 linear segment banta 2000 power zammouri 2001 hu et al 2008 and exponential functions shah et al 2007 all the above approaches are effective on small scales but have limitations when they are used on a regional scale brunner et al 2008 liu et al 2016 one limitation of the above approaches is that they cannot estimate the spatial temporal variability in phreatic et at a regional scale which is important for managing water resources and preventing soil salinization in space salama et al 1999 chen and hu 2004 zipper et al 2015 there are many factors impacting phreatic et including topography water table depth climate information soil types and land cover types sepaskhah et al 2003 and they vary spatially and or temporally at the regional scale thus phreatic et is often heterogeneous the existing approaches for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et include numerical models based on richards equation ahmad et al 2002 pozdniakov et al 2013 numerical models based on simplified approaches liu and luo 2012 liu et al 2015 and remote sensing approaches combined with simplified approaches nichols 1994 beamer et al 2013 numerical models based on richards equation are soil water flux models with the presence of water table depth wang et al 2016a such as hydrus 1d luo and sophocleous 2010 pozdniakov et al 2013 wave liu et al 2006 upflow raes and deproost 2003 and swap ahmad et al 2002 xu et al 2012 luo and sophocleous 2010 employed the hydrus 1d model with weighing lysimeter data to assess the seasonal groundwater contribution to crop etc act raes and deproost 2003 simulated capillary rise to the root zone by upflow software and the simulation results and corresponding field measurements were of the same order of magnitude xu et al 2012 coupled the swap package with modflow 2000 to estimate groundwater recharge and et however these models have practical limitations because the required hydraulic parameters are difficult to obtain liu and luo 2012 modflow harbaugh et al 2000 liu and luo 2012 and swat arnold et al 1993 liu et al 2015 are typical numerical models based on simplified approaches for estimating regional phreatic et these models cannot consider the impact of land cover types which limits their applications at regional scales remote sensing is a useful tool in the acquisition of spatially distributed data brunner et al 2007 remotely sensed vegetation indices corresponding to canopy vigor and cover have been successfully used to estimate phreatic et over large spatial and temporal scales nichols 1994 2000 brunner et al 2008 beamer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 nichols 2000 developed a method for estimating the spatial distribution of phreatic et in the great basin nevada usa as a function of plant cover using landsat data derived vegetation indices brunner et al 2008 established a function to estimate the vadose etc act by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi carlson and ripley 1997 and then obtained the regional phreatic et by subtracting the vadose component from the etc act in the studies of nichols 2000 and brunner et al 2008 the data used to establish equations for estimating phreatic et were from only two field sites and seven stations respectively these data may be insufficient for estimating the phreatic et in a large area the phreatic et is highly related with etc act brunner et al 2008 which means that the spatial temporal phreatic et can be obtained by calculating the spatial temporal etc act the spatial and temporal etc act can be calculated by a remote sensing approach combined with the traditional fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2011 which is a function of the actual crop coefficient k c act calculated by vegetation index derived from remote sensing and reference crop evapotranspiration eto yebra et al 2013 recommended that ndvi was preferred over other vegetation indices in the cropland according to the research of 16 fluxnet sites around the world ndvi is used to calculate k c act due to the high correlation between ndvi and k c act ray and dadhwal 2001 glenn et al 2010 2011 mutiibwa and irmak 2013 yebra et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 mahmoud and gan 2019 since both k c act and ndvi or vegetation indices are affected by the leaf area index and fractional ground cover heilman et al 1982 choudhury et al 1994 glenn et al 2007 the method is effective in most landscape types when transpiration dominates over soil evaporation in determining etc act glenn et al 2010 and is especially suitable for agricultural and natural ecosystems where transpiration is reported to generally account for 70 to 90 of etc act huxman et al 2004 williams et al 2004 the method of using ndvi to calculate k c act has been successfully applied in northwest china lei and yang 2014 hao and yang 2016 liu 2016 a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et was developed based on the spatial temporal etc act and the phreatic et contribution coefficient ndvi was used to calculate the k c act for obtaining the spatial and temporal etc act the water table fluctuation wtf method white 1932 diouf et al 2020 was adopted to obtain the phreatic et for establishing the corresponding function of the phreatic et contribution coefficient with the water table depth by using observations of the water table depth from 227 groundwater monitoring wells in the hetao irrigation district over a period of 9 years a time related correction factor was included to improve the accuracy of the method the main objectives were to 1 establish a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et 2 calculate the 5 day spatial phreatic et from 2000 to 2017 in the hetao irrigation district 3 discuss the temporal and spatial variations in phreatic et on different time scales and 4 apply the developed approach for predicting phreatic et under future conditions 2 study area and observation data 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district is located in the west inner mongolia autonomous region and has five subareas ulanbuh jiefangzha yongji yichang and urad based on irrigation management practices as shown in fig 1 the district is located in an arid continental climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 152 mm and an average annual pan evaporation of 2400 mm zhao et al 2020a the groundwater dynamics follow the vertical infiltration evaporation type due to the gentle land surface and the slight spatial variation in the water table depth yu et al 2010 ren et al 2016 thus hydrological processes e g infiltration evapotranspiration groundwater evapotranspiration and deep percolation mainly occur in the vertical direction furthermore this district has a freezing thawing period longer than five months i e from december to may of the next year considering the special physical process in the freezing thawing period the developed phreatic et estimation approach was applied from june to november marked as the non freezing thawing period including the autumn irrigation period from mid september to mid november sunflower wheat and maize are the predominant crops in this area and their growing seasons are from late may to late september late march to late july and late april to late september respectively although the autumn irrigation causes a shallow groundwater table depth the upward groundwater movement mechanism is also associated with phreatic et and the developed approach is suitable for this period 2 2 data description in the current study the spatial temporal water table depth ndvi and eto from 2000 to 2017 were used to estimate the spatial temporal phreatic et as shown in fig 1 227 groundwater observation wells are distributed across the district and the water table depth is measured every 5 days the spatial distribution of the water table depth was obtained by interpolating the hydraulic head and then obtaining the water table depth as the terrain elevation minus the head the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used in the current study the monthly measurements of the water table depth in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas are displayed in fig 2 a the adopted ndvi dataset was the product of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instrument the 16 day terra modis vegetation index product with a spatial resolution of 250 m mod13q1 kamel et al 2015 since february 2000 was downloaded from the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac http ladsweb nascom nasa gov the downloaded ndvi data were collated into monthly average data fig 2 b shows the monthly time series ndvi in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas eto was calculated by the fao penman monteith method according to the daily observed meteorological data from the five meteorological stations which are located in the five subareas as shown in fig 1 the daily observed meteorological data from 2000 to 2017 at each station were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and these data included the daily values of maximum and minimum temperature average temperature relative humidity average wind speed average air pressure and sunshine hours fig 2 c shows the monthly time series eto in the hetao irrigation district and its five subareas the monthly values of eto in different subareas were very similar thus the eto of any pixel in the space adopted the value of the meteorological station in the subarea where the pixel was located the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district in 2000 2010 and 2020 were obtained from the global geo information public product of national geomatics center of china http www globallandcover com doi 10 11769 monthly and yearly data for the water balance model were provided by the hetao administration and the data included precipitation water diversion equal to the irrigation water and drainage data domestic water data industrial water data livestock water data and lateral water data the monthly and yearly data were from 2000 to 2013 and 2000 2016 respectively the amount of water diversion and drainage data were measured from the diversion sluice and surface drains as shown in fig 1 the main time series inputs of the water balance model including precipitation water diversion and drainage are displayed in fig 2 d 2 f etc act is an important intermediate variable for estimating phreatic et to evaluate the accuracy of the etc act obtained by this study the etc act results of a field experiment and a 10 day public product ssebop with a spatial resolution of 1000 m were collected for comparison with the simulated etc act using the developed approach dai et al 2011 measured the daily average etc act in time intervals of 5 7 days at the dengkou agricultural experiment station in 2009 by the lysimeter experiment and water balance model the public etc act product of ssebop used the simplified surface energy balance model and was obtained from the usgs fews net data portal https earlywarning usgs gov fews senay et al 2020 3 methodologies the new approach for estimating the spatial temporal phreatic et as further described in section 3 1 was a function of the water table depth ndvi and eto the phreatic et contribution coefficient and etc act are the important intermediate variables for estimating phreatic et as further described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively the water balance model was used to calibrate the parameters of the developed approach and validate the accuracy of the approach and is described in section 3 4 3 1 the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach in the current study phreatic et was the product of the phreatic et contribution coefficient and etc act the equations are as follows 1 e t g c e t c act 2 c f m h m i p exp q h 3 e t c act k c act e t o 4 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 5 k c act a n d v i b where et g is the phreatic et mm c is the phreatic et contribution coefficient et c act is the actual evapotranspiration mm h is the water table depth m m represents month m is a correction factor which varies with time m i is a correction factor of the i th month in the non freezing thawing period et o is the reference crop et mm k c act is the actual crop coefficient which is relative to the actual crop conditions including water and salinity stress impacts δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and p q a and b are parameters to be estimated the parameters p and q are constant along time and space for any pixel phreatic et was estimated by using the dataset of the water table depth ndvi and eto and the calculation scheme can be found in fig 3 a the equation for calculating the phreatic et in each pixel is given in eq 6 and the regional phreatic et is estimated by eq 7 6 e t g m i p exp q h a n d v i b e t o 7 e t g s j 1 n m i p exp q h j a n d v i j b e t o j where et g s is the regional phreatic et mm n is the number of pixels in the study area and h j ndvi j and et o j are the water table depth ndvi and eto in the j th pixel respectively it should be noted that all the input data water table depth ndvi and eto vary in both space and time in the process of calculation the average value of the two adjacent measurements of water table depth was used the average ndvi was adopted for the current month the used eto value was the sum of the daily eto between two adjacent monitoring dates the time scale of the estimated regional phreatic et et g s by eq 7 was five days in the current study which corresponded to the measurement frequency of the water table depth the monthly regional phreatic et was the sum of the six regional phreatic et values in a month and the regional phreatic et of the non freezing thawing period was the sum of the monthly regional phreatic et values 3 2 the phreatic et contribution coefficient estimation method the phreatic et contribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the phreatic et to the corresponding etc act there are two unknown parameters p and q and the time dependent correction factor m i must be determined to calculate the phreatic et contribution coefficient the unknown parameters p and q were determined by fitting the dataset of the phreatic et contribution coefficient with the water table depth by the exponential equation the series of phreatic et contribution coefficients were obtained based on the calculated phreatic et and etc act data the etc act was calculated using the approach introduced in section 3 3 and the phreatic et was calculated by using the wtf method the water table depth fluctuates in response to many hydraulic processes including precipitation irrigation groundwater extraction and phreatic et healy and cook 2002 the wtf method is applicable for the fluctuation caused by a single factor this method has been widely used for estimating phreatic et gribovszki et al 2010 and specific yield delin et al 2007 when abundant water table depth data are available in the plain area where the horizontal groundwater flow could be neglected the phreatic et was calculated as follows wang and li 2007 schilling 2007 schilling and kiniry 2007 gribovszki et al 2010 diouf et al 2020 8 e t g μ δ h where μ is the specific yield and δh is the change in water table depth mm the increase in water table depth was mainly caused by phreatic et when there were no other factors i e precipitation irrigation and groundwater extraction causing the fluctuation of the water table depth in the plain area fig 3 b shows three chosen stages of water table depth increase when the wtf method could be applied during the a b and c stages as shown in fig 3 b the phreatic et could be calculated by the wtf method at the point scale the water table depth data for 9 years i e 2000 2005 2006 2009 2011 2012 2013 2015 and 2017 from 227 observation wells at the stage with no precipitation and irrigation were selected for calculating the phreatic et by using the wtf method there were 8965 phreatic et data points obtained and then the corresponding etc act and the phreatic et contribution coefficient were calculated next the relationship of the calculated phreatic et contribution coefficient and the measured water table depth was analysed and the parameters could be obtained from the fitted relationship 3 3 the spatial temporal etc act estimation approach for any pixel etc act was calculated by using the ndvi and the eto datasets and eq 3 to eq 5 as also shown in fig 3 a the etc act for the whole region was the sum of the values of all pixels as shown in eq 9 9 e t c act s a j 1 n n d v i j e t o j b j 1 n e t o j where et c act s is the regional actual evapotranspiration mm n is the number of pixels in the study area and ndvi j and et o j are the ndvi and the reference crop evapotranspiration in the j th pixel respectively then the etc act for the whole region within a year was the sum of the et c act s values in a year additionally the yearly regional etc act could be calculated by the water balance model described in section 3 4 and this value could be used to determine the unknown parameters a and b in eq 9 3 4 water balance model to calibrate the parameters of the spatial temporal etc act estimation approach and evaluate the approach the water balance model was used in the current study yang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the components of the water balance model are shown in fig 3 c and 3 d the water balance of the whole region was used to estimate the yearly regional etc act which can be expressed as follows 10 e t c act y p y i y d y q d y q i y q l y c s y δ w y where et c act y is the actual evapotranspiration of the y th year mm p y is the precipitation of the y th year mm i y is the irrigation amount of the y th year mm d y is the water drainage amount of the y th year mm q d y is the domestic water use of the y th year mm q i y is the industrial water use of the y th year mm q l y is the livestock water use of the y th year mm cs y is the lateral recharge of the y th year mm lateral recharge was ignored due to its very small value δw y is the change in the water storage in the whole region mm the change in the water storage in the whole region was considered small enough to be ignored at the annual scale chang 2003 senay et al 2011 du et al 2016 to obtain the parameters a and b of the etc act estimation approach eq 10 i e for the water balance of the whole region was used to calculate the yearly etc act from 2000 2016 in the hetao irrigation district the known ndvi and the reference crop evapotranspiration eto were used to calculate the two items j 1 n ndvi j et o j and j 1 n et o j in eq 9 and then the parameters a and b can be obtained by applying the least square method the groundwater balance model of the saturated zone was established to estimate the monthly phreatic et as follows 11 e t g m α i m β p m c s m λ d m q d m q i m μ δ h m where et g m is the monthly phreatic et mm the meanings of i p cs d q d and q i are the same as those in eq 10 and the subscript m represents the m th month α is the recharge coefficient of irrigation dimensionless β is the recharge coefficient of precipitation dimensionless λ is the proportion of the groundwater drainage amount to the total drainage amount μ is the specific yield dimensionless and μδh m is the monthly change in the groundwater storage of the m th month mm 3 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the simulation accuracy between the simulated and observed values five evaluation metrics including the coefficient of determination r 2 moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 the mean error me nelson et al 2011 and the mean relative error mre fang et al 2008 were used in the current study r 2 and nse values close to 1 0 indicate good model performance for rmse me and mre values closest to 0 indicate good model performance these evaluation indicators are defined as follows 12 r 2 i 1 n m o i o p i p 2 i 1 n m o i o 2 i 1 n m p i p 2 13 n s e 1 i 1 n m o i p i 2 i 1 n m o i o 2 14 r m s e i 1 n m p i o i 2 n m 15 m e p o 16 m r e 1 n m i 1 n m p i o i o i 100 where o i is the observed value p i is the estimated or predicted value o p are the corresponding average values nm is the number of measurements 3 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis plays an essential role in understanding the impact of input variables and parameters on model output and helps understand the mechanisms of error propagation and uncertainty of the model long and singh 2012 yang and shang 2013 the sensitivity of the estimated phreatic et by the developed approach to the four parameters including a b p and q was analysed as follows xue et al 2017 17 s n δ e t g e t g δ v n v n where s n represents the sensitivity of parameter n δet g is the variation in the simulated phreatic et when the variation in the value of parameter n is δv n v n is the value of the parameter n the parameter m i is a correction factor of the i th month in the non freezing thawing period for the parameter p which has a similar effect as parameter p so the sensitivity of the estimated phreatic et to parameter m i was not analysed the perturbations of the parameters ranged from 20 20 with a variation step of 5 4 results and discussion in this section the parameters for calculating etc act a and b and the phreatic et contribution coefficient m i p and q were calculated then the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach was calibrated and validated for the entire hetao irrigation district to verify the applicability of the developed spatial phreatic et estimation approach the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district were extracted and compared with the values calculated from the groundwater balance model according to the validated phreatic et estimation approach the spatial temporal phreatic et was calculated from 2000 to 2017 in the hetao irrigation district then the temporal and spatial variations in phreatic et on different time scales month and non freezing thawing period were analysed in addition the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act were discussed finally nine prediction scenarios were analysed by using the developed approach 4 1 the results of parameters for estimating the etc act the estimated values of parameters a and b were 1 25 and 0 16 respectively there have been many studies on modelling the actual crop coefficient as a function of ndvi parameters a and b of the relationship between the actual crop coefficient and ndvi are displayed in table 1 according to previous studies parameter a ranges from 0 918 to 1 580 and parameter b ranges from 0 111 0 303 thus the obtained parameters in the current study were within the range reported in previous studies moreover parameters a and b obtained in the current study were very similar to the values recommended by belmonte et al 2005 cuesta et al 2005 rubio et al 2006 allen et al 2011 and rocha et al 2012 who reported parameters a and b of 1 25 and 0 20 respectively the comparison result of actual crop coefficients provided by previous studies and this study is shown in fig 4 the actual crop coefficients calculated by this study were within the range reported in previous studies which demonstrated that the parameters obtained by this study are convincing in the current study the accuracy of the etc act produced by the developed approach was evaluated at both the field and regional scales the comparison results of the yearly etc act calculated by the water balance model and the developed approach in the current study from 2000 to 2016 are shown in fig 5 a the evaluation metrics rmse me and mre were 40 98 mm 2 23 mm and 0 77 respectively which demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the adopted spatial temporal etc act estimation approach compared with other studies in the hetao irrigation district the mre of this study was slightly smaller than that 5 2 5 6 reported by yang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 and yu et al 2019 the rmse of this study was consistent with the study of yebra et al 2013 who found that the rmse ranged from 26 mm year to 48 mm year when using the potential et scaling approach in 16 eddy covariance flux tower sites around the world fig 5 b shows results from comparing the developed approach and the field experiment at the dengkou agricultural experiment station in 2009 dai et al 2011 the rmse me and mre were 1 06 mm 0 40 mm and 19 30 respectively which demonstrated that the estimated etc act using the developed approach matched the observed data by lysimeter experiments at the field scale the simulated accuracy of the developed approach at the regional scale was better than that at the field scale which was consistent with the results of bai et al 2017 and yu et al 2019 who showed that the mre values of the simulated etc act were 5 2 6 0 at the regional scale while the mre values were 13 16 at the field scale then the public etc act product of ssebop was compared with the simulated etc act using the developed approach from the time period of 2003 2016 fig 6 a shows the comparison results of the annual etc act for the water balance model the developed approach and ssebop and the annual average values which were 558 mm 566 mm and 524 mm respectively the developed approach and ssebop obtained values close to the annual etc act calculated by the water balance model the monthly etc act values of the developed approach and ssebop were compared shown in fig 6 b the nse rmse and me were 0 897 13 990 mm and 3 527 mm respectively which proved that the developed approach could obtain monthly etc act values that were consistent with those of ssebop compared with the surface energy balance seb e g ssebop models based on thermal infrared data the etc act simulation approach based on the ndvi and eto is often preferred for operational applications because of its simplicity duchemin et al 2006 tasumi et al 2006 it is challenging for the etc act estimation approach used in the current study to estimate evaporation from bare soil following precipitation events reported by previous studies allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2015 however this condition is not usual in arid and semiarid agricultural regions huang et al 2016 and the average annual precipitation was only 152 mm in the current study which implies that the etc act estimation approach in the current study can serve as an alternative approach to estimate etc act in these regions hornbuckle et al 2016 water salt stress is reflected by parameters a and b using this approach however it should be mentioned that there was no water stress during the primary growth period or the water salt stress was less than 9 in the current study area according to previous studies miao 2015 miao et al 2016 ren et al 2016 huang et al 2019 these are reasons why the developed approach can obtain etc act values consistent with ssebop therefore the developed approach is valid in irrigated regions with less water salt stress according to this study the applicability of the approach for estimating the reduction in etc act caused by acute water or salinity stress is still challenging 4 2 the results of parameters for estimating the phreatic et contribution coefficient the value of specific yield is vital to obtain the phreatic et by using the wtf method healy and cook 2002 loheide et al 2005 specific yield is known to vary with water table depth duke 1972 loheide et al 2005 reported that specific yield was mainly related to the soil structure when the water table depth was deeper than 1 m a total of 8965 datasets were used in the wtf method in the current study and the water table depths of 99 5 of the datasets were deeper than 1 m therefore the specific yield was set at a constant value following common practice in the current study delin et al 2007 table 2 shows the values of specific yield in the hetao irrigation district according to previous studies the specific yield obtained by the volume balance method in our previous study was 0 026 0 028 zhao et al 2020b which was consistent with the results of yue 2004 and ren et al 2019 the recommended specific yield was 0 02 0 04 according to the pumping test data and soil textures in this area yu 2017 wu et al 2018 considering the volume balance data and pumping test data the adopted specific yield was 0 03 the relationship between the phreatic et contribution coefficient and the water table depth with the 8965 datasets is shown in fig 7 a most of the phreatic et contribution coefficient data were concentrated in a triangular region and there was a pattern that showed that the deeper the water table depth was the smaller the phreatic et contribution coefficient was the frequency distribution of the water table depth corresponding to the 8965 datasets of the phreatic et contribution coefficient is shown in fig 7 b the water table depth from 0 3 m to 4 8 m in fig 7 b was spaced at the 0 3 m interval considering that the number of datasets in the different water table depth intervals varied greatly the average phreatic et contribution coefficient and the average water table depth were calculated in each interval then the relationship between the phreatic et contribution coefficient of each interval and the water table depth is shown in fig 7 c and the fitted parameters p and q of the whole non freezing thawing period are displayed in table 3 the parameter p was 0 731 q was 0 639 and the coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 976 the phreatic et contribution coefficient was close to 0 when the water table depth was deeper than 5 m as shown in fig 7 a and c therefore the phreatic et contribution coefficient was set as 0 when the water table depth exceeded 5 m in the current study to verify the rationality of the fitted parameters of the phreatic et contribution coefficient equation the result was compared with the equation developed by wang 2002 obtained from the lysimeter experiment with natural vegetation as shown in fig 7 c the phreatic et contribution coefficient values obtained in the current study were close to those provided by wang 2002 within the water table depth interval of 0 5 1 5 m while the results of this study were larger than those from wang 2002 when the water table depth was deeper than 1 5 m a potential explanation is that the results of wang 2002 are suitable under natural vegetation with shallow roots zhang et al 1995 analysed the law of phreatic et in bare land and cropland through lysimeter experiments they reported that the phreatic et was almost 0 mm d with a water table depth of 2 5 m for bare land while it was 0 327 mm d for cropland kang et al 2001 provided the etc act for this experiment the phreatic et contribution coefficient was approximately 0 13 for cropland with a water table depth of 2 5 m the phreatic et contribution coefficient was approximately 0 16 with a water table depth of 2 5 m in the current study which was similar to the results of zhang et al 1995 and kang et al 2001 in general the fitted phreatic et contribution coefficient equation of this study was reasonable furthermore the exponential relationships between the phreatic et contribution coefficient values of different months and the water table depths were analysed as shown in fig 7 d the exponential fitting curves in different months were different which implied the necessity to induce the correction parameter m i due to the different number of datasets in different months as shown in table 3 the m i values were not obtained directly by fitting the datasets shown in fig 7 d but they were determined by calibrating and validating the groundwater balance model as shown in eq 11 the groundwater balance model was used to calculate the monthly phreatic et from 2000 to 2013 in the hetao irrigation district with the first 11 years of data for calibration and the subsequent 3 years of data for validation the recharge coefficient of irrigation α was 0 30 the recharge coefficient of precipitation β was 0 13 and the proportion of the groundwater drainage amount to the total drainage amount λ was 0 30 in eq 11 all of which were validated by several studies wang et al 2016b yue et al 2016 xue et al 2017 yu 2017 sun et al 2019 the comparison results of the phreatic et calculated by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach in the calibration and validation periods are displayed in fig 8 the results of the phreatic et estimated by the developed approach matched well with those from the groundwater balance model the evaluation metrics nse rmse and me of the monthly phreatic et reflect the good performance of the developed approach in the calibration nse 0 875 rmse 2 862 mm me 0 663 mm and validation nse 0 687 rmse 5 631 mm me 0 219 mm periods as shown in fig 8 b and 8 c the evaluation metrics rmse me and mre of the total phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period also demonstrate the good performance of the developed approach in the calibration rmse 8 013 mm me 3 976 mm mre 3 44 and validation rmse 11 464 mm me 1 314 mm mre 0 81 periods as shown in fig 8 d the results of the calibrated m i are shown in table 3 the m i values of june july and august were smaller than 1 and those of september october and november were larger than 1 which was in good agreement with the law reflected in fig 7 d furthermore the m i value had a significant negative relationship with the ndvi correlation coefficient r 0 909 significance level p 0 012 when the ndvi was smaller than the average ndvi the etc act decreased rapidly and the calculated phreatic et contribution coefficient was smaller than the real value without considering m i the results of the sensitivity analysis of the four input parameters a b p and q are shown in fig 9 the results of sensitivity analysis showed that phreatic et was most sensitive to changes in parameter q followed by changes in parameters p and a and it was least sensitive to b a 10 increase in parameters a b p and q could result in 7 22 2 78 10 00 and 10 22 increases in phreatic et respectively these results indicate that phreatic et is mainly affected by the water table depth because phreatic et comes from shallow groundwater sufficient datasets are needed to obtain parameters p and q to ensure applicability as 8965 datasets over 9 years from 227 observation wells were used in the current study 4 3 validation of the spatial temporal phreatic et estimation approach in the five subareas of the hetao irrigation district to verify the applicability of the developed phreatic et estimation approach in space the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district were extracted and compared with the values of the groundwater balance model from 2000 to 2013 the comparison results of the monthly phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district calculated by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach are displayed in fig 10 a 10 j the evaluation metrics showed that ulanbuh nse 0 714 rmse 5 044 mm me 0 172 mm and jiefangzha nse 0 687 rmse 5 023 mm me 2 846 mm had the best performance followed by yichang nse 0 624 rmse 5 595 mm me 1 129 mm yongji nse 0 517 rmse 5 878 mm me 2 427 mm and urad nse 0 539 rmse 7 066 mm me 0 977 mm in urad there were 4 and 11 fewer monitoring wells that could provide water table depth in 2012 and 2013 relative to the period before 2012 respectively causing a larger deviation when interpolating the spatial water table depth overall the developed phreatic et estimation approach in the current study was able to obtain reasonable monthly phreatic et in space compared with the groundwater balance model the comparison results of the phreatic et values of the five subareas in the hetao irrigation district during the non freezing thawing period by the groundwater balance model and the developed approach are shown in fig 10 k 10 o the rmse values were 7 959 mm 19 236 mm 16 496 mm 13 884 mm and 22 933 mm the me values were 1 035 mm 17 073 mm 14 561 mm 6 773 mm and 5 863 mm and the mre values were 0 893 13 092 12 508 5 441 and 10 315 which demonstrate the good applicability of the developed phreatic et estimation approach thus the developed phreatic et estimation approach is effective in calculating the spatial temporal phreatic et in the hetao irrigation district during the non freezing thawing period 4 4 the spatial temporal phreatic et on the time scale of the non freezing thawing period to analyse the spatial distribution of the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period the results from 2000 2003 2007 2010 2013 and 2017 were selected for analysis the spatial variations of which are displayed in fig 11 the corresponding ndvi and water table depth of these years are shown in fig 12 a 12 f and g 12 l respectively the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period was concentrated within 80 140 mm accounting for more than 60 of the total area the proportion of the spatial phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period exceeding 170 mm was very small and was mainly located in the area with a high ndvi as shown in fig 12 a 12 f the proportion of the spatial phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period less than 50 mm increased from 3 41 in 2000 to 10 05 in 2017 the reason for this increase was that the proportion of area with a water table depth deeper than 3 m in the study area increased from 0 93 to 12 90 from 2000 to 2017 as shown in fig 12 g 12 l due to the development of industry and agriculture causing more severe water resource shortages overall the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period was obviously lower in the southwest middle northern border and southeast regions the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district are shown in fig 12 m 12 n the lower phreatic et in the southwest was caused by the wide ranging areas of desert as shown in fig 12 m 12 n because of the lower ndvi as shown in fig 12 a 12 f while it was caused by the deeper water table depth due to groundwater extraction for industry and agriculture in the middle northern border and southeast as shown in fig 12 g 12 l the phreatic et has a decreasing pattern from west to east which is consistent with the spatial distribution of the ndvi caused by the spatial distribution of the planted crops 4 5 the results of the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act during the non freezing thawing period the results of the phreatic et and its contribution to the etc act marked as etg etc act phreatic et contribution coefficient c during the non freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2017 are shown in fig 13 a the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period had a slight decreasing tendency the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of phreatic et were 95 3 mm 118 8 mm 102 7 mm and 6 3 mm respectively the average value of etg etc act from 2000 to 2017 was 24 4 with a range of 20 30 which was compatible with previous studies the etg etc act results from previous studies are summarized in table 4 miao et al 2016 reported that etg etc act was 21 33 by using the parametric approaches proposed by liu et al 2006 in a study area in the hetao irrigation district with a water table depth ranging from 0 73 m to 2 29 m yu et al 2016 obtained an etg etc act value of 25 5 by using the remote sensing model and the groundwater balance model and the values ranged within 16 28 based on a parametric equation in the hetao irrigation district xue et al 2017 in addition xu et al 2013 reported that etg etc act was 20 30 when the water table depth varied from 0 5 m to 2 0 m in the huinong irrigation district which is close to the hetao irrigation district these studies demonstrate that phreatic et plays an essential role in crop growth in arid areas with shallow water table depths there was a decreasing tendency of etg etc act from 2000 to 2017 as shown in fig 13 a the results of the water table depth the water supply the planting area the ndvi and crops production during the non freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2017 are displayed in fig 13 b 13 f the direct reason for the decreasing tendency of etg etc act was the increasing water table depth as shown in fig 13 b which was mainly caused by the decreasing water supply i e the sum of irrigation amount and precipitation i p and the increasing planting area as shown in fig 13 c and 13 d the decrease in water supply leads to a decrease in groundwater recharge and further increases the water table depth the increasing planting area results in an increase in the ndvi during the non freezing thawing period as shown in fig 13 e which causes higher water consumption and further increases the water table depth the higher water consumption during the non freezing thawing period can be confirmed from the increase in grain production and oil bearing crops production in the hetao irrigation district http tjj bynr gov cn as shown in fig 13 f xu et al 2010 concluded that phreatic et decreases with increasing water table depth sepaskhah et al 2003 and huo et al 2012 found a negative linear descending relationship between etg etc act and water table depth these studies were consistent with the decreasing tendency of etg etc act found in the current study 4 6 the phreatic et in different land cover types during the non freezing thawing period in the current study the land cover types from 2000 2010 and 2020 were used to represent the land cover types of 2000 2005 2006 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively as shown fig 12 m 12 o this is reasonable since the land cover types in adjacent years are similar yang et al 2012 yu et al 2019 the land cover types of the hetao irrigation district could be further divided into two categories cropland and non cropland non cropland includes forest grassland shrubland artificial surfaces bare land e g desert etc the comparison results of phreatic et and etc act during the non freezing thawing period in the cropland and non cropland are shown in fig 14 a and fig 14 b respectively the minimum maximum and average phreatic et values of cropland were 97 7 mm 122 9 mm and 106 2 mm respectively the average phreatic et of non cropland was 88 9 mm which was smaller than that of cropland the crop water demand was larger in cropland than in non cropland and the etc act was also larger in cropland as shown in fig 14 b the law of phreatic et in cropland and non cropland was consistent with the results of yue et al 2004 and yu et al 2016 4 7 the monthly variation in the spatial phreatic et the spatial variations in the monthly average phreatic et from june to november from 2000 to 2017 are displayed in fig 15 and the corresponding ndvi and water table depth are shown in fig 16 similar to the spatial distribution of the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period the monthly average phreatic et was obviously lower in the southwest middle northern border and southeast regions in each month due to the lower ndvi as shown in fig 16 a 16 f and the deeper water table depth as shown in fig 16 g 16 l the density distribution of the spatial monthly average phreatic et from june to november is displayed in fig 17 and the spatial distribution statistics of the monthly average phreatic et are shown in fig 15 the peak of the density distribution curve decreased from june to july and the corresponding phreatic et increased from july to november the peak of the density distribution curve increased and the corresponding phreatic et decreased the spatial monthly average phreatic et was concentrated around a smaller value and within a narrower range from july to november showing smaller spatial variability the spatial monthly average phreatic et from july to november was concentrated at 20 50 mm 10 30 mm 10 20 mm 5 10 mm and 5 10 mm respectively all the areas of the concentrated range in different months accounted for more than 65 of the regional area the monthly average phreatic et and its contribution to etc act are shown in table 5 the monthly phreatic et values were 23 2 mm 29 4 mm 20 9 mm 13 7 mm 9 0 mm and 6 6 mm in june july august september october and november respectively since crops gradually transition from the crop booming period to the harvest period from july to november the ndvi of the region decreases as shown in fig 16 b 16 f and table 5 which results in a decrease in phreatic et the decreasing trend of phreatic et was similar to that found by jiang et al 2017 in the ordos basin located in northwest china the contribution of phreatic et to etc act decreased slowly and then increased rapidly from june to november as shown in table 5 the water table depth gradually increased from june to august due to crop water consumption causing a decrease in the contribution of phreatic et to etc act june 22 8 july 21 7 august 19 8 then the crop water consumption decreased rapidly from september to november and the water table depth decreased rapidly due to the existence of autumn irrigation in this area which increased the contribution of phreatic et to etc act with values of 28 5 in september 41 1 in october and 67 3 in november the variation law of the contribution of the phreatic et to etc act from june to november was consistent with the result of chen et al 2020 found in this area 4 8 model application the values of water table depth eto and ndvi were the basis of the model prediction the main sources of groundwater recharge in this area are water diversion and precipitation therefore different scenarios of water diversion and precipitation were used to obtain the predicted water table depth considering the policy of reducing the water diversion from the yellow river three scenarios of annual water diversion were designed in the prediction marked as w1 with the current water diversion of 4 60 billion m3 i e 429 mm w2 4 00 billion m3 i e 373 mm and w3 3 64 billion m3 i e 339 mm three different levels of precipitation assurance were considered including rainy medium and drought hydrological years 25 p1 i e 193 mm 50 p2 i e 158 mm and 75 p3 i e 126 mm therefore nine prediction scenarios were used and marked as s1 w1p1 s2 w1p2 s3 w1p3 s4 w2p1 s5 w2p2 s6 w2p3 s7 w3p1 s8 w3p2 and s9 w3p3 as described in section 4 2 the recharge coefficient of irrigation water diversion was 0 30 the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 13 and the groundwater recharge was the sum of irrigation recharge and precipitation recharge fig 18 shows the relationship of the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge there was a significant negative relationship between the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge with a correlation coefficient r of 0 809 and a significance level p of 0 000 then the annual average water table depth of each of the nine scenarios was obtained by the relationship shown in fig 18 the spatial temporal water table depths of the nine scenarios expanded from that of 2007 because the relationship of the annual average water table depth and groundwater recharge in 2007 was very consistent with the relationship shown in fig 18 eto is mainly related to the meteorological factors in this region the annual average eto ranged from 1000 mm to 1150 mm in 1961 2017 with a coefficient of variation of only 0 03 because of the small coefficient of variation for the annual average eto the spatial temporal eto values of the nine scenarios adopted the value from 2001 which was close to the average eto the ndvi reflects vegetation growth and activity and is influenced by irrigation area nutritional condition and irrigation water the irrigated area and nutrient conditions of the nine scenarios were considered the same as those in 2017 the spatial temporal ndvi values of the nine scenarios were expanded from that of 2017 and ensured that the etc act obtained by the new ndvi and eto was consistent with that obtained by the water balance model fig 19 shows the spatial variations in the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period of the nine scenarios and the results of the nine scenarios are displayed in table 6 the phreatic et during the non freezing thawing period of s1 had a maximum value of 138 1 mm and that of s9 had a minimum value of 79 5 mm with the decrease in water diversion the water table depth increased and the phreatic et decreased which was consistent with previous study guo et al 2018 lin 2020 calculated the phreatic et using modflow and reported that the annual phreatic et was 109 mm under the same condition of s5 and the annual phreatic et was 100 mm under the same condition of s8 the phreatic et values obtained with the developed approach during the non freezing thawing period of s5 and s8 were 100 8 mm and 87 7 mm respectively the difference between our results and those of lin 2020 was 8 13 mm the phreatic et during the freezing thawing period was not calculated in the current study and was small due to the small etc act therefore the developed etc act approach had good performance during the forecasting period phreatic et was closely related to soil salinization areas or periods with high phreatic et red areas in fig 19 could be found according to the spatial temporal phreatic et produced by the developed approach these areas and periods with high phreatic et are more likely to be affected by soil salinization therefore targeted measures can be adopted in these areas and periods 5 conclusions this study developed a new approach for estimating spatial temporal phreatic et at the regional scale by using the ndvi water table depth and meteorological data the approach has several parameters that can be obtained by model calibration based on water balance models the new approach was used to estimate the spatial temporal phreatic et in the hetao irrigation district located in arid northwest china the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the new approach can yield reasonable phreatic et estimates at different spatial irrigation district and subareas and temporal month and non freezing thawing period scales the estimations match well with the results of the groundwater balance model 2 the spatial distribution of phreatic et is mainly affected by natural variation e g land cover types and human activities e g groundwater extraction planted crops at regional scales 3 in more than 60 of the hetao irrigation district the estimated phreatic et values during the non freezing thawing period range between 80 and 140 mm with an average value of 102 7 mm the phreatic et is approximately 24 4 of the etc act indicating the essential role of phreatic et in crop growth in arid areas with shallow water table depths 4 the phreatic et value of the hetao irrigation district in cropland is 106 2 mm which is larger than the 88 9 mm in non cropland 5 the monthly average phreatic et values from july to november are concentrated around a small value indicating small spatial variability of phreatic et the contribution of the phreatic et to etc act decreases slowly and then increases rapidly from june to november due to the variation in water table depth caused by crop growth and irrigation events declaration of competing interest the authors

9623,recent years have seen continued investments in new irrigation dams across africa which have led to the emergence of new irrigated areas in their vicinity or command areas the ability to irrigate land that was previously only rainfed allows for an increase in crop production and is therefore associated with an increase in the value generated by agriculture what is the value produced by irrigation in the command areas of new major african dams here we use crop water modeling under a variety of crop distribution scenarios to determine the increase in agricultural value induced by irrigation in the command areas adjacent to the major irrigation dams we use these estimates to determine the shadow price of irrigation water in these regions along with the increase in land value and land s economic productivity we focus on dams built in africa between 2000 and 2015 which are clustered in northern east and southern africa this study provides a framework to determine the economic benefits of irrigation dams and evaluate the increase in agricultural revenues resulting from access to water for irrigation keywords irrigation water value command areas irrigation dams shadow price of water irrigated crops yield gap closure 1 introduction the pressure on water resources for agricultural use is increasing globally especially in water limited environments as a result of growing populations the increase in per capita food consumption and the consequent need for agricultural products d odorico et al 2018 falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 as the major contributor to human water consumption agriculture accounts for about 85 of societal water needs falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 as a scarce and essential resource water is a major factor constraining crop production and an important determinant for investments in agriculture which often aim at securing access to water resources for irrigation mehta et al 2012 water used by agriculture is too bulky to be transported over long distances and is typically used locally to sustain the production of crops that are then either consumed in the region or placed on national and global markets allan 1998 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 thus water appropriation by agribusiness corporations typically occurs through the acquisition of land rights e g land acquisitions long term leases or land concessions in areas with good access to adjacent streams underlying aquifers or other existing water bodies dell angelo et al 2018 müller et al 2021 rulli et al 2013 alternatively water appropriations may occur directly through the acquisition of water rights and water entitlements in areas where such rights exist and can be traded separately from land rights or through the construction of dams and the associated water storage in reservoirs for a variety of uses including irrigation duvail et al 2012 hanjra et al 2009 mehta et al 2012 reservoirs allow for the storage of water from wet seasons and its use in dry seasons providing a more reliable and predictable supply as well as opportunities for extending cultivation to drier months of the year the construction of dams and the storage of water in reservoirs however have strong environmental and social impacts such as the loss of environmental flows downstream from the dam the interruption of sediment flow and consequent fluvial and coastal erosion and the loss of access to water by downstream farmers pastoralist groups and other users e g carr 2017 palmer et al 2015 sun et al 2021 the zones irrigated with water from such reservoirs are often known as command areas rufin et al 2018 recent research has mapped the emergence or expansion of command areas in the proximity of major irrigation dams in africa typically downstream from them tatlhego and d odorico 2022 interestingly it has been found that the command areas of dams built in the african continent in the last two decades for agricultural use have been targeted by large scale land investors tatlhego and d odorico 2022 suggesting that large dams are often built more to the benefit of large scale commercial farming than smallholders or subsistence agriculture tatlhego and d odorico 2022 in this context it remains unclear to what extent crop production can be enhanced by access to water stored in the reservoir upstream from these new dams what is the value generated by irrigation in the new command areas answering this question would allow for an estimate of the shadow price of water acquired by agribusiness corporations and local farmers operating in the command area and provide an estimate of the increase in farmland value resulting from access to water young and loomis 2014 the value of water however is difficult to determine as it is often affected by subjective perceptions of what is scarce particularly because water is extremely variable in its geographical occurrences and availability hanemann 2006 pacetti et al 2020 understanding the value of water through an analysis of irrigation water requirements and associated changes in crop yields is needed to fully appreciate the benefits farmers get from having access to irrigation water in the command area and allows for the valuation of the economic benefits brought about by investments in dam and irrigation infrastructure kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 in water limited environments water can be easily considered a scarce valuable economic resource tewabe and dessie 2020 and the construction of dams is often invoked as an investment that would allow for a more reliable water supply grey and sadoff 2007 though recent studies on green infrastructure indicate more sustainable and equitable approaches to irrigation water management palmer et al 2015 ross and hasnain 2018 indeed the construction of the new african dams has been shown to have preferentially occurred to the benefit of large scale farming rather than small holders tatlhego and d odorico 2022 suggesting that agribusinesses are gaining control over precious water resources what type of economic gains can result from irrigated farming within these command areas in this study we attempt a quantitative assessment of the value generated by water and the increase in land value under suitable crop scenarios this study provides a quantitative framework to determine the economic benefits associated with the increase in agricultural revenues resulting from the development of surface reservoirs and other irrigation infrastructure 2 methods this study focuses on 18 dams table 1 built in africa for agriculture after 2000 according to the fao aquastat database fao 2016 irrigated or command areas table 1 were identified in a previous study using land use classification tatlhego and d odorico 2022 command area delineations were identified as those that showed irrigation in 2015 their polygon boundaries were used to extract maximum irrigated crop yields y i i expressed in hg ha from the global agro ecological zoning version 4 data base gaez 2020 for every crop i suitable to that area table s1 in the case of banana date melon and sesame we used 2016 yields from the fao faostat 2021 the gaez database provides crop yields that need to be adjusted to be consistent with the fao values the conversion factors q provided by gaez 2020 are reported in table s1 fao food prices at the farm gate were used to determine the value generated by water in agriculture as explained below http www fao org faostat en data pp using the watneeds crop water model chiarelli et al 2020 we determined green water i e rainwater consumption gwc i see table s2 and the irrigation water requirements iwr i which is the irrigation or blue water required by each suitable crop i to attain maximum yields during their growth season table s3 watneeds is a crop water model that uses data of net solar radiation wind speed air temperature and humidity as well as information on crop type and planting harvesting dates to calculate the actual and potential evapotranspiration using the penman montieth equation the model accounts for soil moisture and its impact on evapotranspiration rates through a soil water balance at the daily time scale chiarelli et al 2020 the maximum crop yields y i i provided by gaez 2020 are attained in irrigated conditions assuming a linear scaling of yields with water consumption

proportionality expressing the linear dependence of yields on crop water use values of k y i can be defined as proportion of crop water use compared to the reference crop values of k y i were taken from smith and steduto 2012 and in those few cases in which they were not available they were assumed to be equal to 1 thus the increase in crop yield in t ha induced by irrigation is table s4 calculated as 2 y y i i y r i for each command area we used crop statistics data to compare rainfed and irrigated production and ascertain the change in production that could be attributed to irrigation using farm gate fao crop prices table s5 pi c for crop i in country c in t the value v i in us generated by the irrigation of that crop was calculated as d odorico et al 2020 3 v i y i p i c a i with eq 2 being the irrigation induced increase in the yield t ha of crop i cultivated within an area a i of the command area and the subscript c referring to the country in which the command area is located the amount v i m3 of water needed for the irrigation of crop i was then calculated as the product of its irrigation water requirement iwr i m3 ha 0 1 mm calculated with the watneed model by its area ai divided by the efficiency e i 4 v i iwr i e i a i where the efficiency e i of the irrigation system used for crop i is the ratio between the amounts of irrigation water evapotranspired consumed by the crop and the applied water sauer et al 2010 we accounted for the efficiency of irrigation because farmers typically must account for water withdrawals rather than water consumption for their allocations the value of water wv used for the irrigation of crop i in each command area is then determined as the ratio us m3 5 wv i v i v i e i y i p i c iwr i we used efficiency values table s6 equal to 0 60 and 0 64 0 25 and 0 30 for sprinkler surface irrigation in north africa and sub saharan africa respectively sauer et al 2010 and assumed that farmers adopt the irrigation techniques i e sprinkler vs surface that maximize yields in the gaez 2020 database irrigation efficiency is fraction of the water volume provided through irrigation that is actually used by the plant the remaining fraction i e 1 e contributes to soil drainage or surface runoff there is a dearth of data bases reporting information on irrigation systems across african countries irrigation is overall poorly developed in africa and the areas included in this study have started to be irrigated just in the last few years tatlhego and d odorico 2022 therefore our study needs to rely on suitable assumptions on the irrigation systems that are likely to be adopted in these newly cultivated and irrigated farmlands the sprinkler irrigation method attains higher efficiencies as compared to surface irrigation which basically floods the planted surfaces and using way more water than needed for crops whose yields were taken from faostat we assumed that farmers practice sprinkler irrigation because in most cases we are looking at newly established irrigated agriculture in areas undergoing major investments in irrigation infrastructure including the construction of dams or barrages since these dams are all located in arid or semiarid regions where crop production is limited by water availability it is reasonable to expect that farmers would use irrigation methods that conserve water more than surface furrow irrigation the most widespread method in africa similarly the crop specific value generated by irrigation water per unit area va in us ha is 6 va i y i p i c we calculate these values for all crops suitable to the command area table 2 and s7 command area boundaries were delineated as the median extent of irrigated cropland in 2015 using landsat 30 m pixels tatlhego and d odorico 2022 while the crop yield data gaez 2020 were at the coarser resolution of 10 km pixels yu et al 2020 the lack of spatially explicit data on actual crop distribution across africa impedes the estimate of the value generated by irrigation in crop production within the command areas therefore in these analyses we considered a few suitable scenarios table 3 specifically we assumed a that the entire command area is cultivated with all the crops that are suitable to that area with all crops having the same crop specific area a i b that farmers choose to cultivate the entire command area with the crops that generate the highest revenue per amount of water expenditure or c the crops that generate the highest revenue per cultivated area we also consider the scenario d in which the five most cultivated crops in the country base on faostat data for 2016 are planted in the command area provided that they are suitable to that area with all crops having the same area a i for each of these scenarios we then calculated the average value of water both in us m3 and us ha table 3 3 results this study determined the shadow price of water stored in relatively new african reservoirs which are mostly located in northern and southern africa as the value generated by irrigation water in the command area under a variety of crop scenarios table 2 table 3 such values are found to range from less than ten cents of us dollar per cubic meter for most staple crops to more than one dollar for cash crops such as dates or other fruits consistent with the results from other regions of the world d odorico et al 2020 similarly the revenues generated by irrigation per unit command area strongly vary across crop types ranging from few hundred dollars per hectare per year for most staple crops to more than ten thousand us ha y for dates in algeria table 3 and s7 these results show how the use of water and land for low value crops often leads to a suboptimal use of water resources and arable land though other factors including food security must come into play in the selection of the crops planted by farmers in the case of dates bananas or other plantations production is perennial i e the same plants remain productive for multiple years and these multi year investments can be at risk under severe drought as it happened in recent years to almond plantations in california conversely some annual crops e g cereals can be combined to have more than one harvest year known as multicropping this practice achieves higher land productivities thereby partly reducing the productivity gap existing with fruit plantations the average total volume of water used in the command area calculated as the average iwr table s3 for all crops times the command area table 1 is found to be consistently smaller than the reservoir capacity table 1 likely because 1 important evaporative losses from the reservoir are not accounted for 2 these reservoirs might have multi year management goals i e they are used to transfer water from wet to dry years instead of just from wet to dry seasons 3 some areas are used for multi cropping and 4 the command areas of these newly built dams are likely still undergoing expansion as new farms are established in the surrounding areas factors such as the time needed for reservoir fill up age of the dam reservoir siltation and implementation of irrigation projects may explain how irrigation projects develop and unfold over time 4 discussion and conclusions water is an essential and scarce resource that has no substitutes as such it is often treated as an economic commodity and is increasingly becoming the target of agribusiness investments through land acquisitions water markets and financialization of water resources baumann et al 1998 chong and sunding 2006 schmidt and mitchell 2014 proponents of the view of water as a private commodity argue that by creating property rights on water and allowing water to be traded for profit we can prevent that this precious resource is wasted and ensure that it is placed at its most valuable i e profitable use debaere and li 2020 savenije and zaag 2002 the commodification of water however has been challenged by those who view it as a common good a shared legacy or a human right johnson et al 2016 shiva 2002 mehta et al 2012 opel 2008 to date most water resources around the world are not treated as a private good that is exchanged in water markets because most countries do not recognize tradeable property rights on water richter 2016 rather water resources are acquired through rights on land with good access to water because of the presence of shallow aquifers adjacency to streams and other water bodies or the development of water infrastructures such as dams that allow for a more reliable predictable and regular supply of water for irrigation d odorico et al 2017 the construction of new dams allows for the emergence of new irrigated command areas in their vicinity and the consequent intensification of agriculture with higher yields and revenues through the construction of a dam and the management of the water stored in its reservoir a consortium of farmers can ensure a physical appropriation of water for irrigation in such conditions it is also possible to envision the emergence of trading of water entitlements among farmers or the acquisition of water from a hypothetical irrigation district managing the reservoir such exchanges require a good knowledge of the value generated by irrigation water through the increase in crop production in irrigated areas in other words it is important to understand how much irrigation water is worth to farmers this study estimated the value generated by irrigation water in the command areas and the associated increase in land value thus giving a better way to evaluate how important irrigation ventures are in developing countries evaluating these can be used as important tool by decision and policy makers on whether a particular country region should embark on these developments our analysis is based on an estimate of the shadow price of water through the evaluation of the increase in agricultural output and its value at the farm gate d odorico et al 2020 the rationale underlying this method of water valuation is that farmers bear similar costs to sustain rainfed and irrigated production same land and seeds and about the same labor and other inputs and the costs of management and operation of irrigation systems are expected to be negligible with respect to the revenues generated by irrigation d odorico et al 2020 if irrigation is carried out sustainably i e without depleting groundwater stocks or environmental flows rosa et al 2018 the environmental costs and future costs of irrigation can also be neglected and the added value of irrigation can be directly determined from the increase in production d odorico et al 2020 such an increase is what motivates land investors to secure rights on land parcels within the command area of irrigation dams making such areas a preferential target for land acquisitions tatlhego and d odorico 2022 as expected the results of this analysis show a strong dependency of the added value of irrigation on crop types table 2 which vary with the specific region in this study we focused on new dams that were built in the last 20 years in northern eastern and southern africa the value generated by water in the north african dams is much higher than in the other regions because of the production of dates reported in the case of algeria while in eastern and southern africa the crops associated with higher added values are potatoes and sugarcane which attain revenues per unit volume of irrigation water that are about ten times smaller table 3 of course farmers decision to plant staple or cash crops will depend on several factors that are not accounted for in this study including the different inputs required by various crops their cost and the associated risks economies of scale farmers investment capacity access to credit technology expertize and markets for the placement of their products it will also depend on the farming system conceived as the combination of means of production expertize land stewardship ways of life and rural livelihoods and on whether it focuses on self subsistence or profit generating agribusiness these and other factors may explain why farmers might choose to plant crops that generate lower revenues rather than profit maximizing crops per unit area table 3 c scenario or why they may attain relatively low water productivities per unit volume with respect to productivity maximizing crops table 3 b scenario interestingly these two scenarios tend to coincide in the sense that in most cases the crops that maximize water productivity i e revenue generated per unit volume in m3 are the same crops that maximize economic yields i e revenue generated per unit area in ha with only few exceptions table 3 in other words while farmers may in general decide to optimize either the economic productivity of land or of water depending on their relative scarcity in this case the two strategies are met by planting the same crops table 3 these analyses provide a first valuation of the ecosystem services provided by water used for irrigation and of the increased income that access to water would provide to farmers and agribusiness investors these results can also be utilized for simple economic analyses to determine to what extent the cost of the dam and associated infrastructure would be justified by the increase in crop production though the environmental and social impacts of dams would also need to be accounted for declaration

9623,recent years have seen continued investments in new irrigation dams across africa which have led to the emergence of new irrigated areas in their vicinity or command areas the ability to irrigate land that was previously only rainfed allows for an increase in crop production and is therefore associated with an increase in the value generated by agriculture what is the value produced by irrigation in the command areas of new major african dams here we use crop water modeling under a variety of crop distribution scenarios to determine the increase in agricultural value induced by irrigation in the command areas adjacent to the major irrigation dams we use these estimates to determine the shadow price of irrigation water in these regions along with the increase in land value and land s economic productivity we focus on dams built in africa between 2000 and 2015 which are clustered in northern east and southern africa this study provides a framework to determine the economic benefits of irrigation dams and evaluate the increase in agricultural revenues resulting from access to water for irrigation keywords irrigation water value command areas irrigation dams shadow price of water irrigated crops yield gap closure 1 introduction the pressure on water resources for agricultural use is increasing globally especially in water limited environments as a result of growing populations the increase in per capita food consumption and the consequent need for agricultural products d odorico et al 2018 falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 as the major contributor to human water consumption agriculture accounts for about 85 of societal water needs falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 as a scarce and essential resource water is a major factor constraining crop production and an important determinant for investments in agriculture which often aim at securing access to water resources for irrigation mehta et al 2012 water used by agriculture is too bulky to be transported over long distances and is typically used locally to sustain the production of crops that are then either consumed in the region or placed on national and global markets allan 1998 hoekstra and chapagain 2008 thus water appropriation by agribusiness corporations typically occurs through the acquisition of land rights e g land acquisitions long term leases or land concessions in areas with good access to adjacent streams underlying aquifers or other existing water bodies dell angelo et al 2018 müller et al 2021 rulli et al 2013 alternatively water appropriations may occur directly through the acquisition of water rights and water entitlements in areas where such rights exist and can be traded separately from land rights or through the construction of dams and the associated water storage in reservoirs for a variety of uses including irrigation duvail et al 2012 hanjra et al 2009 mehta et al 2012 reservoirs allow for the storage of water from wet seasons and its use in dry seasons providing a more reliable and predictable supply as well as opportunities for extending cultivation to drier months of the year the construction of dams and the storage of water in reservoirs however have strong environmental and social impacts such as the loss of environmental flows downstream from the dam the interruption of sediment flow and consequent fluvial and coastal erosion and the loss of access to water by downstream farmers pastoralist groups and other users e g carr 2017 palmer et al 2015 sun et al 2021 the zones irrigated with water from such reservoirs are often known as command areas rufin et al 2018 recent research has mapped the emergence or expansion of command areas in the proximity of major irrigation dams in africa typically downstream from them tatlhego and d odorico 2022 interestingly it has been found that the command areas of dams built in the african continent in the last two decades for agricultural use have been targeted by large scale land investors tatlhego and d odorico 2022 suggesting that large dams are often built more to the benefit of large scale commercial farming than smallholders or subsistence agriculture tatlhego and d odorico 2022 in this context it remains unclear to what extent crop production can be enhanced by access to water stored in the reservoir upstream from these new dams what is the value generated by irrigation in the new command areas answering this question would allow for an estimate of the shadow price of water acquired by agribusiness corporations and local farmers operating in the command area and provide an estimate of the increase in farmland value resulting from access to water young and loomis 2014 the value of water however is difficult to determine as it is often affected by subjective perceptions of what is scarce particularly because water is extremely variable in its geographical occurrences and availability hanemann 2006 pacetti et al 2020 understanding the value of water through an analysis of irrigation water requirements and associated changes in crop yields is needed to fully appreciate the benefits farmers get from having access to irrigation water in the command area and allows for the valuation of the economic benefits brought about by investments in dam and irrigation infrastructure kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 in water limited environments water can be easily considered a scarce valuable economic resource tewabe and dessie 2020 and the construction of dams is often invoked as an investment that would allow for a more reliable water supply grey and sadoff 2007 though recent studies on green infrastructure indicate more sustainable and equitable approaches to irrigation water management palmer et al 2015 ross and hasnain 2018 indeed the construction of the new african dams has been shown to have preferentially occurred to the benefit of large scale farming rather than small holders tatlhego and d odorico 2022 suggesting that agribusinesses are gaining control over precious water resources what type of economic gains can result from irrigated farming within these command areas in this study we attempt a quantitative assessment of the value generated by water and the increase in land value under suitable crop scenarios this study provides a quantitative framework to determine the economic benefits associated with the increase in agricultural revenues resulting from the development of surface reservoirs and other irrigation infrastructure 2 methods this study focuses on 18 dams table 1 built in africa for agriculture after 2000 according to the fao aquastat database fao 2016 irrigated or command areas table 1 were identified in a previous study using land use classification tatlhego and d odorico 2022 command area delineations were identified as those that showed irrigation in 2015 their polygon boundaries were used to extract maximum irrigated crop yields y i i expressed in hg ha from the global agro ecological zoning version 4 data base gaez 2020 for every crop i suitable to that area table s1 in the case of banana date melon and sesame we used 2016 yields from the fao faostat 2021 the gaez database provides crop yields that need to be adjusted to be consistent with the fao values the conversion factors q provided by gaez 2020 are reported in table s1 fao food prices at the farm gate were used to determine the value generated by water in agriculture as explained below http www fao org faostat en data pp using the watneeds crop water model chiarelli et al 2020 we determined green water i e rainwater consumption gwc i see table s2 and the irrigation water requirements iwr i which is the irrigation or blue water required by each suitable crop i to attain maximum yields during their growth season table s3 watneeds is a crop water model that uses data of net solar radiation wind speed air temperature and humidity as well as information on crop type and planting harvesting dates to calculate the actual and potential evapotranspiration using the penman montieth equation the model accounts for soil moisture and its impact on evapotranspiration rates through a soil water balance at the daily time scale chiarelli et al 2020 the maximum crop yields y i i provided by gaez 2020 are attained in irrigated conditions assuming a linear scaling of yields with water consumption i e evapotranspiration the corresponding rainfed yields y r i were determined as doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 y r i y i i 1 k y i 1 gwc i gwc i iwr i where k y i is a crop specific constant of proportionality expressing the linear dependence of yields on crop water use values of k y i can be defined as proportion of crop water use compared to the reference crop values of k y i were taken from smith and steduto 2012 and in those few cases in which they were not available they were assumed to be equal to 1 thus the increase in crop yield in t ha induced by irrigation is table s4 calculated as 2 y y i i y r i for each command area we used crop statistics data to compare rainfed and irrigated production and ascertain the change in production that could be attributed to irrigation using farm gate fao crop prices table s5 pi c for crop i in country c in t the value v i in us generated by the irrigation of that crop was calculated as d odorico et al 2020 3 v i y i p i c a i with eq 2 being the irrigation induced increase in the yield t ha of crop i cultivated within an area a i of the command area and the subscript c referring to the country in which the command area is located the amount v i m3 of water needed for the irrigation of crop i was then calculated as the product of its irrigation water requirement iwr i m3 ha 0 1 mm calculated with the watneed model by its area ai divided by the efficiency e i 4 v i iwr i e i a i where the efficiency e i of the irrigation system used for crop i is the ratio between the amounts of irrigation water evapotranspired consumed by the crop and the applied water sauer et al 2010 we accounted for the efficiency of irrigation because farmers typically must account for water withdrawals rather than water consumption for their allocations the value of water wv used for the irrigation of crop i in each command area is then determined as the ratio us m3 5 wv i v i v i e i y i p i c iwr i we used efficiency values table s6 equal to 0 60 and 0 64 0 25 and 0 30 for sprinkler surface irrigation in north africa and sub saharan africa respectively sauer et al 2010 and assumed that farmers adopt the irrigation techniques i e sprinkler vs surface that maximize yields in the gaez 2020 database irrigation efficiency is fraction of the water volume provided through irrigation that is actually used by the plant the remaining fraction i e 1 e contributes to soil drainage or surface runoff there is a dearth of data bases reporting information on irrigation systems across african countries irrigation is overall poorly developed in africa and the areas included in this study have started to be irrigated just in the last few years tatlhego and d odorico 2022 therefore our study needs to rely on suitable assumptions on the irrigation systems that are likely to be adopted in these newly cultivated and irrigated farmlands the sprinkler irrigation method attains higher efficiencies as compared to surface irrigation which basically floods the planted surfaces and using way more water than needed for crops whose yields were taken from faostat we assumed that farmers practice sprinkler irrigation because in most cases we are looking at newly established irrigated agriculture in areas undergoing major investments in irrigation infrastructure including the construction of dams or barrages since these dams are all located in arid or semiarid regions where crop production is limited by water availability it is reasonable to expect that farmers would use irrigation methods that conserve water more than surface furrow irrigation the most widespread method in africa similarly the crop specific value generated by irrigation water per unit area va in us ha is 6 va i y i p i c we calculate these values for all crops suitable to the command area table 2 and s7 command area boundaries were delineated as the median extent of irrigated cropland in 2015 using landsat 30 m pixels tatlhego and d odorico 2022 while the crop yield data gaez 2020 were at the coarser resolution of 10 km pixels yu et al 2020 the lack of spatially explicit data on actual crop distribution across africa impedes the estimate of the value generated by irrigation in crop production within the command areas therefore in these analyses we considered a few suitable scenarios table 3 specifically we assumed a that the entire command area is cultivated with all the crops that are suitable to that area with all crops having the same crop specific area a i b that farmers choose to cultivate the entire command area with the crops that generate the highest revenue per amount of water expenditure or c the crops that generate the highest revenue per cultivated area we also consider the scenario d in which the five most cultivated crops in the country base on faostat data for 2016 are planted in the command area provided that they are suitable to that area with all crops having the same area a i for each of these scenarios we then calculated the average value of water both in us m3 and us ha table 3 3 results this study determined the shadow price of water stored in relatively new african reservoirs which are mostly located in northern and southern africa as the value generated by irrigation water in the command area under a variety of crop scenarios table 2 table 3 such values are found to range from less than ten cents of us dollar per cubic meter for most staple crops to more than one dollar for cash crops such as dates or other fruits consistent with the results from other regions of the world d odorico et al 2020 similarly the revenues generated by irrigation per unit command area strongly vary across crop types ranging from few hundred dollars per hectare per year for most staple crops to more than ten thousand us ha y for dates in algeria table 3 and s7 these results show how the use of water and land for low value crops often leads to a suboptimal use of water resources and arable land though other factors including food security must come into play in the selection of the crops planted by farmers in the case of dates bananas or other plantations production is perennial i e the same plants remain productive for multiple years and these multi year investments can be at risk under severe drought as it happened in recent years to almond plantations in california conversely some annual crops e g cereals can be combined to have more than one harvest year known as multicropping this practice achieves higher land productivities thereby partly reducing the productivity gap existing with fruit plantations the average total volume of water used in the command area calculated as the average iwr table s3 for all crops times the command area table 1 is found to be consistently smaller than the reservoir capacity table 1 likely because 1 important evaporative losses from the reservoir are not accounted for 2 these reservoirs might have multi year management goals i e they are used to transfer water from wet to dry years instead of just from wet to dry seasons 3 some areas are used for multi cropping and 4 the command areas of these newly built dams are likely still undergoing expansion as new farms are established in the surrounding areas factors such as the time needed for reservoir fill up age of the dam reservoir siltation and implementation of irrigation projects may explain how irrigation projects develop and unfold over time 4 discussion and conclusions water is an essential and scarce resource that has no substitutes as such it is often treated as an economic commodity and is increasingly becoming the target of agribusiness investments through land acquisitions water markets and financialization of water resources baumann et al 1998 chong and sunding 2006 schmidt and mitchell 2014 proponents of the view of water as a private commodity argue that by creating property rights on water and allowing water to be traded for profit we can prevent that this precious resource is wasted and ensure that it is placed at its most valuable i e profitable use debaere and li 2020 savenije and zaag 2002 the commodification of water however has been challenged by those who view it as a common good a shared legacy or a human right johnson et al 2016 shiva 2002 mehta et al 2012 opel 2008 to date most water resources around the world are not treated as a private good that is exchanged in water markets because most countries do not recognize tradeable property rights on water richter 2016 rather water resources are acquired through rights on land with good access to water because of the presence of shallow aquifers adjacency to streams and other water bodies or the development of water infrastructures such as dams that allow for a more reliable predictable and regular supply of water for irrigation d odorico et al 2017 the construction of new dams allows for the emergence of new irrigated command areas in their vicinity and the consequent intensification of agriculture with higher yields and revenues through the construction of a dam and the management of the water stored in its reservoir a consortium of farmers can ensure a physical appropriation of water for irrigation in such conditions it is also possible to envision the emergence of trading of water entitlements among farmers or the acquisition of water from a hypothetical irrigation district managing the reservoir such exchanges require a good knowledge of the value generated by irrigation water through the increase in crop production in irrigated areas in other words it is important to understand how much irrigation water is worth to farmers this study estimated the value generated by irrigation water in the command areas and the associated increase in land value thus giving a better way to evaluate how important irrigation ventures are in developing countries evaluating these can be used as important tool by decision and policy makers on whether a particular country region should embark on these developments our analysis is based on an estimate of the shadow price of water through the evaluation of the increase in agricultural output and its value at the farm gate d odorico et al 2020 the rationale underlying this method of water valuation is that farmers bear similar costs to sustain rainfed and irrigated production same land and seeds and about the same labor and other inputs and the costs of management and operation of irrigation systems are expected to be negligible with respect to the revenues generated by irrigation d odorico et al 2020 if irrigation is carried out sustainably i e without depleting groundwater stocks or environmental flows rosa et al 2018 the environmental costs and future costs of irrigation can also be neglected and the added value of irrigation can be directly determined from the increase in production d odorico et al 2020 such an increase is what motivates land investors to secure rights on land parcels within the command area of irrigation dams making such areas a preferential target for land acquisitions tatlhego and d odorico 2022 as expected the results of this analysis show a strong dependency of the added value of irrigation on crop types table 2 which vary with the specific region in this study we focused on new dams that were built in the last 20 years in northern eastern and southern africa the value generated by water in the north african dams is much higher than in the other regions because of the production of dates reported in the case of algeria while in eastern and southern africa the crops associated with higher added values are potatoes and sugarcane which attain revenues per unit volume

pakistan have a total irrigated area of land of 18 84 million hectares with 7 79 million hectares irrigated through canals qureshi 2011 and the remaining agricultural land irrigated through groundwater with tube wells and canals accounting for the majority of the 7 7 million hectares anjum et al 2014 pakistan has a moderately arid environment as well as a serious shortage of freshwater water availability is decreasing as a result of climate change and population growth around the world posing a threat to the sustainability of agriculture mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 farmers discovered wastewater as a source of water supply and this technique is growing quickly in essentially all communities across the country shahid et al 2020 therefore wastewater had become a feasible way to decrease water scarcity the application of municipal wastewater to agriculture has become common place riaz et al 2020 however this may have an indirect impact on the microbiological characteristics of the soil becerra castro et al 2015 pakistan s canal system is the country s primary source of irrigation and it is the world s largest canal irrigation system mekonnen et al 2016 waters from rivers including indus are stored and diverted for hydropower as well as irrigation purpose canals and distributaries originating from different barrages and heads works distribute irrigation water in vast plains of the punjab and sindh provinces despite the availability of such vital resources while assessing social economic and environmental benefits the outcomes indicate that pakistan although well endowed with fresh water is actually not water secure yet only 16 countries in the world have more water than pakistan but because pakistan is the world s sixth most populous country water availability per person is comparatively low so there exits scarcity of water in the country world bank 2019 less availability of fresh water in future infers in serious troubles seckler et al 1998 the cropland area is growing every day and the canal water supply is unable to meet these rising demands as a result water becomes a limiting element in agriculture s effective maintenance iqbal and iqbal 2015 use and application of untreated waste water for irrigation purposes are replacing the fresh water providing benefits for crops cultivation and preventing fresh water bodies from pollution who fao 2007 usepa 1992 however leafy vegetables irrigated with untreated contaminated waters were usually abounded in high concentrations of heavy and hazardous metals in pakistan khan et al 2014 these contaminated vegetables may be a big hidden threat to human and animal health since the untreated contaminated waters include many city effluents heavy metals have non biodegradable nature and cause pollution in environment zhuang et al 2009 khan et al 2016a khan et al 2016b khan et al 2018 leafy vegetables like spinach spinacia oleracea l family amaranthaceae and cabbage brassica oleracea family brassicaceae showed sound growth when irrigated with untreated sewage water murtaza et al 2003 the leafy vegetable contains lot of iron in it and there is a physiological system that causes reduction in iron uptake through roots of plants hussain and qureshi 2020 murtaza et al 2003 additionally these metals are abundant in wastewater as well as soil and they are posing threat to human health khan et al 2014 these metals move from soil to plants through root system resultantly food stuff grown on contaminated soil contains such metals and pose risk to health of those who consume these contaminated products plants absorb such metals from soil khan et al 2016b khan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2018 khan et al 2019 by using their internal mechanism and then shift them to edible parts a good indicator of anthropogenic contamination is the presence or enrichment of high levels of accumulated heavy metals at the base of water table in agricultural practices the evaluation of soil enrichment of trace metals can be done by applying pollution load index pli which gives the quantity of times by which the metals in the soil surpass the critical level and gives a summative sign of the general level of metal harmfulness in a specific sample priju and narayana 2006 the amount of daily metal consumption from edible plants to the external standard amount is the health risk index kafeel et al 2016 the ability of heavy metals to migrate from the soil to the eating section of crops is known as the bio concentration factor bcf ef is used to calculate soil pollution enrichment factor and metal poisoning in people is caused by trace metals pollution load bakshi et al 2018 the bio concentration factor is used to examine heavy metal concentrations in various parts of plants and the soil zhang et al 2018 several studies have shown that heavy metals in plants may provide a health risk to humans to measure the level of the health risk posed by heavy metals various health indices such as daily intake of metals dim transfer factor tf and health risk index hri or health quotient hq are utilised qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2021 meanwhile the consumption of leafy

values of cd and ni and low for cu zn pb and fe than given by bigdeli and seilsepour 2008 agricultural productivity has been decreased that led to major problem of food insecurity in developing countries attempts to address this problem have led to the development and use of different agricultural management practices such as proper use of non conventional water organic farming use of microorganisms to increase productivity increase farmers incomes and improve their livelihoods khan et al 2022 hussain et al 2021 haider et al 2021 these productivity technologies have largely overlooked their unexplained relationship and interdependence with interrelated factors such as climate water and energy as part of the integration of the food production system raw sewage is an important source of organic and inorganic nutrients which are required for growth of plants sewage water is an alternate source of water for irrigation of vegetables and fodder crops growing around sewage treatment sites these food items are used by animals and humans sewage farming is common in all urban areas of pakistan sewage water of some cities also contains toxic effluents especially in those areas located near industrial sites the sewage water has a high amount of fertilizer nutrients it provides available n p fe k zn mn and cu to soil this indicates that why it is importance for irrigation of crops in agriculture worldwide it is used as a cheap source of fertilizer for agriculture purpose khan et al 2022 hussain et al 2021 haider et al 2021 it is also used as an fertilizer then there is no need to buy chemical fertilizers heavy metals gain entry into plants by food chain shahid et al 2015 and become accumulated into their bodies and parts of plants e g fatty tissues and then create serious problems because they have their long lives and non biodegradable nature shahid et al 2015 heavy metal are soluble in water and causes risk to animals and human health even at low concentration uzu et al 2011 like problems related to nervous and kidney bone damage cardiovascular problems and mental impairment yargholi et al 2008 according to reports long term use of foods highly contaminated with heavy metal cause diseases like cancer liver kidney nervous disorders cardiovascular problems järup 2003 bcf indicates metal entry from soil to plants if values of bcf are over 1 0 then it is an indication that metal retention in soil was low and roots take it up at once otherwise if the measured values of bcf are under 1 0 the metal levels in soil were as it has strong binding with soil bcf for zn cu and f was low in this study than those reported earlier ashfaq et al 2015 the reason appears the dependence of bcf on specific vegetable cui et al 2004 the estimated pli values were more than 1 0 that represented contamination whereas if it would less than 1 00 depicts area was unpolluted harikumar et al 2009 ahmad et al 2014 the instant study exhibited that metals gave the pli lower than 1 0 which means land is not much polluted maiz et al 2000 usman and ayodele 2002 uwah et al 2009 as in sargodha there are not so many industries so far hence pli in this study work is resulted low and safe all metals including fe cr cd ni cu pb and zn showed lower values of pli in current research work than reported by ahmad et al 2014 and similar pli results by liang et al 2004 showed in case of pb cd and cr which were measuring 0 107 2 069 and 0 113 respectively additionally pb cd and cr had higher dim and zn showed equal and lower for cu and ni as compared to values reported by mahmood and malik 2013 in the instant work dim of ni zn cu and cr were within the limits while pb and cd were high usepa 1992 which is a threat of hazardous for human health khan et al 2008 gave the dim values for zn cu pb cd cr and ni indicated as 0 032 0 008 0 002 0 0003 0 005 0 005 respectively in s oleracea while cd zn and pb showed higher concentrations than the current ones on the other hand ni indicated equal while cr and cu were on higher levels than those of this study the values of hq in our study showed lower values of cu fe ni cd and pb while higher for zn and cr than the values reported in different other studies khan et al 2016a singh et al 2010b hq values were less than 1 0 for cu ni zn and fe which are not risky for health but higher for cd pb cr and pb which are apparently risky singh et al 2010a also reported values of hq which were higher for ni cd and pb and were lower for cr zn and cu the values of the metals in this study in case of cu fe zn and ni were within permissible limits but in case of cr cd and pb were crossing over the safe limits the ec were on higher side for pb cd cr zn and ni while on lower side for cu singh et al 2010a singh et al 2010b ec depends upon certain factor like availability of metals in environment plant s ability to take them up and their growth phenomenon in spinach plants the uptake of metals was found high because of its leaves which transpire at high rate and also have the ability to retain moisture within them 5 conclusion apart from essential nutrient element green leafy vegetables can also accumulate a significant amount of toxic trace and hazardous elements in different plant organs especially in the leaves tissues therefore spinach is a horticulture green vegetable that requires appropriate precautions to avoid the potential risks arising from its consumption following irrigation with contaminated water the long term use of polluted water canal water and city effluents in fields of leafy vegetables like spinach leads to a remarkable increase with accumulation of heavy metals contents of cd cr ni zn fe pb and cu grown in such polluted irrigated soils generally and leafy vegetables particularly the result of this study shows more risk to urban population which is consuming these contaminated vegetables regularly sargodha is an agricultural district with significant potential of export of agricultural commodities but at the same time it is under the influence of industrialization therefore advanced technologies should be adopted that can monitor the hazards elements and toxic metals levels in horticulture products and spinach meanwhile strict checking and monitoring of sites where such vegetables are grown along with testing of such soils and waters to avoid any severe health risk credit authorship contribution statement the study was designed and supervised by fc zik and ka jm mih sn and sa performed the experiments ij and ae collected the data

additionally thms can enter human bodies through the food chain leading to an increased incidence of chronic diseases such as deformity and cancer leafy vegetables irrigated with untreated as well as contaminated waters were usually abounded with heavy metals in high concentrations these contaminated leafy green vegetables although very popular here may cause threats to human health since these

pakistan have a total irrigated area of land of 18 84 million hectares with 7 79 million hectares irrigated through canals qureshi 2011 and the remaining agricultural land irrigated through groundwater with tube wells and canals accounting for the majority of the 7 7 million hectares anjum et al 2014 pakistan has a moderately arid environment as well as a serious shortage of freshwater water availability is decreasing as a result of climate change and population growth around the world posing a threat to the sustainability of agriculture mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 farmers discovered wastewater as a source of water supply and this technique is growing quickly in essentially all communities across the country shahid et al 2020 therefore wastewater had become a feasible way to decrease water scarcity the application of municipal wastewater to agriculture has become common place riaz et al 2020 however this may have an indirect impact on the microbiological characteristics of the soil becerra castro et al 2015 pakistan s canal system is the country s primary source of irrigation and it is the world s largest canal irrigation system mekonnen et al 2016 waters from rivers including indus are stored and diverted for hydropower as well as irrigation purpose canals and distributaries originating from different barrages and heads works distribute irrigation water in vast plains of the punjab and sindh provinces despite the availability of such vital resources while assessing social economic and environmental benefits the outcomes indicate that pakistan although well endowed with fresh water is actually not water secure yet only 16 countries in the world have more water than pakistan but because pakistan is the world s sixth most populous country water availability per person is comparatively low so there exits scarcity of water in the country world bank 2019 less availability of fresh water in future infers in serious troubles seckler et al 1998 the cropland area is growing every day and the canal water supply is unable to meet these rising demands as a result water becomes a limiting element in agriculture s effective maintenance iqbal and iqbal 2015 use and application of untreated waste water for irrigation purposes are replacing the fresh water providing benefits for crops cultivation and preventing fresh water bodies from pollution who fao 2007 usepa 1992 however leafy vegetables irrigated with untreated contaminated waters were usually abounded in high concentrations of heavy and hazardous metals in pakistan khan et al 2014 these contaminated vegetables may be a big hidden threat to human and animal health since the untreated contaminated waters include many city effluents heavy metals have non biodegradable nature and cause pollution in environment zhuang et al 2009 khan et al 2016a khan et al 2016b khan et al 2018 leafy vegetables like spinach spinacia oleracea l family amaranthaceae and cabbage brassica oleracea family brassicaceae showed sound growth when irrigated with untreated sewage water murtaza et al 2003 the leafy vegetable contains lot of iron in it and there is a physiological system that causes reduction in iron uptake through roots of plants hussain and qureshi 2020 murtaza et al 2003 additionally these metals are abundant in wastewater as well as soil and they are posing threat to human health khan et al 2014 these metals move from soil to plants through root system resultantly food stuff grown on contaminated soil contains such metals and pose risk to health of those who consume these contaminated products plants absorb such metals from soil khan et al 2016b khan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2018 khan et al 2019 by using their internal mechanism and then shift them to edible parts a good indicator of anthropogenic contamination is the presence or enrichment of high levels of accumulated heavy metals at the base of water table in agricultural practices the evaluation of soil enrichment of trace metals can be done by applying pollution load index pli which gives the quantity of times by which the metals in the soil surpass the critical level and gives a summative sign of the general level of metal harmfulness in a specific sample priju and narayana 2006 the amount of daily metal consumption from edible plants to the external standard amount is the health risk index kafeel et al 2016 the ability of heavy metals to migrate from the soil to the eating section of crops is known as the bio concentration factor bcf ef is used to calculate soil pollution enrichment factor and metal poisoning in people is caused by trace metals pollution load bakshi et al 2018 the bio concentration factor is used to examine heavy metal concentrations in various parts of plants and the soil zhang et al 2018 several studies have shown that heavy metals in plants may provide a health risk to humans to measure the level of the health risk posed by heavy metals various health indices such as daily intake of metals dim transfer factor tf and health risk index hri or health quotient hq are utilised qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2021 meanwhile the consumption of leafy green vegetables although very popular here may cause threats to human health since these are usually grown in sub urban areas by irrigations of the untreated contaminated waters canal water groundwater and waste water carrying many city effluents and these green vegetables might have high levels of different trace elements assessment and biomonitoring of heavy metals pollution and possible risk to human health via food chain contamination and it is of vital importance to restrict the entry of hazards material entry into the terrestrial environment realizing the importance of canal water sewage water and groundwater as an important non conventional water resource for crop irrigation in pakistan a comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the uptake of heavy metals uptake and their pollution load in kitchen vegetable spinach spinacia oleracea l and to measure the levels of hazardous metals zn cr ni cd cu fe and pb at 3 different ecological sites from district sargodha punjab pakistan the outcome of this study is expected to provide necessary feedback to policy makers for the reuse of canal water sewage water and groundwater as an important non conventional water resource for crop irrigation in pakistan as well as in the south asia region 2 materials and methods this study was done in district sargodha punjab pakistan the experiment site i jhal chakiyaan

values of cd and ni and low for cu zn pb and fe than given by bigdeli and seilsepour 2008 agricultural productivity has been decreased that led to major problem of food insecurity in developing countries attempts to address this problem have led to the development and use of different agricultural management practices such as proper use of non conventional water organic farming use of microorganisms to increase productivity increase farmers incomes and improve their livelihoods khan et al 2022 hussain et al 2021 haider et al 2021 these productivity technologies have largely overlooked their unexplained relationship and interdependence with interrelated factors such as climate water and energy as part of the integration of the food production system raw sewage is an important source of organic and inorganic nutrients which are required for growth of plants sewage water is an alternate source of water for irrigation of vegetables and fodder crops growing around sewage treatment sites these food items are used by animals and humans sewage farming is common in all urban areas of pakistan sewage water of some cities also contains toxic effluents especially in those areas located near industrial sites the sewage water has a high amount of fertilizer nutrients it provides available n p fe k zn mn and cu to soil this indicates that why it is importance for irrigation of crops in agriculture worldwide it is used as a cheap source of fertilizer for agriculture purpose khan et al 2022 hussain et al 2021 haider et al 2021 it is also used as an fertilizer then there is no need to buy chemical fertilizers heavy metals gain entry into plants by food chain shahid et al 2015 and become accumulated into their bodies and parts of plants e g fatty tissues and then create serious problems because they have their long lives and non biodegradable nature shahid et al 2015 heavy metal are soluble in water and causes risk to animals and human health even at low concentration uzu et al 2011 like problems related to nervous and kidney bone damage cardiovascular problems and mental impairment yargholi et al 2008 according to reports long term use of foods highly contaminated with heavy metal cause diseases like cancer liver kidney nervous disorders cardiovascular problems järup 2003 bcf indicates metal entry from soil to plants if values of bcf are over 1 0 then it is an indication that metal retention in soil was low and roots take it up at once otherwise if the measured values of bcf are under 1 0 the metal levels in soil were as it has strong binding with soil bcf for zn cu and f was low in this study than those reported earlier ashfaq et al 2015 the reason appears the dependence of bcf on specific vegetable cui et al 2004 the estimated pli values were more than 1 0 that represented contamination whereas if it would less than 1 00 depicts area was unpolluted harikumar et al 2009 ahmad et al 2014 the instant study exhibited that metals gave the pli lower than 1 0 which means land is not much polluted maiz et al 2000 usman and ayodele 2002 uwah et al 2009 as in sargodha there are not so many industries so far hence pli in this study work is resulted low and safe all metals including fe cr cd ni cu pb and zn showed lower values of pli in current research work than reported by ahmad et al 2014 and similar pli results by liang et al 2004 showed in case of pb cd and cr which were measuring 0 107 2 069 and 0 113 respectively additionally pb cd and cr had higher dim and zn showed equal and lower for cu and ni as compared to values reported by mahmood and malik 2013 in the instant work dim of ni zn cu and cr were within the limits while pb and cd were high usepa 1992 which is a threat of hazardous for human health khan et al 2008 gave the dim values for zn cu pb cd cr and ni indicated as 0 032 0 008 0 002 0 0003 0 005 0 005 respectively in s oleracea while cd zn and pb showed higher concentrations than the current ones on the other hand ni indicated equal while cr and cu were on higher levels than those of this study the values of hq in our study showed lower values of cu fe ni cd and pb while higher for zn and cr than the values reported in different other studies khan et al 2016a singh et al 2010b hq values were less than 1 0 for cu ni zn and fe which are not risky for health but higher for cd pb cr and pb which are apparently risky singh et al 2010a also reported values of hq which were higher for ni cd and pb and were lower for cr zn and cu the values of the metals in this study in case of cu fe zn and ni were within permissible limits but in case of cr cd and pb were crossing over the safe limits the ec were on higher side for pb cd cr zn and ni while on lower side for cu singh et al 2010a singh et al 2010b ec depends upon certain factor like availability of metals in environment plant s ability to take them up and their growth phenomenon in spinach plants the uptake of metals was found high because of its leaves which transpire at high rate and also have the ability to retain moisture within them 5 conclusion apart from essential nutrient element green leafy vegetables can also accumulate a significant amount of toxic trace and hazardous elements in different plant organs especially in the leaves tissues therefore spinach is a horticulture green vegetable that requires appropriate precautions to avoid the potential risks arising from its consumption following irrigation with contaminated water the long term use of polluted water canal water and city effluents in fields of leafy vegetables like spinach leads to a remarkable increase with accumulation of heavy metals contents of cd cr ni zn fe pb and cu grown in such polluted irrigated soils generally and leafy vegetables particularly the result of this study shows more risk to urban population which is consuming these contaminated vegetables regularly sargodha is an agricultural district with significant potential of export of agricultural commodities but at the same time it is under the influence of industrialization therefore advanced technologies should be adopted that can monitor the hazards elements and toxic metals levels in horticulture products and spinach meanwhile strict checking and monitoring of sites where such vegetables are grown along with testing of such soils and waters to avoid any severe health risk credit authorship contribution statement the study was designed and supervised by fc zik and ka jm mih sn and sa performed the experiments ij and ae collected the data
