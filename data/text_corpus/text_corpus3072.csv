treatment of marine oily wastewater including degradation performance acute toxicity evaluation and oil flocs analysis in a benchtop circulating flow photoozonation reactor degradation performances have been studied by measuring the degradation rate of total oil concentrations specific oil components n alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and total organic carbon toc the results show that uv o3 ps could significantly enhance the removal efficiency than the other two processes with above 90 of removal efficiency in 30 min acute toxicity analysis further shows that the wastewater quality is significantly improved by four fold of the ec50 of vibrio fischeri and the mortality of artemia franciscana decreases from 100 to 0 after 48 h exposure further the morphology and functional groups of flocs have been further characterized showing that the floating flocs could be further degraded especially in uv o3 ps process our study further raised discussions regarding the future on site application of o3 based systems based on the results generated from the treatment efficiency toxicity and flocs characterization the regulation of the oxidation strength and optimization of the reaction systems could be a practical strategy for on site marine oily wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes

contaminated water from offshore petroleum and marine shipping operations e g bilge water ballast water and offshore produced water accidental oil spill response e g decanted water and other wastewater streams containing oil from the harbor and coastal activities isaacson 1979 jing et al 2015 the discharge and exposure of marine oily wastewater could result in disastrous impacts on marine ecosystems jing et al 2015 2018a li et al 2016 song et al 2021 a variety of physical chemical and biological treatment methods have been developed and geared toward the recovery removal of oil impurities from water cao et al 2022 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 among all the existing treatment methods ozonation and its integration with other oxidation techniques have been among the most effective advanced oxidation processes aops to eliminate the recalcitrant contaminants unselectively in various water matrices dong et al 2022 jing et al 2018b wen et al 2022 ozonation or ultraviolet uv processes have been used to eliminate recalcitrant contaminants due to their ability to efficiently degrade recalcitrant organics in a reliable manner via direct reaction with ozone molecules or the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh that with strong oxidizing capabilities coha et al 2021 liu et al 2021a the efficiency of ozone in degrading organics is improved when combined with uv 254 nm radiation gassie and englehardt 2019 as one of the powerful aops the uv o3 process has been proven to have a huge ability to treat oily wastewater such as n alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs lin et al 2014 sulfate radical so4 as a strong one electron oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v has an extremely high reactivity toward a variety of organic substances which is comparable with that of oh it is reported that both o3 and uv can activate persulfate ps to form so4 and oh simultaneously dong et al 2021 zou et al 2021 qin et al 2020 have indicated that the pseudo first order rate constants of atrazine degradation in the uv o3 ps process increase by 3 3 times compared to that in the uv o3 process while these findings suggest that so4 could decrease energy consumption and enhance the degradation efficiency such a hypothesis has not been validated for treating oily marine wastewater oily wastewater can cause ecological disturbances including alteration of the aquatic community structure and food chains through physical and chemical means lee et al 2015 toxic components of oily wastewater specifically benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex and alkylated non alkylated pahs have been observed to exhibit potential toxicity to both marine organisms and human health baird et al 2007 kponee et al 2015 on the other hand oxidation byproducts or excessive oxidants may also increase the toxicity level during the treatment process which calls for the needs for better understanding of the mechanisms and control of the treatment process to ensure the quality toxicity of effluent in compliance with standards liu et al 2021a wang et al 2013 therefore toxicity assessment of marine oily wastewater treated by ozone based processes with respect to aquatic organisms becomes important microtox test for monitoring the acute toxicity of oily wastewater and the treatment efficacy has been widely adopted in research and practice as a rapid sensitive and cost effective method and recommended by many regulators lee et al 2003 this bioassay is based on the measurement of changes in light emission by a nonpathogenic bioluminescent marine bacterium vibrio fischeri upon exposure to the test samples brine shrimp artemia franciscana one of the best studied species of crustaceans plays a key role in the marine food chain and is a suitable organism for bioassay and toxicity studies khoshnood et al 2017 these two species were selected to evaluate and compare the toxicity of the raw and treated water in this study it is worth noting that the treatment of oily wastewater by ozonation can produce some flocs that can be suspended in water stick to reactor walls or float on the water surface khalifa et al 2021 sun et al 2020 in detail flocs generation may suppress the o3 bubble interactions with oil and reduce the transmission of the uv light during the uv induced oxidation process limiting the production of free radicals for wastewater treatment flocs can also cause clogging and make system cleaning difficult to our best knowledge although the generation of flocs during o3 based processes is a common and important phenomenon few studies have been reported on their properties e g components and surface characteristics and fate de araujo et al 2020 to fill this gap and provide practical strategies for the on site o3 based treatment of oily wastewater it is necessary to explore the physical and chemical properties of flocs and their fate during different approaches in this study a lab scale o3 reactor was developed to explore the degradation of marine oily wastewater from synthetic seawater two oils and three types of ozonation processes were compared and some key parameters like initial oil concentration o3 dosage ps dosage salinity ph level and temperature were studied to determine the optimal conditions the degradation kinetics of n alkanes pahs and toc were investigated to reveal the degradation performance of three processes bioassays with luminous bacterium and brine shrimp were performed to evaluate the reduction in toxicity of the treated water microscopic and spectroscopic techniques were employed to investigate the characteristic of flocs generated in three o3 based processes 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals and materials sodium persulfate ps dichloromethane dcm pah mix 3 c8 c40 alkanes calibration standard internal standards is and sea salts were purchased from sigma aldrich ontario canada two commonly used light and heavy crude oils produced in canada were compared thoroughly the physicochemical properties of both light and heavy crude oils including gravity density viscosity sulphur content and sara saturates aromatics resin and asphaltene fractions were obtained from environment canada and displayed in table 1 it can be seen that the sara fractions of light crude oil and heavy crude oil are significantly different heavy crude oil is low in saturates and aromatics but very high in resins and asphaltenes 2 2 experimental design different aop experiments were carried out in a lab scale reactor with a continuous supply of ozone at atmospheric temperature as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 1 the ozone reactor comprises a glass column in which 1 l of synthetic seawater with dissolved crude oil was introduced a uv 254 nm uvp 90 0012 01 model source krackeler scientific was inserted from the upper part as light source an ozone diffuser micropore size 500 µm was set at the bottom of the reactor ozone was produced in the lab using an ozone generator ozonelabtm ol80a model a flow meter reg 5404 r flows 0 4 l min was used to provide a constant oxygen flow of 0 25 l min into the ozone generator to better adjust the experimental conditions and operational parameters and explore the reaction mechanisms we chose to use synthetic water in this study synthetic seawater was prepared by dissolving 35 g sea salt in 1 l distilled water with a magnetic stirrer marine oily wastewater was prepared by adding 1 ml crude oil in 1 l synthetic seawater oil to water ratio 1 1000 followed by homogenization fisherbrand 850 homogenizer for 5 min in 15 000 rpm at room temperature 22 25 c each experiment was conducted at least three times since the dilution of crude oils in the seawater was not completely homogenous throughout the study 2 3 extraction and analysis methods 2 3 1 extraction procedure the water samples were first pre treated by a vortex shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction vsallme method modified from that reported by zheng et al 2015 for pahs detection ten milliliters of the treated solution were collected in a 15 ml glass screw top tube and 1 ml of dcm was added the tube was well sealed and vortexed for 1 min then stood for 10 min to allow the separation of the organic and aqueous phases a hundred microliters of the organic phase were transferred to a 150 μl micro vial ten microliters of is 10 μg ml were added before instrumental analysis for the detection of n alkanes the procedure was same as above except that the organic phase dcm was replaced with hexane 2 3 2 determination of total crude oil concentration the uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher genesys 10s was applied to estimate the total oil concentration all the components were dissolved in dcm in the same proportions and then the absorbance measurements were recorded at wavelengths of 340 370 and 400 nm cao et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the detailed equations and calibration curves of total oil compounds for light and heavy crude oils can be obtained in text s1 and fig s1 the total organic carbon toc concentrations were measured by the burning oxidation non dispersive infrared absorption method using a shimadzu toc l analyzer shimadzu tokyo japan a few drops of phosphoric acid were added before measuring toc to maintain the sample ph 1 additional fluorometric analysis horiba aqualog was performed during the toxicity studies to estimate the concentration of crude oils in water 2 3 3 determination of n alkanes and pahs using gc ms both the normal alkanes n alkanes and pahs analysis were performed using an agilent 7890a 5975c gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms equipped with an agilent 7693 autosampler two microliters of analytes were injected into gc and separated by a 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm db 5ms ui fused silica capillary column for n alkanes analysis the oven was programed to hold the initial temperature at 40 c for 8 min then ramp from 7 c min to 295 c for 10 min the injection mode was split at 300 c with a split ratio of 10 1 for pahs analysis the oven program was set as the initial temperature at 65 c for 1 min then ramped 65 300 c at 4 c min and held at 300 c for 1 min the injection mode was splitless at 300 c the pah analyses were performed in the selected ion monitoring sim mode with an electron energy of 70 ev the ion source was set at 300 c the methods detection limit was 0 3 1 ng l the variance of the analytical method was 5 based on duplicate measurements 2 4 toxicity evaluation of treated water 2 4 1 vibrio fischeri acute toxicity evaluation acute toxicity tests of the solution before and after 1 h o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes treatment were carried out using a microtox model 500 analyzer whose primary indicator was the luminous bacterium vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity test relied on bacterial luminescence via cellular respiration inhibition of cellular activity caused by exposure to toxicants acidic or alkaline conditions etc decreased the respiratory rate leading to a corresponding decrease in luminosity the ec50 referred to the percentage of water samples that cause a 50 decrease of luminous intensity the ph range of 6 0 8 5 was recommended as standard since vibrio fischeri is ph sensitive fang et al 2019 fifteen minutes of nitrogen aeration was conducted to remove the residual ozone before the tests 2 4 2 artemia acute toxicity evaluation the artemia toxicity tests were conducted at huntsman marine science centre st andrews nb canada a franciscana cysts were sourced from aquamerik inc levis qc canada decapsulated cysts were hatched 24 h prior to exposure in an aerated flask at 25 3 c hatched a franciscana nauplii at the ii and iii instar stages were used for all exposures and 20 individuals were imaged to confirm the developmental stage exposures were performed at room temperature 25 2 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod with led light the acute toxicity of artemia was evaluated based on the mortality rate at 48 h exposure to the marine oily wastewater before and after 1 h o3 based aops all solutions were tested in triplicate with 10 organisms per vial 4 ml glass gc vial after 48 h exposure to the samples organisms that were no longer able to swim within 15 s after gentle agitation with flowing water from a pipette were considered dead water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do ph salinity psu and temperature c were measured in the test solutions at the beginning and end 48 h of the exposure a test was considered valid if the control survival was greater than 80 dissolved oxygen remained over 60 saturation and the test solution temperature remained within 1 5 c for the duration of the trial tests were performed and data collected consistent with good laboratory practice standards to better understand what the organisms were exposed to fluorometric readings horiba aqualog excitation emission range 220 600 nm were collected to detect the relative differences in key components in crude oils before and after the o3 based aops all contour maps were generated using origin 2021 software 2 5 characterization and analysis of floating flocs the flocs formed in three o3 based aops i e o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps after 1 h were collected on a glass slide and dried in a vacuum oven fisherbrand isotemp model 281a fisher scientific set at 50 c 10 h for further analysis oil flocs were observed under a leica dm2500 m optical microscope leica microsystems buffalo grove il usa the surface morphology of crude oil flocs before and after treatment was measured by the scanning electron microscope sem quanta 400 mla equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the surface functional groups of floating flocs were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance atr ftir the spectra were taken in the range of 4000 650 cm 1 2 6 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate for quality control error bar and error area represented each standard deviation from the means of independent experiment the significant differences were determined by one way analysis of variance anova with f tests using minitab 18 software the p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant and p 0 001 as statistically highly significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation performance of three ozone based processes 3 1 1 ps addition enhanced the overall degradation of crude oils changes in total oil concentration over time were examined to compare the treatment performance of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes for both light and heavy crude oils fig 2 under the same oil to water ratio 1 1000 the initial concentration of light crude oil measured by the spectrophotometer was about 380 430 ppm and that of heavy crude oil was about 190 230 ppm it was found that in the first 5 min three oxidation processes showed no significant difference on the light crude oil degradation fig s2 after 10 min of reaction the uv o3 ps process showed significant degradation performance in comparison with o3 process after that these three processes started to show significant differences on light crude oil degradation after 30 min treatment the concentrations of light crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 156 63 90 03 and 28 76 ppm respectively correspondingly the removal efficiencies of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 61 22 76 57 and 92 49 respectively fig 2a the results indicated that the addition of ps showed little effect on the first 5 min but the degradation efficiency is gradually increased afterward this could be due to the activation of ps and generation of more so4 after 5 min fig 2a lee et al 2020 the crude oil degradation could be fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model and the kinetic parameters were collected in table s1 the rate constant of the uv o3 ps process was 0 092 min 1 which was significantly higher than both o3 0 032 min 1 and uv o3 0 050 min 1 processes showing that the addition of persulfate could substantially improve the oxidation performance within 30 min the degradation performance of these three processes for heavy crude oil was displayed in fig 2b it would be worth noting that unlike light crude oil the degradation of heavy crude oil in three oxidation processes showed a significant difference in the first 5 min fig s2 since then the degradation performance improved significantly from o3 to uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes it could be due to more hydroxyl radicals being generated when o3 was irradiated by uv light and more sulfate radicals being produced when persulfate was activated under the dual action of uv light and hydroxyl radicals soubh and mokhtarani 2016 wang et al 2019 the concentrations of heavy crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps decreased to 93 07 53 04 and 22 41 ppm after 30 min treatment respectively the average removal efficiencies of heavy crude oil were slightly lower than those of light crude oil degradation which were 55 91 74 64 and 89 26 in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively the rate constants of the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps process were 0 027 0 044 0 073 min 1 respectively table s1 all the above results indicated that the addition of only a small amount of persulfate can significantly improve the uv o3 treatment performance of crude oil containing wastewater 3 1 2 factors affecting degradation of crude oils parameters including initial crude oil concentration o3 ps salinity ph level and temperature were further investigated to test uv o3 ps process on the degradation of crude oils six different light crude oil concentrations from 200 ppm to 500 ppm were prepared to test the effect of initial crude oil concentrations on uv o3 ps process the results showed that regardless of the initial oil concentrations the remaining crude oil concentrations were relatively close 20 70 ppm and around 85 91 of the crude oil could be removed after 30 min treatment fig 3 a increased initial concentration from 202 02 ppm to 513 20 ppm resulted in a slight decrease in process efficiency from 90 95 to 86 40 and rate constants from 0 080 to 0 067 min 1 more than 80 00 of the heavy crude oil were removed within 30 min at initial concentration of less than 200 ppm fig s3a however a lower removal rate less than 60 00 occurred at increased heavy crude oil concentration 200 ppm this could be due to the low uv penetration in wastewater with high heavy crude concentrations resulting in decreased free radical production the degradation performance of the crude oils under uv o3 ps process followed the first order kinetic equation the corresponding parameters were collected in table s2 this indicated that the initial concentrations had little effect on the degradation performance of this process the ozone dose had a significant impact on crude oil removal fig 3b only 38 34 of light crude oil could be removed in 30 min in uv ps process an addition of 2 mg l of ozone could enhance the removal efficiency up to 65 44 comparing with no ozone input and when the blown ozone reached 10 mg l more than 90 of crude oil could be eliminated in 30 min showing the great effect of ozonation the calculated rate constant increased from 0 016 to 0 069 min 1 corroborating that the ozone dosage played a key role in this combined oxidation process only 19 13 of heavy crude could be removed in 30 min without propagating o3 fig s3b when ozone was injected the results were similar to light crude oil it was reported that an appropriate dosage of persulfate was conducive to the degradation of organic pollutants sharma and ruparelia 2017 the dosage exceeding the optimal limit would not only cause an excessive use of chemicals but also may act as a scavenger and reduce the treatment effectiveness sharma and ruparelia 2017 to find the optimum persulfate dosage different ps dosages were selected to test their effects on the light crude oil degradation fig 3c it was found that the removal efficiency could be improved from 72 81 to 77 47 when 0 5 mm persulfate was added the removal efficiency was further increased to 90 17 and 93 47 when increasing the concentration of persulfate to 1 mm and 2 mm respectively the trend was similar to that seen in heavy crude oil fig s3c given that increasing the persulfate dosages above 1 mm did not significantly improve the process efficiency the concentration of 1 mm was then selected for the remainder of the study as indicated in figs 3d and s3d the crude oil removal efficiency was improved significantly with the increase of salinity the corresponding reaction rate constants in light crude oil were 0 043 0 055 0 070 and 0 088 min 1 under the salinity of 0 15 35 and 50 respectively fig 3d the rate constant reached 0 117 min 1 when the solution salinity was set as 50 showing an impressive removal efficiency of heavy crude oil fig s3d these indicated that salinity played a key role on crude oil degradation in the uv o3 ps process our result has been in line with previous results which demonstrated that salinity played a critical role in the degradation of oily pollutants cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it may be due to the low amount of chloride that would react with oh to produce cl which had a high redox potential of 2 4 v to further degrade organics as active species xu et al 2018 further the existence of salts na2so4 or nacl accelerated the mass transfer of ozone at the gas liquid interface and as a result the removal efficiency of organic pollutants enhanced significantly liu et al 2021b an investigation on the effect of ph on the degradation of crude oils by uv o3 ps process was conducted at the ph values of 5 6 5 and 8 as seen in the inset chart of fig 3e the initial light crude oil concentrations increased with the elevated ph reaching 329 25 ppm 360 76 ppm and 425 27 ppm at ph 5 6 5 and 8 respectively this trend was also observed in heavy crude oil under the same oil to water ratio the concentration of light and heavy crude oils under alkaline ph was higher than in neutral and acidic conditions figs 3e and s3e inset chart this could be due to the alkaline reaction of the organic acids in the crude oils producing an in situ surfactant which reduced the interfacial tension and thus increased the concentration of crude oil in water sheng 2015 as seen in fig 3e the efficiency of light crude oil removal increased from 66 85 to 79 89 as the ph was decreased from 6 5 to 5 while the removal efficiency was significantly reduced to 19 59 when the ph reached up to 8 similar results were displayed in fig s3e for heavy crude oil degradation thus the uv o3 ps process would be more suitable for light and heavy crude oils degradation in acidic rather than alkaline conditions it was reported that molecular ozone sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals were the dominant reactive species at ph 7 in uv o3 ps process izadifard et al 2017 indirect ozonation usually by hydroxyl radicals played a major role in alkaline conditions because of the decomposition of molecular ozone ji et al 2018 besides more sulfate radicals reacted with oh forming hydroxyl radicals which were the primary reactive species under basic conditions izadifard et al 2017 ji et al 2018 reported that direct ozonation was the predominant process for the oxidation of some oil compounds such as n alkanes and pahs therefore the reduced sulfate radicals and the decomposition of molecular ozone could result in inhibited degradation of crude oil in alkaline conditions figs 3f and s3f presented the degradation of light and heavy crude oils at various temperatures 4 c 15 c and 22 c under the uv o3 ps process the initial crude oil concentrations in water at 4 c 15 c and 22 c were 337 88 ppm 375 23 ppm and 399 70 ppm respectively showing an increasing trend it was seen that low temperature decreased the concentration of initial crude oil in water and inhibited the degradation of total crude oil in this combined process fig 3f with the temperature rising from 4 to 22 c the total light crude oil removal increased from 67 82 to 86 12 the reason could be that the rising temperature accelerated the solubility of ozone in water and speeded up the production of hydroxyl radicals the lowest removal rate for heavy crude oil occurred at 15 c instead of 4 c which could be attribute to the significantly different initial heavy crude oil concentrations fig s3f 3 1 3 removal of n alkanes and pahs during three ozone based processes chronic and acute exposure to hydrocarbons from crude oil like n alkanes and pahs could cause detrimental health disorders to both aquatic and human beings rajasekhar et al 2021 it is necessary to monitor the concentration change of n alkanes and pahs during three ozone based processes as displayed in the reactors of fig s4a and b the color of homogenized light and heavy crude oils are yellow and dark brown respectively the abundance of the n alkane peaks in light crude oil was observed to be much higher than that in heavy crude oil as shown in the gc ms chromatogram fig 4 this result was consistent with the crude oil properties given in table 1 i e the concentration of saturates in light crude oil was significantly higher than in heavy crude oil in comparison with heavy crude oil the initial total n alkanes concentration in light crude oil 6 24 mg l is 15 times higher than in heavy crude oil 0 41 mg l fig 4 in both light and heavy crude oils short chain i e c10 c19 n alkanes are the most abundant accounting for more than half of the total n alkanes the content of long chain i e c30 c35 n alkanes was the lowest accounting for only about 7 31 of total n alkanes in both light and heavy crude oils for light crude oil after 30 min treatment the o3 process could remove 69 41 of the n alkanes the uv o3 process reached up to 73 23 and 90 removal could be achieved with the uv o3 ps process fig 4a c it would be noteworthy that after 1 h treatment small amounts of n alkanes still can be detected in both o3 and uv o3 processes but none can be found in uv o3 ps process which indicated that the uv o3 ps process had an impressive efficiency for n alkanes removal fig 4a c after 1 h o3 process treatment the removal efficiencies of short chain middle chain i e c20 c29 and long chain n alkanes were 93 65 96 30 and 99 29 respectively in the uv o3 process 96 59 97 66 and 100 of efficiencies could be reached for short chain middle chain and long chain n alkanes degradation respectively therefore we concluded that the longer the carbon chain of the n alkanes the easier these were to remove it was possible that the long chain n alkanes were cleaved into short chain before being completely removed under the o3 based processes for heavy crude oil 96 45 of the total n alkanes removal efficiency could be observed in o3 process and these were completely removed in both uv o3 and uv o3 ps aops this confirmed that both uv light and persulfate had positive effect on the degradation of n alkanes it would be worth noting that 97 88 of n alkanes could be removed in only 30 min in the uv o3 ps process showing excellent degradation performance different n alkane fractions showed different results it only took 5 to 15 min to remove all long chain n alkanes in these three o3 based aops however it took longer to degrade short chain n alkanes than both middle and long chain n alkanes this was consistent with the degradation performance in light crude oil the 16 priority pahs were classified by the u s environmental protection agency based on the wide range of toxicological effects on humans ambade et al 2022 therefore the main pahs in both light and heavy crude oils were detected and their degradation performance under three o3 based processes were monitored and displayed in fig 5 the main detected pahs in light crude oil were naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene and chrysene and the total pahs concentration was 1 05 mg l in contrast as many as 10 pahs were detected in heavy crude oil including naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenz a h anthracene their total concentration of about 0 21 mg l was 5 times lower than the total pahs concentration in light crude oil the concentration of phenanthrene was the highest in both light and heavy crude oils although the concentration of total pahs in light crude oil was higher than in heavy crude oil these were easy to remove unselectively under the three aops fig 5a the results showed that 86 72 95 09 and 97 46 of total pahs in light crude oil could be removed in only 30 min under o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively both uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes could improve the removal efficiency after 60 min 97 28 and 98 67 of pahs in o3 and uv o3 processes could be removed respectively and no pahs could be detected in uv o3 ps process for heavy crude oil the degradation efficiencies of the total pahs in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps aops after 30 min were 78 36 81 21 and 92 91 respectively fig 5b after 1 h of heavy crude oil treatment the removal efficiencies in the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 94 79 94 97 and 100 respectively overall the addition of persulfate could achieve more than 90 of degradation efficiency for both n alkanes and pahs within 30 min and the degradation rate was significantly higher than that of o3 and uv o3 processes 3 1 4 toc removal the toc concentrations of crude oils before and after treatment were further evaluated to explore the mineralization of the treated water in the above three o3 based aops the average toc concentrations of initial light and heavy crude oils were 135 08 mg l and 207 93 mg l respectively it was found that the toc removal efficiencies of the o3 uv o3 uv o3 ps processes after 1 h of treatment were 85 33 89 89 and 90 33 respectively fig s5 indicating that these three aops had very positive effects on crude oil mineralization similar results were obtained for heavy crude oil degradation after 1 h of treatment the toc removal efficiencies of heavy crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 89 56 91 58 and 92 40 respectively the toc analysis showed that these three processes had no significant difference in the mineralization of crude oil after one hour of treatment this result was consistent with both n alkanes and pahs degradation which showed no significant difference in degradation after 1 h treatment under these three processes overall in the first 30 min of the reaction the three aops showed significant differences in crude oil degradation the uv o3 ps process showed superior degradation performance regardless of total crude oil content n alkanes or pahs when the reaction was run for 60 min the effects of the three processes on the two crude oils were not significantly different for aops technique the high process efficiency and short processing time can reduce electrical cost and energy consumption therefore the addition of persulfate to uv o3 process may be a promising hybrid aop system for marine oily wastewater treatment 3 1 5 mechanisms and cost analysis of uv o3 ps process the degradation performance of light crude oil obtained via the 5 oxidation processes ps uv o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps within 30 min was further investigated the pseudo first order kinetic behaviors of above processes were displayed in fig s6 the rate constants of different processes showed that the combined process could enhance the removal performance in comparison with a single process fig s6b the degree of synergy between ps uv and o3 was calculated from the rate constants according to eq 1 the rate constant of uv o3 ps process was 0 0698 min 1 a value much higher than the sum of the rate constants achieved by the independent ps 0 0005 min 1 uv 0 0072 min 1 and o3 0 0317 min 1 processes the calculated degree of synergy value s for the uv o3 ps process was 43 6 reflecting the great synergistic effect of the combined process the main reaction equations in uv o3 ps process were provided below eqs 2 8 1 s k u v o 3 p s k p s k u v k o 3 k u v o 3 p s 100 2 s 2 o 8 2 h v 2 s o 4 3 o 3 h 2 o h v h 2 o 2 o 2 4 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 2 o h 3 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 6

to enhanced interactions with organics via hydrogen abstraction addition on double bond and electron transfer dong et al 2021 neta et al 1977 in uv o3 involved system ozonation could proceed via two routes direct molecular ozone reactions and indirect ozone decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals izadifard et al 2017 direct ozonation was the predominant process for the oxidation of some oil compounds e g n alkanes and pahs ji et al 2018 based on the literature and the results obtained from the effects of ph values on crude oil degradation fig 3e molecular ozone sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals were the dominant reactive species at ph 7 in uv o3 ps process izadifard et al 2017 the sulfate radicals react with oh forming hydroxyl radicals which were the primary reactive species under basic conditions eq 8 we estimated the operating costs of the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes based on the experiments carried out in the bench scale reactor 1 l the costs included the energy consumption of uv irradiation and ozone generation and usage of oxidants oxygen and sodium persulfate the calculations revealed the costs of around us 34 25 and 16 to achieve 90 removal of total oil concentration per cubic meter of water by using o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively this indicated that the uv o3 ps was the most economical option 3 2 acute toxicity assessment of both initial and treated water since the marine oily wastewater treated by aop technology would eventually be discharged back into the ocean it was necessary to pay attention to its acute toxicity to bacteria and aquatic species in the sea in this section we chose the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri and brine shrimp artemia franciscana as targets to evaluate the toxicity of marine oily wastewater before and after treatment all the treated water samples were bubbled using nitrogen for 15 min to remove residual o3 from the water 3 2 1 acute toxicity of marine oily wastewater to vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity of solution with light and heavy crude oils before and after three treatments was monitored by microtox and the results were shown in fig 6 the control solutions i e seawater and seawater with ps addition have been shown to be non toxic to vibrio fischeri for light crude oil the ec50 increased slightly from the initial value of 34 91 to 38 94 after o3 process treatment the ec50 value increased around 2 fold in both uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes indicating that the enhanced oxidation processes could reduce the toxicity of treated water similar trend was found for heavy crude oil the initial ec50 value of heavy crude oil was 13 44 which was much lower than that of light crude oil indicating the higher toxicity of heavy crude oil that could be due to the presence of more diverse pahs in heavy crude oil and its higher sulfur content as shown in fig 5 and table 1 after o3 treatment the ec50 value of heavy crude oil increased to 18 71 showing a slight toxicity reduction the uv o3 process could increase the ec50 value to 47 16 the ec50 value of uv o3 ps process treated sample increased as much as 4 fold from 13 44 to 54 31 this indicated that the combined uv o3 and ps processes could effectively remove toxicity products from water to verify and compare the differences in the toxicity of wastewater to bacteria and aquatic species we further studied its effect on brine shrimp 3 2 2 acute toxicity of marine oily wastewater to artemia franciscana three dimensional fluorescence emission excitation spectra eems of both light and heavy crude oils before and after 1 h of treatment showed distinct fluorescence characteristics fig 7 a and c the fluorescence intensity of light crude oil was around 3 times stronger than that of heavy crude oil this observation was similar to that from uv vis spectrophotometry fig 2 light crude oil had its maximum fluorescence intensity centered on ex em 224 340 nm fig 7a another fluorescence component of the crude oil had an emission maximum located at 320 nm over the excitation wavelength range of 260 280 nm which coincided with the fluorescence peak identified for other crude oils by previous reports bugden et al 2008 zhou et al 2013 the oblique lines may be due to scattering effects ludmerczki et al 2019 yin et al 2020 this weak fluorescence component at an emission wavelength of 320 nm showed no signal after three o3 based processes treatment demonstrating that the emission was strongly quenched and the oil was degraded a significant decrease of the maximum fluorescence intensity peak at ex em 224 340 nm occurred after 1 h o3 treatment indicating that most of the oil was degraded further weakened and even disappeared fluorescence emission was observed in uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively showing enhanced degradation performance for heavy crude oil the main fluorescence intensities were also observed on ex em 224 340 nm and ex 260 280 em 310 330 nm fig 7c interestingly only extremely weak fluorescence intensity could be observed in uv o3 treated sample almost no peak signal could be found in o3 and uv o3 ps processes the mortality rate of artemia to both initial crude oil emulsions and the treated water was evaluated to further explore the feasibility of three o3 based processes fig 7b and d the control samples i e seawater and seawater with ps addition showed no obvious intensity signal on eems and zero mortality to artemia fig s7 the 48 h mortality rate of untreated light crude oil to artemia was between 0 and 10 showing that it was less toxic fig 7c the mortality rate of 0 was observed in three o3 based aops this indicated that the light crude oil treated with the three o3 based processes was not toxic to artemia the mortality of artemia exposed to untreated heavy crude oil was considerably higher 80 100 than that in initial light crude oil 0 10 fig 7d this result is aligned with the results of the microtox analysis which also had high toxicity in untreated heavy crude oil the artemia mortalities were 0 0 20 and 0 10 after 1 h of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps treatments respectively fig 7d the increased toxicity of heavy crude oil in uv o3 process may be related to a greater variety of pahs compared to light crude oil some previous studies reported that some pahs were more likely oxidized to form oxygenated pahs oxy pahs which were sometimes more toxic than their parent compounds lundstedt et al 2007 ps addition reduced the mortality from 0 20 to 0 10 in comparison with the uv o3 process that could be due to further oxidation results in ring cleavage and the release of ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids which were more biodegradable than aromatics as reported by our previous work liu et al 2022 2021a further studies on the relationship between toxicity and byproducts were needed and would help better elucidate this point 3 3 fate of oil flocs after o3 based aops oil flocs were produced and found floating on the water surface during gas related treatment processes such as gas floatation and ozonation khalifa et al 2021 saththasivam et al 2016 actually the generated oil flocs could affect the penetration of light and increase the burden of the cleaning work of the device however few studies investigated the floating flocs that form during o3 based treatment it was necessary to conduct a detailed study of flocs characteristics and fate after the reaction in order to subsequently optimize the o3 based marine oily wastewater treatment technology this section further provides an in depth understanding of the marine oily wastewater treatment process by analyzing the dried flocs from the morphology optical microscope and sem and surface functional group ftir perspectives 3 3 1 optical microscope analysis of flocs the morphology of oil flocs in light crude oil was observed under an optical microscope as displayed in fig 8 the dried flocs were centered on sea salt under different processes with the enhancement of the treatment processes from o3 uv o3 to uv o3 ps the volume of flocs decreased visually fig 8a1 b1 and c1 the morphology of sea salt particles and adhered surface flocs was quite different in these three processes it was observed that the flocs produced by the o3 process had a very rough surface fig 8a2 a clear shape of salt crystal indicated a lack of amphiphilic groups between salt and flocs there were some darker droplets around the salt surface that could need to be further degraded during the uv o3 process the morphology of flocs in the plate was a little sticky fig 8b under the optical microscope the flocs were tidy and loosely adhered to the salt surface which indicated that the flocs were further degraded with the presence of uv light fig 8b2 during the uv o3 ps process the volume of the flocs was significantly reduced than that of the other two processes fig 8c1 moreover the flocs produced by this process were very viscous and there were bonds between the salt particles fig 8c2 this indicated that the flocs were gradually decomposed in the order of enhancing the treatment processes the optical microscopy analysis for heavy crude oil was also observed and displayed in fig s8 in comparison with light crude oil the flocs in heavy crude oil were darker and sticker and the irregular shape of sea salt particles was found in each process to understand their surface characteristics sem was applied to further examine the flocs in two crude oils and three o3 based processes 3 3 2 sem analysis of flocs the morphology and eds analysis of both untreated crude oils and flocs generated in three o3 based oxidation processes were studied and displayed in fig 9 all samples were coated with gold before sem analysis fig 9a presented the morphology and elemental analysis of untreated light crude oil the surface of untreated light crude oil was smooth and its main components 96 82 was carbon after 1 h o3 process treatment flocs with wrinkles were generated and some crystalline salts could be seen on the surface fig 9b the carbon content was reduced from 96 82 to 71 82 after the reaction indicating that the degradation of organics occurred in oil flocs surface when uv light was added in o3 process fig 9c more sea salts were found on the flocs surface the carbon contents were decreased to 58 19 and some oxygen was introduced in the uv o3 ps process the floc surfaces became rough and more salts were embedded into the flocs showing further oxidation fig 9d the reduced carbon and increased nacl contents confirmed these results similar behavior was found in heavy crude oils the surface of initial heavy crude oil was somewhat rough compared to light crude oil fig 9e compared with light crude oil the heavy crude oil had high sulfur content 7 28 versus 2 33 in light crude oil consistent with the information given in table 1 after o3 and uv o3 treatment the flocs clustered together with some salt particles appearing on the surface fig 9f and g it would be worth noting that after uv o3 ps treatment the flocs became coarser and their surface sea salt content was high showing further oxidation fig 9h the eds results showed that the contents of o na and cl increased with the enhancement of the treatment process the above results concluded that with the strengthening of the oxidation process the carbon content in the flocs gradually decreased and the oxygen content gradually increased the addition of persulfate accelerated the degradation of the flocs 3 3 3 ftir analysis of flocs formed in o3 based processes ftir analysis was performed to observe the changes in the functional groups of initial crude oils and flocs after three o3 based processes fig 10 in light crude oil the large wavenumber bands found at about 2953 2921 and 2852 cm 1 were associated with c h stretching vibration specifically c h in phase stretch in ch2 and c h out of phase stretch in ch2 akmaz et al 2011 fig 10a the broad peak between 3100 and 3600 cm 1 represented the hydroxyl groups o h that could be related to hydrogen bonds dong et al 2018 there were no notable o h functional groups in the ftir of the initial light crude oil however the peak area at 3100 3600 cm 1 increased significantly with the enhancement of the oxidation processes the peak at around 1706 cm 1 contributed to the c o vibration stretching in the ketones and or carboxylic acids it had been reported that ozone could oxidize alkanes cleaving carbon carbon double bands to give ketones or carboxylic acids soriano jr et al 2003 with the duration of ozone and further enhancement of oxidation processes by the addition of uv light and persulfate the c o stretching peak area became larger suggesting an increased concentration of new carbonyl compounds the production of more oxygen containing functional groups indicated that the flocs were gradually oxidized and this phenomenon was more pronounced with the addition of persulfate in heavy crudes the same oxygen containing groups i e o h and c o and enhanced peak intensities were observed with the enhancement of the treatment processes from o3 and uv o3 to uv o3 ps processes fig 10b besides unlike light crudes heavy crude oil featured some low wavenumber functional groups for example the asymmetric stretching of c o c in ethers gives rise to bands in the region between 1300 and 1200 cm 1 and the c h out of plane bending wagging vibration of aromatic rings was the main contributor in the region between 900 and 700 cm 1 asemani and rabbani 2020 it had been reported by previous researchers that these two bands belonged to the asphaltenes and resins akmaz et al 2011 asemani and rabbani 2020 these two bands were absent in light crude oil probably because of its low asphaltene and resin content after the three oxidation processes the peak area of these two bands gradually decreased showing that the asphaltene and resin contents in flocs were decreased 4 conclusions marine industries transportation petroleum and energy fishing and aquaculture ports etc generate a tremendous quantity of wastewater e g offshore produced water bilge water ballast water and decanted water which contains complex organic contaminants especially including toxic and recalcitrant hydrocarbons leading to significant challenges on marine wastewater treatment usually requires high efficiency mobile and small footprint and sustainable development ozonation based aop is one of the highly effective solutions to achieve a rapid and feasible on site treatment method for marine oily wastewater to meet the more stringent standards our study thoroughly compared the degradation performance toxicity assessment and floc formation of three ozone based processes i e o3 only uv o3 and uv o3 ps for light and heavy crude oils the results showed that in comparison with o3 and uv o3 processes the addition of ps could significantly shorten the treatment time of marine oily wastewater to 30 min which would potentially reduce the energy consumption this provides evidence for the addition of ps in o3 based aop to explore the optimal treatment conditions for scale up to an operational system of marine oily wastewater two types of marine species bacteria and crustacean species were chosen to systematic evaluate the toxicity of marine oily wastewater the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri was significantly reduced in uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes than in o3 process the mortality of artemia from marine oily wastewater was significantly reduced in all three processes confirming that the significance of the treatment processes on reducing the negative ecological impacts of oily wastewater the flocs are a tough nut but receive limited investigations it was found that the flocs generated by different o3 based processes have different fates morphology and surface functional groups analysis confirmed that the flocs issue could be alleviated by the enhanced oxidation process and extended reaction time especially in the uv o3 ps process therefore the results in this paper demonstrated a more energy effective and low environmental impact approach to treating marine oily wastewater by o3 based processes overall this study added new scientific knowledge to improve the understanding of oxidation mechanisms of heavy and light crude oil in seawater and support the practical operations and policy making as well as sustainable development of marine industry the uv o3 ps process was further approved to be a promising option for marine oily wastewater treatment in a more cost efficient way with potential of applications in the other relevant areas meanwhile future efforts are still needed to address some limitations in the current study for example more in depth mechanistic analysis e g generation of free radicals and fate and impact of byproducts can help gain comprehensive understanding and optimize the system design and operation toxicity to different species the chronic toxicity assessment of many marine organisms e g microbes crustaceans vertebrates scaling up and field demonstration are desired for further performance

15360,efficient on site treatment technology is crucial for mitigating marine oily wastewater pollution this work investigates the ozone o3 ultraviolet uv o3 uv o3 persulfate ps processes for the treatment of marine oily wastewater including degradation performance acute toxicity evaluation and oil flocs analysis in a benchtop circulating flow photoozonation reactor degradation performances have been studied by measuring the degradation rate of total oil concentrations specific oil components n alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and total organic carbon toc the results show that uv o3 ps could significantly enhance the removal efficiency than the other two processes with above 90 of removal efficiency in 30 min acute toxicity analysis further shows that the wastewater quality is significantly improved by four fold of the ec50 of vibrio fischeri and the mortality of artemia franciscana decreases from 100 to 0 after 48 h exposure further the morphology and functional groups of flocs have been further characterized showing that the floating flocs could be further degraded especially in uv o3 ps process our study further raised discussions regarding the future on site application of o3 based systems based on the results generated from the treatment efficiency toxicity and flocs characterization the regulation of the oxidation strength and optimization of the reaction systems could be a practical strategy for on site marine oily wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes

contaminated water from offshore petroleum and marine shipping operations e g bilge water ballast water and offshore produced water accidental oil spill response e g decanted water and other wastewater streams containing oil from the harbor and coastal activities isaacson 1979 jing et al 2015 the discharge and exposure of marine oily wastewater could result in disastrous impacts on marine ecosystems jing et al 2015 2018a li et al 2016 song et al 2021 a variety of physical chemical and biological treatment methods have been developed and geared toward the recovery removal of oil impurities from water cao et al 2022 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 among all the existing treatment methods ozonation and its integration with other oxidation techniques have been among the most effective advanced oxidation processes aops to eliminate the recalcitrant contaminants unselectively in various water matrices dong et al 2022 jing et al 2018b wen et al 2022 ozonation or ultraviolet uv processes have been used to eliminate recalcitrant contaminants due to their ability to efficiently degrade recalcitrant organics in a reliable manner via direct reaction with ozone molecules or the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh that with strong oxidizing capabilities coha et al 2021 liu et al 2021a the efficiency of ozone in degrading organics is improved when combined with uv 254 nm radiation gassie and englehardt 2019 as one of the powerful aops the uv o3 process has been proven to have a huge ability to treat oily wastewater such as n alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs lin et al 2014 sulfate radical so4 as a strong one electron oxidant with a redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v has an extremely high reactivity toward a variety of organic substances which is comparable with that of oh it is reported that both o3 and uv can activate persulfate ps to form so4 and oh simultaneously dong et al 2021 zou et al 2021 qin et al 2020 have indicated that the pseudo first order rate constants of atrazine degradation in the uv o3 ps process increase by 3 3 times compared to that in the uv o3 process while these findings suggest that so4 could decrease energy consumption and enhance the degradation efficiency such a hypothesis has not been validated for treating oily marine wastewater oily wastewater can cause ecological disturbances including alteration of the aquatic community structure and food chains through physical and chemical means lee et al 2015 toxic components of oily wastewater specifically benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex and alkylated non alkylated pahs have been observed to exhibit potential toxicity to both marine organisms and human health baird et al 2007 kponee et al 2015 on the other hand oxidation byproducts or excessive oxidants may also increase the toxicity level during the treatment process which calls for the needs for better understanding of the mechanisms and control of the treatment process to ensure the quality toxicity of effluent in compliance with standards liu et al 2021a wang et al 2013 therefore toxicity assessment of marine oily wastewater treated by ozone based processes with respect to aquatic organisms becomes important microtox test for monitoring the acute toxicity of oily wastewater and the treatment efficacy has been widely adopted in research and practice as a rapid sensitive and cost effective method and recommended by many regulators lee et al 2003 this bioassay is based on the measurement of changes in light emission by a nonpathogenic bioluminescent marine bacterium vibrio fischeri upon exposure to the test samples brine shrimp artemia franciscana one of the best studied species of crustaceans plays a key role in the marine food chain and is a suitable organism for bioassay and toxicity studies khoshnood et al 2017 these two species were selected to evaluate and compare the toxicity of the raw and treated water in this study it is worth noting that the treatment of oily wastewater by ozonation can produce some flocs that can be suspended in water stick to reactor walls or float on the water surface khalifa et al 2021 sun et al 2020 in detail flocs generation may suppress the o3 bubble interactions with oil and reduce the transmission of the uv light during the uv induced oxidation process limiting the production of free radicals for wastewater treatment flocs can also cause clogging and make system cleaning difficult to our best knowledge although the generation of flocs during o3 based processes is a common and important phenomenon few studies have been reported on their properties e g components and surface characteristics and fate de araujo et al 2020 to fill this gap and provide practical strategies for the on site o3 based treatment of oily wastewater it is necessary to explore the physical and chemical properties of flocs and their fate during different approaches in this study a lab scale o3 reactor was developed to explore the degradation of marine oily wastewater from synthetic seawater two oils and three types of ozonation processes were compared and some key parameters like initial oil concentration o3 dosage ps dosage salinity ph level and temperature were studied to determine the optimal conditions the degradation kinetics of n alkanes pahs and toc were investigated to reveal the degradation performance of three processes bioassays with luminous bacterium and brine shrimp were performed to evaluate the reduction in toxicity of the treated water microscopic and spectroscopic techniques were employed to investigate the characteristic of flocs generated in three o3 based processes 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals and materials sodium persulfate ps dichloromethane dcm pah mix 3 c8 c40 alkanes calibration standard internal standards is and sea salts were purchased from sigma aldrich ontario canada two commonly used light and heavy crude oils produced in canada were compared thoroughly the physicochemical properties of both light and heavy crude oils including gravity density viscosity sulphur content and sara saturates aromatics resin and asphaltene fractions were obtained from environment canada and displayed in table 1 it can be seen that the sara fractions of light crude oil and heavy crude oil are significantly different heavy crude oil is low in saturates and aromatics but very high in resins and asphaltenes 2 2 experimental design different aop experiments were carried out in a lab scale reactor with a continuous supply of ozone at atmospheric temperature as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 1 the ozone reactor comprises a glass column in which 1 l of synthetic seawater with dissolved crude oil was introduced a uv 254 nm uvp 90 0012 01 model source krackeler scientific was inserted from the upper part as light source an ozone diffuser micropore size 500 µm was set at the bottom of the reactor ozone was produced in the lab using an ozone generator ozonelabtm ol80a model a flow meter reg 5404 r flows 0 4 l min was used to provide a constant oxygen flow of 0 25 l min into the ozone generator to better adjust the experimental conditions and operational parameters and explore the reaction mechanisms we chose to use synthetic water in this study synthetic seawater was prepared by dissolving 35 g sea salt in 1 l distilled water with a magnetic stirrer marine oily wastewater was prepared by adding 1 ml crude oil in 1 l synthetic seawater oil to water ratio 1 1000 followed by homogenization fisherbrand 850 homogenizer for 5 min in 15 000 rpm at room temperature 22 25 c each experiment was conducted at least three times since the dilution of crude oils in the seawater was not completely homogenous throughout the study 2 3 extraction and analysis methods 2 3 1 extraction procedure the water samples were first pre treated by a vortex shaker assisted liquid liquid microextraction vsallme method modified from that reported by zheng et al 2015 for pahs detection ten milliliters of the treated solution were collected in a 15 ml glass screw top tube and 1 ml of dcm was added the tube was well sealed and vortexed for 1 min then stood for 10 min to allow the separation of the organic and aqueous phases a hundred microliters of the organic phase were transferred to a 150 μl micro vial ten microliters of is 10 μg ml were added before instrumental analysis for the detection of n alkanes the procedure was same as above except that the organic phase dcm was replaced with hexane 2 3 2 determination of total crude oil concentration the uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher genesys 10s was applied to estimate the total oil concentration all the components were dissolved in dcm in the same proportions and then the absorbance measurements were recorded at wavelengths of 340 370 and 400 nm cao et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the detailed equations and calibration curves of total oil compounds for light and heavy crude oils can be obtained in text s1 and fig s1 the total organic carbon toc concentrations were measured by the burning oxidation non dispersive infrared absorption method using a shimadzu toc l analyzer shimadzu tokyo japan a few drops of phosphoric acid were added before measuring toc to maintain the sample ph 1 additional fluorometric analysis horiba aqualog was performed during the toxicity studies to estimate the concentration of crude oils in water 2 3 3 determination of n alkanes and pahs using gc ms both the normal alkanes n alkanes and pahs analysis were performed using an agilent 7890a 5975c gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms equipped with an agilent 7693 autosampler two microliters of analytes were injected into gc and separated by a 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm db 5ms ui fused silica capillary column for n alkanes analysis the oven was programed to hold the initial temperature at 40 c for 8 min then ramp from 7 c min to 295 c for 10 min the injection mode was split at 300 c with a split ratio of 10 1 for pahs analysis the oven program was set as the initial temperature at 65 c for 1 min then ramped 65 300 c at 4 c min and held at 300 c for 1 min the injection mode was splitless at 300 c the pah analyses were performed in the selected ion monitoring sim mode with an electron energy of 70 ev the ion source was set at 300 c the methods detection limit was 0 3 1 ng l the variance of the analytical method was 5 based on duplicate measurements 2 4 toxicity evaluation of treated water 2 4 1 vibrio fischeri acute toxicity evaluation acute toxicity tests of the solution before and after 1 h o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes treatment were carried out using a microtox model 500 analyzer whose primary indicator was the luminous bacterium vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity test relied on bacterial luminescence via cellular respiration inhibition of cellular activity caused by exposure to toxicants acidic or alkaline conditions etc decreased the respiratory rate leading to a corresponding decrease in luminosity the ec50 referred to the percentage of water samples that cause a 50 decrease of luminous intensity the ph range of 6 0 8 5 was recommended as standard since vibrio fischeri is ph sensitive fang et al 2019 fifteen minutes of nitrogen aeration was conducted to remove the residual ozone before the tests 2 4 2 artemia acute toxicity evaluation the artemia toxicity tests were conducted at huntsman marine science centre st andrews nb canada a franciscana cysts were sourced from aquamerik inc levis qc canada decapsulated cysts were hatched 24 h prior to exposure in an aerated flask at 25 3 c hatched a franciscana nauplii at the ii and iii instar stages were used for all exposures and 20 individuals were imaged to confirm the developmental stage exposures were performed at room temperature 25 2 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod with led light the acute toxicity of artemia was evaluated based on the mortality rate at 48 h exposure to the marine oily wastewater before and after 1 h o3 based aops all solutions were tested in triplicate with 10 organisms per vial 4 ml glass gc vial after 48 h exposure to the samples organisms that were no longer able to swim within 15 s after gentle agitation with flowing water from a pipette were considered dead water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do ph salinity psu and temperature c were measured in the test solutions at the beginning and end 48 h of the exposure a test was considered valid if the control survival was greater than 80 dissolved oxygen remained over 60 saturation and the test solution temperature remained within 1 5 c for the duration of the trial tests were performed and data collected consistent with good laboratory practice standards to better understand what the organisms were exposed to fluorometric readings horiba aqualog excitation emission range 220 600 nm were collected to detect the relative differences in key components in crude oils before and after the o3 based aops all contour maps were generated using origin 2021 software 2 5 characterization and analysis of floating flocs the flocs formed in three o3 based aops i e o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps after 1 h were collected on a glass slide and dried in a vacuum oven fisherbrand isotemp model 281a fisher scientific set at 50 c 10 h for further analysis oil flocs were observed under a leica dm2500 m optical microscope leica microsystems buffalo grove il usa the surface morphology of crude oil flocs before and after treatment was measured by the scanning electron microscope sem quanta 400 mla equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the surface functional groups of floating flocs were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance atr ftir the spectra were taken in the range of 4000 650 cm 1 2 6 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate for quality control error bar and error area represented each standard deviation from the means of independent experiment the significant differences were determined by one way analysis of variance anova with f tests using minitab 18 software the p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant and p 0 001 as statistically highly significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation performance of three ozone based processes 3 1 1 ps addition enhanced the overall degradation of crude oils changes in total oil concentration over time were examined to compare the treatment performance of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes for both light and heavy crude oils fig 2 under the same oil to water ratio 1 1000 the initial concentration of light crude oil measured by the spectrophotometer was about 380 430 ppm and that of heavy crude oil was about 190 230 ppm it was found that in the first 5 min three oxidation processes showed no significant difference on the light crude oil degradation fig s2 after 10 min of reaction the uv o3 ps process showed significant degradation performance in comparison with o3 process after that these three processes started to show significant differences on light crude oil degradation after 30 min treatment the concentrations of light crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 156 63 90 03 and 28 76 ppm respectively correspondingly the removal efficiencies of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 61 22 76 57 and 92 49 respectively fig 2a the results indicated that the addition of ps showed little effect on the first 5 min but the degradation efficiency is gradually increased afterward this could be due to the activation of ps and generation of more so4 after 5 min fig 2a lee et al 2020 the crude oil degradation could be fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model and the kinetic parameters were collected in table s1 the rate constant of the uv o3 ps process was 0 092 min 1 which was significantly higher than both o3 0 032 min 1 and uv o3 0 050 min 1 processes showing that the addition of persulfate could substantially improve the oxidation performance within 30 min the degradation performance of these three processes for heavy crude oil was displayed in fig 2b it would be worth noting that unlike light crude oil the degradation of heavy crude oil in three oxidation processes showed a significant difference in the first 5 min fig s2 since then the degradation performance improved significantly from o3 to uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes it could be due to more hydroxyl radicals being generated when o3 was irradiated by uv light and more sulfate radicals being produced when persulfate was activated under the dual action of uv light and hydroxyl radicals soubh and mokhtarani 2016 wang et al 2019 the concentrations of heavy crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps decreased to 93 07 53 04 and 22 41 ppm after 30 min treatment respectively the average removal efficiencies of heavy crude oil were slightly lower than those of light crude oil degradation which were 55 91 74 64 and 89 26 in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively the rate constants of the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps process were 0 027 0 044 0 073 min 1 respectively table s1 all the above results indicated that the addition of only a small amount of persulfate can significantly improve the uv o3 treatment performance of crude oil containing wastewater 3 1 2 factors affecting degradation of crude oils parameters including initial crude oil concentration o3 ps salinity ph level and temperature were further investigated to test uv o3 ps process on the degradation of crude oils six different light crude oil concentrations from 200 ppm to 500 ppm were prepared to test the effect of initial crude oil concentrations on uv o3 ps process the results showed that regardless of the initial oil concentrations the remaining crude oil concentrations were relatively close 20 70 ppm and around 85 91 of the crude oil could be removed after 30 min treatment fig 3 a increased initial concentration from 202 02 ppm to 513 20 ppm resulted in a slight decrease in process efficiency from 90 95 to 86 40 and rate constants from 0 080 to 0 067 min 1 more than 80 00 of the heavy crude oil were removed within 30 min at initial concentration of less than 200 ppm fig s3a however a lower removal rate less than 60 00 occurred at increased heavy crude oil concentration 200 ppm this could be due to the low uv penetration in wastewater with high heavy crude concentrations resulting in decreased free radical production the degradation performance of the crude oils under uv o3 ps process followed the first order kinetic equation the corresponding parameters were collected in table s2 this indicated that the initial concentrations had little effect on the degradation performance of this process the ozone dose had a significant impact on crude oil removal fig 3b only 38 34 of light crude oil could be removed in 30 min in uv ps process an addition of 2 mg l of ozone could enhance the removal efficiency up to 65 44 comparing with no ozone input and when the blown ozone reached 10 mg l more than 90 of crude oil could be eliminated in 30 min showing the great effect of ozonation the calculated rate constant increased from 0 016 to 0 069 min 1 corroborating that the ozone dosage played a key role in this combined oxidation process only 19 13 of heavy crude could be removed in 30 min without propagating o3 fig s3b when ozone was injected the results were similar to light crude oil it was reported that an appropriate dosage of persulfate was conducive to the degradation of organic pollutants sharma and ruparelia 2017 the dosage exceeding the optimal limit would not only cause an excessive use of chemicals but also may act as a scavenger and reduce the treatment effectiveness sharma and ruparelia 2017 to find the optimum persulfate dosage different ps dosages were selected to test their effects on the light crude oil degradation fig 3c it was found that the removal efficiency could be improved from 72 81 to 77 47 when 0 5 mm persulfate was added the removal efficiency was further increased to 90 17 and 93 47 when increasing the concentration of persulfate to 1 mm and 2 mm respectively the trend was similar to that seen in heavy crude oil fig s3c given that increasing the persulfate dosages above 1 mm did not significantly improve the process efficiency the concentration of 1 mm was then selected for the remainder of the study as indicated in figs 3d and s3d the crude oil removal efficiency was improved significantly with the increase of salinity the corresponding reaction rate constants in light crude oil were 0 043 0 055 0 070 and 0 088 min 1 under the salinity of 0 15 35 and 50 respectively fig 3d the rate constant reached 0 117 min 1 when the solution salinity was set as 50 showing an impressive removal efficiency of heavy crude oil fig s3d these indicated that salinity played a key role on crude oil degradation in the uv o3 ps process our result has been in line with previous results which demonstrated that salinity played a critical role in the degradation of oily pollutants cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it may be due to the low amount of chloride that would react with oh to produce cl which had a high redox potential of 2 4 v to further degrade organics as active species xu et al 2018 further the existence of salts na2so4 or nacl accelerated the mass transfer of ozone at the gas liquid interface and as a result the removal efficiency of organic pollutants enhanced significantly liu et al 2021b an investigation on the effect of ph on the degradation of crude oils by uv o3 ps process was conducted at the ph values of 5 6 5 and 8 as seen in the inset chart of fig 3e the initial light crude oil concentrations increased with the elevated ph reaching 329 25 ppm 360 76 ppm and 425 27 ppm at ph 5 6 5 and 8 respectively this trend was also observed in heavy crude oil under the same oil to water ratio the concentration of light and heavy crude oils under alkaline ph was higher than in neutral and acidic conditions figs 3e and s3e inset chart this could be due to the alkaline reaction of the organic acids in the crude oils producing an in situ surfactant which reduced the interfacial tension and thus increased the concentration of crude oil in water sheng 2015 as seen in fig 3e the efficiency of light crude oil removal increased from 66 85 to 79 89 as the ph was decreased from 6 5 to 5 while the removal efficiency was significantly reduced to 19 59 when the ph reached up to 8 similar results were displayed in fig s3e for heavy crude oil degradation thus the uv o3 ps process would be more suitable for light and heavy crude oils degradation in acidic rather than alkaline conditions it was reported that molecular ozone sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals were the dominant reactive species at ph 7 in uv o3 ps process izadifard et al 2017 indirect ozonation usually by hydroxyl radicals played a major role in alkaline conditions because of the decomposition of molecular ozone ji et al 2018 besides more sulfate radicals reacted with oh forming hydroxyl radicals which were the primary reactive species under basic conditions izadifard et al 2017 ji et al 2018 reported that direct ozonation was the predominant process for the oxidation of some oil compounds such as n alkanes and pahs therefore the reduced sulfate radicals and the decomposition of molecular ozone could result in inhibited degradation of crude oil in alkaline conditions figs 3f and s3f presented the degradation of light and heavy crude oils at various temperatures 4 c 15 c and 22 c under the uv o3 ps process the initial crude oil concentrations in water at 4 c 15 c and 22 c were 337 88 ppm 375 23 ppm and 399 70 ppm respectively showing an increasing trend it was seen that low temperature decreased the concentration of initial crude oil in water and inhibited the degradation of total crude oil in this combined process fig 3f with the temperature rising from 4 to 22 c the total light crude oil removal increased from 67 82 to 86 12 the reason could be that the rising temperature accelerated the solubility of ozone in water and speeded up the production of hydroxyl radicals the lowest removal rate for heavy crude oil occurred at 15 c instead of 4 c which could be attribute to the significantly different initial heavy crude oil concentrations fig s3f 3 1 3 removal of n alkanes and pahs during three ozone based processes chronic and acute exposure to hydrocarbons from crude oil like n alkanes and pahs could cause detrimental health disorders to both aquatic and human beings rajasekhar et al 2021 it is necessary to monitor the concentration change of n alkanes and pahs during three ozone based processes as displayed in the reactors of fig s4a and b the color of homogenized light and heavy crude oils are yellow and dark brown respectively the abundance of the n alkane peaks in light crude oil was observed to be much higher than that in heavy crude oil as shown in the gc ms chromatogram fig 4 this result was consistent with the crude oil properties given in table 1 i e the concentration of saturates in light crude oil was significantly higher than in heavy crude oil in comparison with heavy crude oil the initial total n alkanes concentration in light crude oil 6 24 mg l is 15 times higher than in heavy crude oil 0 41 mg l fig 4 in both light and heavy crude oils short chain i e c10 c19 n alkanes are the most abundant accounting for more than half of the total n alkanes the content of long chain i e c30 c35 n alkanes was the lowest accounting for only about 7 31 of total n alkanes in both light and heavy crude oils for light crude oil after 30 min treatment the o3 process could remove 69 41 of the n alkanes the uv o3 process reached up to 73 23 and 90 removal could be achieved with the uv o3 ps process fig 4a c it would be noteworthy that after 1 h treatment small amounts of n alkanes still can be detected in both o3 and uv o3 processes but none can be found in uv o3 ps process which indicated that the uv o3 ps process had an impressive efficiency for n alkanes removal fig 4a c after 1 h o3 process treatment the removal efficiencies of short chain middle chain i e c20 c29 and long chain n alkanes were 93 65 96 30 and 99 29 respectively in the uv o3 process 96 59 97 66 and 100 of efficiencies could be reached for short chain middle chain and long chain n alkanes degradation respectively therefore we concluded that the longer the carbon chain of the n alkanes the easier these were to remove it was possible that the long chain n alkanes were cleaved into short chain before being completely removed under the o3 based processes for heavy crude oil 96 45 of the total n alkanes removal efficiency could be observed in o3 process and these were completely removed in both uv o3 and uv o3 ps aops this confirmed that both uv light and persulfate had positive effect on the degradation of n alkanes it would be worth noting that 97 88 of n alkanes could be removed in only 30 min in the uv o3 ps process showing excellent degradation performance different n alkane fractions showed different results it only took 5 to 15 min to remove all long chain n alkanes in these three o3 based aops however it took longer to degrade short chain n alkanes than both middle and long chain n alkanes this was consistent with the degradation performance in light crude oil the 16 priority pahs were classified by the u s environmental protection agency based on the wide range of toxicological effects on humans ambade et al 2022 therefore the main pahs in both light and heavy crude oils were detected and their degradation performance under three o3 based processes were monitored and displayed in fig 5 the main detected pahs in light crude oil were naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene and chrysene and the total pahs concentration was 1 05 mg l in contrast as many as 10 pahs were detected in heavy crude oil including naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenz a h anthracene their total concentration of about 0 21 mg l was 5 times lower than the total pahs concentration in light crude oil the concentration of phenanthrene was the highest in both light and heavy crude oils although the concentration of total pahs in light crude oil was higher than in heavy crude oil these were easy to remove unselectively under the three aops fig 5a the results showed that 86 72 95 09 and 97 46 of total pahs in light crude oil could be removed in only 30 min under o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively both uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes could improve the removal efficiency after 60 min 97 28 and 98 67 of pahs in o3 and uv o3 processes could be removed respectively and no pahs could be detected in uv o3 ps process for heavy crude oil the degradation efficiencies of the total pahs in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps aops after 30 min were 78 36 81 21 and 92 91 respectively fig 5b after 1 h of heavy crude oil treatment the removal efficiencies in the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 94 79 94 97 and 100 respectively overall the addition of persulfate could achieve more than 90 of degradation efficiency for both n alkanes and pahs within 30 min and the degradation rate was significantly higher than that of o3 and uv o3 processes 3 1 4 toc removal the toc concentrations of crude oils before and after treatment were further evaluated to explore the mineralization of the treated water in the above three o3 based aops the average toc concentrations of initial light and heavy crude oils were 135 08 mg l and 207 93 mg l respectively it was found that the toc removal efficiencies of the o3 uv o3 uv o3 ps processes after 1 h of treatment were 85 33 89 89 and 90 33 respectively fig s5 indicating that these three aops had very positive effects on crude oil mineralization similar results were obtained for heavy crude oil degradation after 1 h of treatment the toc removal efficiencies of heavy crude oil in o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes were 89 56 91 58 and 92 40 respectively the toc analysis showed that these three processes had no significant difference in the mineralization of crude oil after one hour of treatment this result was consistent with both n alkanes and pahs degradation which showed no significant difference in degradation after 1 h treatment under these three processes overall in the first 30 min of the reaction the three aops showed significant differences in crude oil degradation the uv o3 ps process showed superior degradation performance regardless of total crude oil content n alkanes or pahs when the reaction was run for 60 min the effects of the three processes on the two crude oils were not significantly different for aops technique the high process efficiency and short processing time can reduce electrical cost and energy consumption therefore the addition of persulfate to uv o3 process may be a promising hybrid aop system for marine oily wastewater treatment 3 1 5 mechanisms and cost analysis of uv o3 ps process the degradation performance of light crude oil obtained via the 5 oxidation processes ps uv o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps within 30 min was further investigated the pseudo first order kinetic behaviors of above processes were displayed in fig s6 the rate constants of different processes showed that the combined process could enhance the removal performance in comparison with a single process fig s6b the degree of synergy between ps uv and o3 was calculated from the rate constants according to eq 1 the rate constant of uv o3 ps process was 0 0698 min 1 a value much higher than the sum of the rate constants achieved by the independent ps 0 0005 min 1 uv 0 0072 min 1 and o3 0 0317 min 1 processes the calculated degree of synergy value s for the uv o3 ps process was 43 6 reflecting the great synergistic effect of the combined process the main reaction equations in uv o3 ps process were provided below eqs 2 8 1 s k u v o 3 p s k p s k u v k o 3 k u v o 3 p s 100 2 s 2 o 8 2 h v 2 s o 4 3 o 3 h 2 o h v h 2 o 2 o 2 4 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 2 o h 3 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 6

to enhanced interactions with organics via hydrogen abstraction addition on double bond and electron transfer dong et al 2021 neta et al 1977 in uv o3 involved system ozonation could proceed via two routes direct molecular ozone reactions and indirect ozone decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals izadifard et al 2017 direct ozonation was the predominant process for the oxidation of some oil compounds e g n alkanes and pahs ji et al 2018 based on the literature and the results obtained from the effects of ph values on crude oil degradation fig 3e molecular ozone sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals were the dominant reactive species at ph 7 in uv o3 ps process izadifard et al 2017 the sulfate radicals react with oh forming hydroxyl radicals which were the primary reactive species under basic conditions eq 8 we estimated the operating costs of the o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes based on the experiments carried out in the bench scale reactor 1 l the costs included the energy consumption of uv irradiation and ozone generation and usage of oxidants oxygen and sodium persulfate the calculations revealed the costs of around us 34 25 and 16 to achieve 90 removal of total oil concentration per cubic meter of water by using o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively this indicated that the uv o3 ps was the most economical option 3 2 acute toxicity assessment of both initial and treated water since the marine oily wastewater treated by aop technology would eventually be discharged back into the ocean it was necessary to pay attention to its acute toxicity to bacteria and aquatic species in the sea in this section we chose the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri and brine shrimp artemia franciscana as targets to evaluate the toxicity of marine oily wastewater before and after treatment all the treated water samples were bubbled using nitrogen for 15 min to remove residual o3 from the water 3 2 1 acute toxicity of marine oily wastewater to vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity of solution with light and heavy crude oils before and after three treatments was monitored by microtox and the results were shown in fig 6 the control solutions i e seawater and seawater with ps addition have been shown to be non toxic to vibrio fischeri for light crude oil the ec50 increased slightly from the initial value of 34 91 to 38 94 after o3 process treatment the ec50 value increased around 2 fold in both uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes indicating that the enhanced oxidation processes could reduce the toxicity of treated water similar trend was found for heavy crude oil the initial ec50 value of heavy crude oil was 13 44 which was much lower than that of light crude oil indicating the higher toxicity of heavy crude oil that could be due to the presence of more diverse pahs in heavy crude oil and its higher sulfur content as shown in fig 5 and table 1 after o3 treatment the ec50 value of heavy crude oil increased to 18 71 showing a slight toxicity reduction the uv o3 process could increase the ec50 value to 47 16 the ec50 value of uv o3 ps process treated sample increased as much as 4 fold from 13 44 to 54 31 this indicated that the combined uv o3 and ps processes could effectively remove toxicity products from water to verify and compare the differences in the toxicity of wastewater to bacteria and aquatic species we further studied its effect on brine shrimp 3 2 2 acute toxicity of marine oily wastewater to artemia franciscana three dimensional fluorescence emission excitation spectra eems of both light and heavy crude oils before and after 1 h of treatment showed distinct fluorescence characteristics fig 7 a and c the fluorescence intensity of light crude oil was around 3 times stronger than that of heavy crude oil this observation was similar to that from uv vis spectrophotometry fig 2 light crude oil had its maximum fluorescence intensity centered on ex em 224 340 nm fig 7a another fluorescence component of the crude oil had an emission maximum located at 320 nm over the excitation wavelength range of 260 280 nm which coincided with the fluorescence peak identified for other crude oils by previous reports bugden et al 2008 zhou et al 2013 the oblique lines may be due to scattering effects ludmerczki et al 2019 yin et al 2020 this weak fluorescence component at an emission wavelength of 320 nm showed no signal after three o3 based processes treatment demonstrating that the emission was strongly quenched and the oil was degraded a significant decrease of the maximum fluorescence intensity peak at ex em 224 340 nm occurred after 1 h o3 treatment indicating that most of the oil was degraded further weakened and even disappeared fluorescence emission was observed in uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes respectively showing enhanced degradation performance for heavy crude oil the main fluorescence intensities were also observed on ex em 224 340 nm and ex 260 280 em 310 330 nm fig 7c interestingly only extremely weak fluorescence intensity could be observed in uv o3 treated sample almost no peak signal could be found in o3 and uv o3 ps processes the mortality rate of artemia to both initial crude oil emulsions and the treated water was evaluated to further explore the feasibility of three o3 based processes fig 7b and d the control samples i e seawater and seawater with ps addition showed no obvious intensity signal on eems and zero mortality to artemia fig s7 the 48 h mortality rate of untreated light crude oil to artemia was between 0 and 10 showing that it was less toxic fig 7c the mortality rate of 0 was observed in three o3 based aops this indicated that the light crude oil treated with the three o3 based processes was not toxic to artemia the mortality of artemia exposed to untreated heavy crude oil was considerably higher 80 100 than that in initial light crude oil 0 10 fig 7d this result is aligned with the results of the microtox analysis which also had high toxicity in untreated heavy crude oil the artemia mortalities were 0 0 20 and 0 10 after 1 h of o3 uv o3 and uv o3 ps treatments respectively fig 7d the increased toxicity of heavy crude oil in uv o3 process may be related to a greater variety of pahs compared to light crude oil some previous studies reported that some pahs were more likely oxidized to form oxygenated pahs oxy pahs which were sometimes more toxic than their parent compounds lundstedt et al 2007 ps addition reduced the mortality from 0 20 to 0 10 in comparison with the uv o3 process that could be due to further oxidation results in ring cleavage and the release of ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids which were more biodegradable than aromatics as reported by our previous work liu et al 2022 2021a further studies on the relationship between toxicity and byproducts were needed and would help better elucidate this point 3 3 fate of oil flocs after o3 based aops oil flocs were produced and found floating on the water surface during gas related treatment processes such as gas floatation and ozonation khalifa et al 2021 saththasivam et al 2016 actually the generated oil flocs could affect the penetration of light and increase the burden of the cleaning work of the device however few studies investigated the floating flocs that form during o3 based treatment it was necessary to conduct a detailed study of flocs characteristics and fate after the reaction in order to subsequently optimize the o3 based marine oily wastewater treatment technology this section further provides an in depth understanding of the marine oily wastewater treatment process by analyzing the dried flocs from the morphology optical microscope and sem and surface functional group ftir perspectives 3 3 1 optical microscope analysis of flocs the morphology of oil flocs in light crude oil was observed under an optical microscope as displayed in fig 8 the dried flocs were centered on sea salt under different processes with the enhancement of the treatment processes from o3 uv o3 to uv o3 ps the volume of flocs decreased visually fig 8a1 b1 and c1 the morphology of sea salt particles and adhered surface flocs was quite different in these three processes it was observed that the flocs produced by the o3 process had a very rough surface fig 8a2 a clear shape of salt crystal indicated a lack of amphiphilic groups between salt and flocs there were some darker droplets around the salt surface that could need to be further degraded during the uv o3 process the morphology of flocs in the plate was a little sticky fig 8b under the optical microscope the flocs were tidy and loosely adhered to the salt surface which indicated that the flocs were further degraded with the presence of uv light fig 8b2 during the uv o3 ps process the volume of the flocs was significantly reduced than that of the other two processes fig 8c1 moreover the flocs produced by this process were very viscous and there were bonds between the salt particles fig 8c2 this indicated that the flocs were gradually decomposed in the order of enhancing the treatment processes the optical microscopy analysis for heavy crude oil was also observed and displayed in fig s8 in comparison with light crude oil the flocs in heavy crude oil were darker and sticker and the irregular shape of sea salt particles was found in each process to understand their surface characteristics sem was applied to further examine the flocs in two crude oils and three o3 based processes 3 3 2 sem analysis of flocs the morphology and eds analysis of both untreated crude oils and flocs generated in three o3 based oxidation processes were studied and displayed in fig 9 all samples were coated with gold before sem analysis fig 9a presented the morphology and elemental analysis of untreated light crude oil the surface of untreated light crude oil was smooth and its main components 96 82 was carbon after 1 h o3 process treatment flocs with wrinkles were generated and some crystalline salts could be seen on the surface fig 9b the carbon content was reduced from 96 82 to 71 82 after the reaction indicating that the degradation of organics occurred in oil flocs surface when uv light was added in o3 process fig 9c more sea salts were found on the flocs surface the carbon contents were decreased to 58 19 and some oxygen was introduced in the uv o3 ps process the floc surfaces became rough and more salts were embedded into the flocs showing further oxidation fig 9d the reduced carbon and increased nacl contents confirmed these results similar behavior was found in heavy crude oils the surface of initial heavy crude oil was somewhat rough compared to light crude oil fig 9e compared with light crude oil the heavy crude oil had high sulfur content 7 28 versus 2 33 in light crude oil consistent with the information given in table 1 after o3 and uv o3 treatment the flocs clustered together with some salt particles appearing on the surface fig 9f and g it would be worth noting that after uv o3 ps treatment the flocs became coarser and their surface sea salt content was high showing further oxidation fig 9h the eds results showed that the contents of o na and cl increased with the enhancement of the treatment process the above results concluded that with the strengthening of the oxidation process the carbon content in the flocs gradually decreased and the oxygen content gradually increased the addition of persulfate accelerated the degradation of the flocs 3 3 3 ftir analysis of flocs formed in o3 based processes ftir analysis was performed to observe the changes in the functional groups of initial crude oils and flocs after three o3 based processes fig 10 in light crude oil the large wavenumber bands found at about 2953 2921 and 2852 cm 1 were associated with c h stretching vibration specifically c h in phase stretch in ch2 and c h out of phase stretch in ch2 akmaz et al 2011 fig 10a the broad peak between 3100 and 3600 cm 1 represented the hydroxyl groups o h that could be related to hydrogen bonds dong et al 2018 there were no notable o h functional groups in the ftir of the initial light crude oil however the peak area at 3100 3600 cm 1 increased significantly with the enhancement of the oxidation processes the peak at around 1706 cm 1 contributed to the c o vibration stretching in the ketones and or carboxylic acids it had been reported that ozone could oxidize alkanes cleaving carbon carbon double bands to give ketones or carboxylic acids soriano jr et al 2003 with the duration of ozone and further enhancement of oxidation processes by the addition of uv light and persulfate the c o stretching peak area became larger suggesting an increased concentration of new carbonyl compounds the production of more oxygen containing functional groups indicated that the flocs were gradually oxidized and this phenomenon was more pronounced with the addition of persulfate in heavy crudes the same oxygen containing groups i e o h and c o and enhanced peak intensities were observed with the enhancement of the treatment processes from o3 and uv o3 to uv o3 ps processes fig 10b besides unlike light crudes heavy crude oil featured some low wavenumber functional groups for example the asymmetric stretching of c o c in ethers gives rise to bands in the region between 1300 and 1200 cm 1 and the c h out of plane bending wagging vibration of aromatic rings was the main contributor in the region between 900 and 700 cm 1 asemani and rabbani 2020 it had been reported by previous researchers that these two bands belonged to the asphaltenes and resins akmaz et al 2011 asemani and rabbani 2020 these two bands were absent in light crude oil probably because of its low asphaltene and resin content after the three oxidation processes the peak area of these two bands gradually decreased showing that the asphaltene and resin contents in flocs were decreased 4 conclusions marine industries transportation petroleum and energy fishing and aquaculture ports etc generate a tremendous quantity of wastewater e g offshore produced water bilge water ballast water and decanted water which contains complex organic contaminants especially including toxic and recalcitrant hydrocarbons leading to significant challenges on marine wastewater treatment usually requires high efficiency mobile and small footprint and sustainable development ozonation based aop is one of the highly effective solutions to achieve a rapid and feasible on site treatment method for marine oily wastewater to meet the more stringent standards our study thoroughly compared the degradation performance toxicity assessment and floc formation of three ozone based processes i e o3 only uv o3 and uv o3 ps for light and heavy crude oils the results showed that in comparison with o3 and uv o3 processes the addition of ps could significantly shorten the treatment time of marine oily wastewater to 30 min which would potentially reduce the energy consumption this provides evidence for the addition of ps in o3 based aop to explore the optimal treatment conditions for scale up to an operational system of marine oily wastewater two types of marine species bacteria and crustacean species were chosen to systematic evaluate the toxicity of marine oily wastewater the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri was significantly reduced in uv o3 and uv o3 ps processes than in o3 process the mortality of artemia from marine oily wastewater was significantly reduced in all three processes confirming that the significance of the treatment processes on reducing the negative ecological impacts of oily wastewater the flocs are a tough nut but receive limited investigations it was found that the flocs generated by different o3 based processes have different fates morphology and surface functional groups analysis confirmed that the flocs issue could be alleviated by the enhanced oxidation process and extended reaction time especially in the uv o3 ps process therefore the results in this paper demonstrated a more energy effective and low environmental impact approach to treating marine oily wastewater by o3 based processes overall this study added new scientific knowledge to improve the understanding of oxidation mechanisms of heavy and light crude oil in seawater and support the practical operations and policy making as well as sustainable development of marine industry the uv o3 ps process was further approved to be a promising option for marine oily wastewater treatment in a more cost efficient way with potential of applications in the other relevant areas meanwhile future efforts are still needed to address some limitations in the current study for example more in depth mechanistic analysis e g generation of free radicals and fate and impact of byproducts can help gain comprehensive understanding and optimize the system design and operation toxicity to different species the chronic toxicity assessment of many marine organisms e g microbes crustaceans vertebrates scaling up and field demonstration are desired for further performance

15361,in the past 20 years there has been a major stride in understanding the core mechanism of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria but there are still several discussion points on their survival strategies here we discovered a new genus of anammox bacteria in a full scale wastewater treating biofilm system tentatively named candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans next to genes of all core anammox metabolisms it encoded and transcribed genes involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which coupled to oxidation of small organic acids could be used to replenish ammonium and sustain their metabolism surprisingly it uniquely harbored a new ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase which has not yet been found in any other anammox genome and might confer a selective advantage to it in nitrate assimilation similar to many other microorganisms superoxide dismutase and catalase related to oxidative stress resistance were encoded and transcribed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans interestingly bilirubin oxidase bod likely involved in oxygen resistance of anammox bacteria under fluctuating oxygen concentrations was identified in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and four ca brocadia genomes and its activity was demonstrated using purified heterologously expressed proteins a following survey of oxygen active proteins in anammox bacteria revealed the presence of other previously undetected oxygen defense systems the novel cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase and bifunctional catalase peroxidase may confer a selective advantage to ca kuenenia and ca scalindua that face frequent changes in oxygen concentrations the discovery of this new genus significantly broadens our understanding of the ecophysiology of anammox bacteria furthermore the diverse oxygen tolerance strategies employed by distinct anammox bacteria advance our understanding of their niche adaptability and provide valuable insight for the operation of anammox based wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox new genus biofilm oxygen tolerance nitrate reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discovery of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox completely changed our understanding of the nitrogen cycle kuypers et al 2018 mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria are affiliated with a monophyletic group in the phylum planctomycetes strous et al 1999 and have been detected in many natural and engineered ecosystems where they facilitate the release of fixed nitrogen into the atmosphere after the initial discovery of the anammox process five candidate genera of anammox bacteria including ca scalindua kuypers et al 2003 ca kuenenia schmid et al 2000 2003 ca brocadia strous et al 1999 ca anammoxoglobus kartal et al 2007b and ca jettenia quan et al 2008 were consecutively identified environmental metagenomics combined with continuous cultivation approaches and biochemical experiments resulted in the description of the core anammox metabolism which can be described in three main catabolic reactions hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 reduction of nitrite no2 to nitric oxide no by nitrite reductase nir or an unidentified enzyme equation 1 transformation of ammonium nh4 and no to hydrazine n2h4 by hydrazine synthase hzs equation 2 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 oshiki et al 2016a and oxidation of n2h4 into dinitrogen gas n2 by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh equation 3 the electrons released from hydrazine oxidation are used to establish a proton motive force for energy conservation and produce reducing equivalents needed for cellular anabolic activity de almeida et al 2016 hu et al 2019 whereas hydroxylamine nh2oh was found to be the intermediate of anammox process in ca brocadia that an nh2oh dependent metabolism was proposed for some anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016a anammox bacteria were assumed to oxidize a part of their substrate nitrite to nitrate by a nitrite oxidoreductase nxr equation 4 to generate electrons for the reduction of nitrite to no equation 1 hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2013 whereas hzs hdh and nxr are conserved throughout the known anammox genera distinct anammox bacteria encode a cytochrome cd 1 type nir nirs a copper containing nir nirk or some alternative protein for nitrite reduction such as a multiheme hao like protein complex ferousi et al 2019 kartal and keltjens 2016 all of these catabolic reactions occur in the membrane bound prokaryotic organelle called the anammoxosome which comprises 50 70 of the cell volume de almeida et al 2015 1 no2 2h e no h2o e0 0 38 v 2 no nh4 2h 3e n2h4 h2o e0 0 06 v 3 n2h4 n2 4h 4e e0 0 75 v 4 no2 no3 2h 2e e0 0 42 v while there have been advances made in understanding the core metabolism of anammox bacteria there are still several discussion points on their physiological versatility and resistance to environmental factors including their alternative energy sources and oxygen defense systems anammox bacteria were assumed to have an exclusively chemolithotrophic lifestyle acquiring energy for growth solely from anaerobic nh4 oxidation but they have the genomic potential of using formate acetate propionate amino acid hydrogen and fe2 as electron donors to sustain their metabolism kartal et al 2013 lawson et al 2021 indeed using enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria their growth on anaerobic oxidation of short volatile fatty acids was demonstrated güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b 2008 tao et al 2019 distinct enrichments of anammox bacteria were reported to reduce no3 to produce additional ammonium as a substrate for their main metabolism by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra coupled with short volatile fatty acids oxidation ali et al 2020 güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a winkler et al 2012 the known anammox bacteria appear to be oxygen sensitive and dissolved oxygen is an important parameter controlling anammox activity in manmade ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps cho et al 2020 kimura et al 2011 nevertheless varying levels of oxygen tolerances were observed in different enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016b but the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear and oxygen defense systems of anammox bacteria have not been characterized altogether these findings indicate greater ecophysiological flexibility of anammox bacteria and the presence of a specific niche for each distinct anammox genera or species in this study we present the discovery of a new anammox genus in a full scale wastewater treatment biofilm system treating landfill leachate using its metagenome assembled genome mag and metatranscriptomes we constructed a metabolic blueprint of this new anammox bacterium in addition a detailed analysis of the mag revealed a bilirubin oxidase an enzyme that could be used in oxygen resistance whose activity was validated using heterologously expressed proteins we discuss the central metabolism of this new genus and its ecophysiological versatility related to its adaptation to unfavorable and fluctuating environmental conditions furthermore the exploration of different oxygen defense mechanisms employed by distinct anammox bacteria advances our understanding of niche adaption and application of anammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and sequencing two separate biofilm samples were collected from the activated carbon modules of a landfill leachate treatment plant called zentraldeponie emscherbruch zde wwtp table s1 fig s1 located in herten germany in november 2017 and april 2018 respectively zde plant was primarily operated as an activated sludge system with a conventional nitrification denitrification nitrogen removal process the plant was upgraded in 2001 by equipping ultrafiltration and activated carbon modules after activated sludge systems fig s1 the activated carbon modules were kept at a high temperature 34 and nearly neutral ph 6 8 table s1 in which granular activated carbon acted as carrier materials for the establishment of anammox biofilm

and discussion 3 1 identification of a new genus of anammox bacteria zentraldeponie emscherbruch zde wwtp was designed to treat landfill leachate the plant was designed to remove ammonium through a two stage process in which part of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite by the activated sludge system and the remaining ammonium and oxidized nitrite were then transferred to nitrogen gas by anammox in the activated carbon modules under anaerobic condition table s1 fig s1 biofilm samples were collected from the activated carbon modules of the plant in november 2017 and april 2018 for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing respectively in total 27 otus of brocadiales anammox bacteria were obtained from 16s rna gene amplicon sequencing and most of them were assigned to ca brocadia but only otu27 could not be assigned to any of the known anammox genera fig s2 shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of the biofilm produced 251 6 million dna and 66 4 million cdna reads in total 198 mags were obtained after de novo assembly and binning of the metagenomic dna reads in which 106 mags had high completeness 80 and low contamination 10 table s6 four high quality anammox bacterial mags table s7 were identified based on the taxonomic assignments of gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2019 including two ca kuenenia mags yc6 and yc7 one ca brocadia mag yc2 and the mag yc1 ca kuenenia yc6 dominated the anammox community 5 82 then followed by yc2 1 85 yc7 0 78 and yc1 0 6 table s7 and fig s3 yc1 was assigned to the family brocadiaceae but could not be assigned to any known genera in line with this observation the 16s rrna gene of yc1 had a 100 identity with otu27 fig s4 in the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene from yc1 and otu27 a 7 bps gap was found compared to the 16s rrna genes from other known anammox bacteria fig s4 in line with the finding in ca jettenia asiatica quan et al 2008 the 16s rrna intergenic spacer region and 23s rrna coding genes were arranged in a large rrna gene fragment in yc1 phylogenetic analyses of the full length 16s rrna genes fig 1a and 23s rrna genes fig s5c 43 concatenated markers fig s5a and hzsa sequences of anammox bacteria fig s6 confirmed the placement of yc1 in the phylum planctomycetes based on the phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene fig 1a and hzsa fig s6 yc1 had the closest phylogenetic relationship with ca anammoxoglobus the highest 16s rrna gene sequence identity between yc1 and known anammox bacteria was 92 79 with ca anammoxoglobus propionicus kc862502 1 fig 1b which is much lower than the minimum similarity cutoff demarcating the genus level 94 5 yarza et al 2014 aai between yc1 and non marine genera ca jettenia ca brocadia and ca kuenenia was 66 4 75 2 which is larger than the defined minimum genus demarcation using aai 60 80 konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 fig s5b yc1 had the lowest aai 60 with marine genus ca scalindua fig s5b however aai among the other three non marine genera ca jettenia ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were also larger than 60 fig s5b illustrating the minimum genus demarcation of aai for non marine anammox bacteria should be larger than 60 therefore we propose yc1 represents a new genus and have tentatively named it candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans description of candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans gen nov sp nov the genus name loosdrechtia latin substantive in nominative singular gender feminine is latinized from van loosdrecht in honor of mark van loosdrecht for his contribution to the field of anammox research the specific epithet aerotolerans compounded from l aer air and l tolerans tolerating treated as latin adjective in feminine nominative singular referring to the oxygen air tolerance of the niche of the species the analogous 16s rrna gene sequence of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could be detected in 831 rrna amplicon datasets indexed by imngs ilias et al 2016 with a 94 5 identity cutoff yarza et al 2014 and had considerable abundance 0 1 in 379 amplicon datasets it appeared to be widely distributed in freshwater sediment and soil ecosystems as well as in wastewater activated sludge and biofilm niches of wastewater treatment systems fig s7 3 2 central anammox catabolism of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans the production and oxidation of hydrazine are central for energy conservation in anammox bacteria kartal and keltjens 2016 the biochemically unique multiheme cytochrome c protein hydrazine synthase hzs produces hydrazine from nitric oxide and ammonium in a slow two step reaction mechanism with hydroxylamine as an enzyme bound intermediate dietl et al 2015 kartal et al 2011 hzs and its associated electron transfer module etm are conserved throughout the known anammox genera kartal et al 2011 in line with this observation hzs and its etm were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and were highly conserved figs s8a c and s9 it has been postulated that hzs receives electrons from a tetraheme c type cytochrome encoded by kuste2854 in k stuttgartiensis as a part of the etm ferousi et al 2019 the homolog of this protein in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 13910 shared a 73 sequence identity with kuste2854 and the four heme binding motifs including the naturally occurring contracted ckch heme binding motif were all conserved in e3k32 13910 fig s10 the amino acid sequences of the three catalytic subunits of hzs hzsabc from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans were also fully conserved and superimposable with those in k stuttgartiensis and shared highly similar catalytic sites in the α and γ subunits including the heme and zn2 binding sites as well as the specific hzsβ loop in the β subunit dietl et al 2015 figs s8a c s9 in line with previous findings the approximately two fold higher coverage of hzs gene than the whole genome fig s9 suggests that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also harbors two identical copies of hzs gene cluster frank et al 2018 speth et al 2015 yang et al 2018 as isolated hydrazine synthase is a relatively slow enzyme if turnover rate of this enzyme is also slow in the cellular environment encoding multiple copies might facilitate the increased levels of hzs protein in the cells in order to reach appreciable hydrazine production rates kartal et al 2013 all the three subunits of hzs coding genes were highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts figs 2 s13 illustrating ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans participated in nitrogen removal with high activity in the full scale biofilm system the oxidation of hydrazine to n2 results in highly energized low potential electrons which are used to establish a proton motive force for energy conservation and produce reducing equivalents needed for cellular anabolic activity in anammox bacteria hydrazine oxidation is carried out by a dedicated octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like protein hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh akram et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2016 the hdh homolog in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 09170 was highly conserved including the catalytic heme and the unusual heme binding motif cxxxxch figs s8d s11a hdh is severely inhibited by hydroxylamine which is suggested to leak out of hzs during hydrazine production akram et al 2021 dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 maalcke et al 2014 to prevent this inhibition anammox bacteria encode a dedicated hydroxylamine oxidizing protein hox that recycles hydroxylamine back to no fig 2 which can then be used by hzs kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans hox was also conserved e3k32 09155 with highly similar heme placements to hox kustc1061 of k stuttgartiensis figs s8e s11b like hzs the hdh and hox coding genes were all highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts indicating the central roles of these enzymes in anammox metabolism figs 2 s13 based on growth experiments with k stuttgartiensis using no and ammonium it has been suggested that the core anammox catabolic unit initially consisted of hzs and hdh and nitrite reduction nir and oxidation nxr pathways were acquired later in its evolutionary history hu et al 2019 indeed hzs and hdh are conserved throughout the known anammox bacteria whereas distinct anammox genera utilize different no generating nitrite reductases nir kartal and keltjens 2016 ca kuenenia and ca scalindua species encode cytochrome cd 1 nir nirs whereas ca jettenia species encode a copper containing nir nirk hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 fig 3 ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans contained a nirk but it was very lowly transcribed fig s13 the low transcript of nir gene in anammox bacteria has widely been reported bagchi et al 2016 kartal et al 2011 yang et al 2020c in striking contrast nirs is one of the most abundant proteins in ca scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 although not biochemically characterized based on physiological experiments as well as transcriptomic and proteomic analyses the hao like protein cluster kustc0458 kustc0457 was implicated in nitrite reduction to no in k stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 interestingly ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also encoded and highly transcribed a kustc0458 kustc0457 homolog figs s8f s14 which could fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no in this microorganism the electrons required for nitrite reduction to no are most likely derived from nitrite oxidation to nitrate catalyzed by nxr hu et al 2019 the highly complex nxr gene cluster identified in k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2013 was completely conserved in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans in a single gene cluster e3k32 04900 to e3k32 04970 including the e3k32 04960 e3k32 04945 and e3k32 04940 encoding nxra nxrb and nxrc respectively the transcriptions of these genes were detected albeit at lower amounts than hzs hdh and hox coding genes fig 2 table s8 3 3 dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reduction dnra has been observed in the enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria that could supply anammox bacteria with both nitrite and ammonium kartal et al 2007a in anammox bacteria the first step of dnra nitrate reduction to nitrite was proposed to be catalyzed by nxr operating in the reverse as nitrate reductase has not been observed in these microorganisms chicano et al 2021 kartal et al 2007a the close affiliation of the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans nxra with homologs from the other known terrestrial anammox bacteria was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis fig s15 indicating it could be used for nitrate reduction pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa which catalyzes the six electron reduction of nitrite into ammonium has been observed in ca brocadia ca jettenia and one ca scalindua species fig 3 the presence and transcription of nrfa coding genes fig 2 are consistent with the possible availability of dnra can be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of small organic acids in wastewater treatment systems kartal et al 2007b 2008 lawson et al 2021 tao et al 2019 interestingly in contrast to other anammox microorganisms a soluble ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase narb and its associated ferredoxin related to electron donation jepson et al 2004 were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans figs 4a s12 and had the similar sequencing depth with other genes in the same scaffold fig s16a the nitrate reductase is classified within assimilatory nitrate reductases had the highest amino acid identity 62 37 to narb from the planctomycete aquisphaera giovannonii wp 148594665 1 fig 4a narb is described as a soluble and monomeric enzyme which contains a 4fe 4s cluster and a mo bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor moco as its prosthetic groups rubio et al 2002 the conserved catalytic sites of the well studied narb caa52675 1 from synechococcus elongatus srivastava et al 2015 2013 including lys58 arg70 cys148 asp163 and arg351 were conserved in the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans narb figs 4b s16b the finding of narb in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans was unexpected because it has not yet been found in any other anammox bacteria fig 3 according to the close lineage between narb from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and other planctomycete strains fig 4a we propose that the ancestor of anammox bacteria should encode narb but it was lost by most of the known anammox bacteria in the long term evolution might be because of the dramatic changes in the habitat nevertheless the possibility that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans acquired the narb through horizontal gene transfer from another planctomycete organism cannot be excluded ferredoxin dependent narb has been characterized as a crucial enzyme for nitrate assimilatory purposes in diverse microorganisms by catalyzing the two electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite feng et al 2014 rubio et al 1996 wang et al 2011 although the in situ transcription of the genes encoding narb and its associated ferredoxin was not detected fig 2 ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could potentially use this as an additional pathway for nitrate reduction under nitrate replete conditions as using ferredoxin to produce auxiliary nitrite would be a huge energy waste that nitrate reduction catalyzed by narb may probably be restricted to ammonium limited conditions for assimilation purposes but gene coding for known assimilatory nitrite reductase was not found in the recovered part of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans possessing multiple routes for small organic acid utilization coupled with nitrate reduction to ammonium and the ability to use different nitrogen sources could be associated with the niche adaptability of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans 3 4 utilization of organic substrates in anammox bacteria nitrate reduction to ammonium via nitrite can be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of small organic acids kartal et al 2007b 2008 lawson et al 2021 tao et al 2019 in agreement with previous findings that at least three different acetyl coa synthetases acs were found in anammox bacterial genomes kartal et al 2007b 2008 four acss were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and transcription of three of them were detected fig 2 table s8 acs which catalyzes the ligation of acetate with coa for acetyl coa production has been implicated in acetate oxidation by anammox bacteria russ et al 2012 but the exact propionate oxidation pathway is still unclear nevertheless substrate specificity studies in different organisms demonstrated that propionate could also be used by acs with propionate coa production hele 1954 li et al 2011 sealy lewis 1994 additionally the propionate activation capability of an acs like protein kustc1128 found in k stuttgartiensis was demonstrated in a heterologous host russ et al 2012 the produced propionate coa could be further transformed to succinyl coa through an α carboxylation reaction and then to acetyl coa through the tca cycle fig 2 which is the pathway for propionate conversion in a syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacterium plugge et al 1993 all three genes encoding the α carboxylation pathway were encoded and two of them were transcribed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 table s8 the transcribed genes related to acetate and propionate oxidation suggesting that small organic acid oxidation was active in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans therefore we propose that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could use the available small organics in wastewater as electron donors for certain redox reactions such as nitrate nitrite assimilatory or oxygen elimination see below this capability would give ca loosdrechtia aerolerans a competitive advantage over other microorganisms in the dynamic wastewater treatment environments where substrate concentrations might fluctuate all known anammox bacteria have the genetic potential for acetate conversion but the homologs of the complete α carboxylation pathway for propionate transformation were identified only in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and three ca brocadia genomes fig 3 the capabilities and efficiencies of co oxidation of ammonium and acetate propionate likely determine the ecological niches of distinct anammox bacteria ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also encoded the genetic potential to replenish the intracellular carbon cycle using other extracellular organic compounds such as proteins peptides amino acids long chain fatty acids maltodextrin and c4 dicarboxylate and to store carbon and energy in the form of glycogen see the supplemental material utilization of other organic substrates and storage compound 3 5 diverse oxygen resistance strategies of anammox bacteria next to the utilization of alternative energy conservation pathways resistance and adaptability of anammox bacteria to changing environmental conditions plays an important role in the niche differentiation of these microorganisms kartal et al 2013 the reports from distinct anammox enrichment cultures suggest that anammox bacteria are most likely oxygen tolerant rather than strictly anaerobic oshiki et al 2016b nevertheless the underlying mechanism of oxygen tolerance and the activity of a protein used against oxygen toxicity has not been shown in anammox bacteria before like in many other microorganisms superoxide dismutase and catalase related to oxidative stress resistance were encoded and expressed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 and thus are well prepared for defense against reactive oxygen species ros interestingly the catalase coding gene was absent in some ca brocadia and ca jettenia strains suggesting that these microorganisms employ different oxygence defense systems fig 3 an additional bifunctional catalase peroxidase was uniquely encoded by ca scalindua strains fig 3 with both catalase catalyzes high concentration of h2o2 and peroxidase catalyzes low concentration of h2o2 activities hillar et al 2000 may confer a selective advantage to ca scalindua when facing frequent oxygen intrusions in the oxygen minimum zones of the ocean ulloa et al 2012 the absence of oxygen tolerance systems in ca scalindua rubra bsi 1 obtained from the anoxic deep sea speth et al 2017 would make sense fig 3 which are not necessary for the niche adaptability of anammox bacteria to the anoxic environment and would be additional energy consumption burdens in cell replication and growth under the oligotrophic environment unexpectedly ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans encoded a cota like multicopper oxidase mco with three specific copper binding sites figs 5a b s17 a signal peptide identified at the n terminal of its sequence indicates that the protein will not reside in the cytoplasm whether it is transported to the periplasm or the anammoxosome compartment remains to be determined the cota like protein had a high amino acid sequence identity with the oxygen utilizing laccases and bilirubin oxidases bod and it clustered into the bod group fig 5c d a detailed analysis revealed that putative bod like proteins were also found in four ca brocadia strains albeit with low sequence identities 40 with the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans bod figs 5a d s17 consequently bods from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 04160 ca brocadia caroliniensis oop56653 1 and ca brocadia sp amx2 rik02322 1 were selected for heterologous expression the bods expressed in e coli were further purified and displayed one major band in a denaturing sds polyacrylamide gel fig 5e the activities of the purified bods were determined towards bilirubin oxidation fig 5f in line with the suggested role of bods in oxygen resistance higher oxygen tolerances were previously observed in the two bod positive ca brocadia caroliniensis and ca brocadia fulgida compared to the two bod negative ca brocadia sinica and ca brocadia anammoxidans oshiki et al 2016b although the in situ transcription of gene encoding bod was not detected in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 the oxygen converting bod could be used as a protective protein involved in low potential electron carriers used by the anammox bacteria for example in the anammoxosome a survey of oxygen active proteins revealed the presence of a varying number of genes that could be involved in oxygen defense in anammox bacteria ca kuenenia and ca scalindua contain a terminal cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase fig 3 which is normally involved in aerobic respiration in line with this finding the transcriptions of terminal oxidases were detected previously in an anaerobic anammox bioreactor likely associated with protection against oxygen lawson et al 2017 richardson 2000 the cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase has a high affinity for oxygen hamada et al 2014 which might function as an oxygen detoxifying enzyme to protect anammox bacteria against oxygen intrusion in dynamic natural e g oxygen minimum zones in the ocean and engineered environments such as wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions and implications in the present study we described the discovery of a new anammox bacterium in the full scale biofilm landfill leachate treating bioreactor the nearly complete genome of the novel anammox bacterium tentatively named ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans was constructed by metagenomic analysis all the genes related to anammox core metabolism are conserved in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans as expected core genes essential for anaerobic ammonia oxidization were among the most highly transcribed genes reflecting a high nitrogen removal potential of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans in the full scale biofilm system the low transcribed nir gene indicates ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans might heavily rely on the hao like protein to fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no as previously obsevred in k stuttgartiensis ferousi et al 2019 furthermore its metabolic versatility related to its survival in unfavorable and fluctuating environmental parameters was investigated earlier observations and our findings show that anammox bacteria have a versatile lifestyle are able to utilize different substrates to survive in distinct dynamic environments furthermore these microorganisms are equipped with diverse strategies to protect themselves against changing environmental conditions such as oxygen fluctuations in both manmade and natural ecosystems where they remove ammonium from wastewater or contribute to the input of dinitrogen gas into our atmosphere overall the examined full scale anammox biofilm system provides an interesting case study of anammox based nitrogen removal the discovery of this new genus with high transcriptional activity and metabolic versatility advances our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity ecophysiology and niche adaptability of anammox bacteria in full scale wastewater treatment systems future research efforts might aim to exploit the enrichment strategy and unique physiological versatility of novel anammox

15361,in the past 20 years there has been a major stride in understanding the core mechanism of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria but there are still several discussion points on their survival strategies here we discovered a new genus of anammox bacteria in a full scale wastewater treating biofilm system tentatively named candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans next to genes of all core anammox metabolisms it encoded and transcribed genes involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which coupled to oxidation of small organic acids could be used to replenish ammonium and sustain their metabolism surprisingly it uniquely harbored a new ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase which has not yet been found in any other anammox genome and might confer a selective advantage to it in nitrate assimilation similar to many other microorganisms superoxide dismutase and catalase related to oxidative stress resistance were encoded and transcribed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans interestingly bilirubin oxidase bod likely involved in oxygen resistance of anammox bacteria under fluctuating oxygen concentrations was identified in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and four ca brocadia genomes and its activity was demonstrated using purified heterologously expressed proteins a following survey of oxygen active proteins in anammox bacteria revealed the presence of other previously undetected oxygen defense systems the novel cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase and bifunctional catalase peroxidase may confer a selective advantage to ca kuenenia and ca scalindua that face frequent changes in oxygen concentrations the discovery of this new genus significantly broadens our understanding of the ecophysiology of anammox bacteria furthermore the diverse oxygen tolerance strategies employed by distinct anammox bacteria advance our understanding of their niche adaptability and provide valuable insight for the operation of anammox based wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox new genus biofilm oxygen tolerance nitrate reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discovery of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox completely changed our understanding of the nitrogen cycle kuypers et al 2018 mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria are affiliated with a monophyletic group in the phylum planctomycetes strous et al 1999 and have been detected in many natural and engineered ecosystems where they facilitate the release of fixed nitrogen into the atmosphere after the initial discovery of the anammox process five candidate genera of anammox bacteria including ca scalindua kuypers et al 2003 ca kuenenia schmid et al 2000 2003 ca brocadia strous et al 1999 ca anammoxoglobus kartal et al 2007b and ca jettenia quan et al 2008 were consecutively identified environmental metagenomics combined with continuous cultivation approaches and biochemical experiments resulted in the description of the core anammox metabolism which can be described in three main catabolic reactions hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 reduction of nitrite no2 to nitric oxide no by nitrite reductase nir or an unidentified enzyme equation 1 transformation of ammonium nh4 and no to hydrazine n2h4 by hydrazine synthase hzs equation 2 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 oshiki et al 2016a and oxidation of n2h4 into dinitrogen gas n2 by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh equation 3 the electrons released from hydrazine oxidation are used to establish a proton motive force for energy conservation and produce reducing equivalents needed for cellular anabolic activity de almeida et al 2016 hu et al 2019 whereas hydroxylamine nh2oh was found to be the intermediate of anammox process in ca brocadia that an nh2oh dependent metabolism was proposed for some anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016a anammox bacteria were assumed to oxidize a part of their substrate nitrite to nitrate by a nitrite oxidoreductase nxr equation 4 to generate electrons for the reduction of nitrite to no equation 1 hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2013 whereas hzs hdh and nxr are conserved throughout the known anammox genera distinct anammox bacteria encode a cytochrome cd 1 type nir nirs a copper containing nir nirk or some alternative protein for nitrite reduction such as a multiheme hao like protein complex ferousi et al 2019 kartal and keltjens 2016 all of these catabolic reactions occur in the membrane bound prokaryotic organelle called the anammoxosome which comprises 50 70 of the cell volume de almeida et al 2015 1 no2 2h e no h2o e0 0 38 v 2 no nh4 2h 3e n2h4 h2o e0 0 06 v 3 n2h4 n2 4h 4e e0 0 75 v 4 no2 no3 2h 2e e0 0 42 v while there have been advances made in understanding the core metabolism of anammox bacteria there are still several discussion points on their physiological versatility and resistance to environmental factors including their alternative energy sources and oxygen defense systems anammox bacteria were assumed to have an exclusively chemolithotrophic lifestyle acquiring energy for growth solely from anaerobic nh4 oxidation but they have the genomic potential of using formate acetate propionate amino acid hydrogen and fe2 as electron donors to sustain their metabolism kartal et al 2013 lawson et al 2021 indeed using enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria their growth on anaerobic oxidation of short volatile fatty acids was demonstrated güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b 2008 tao et al 2019 distinct enrichments of anammox bacteria were reported to reduce no3 to produce additional ammonium as a substrate for their main metabolism by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra coupled with short volatile fatty acids oxidation ali et al 2020 güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007a winkler et al 2012 the known anammox bacteria appear to be oxygen sensitive and dissolved oxygen is an important parameter controlling anammox activity in manmade ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps cho et al 2020 kimura et al 2011 nevertheless varying levels of oxygen tolerances were observed in different enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016b but the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear and oxygen defense systems of anammox bacteria have not been characterized altogether these findings indicate greater ecophysiological flexibility of anammox bacteria and the presence of a specific niche for each distinct anammox genera or species in this study we present the discovery of a new anammox genus in a full scale wastewater treatment biofilm system treating landfill leachate using its metagenome assembled genome mag and metatranscriptomes we constructed a metabolic blueprint of this new anammox bacterium in addition a detailed analysis of the mag revealed a bilirubin oxidase an enzyme that could be used in oxygen resistance whose activity was validated using heterologously expressed proteins we discuss the central metabolism of this new genus and its ecophysiological versatility related to its adaptation to unfavorable and fluctuating environmental conditions furthermore the exploration of different oxygen defense mechanisms employed by distinct anammox bacteria advances our understanding of niche adaption and application of anammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and sequencing two separate biofilm samples were collected from the activated carbon modules of a landfill leachate treatment plant

could only be assigned to family brocadiaceae and could not be classified as any known genera the completeness and level of contamination of yc1 were estimated using checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 yc1

and discussion 3 1 identification of a new genus of anammox bacteria zentraldeponie emscherbruch zde wwtp was designed to treat landfill leachate the plant was designed to remove ammonium through a two stage process in which part of ammonium was oxidized to nitrite by the activated sludge system and the remaining ammonium and oxidized nitrite were then transferred to nitrogen gas by anammox in the activated carbon modules under anaerobic condition table s1 fig s1 biofilm samples were collected from the activated carbon modules of the plant in november 2017 and april 2018 for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing respectively in total 27 otus of brocadiales anammox bacteria were obtained from 16s rna gene amplicon sequencing and most of them were assigned to ca brocadia but only otu27 could not be assigned to any of the known anammox genera fig s2 shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of the biofilm produced 251 6 million

anammox bacteria fig s6 confirmed the placement of yc1 in the phylum planctomycetes based on the phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene fig 1a and hzsa fig s6 yc1 had the closest phylogenetic relationship with ca anammoxoglobus the highest 16s rrna gene sequence identity between yc1 and known anammox bacteria was 92 79 with ca anammoxoglobus propionicus kc862502 1 fig 1b which is much lower than the minimum similarity cutoff demarcating the genus level 94 5 yarza et al 2014 aai between yc1 and non marine genera ca jettenia ca brocadia and ca kuenenia was 66 4 75 2 which is larger than the defined minimum genus demarcation using aai 60 80 konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 fig s5b yc1 had the lowest aai 60 with marine genus ca scalindua fig s5b however aai among the other three non marine genera ca jettenia ca brocadia and ca kuenenia were also larger than 60 fig s5b illustrating the minimum genus demarcation of aai for non marine anammox bacteria should be larger than 60 therefore we propose yc1 represents a new genus and have tentatively named it candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans description of candidatus loosdrechtia aerotolerans gen nov sp nov the genus name loosdrechtia latin substantive in nominative singular gender feminine is latinized from van loosdrecht in honor of mark van loosdrecht for his contribution to the field of anammox research the specific epithet aerotolerans compounded from l aer air and l tolerans tolerating treated as latin adjective in feminine nominative singular referring to the oxygen air tolerance of the niche of the species the analogous 16s rrna gene sequence of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could be detected in 831 rrna amplicon datasets indexed by imngs ilias et al 2016 with a 94 5 identity cutoff yarza et al 2014 and had considerable abundance 0 1 in 379 amplicon datasets it appeared to be widely distributed in freshwater sediment and soil ecosystems as well as in wastewater activated sludge and biofilm niches of wastewater treatment systems fig s7 3 2 central anammox catabolism of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans the production and oxidation of hydrazine are central for energy conservation in anammox bacteria kartal and keltjens 2016 the biochemically unique multiheme cytochrome c protein hydrazine synthase hzs produces hydrazine from nitric oxide and ammonium in a slow two step reaction mechanism with hydroxylamine as an enzyme bound intermediate dietl et al 2015 kartal et al 2011 hzs and its associated electron transfer module etm are conserved throughout the known anammox genera kartal et al 2011 in line with this observation hzs and its etm were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and were highly conserved figs s8a c and s9 it has been postulated that hzs receives electrons from a tetraheme c type cytochrome encoded by kuste2854 in k stuttgartiensis as a part of the etm ferousi et al 2019 the homolog of this protein in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 13910 shared a 73 sequence identity with kuste2854 and the four heme binding motifs including the naturally occurring contracted ckch heme binding motif were all conserved in e3k32 13910 fig s10 the amino acid sequences of the three catalytic subunits of hzs hzsabc from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans were also fully conserved and superimposable with those in k stuttgartiensis and shared highly similar catalytic sites in the α and γ subunits including the heme and zn2 binding sites as well as the specific hzsβ loop in the β subunit dietl et al 2015 figs s8a c s9 in line with previous findings the approximately two fold higher coverage of hzs gene than the whole genome fig s9 suggests that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also harbors two identical copies of hzs gene cluster frank et al 2018 speth et al 2015 yang et al 2018 as isolated hydrazine synthase is a relatively slow enzyme if turnover rate of this enzyme is also slow in the cellular environment encoding multiple copies might facilitate the increased levels of hzs protein in the cells in order to reach appreciable hydrazine production rates kartal et al 2013 all the three subunits of hzs coding genes were highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts figs 2 s13 illustrating ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans participated in nitrogen removal with high activity in the full scale biofilm system the oxidation of hydrazine to n2 results in highly energized low potential electrons which are used to establish a proton motive force for energy conservation and produce reducing equivalents needed for cellular anabolic activity in anammox bacteria hydrazine oxidation is carried out by a dedicated octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like protein hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh akram et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2016 the hdh homolog in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 09170 was highly conserved including the catalytic heme and the unusual heme binding motif cxxxxch figs s8d s11a hdh is severely inhibited by hydroxylamine which is suggested to leak out of hzs during hydrazine production akram et al 2021 dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 maalcke et al 2014 to prevent this inhibition anammox bacteria encode a dedicated hydroxylamine oxidizing protein hox that recycles hydroxylamine back to no fig 2 which can then be used by hzs kartal et al 2011 maalcke et al 2014 in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans hox was also conserved e3k32 09155 with highly similar heme placements to hox kustc1061 of k stuttgartiensis figs s8e s11b like hzs the hdh and hox coding genes were all highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts indicating the central roles of these enzymes in anammox metabolism figs 2 s13 based on growth experiments with k stuttgartiensis using no and ammonium it has been suggested that the core anammox catabolic unit initially consisted of hzs and hdh and nitrite reduction nir and oxidation nxr pathways were acquired later in its evolutionary history hu et al 2019 indeed hzs and hdh are conserved throughout the known anammox bacteria whereas distinct anammox genera utilize different no generating nitrite reductases nir kartal and keltjens 2016 ca kuenenia and ca scalindua species encode cytochrome cd 1 nir nirs whereas ca jettenia species encode a copper containing nir nirk hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 fig 3 ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans contained a nirk but it was very lowly transcribed fig s13 the low transcript of nir gene in anammox bacteria has widely been reported bagchi et al 2016 kartal et al 2011 yang et al 2020c in striking contrast nirs is one of the most abundant proteins in ca scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 although not biochemically characterized based on physiological experiments as well as transcriptomic and proteomic analyses the hao like protein cluster kustc0458 kustc0457 was implicated in nitrite reduction to no in k stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 interestingly ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also encoded and highly transcribed a kustc0458 kustc0457 homolog figs s8f s14 which could fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no in this microorganism the electrons required for nitrite reduction to no are most likely derived from nitrite oxidation to nitrate catalyzed by nxr hu et al 2019 the highly complex nxr gene cluster identified in k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2013 was completely conserved in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans in a single gene cluster e3k32 04900 to e3k32 04970 including the e3k32 04960 e3k32 04945 and e3k32 04940 encoding nxra nxrb and nxrc respectively the transcriptions of these genes were detected albeit at lower amounts than hzs hdh and hox coding genes fig 2 table s8 3 3 dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reduction dnra has been observed in the enrichment cultures of anammox bacteria that could supply anammox bacteria with both nitrite and ammonium kartal et al 2007a in anammox bacteria the first step of dnra nitrate reduction to nitrite was proposed to be catalyzed by nxr operating in the reverse as nitrate reductase has not been observed in these microorganisms chicano et al 2021 kartal et al 2007a the close affiliation of the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans nxra with homologs from the other known terrestrial anammox bacteria was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis fig s15 indicating it could be used for nitrate reduction pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa which catalyzes the six electron reduction of nitrite into ammonium has been observed in ca brocadia ca jettenia and one ca scalindua species fig 3 the presence and transcription of nrfa coding genes fig 2 are consistent with the possible availability of dnra can be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of small organic acids in wastewater treatment systems kartal et al 2007b 2008 lawson et al 2021 tao et al 2019 interestingly in contrast to other anammox microorganisms a soluble ferredoxin dependent nitrate reductase narb and its associated ferredoxin related to electron donation jepson et al 2004 were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans figs 4a s12 and had the similar sequencing depth with other genes in the same scaffold fig s16a the nitrate reductase is classified within assimilatory nitrate reductases had the highest amino acid identity 62 37 to narb from the planctomycete aquisphaera giovannonii wp 148594665 1 fig 4a narb is described as a soluble and monomeric enzyme which contains a 4fe 4s cluster and a mo bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor moco as its prosthetic groups rubio et al 2002 the conserved catalytic sites of the well studied narb caa52675 1 from synechococcus elongatus srivastava et al 2015 2013 including lys58 arg70 cys148 asp163 and arg351 were conserved in the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans narb figs 4b s16b the finding of narb in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans was unexpected because it has not yet been found in any other anammox bacteria fig 3 according to the close lineage between narb from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and other planctomycete strains fig 4a we propose that the ancestor of anammox bacteria should encode narb but it was lost by most of the known anammox bacteria in the long term evolution might be because of the dramatic changes in the habitat nevertheless the possibility that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans acquired the narb through horizontal gene transfer from another planctomycete organism cannot be excluded ferredoxin dependent narb has been characterized as a crucial enzyme for nitrate assimilatory purposes in diverse microorganisms by catalyzing the two electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite feng et al 2014 rubio et al 1996 wang et al 2011 although the in situ transcription of the genes encoding narb and its associated ferredoxin was not detected fig 2 ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could potentially use this as an additional pathway for nitrate reduction under nitrate replete conditions as using ferredoxin to produce auxiliary nitrite would be a huge energy waste that nitrate reduction catalyzed by narb may probably be restricted to ammonium limited conditions for assimilation purposes but gene coding for known assimilatory nitrite reductase was not found in the recovered part of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans possessing multiple routes for small organic acid utilization coupled with nitrate reduction to ammonium and the ability to use different nitrogen sources could be associated with the niche adaptability of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans 3 4 utilization of organic substrates in anammox bacteria nitrate reduction to ammonium via nitrite can be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of small organic acids kartal et al 2007b 2008 lawson et al 2021 tao et al 2019 in agreement with previous findings that at least three different acetyl coa synthetases acs were found in anammox bacterial genomes kartal et al 2007b 2008 four acss were encoded by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and transcription of three of them were detected fig 2 table s8 acs which catalyzes the ligation of acetate with coa for acetyl coa production has been implicated in acetate oxidation by anammox bacteria russ et al 2012 but the exact propionate oxidation pathway is still unclear nevertheless substrate specificity studies in different organisms demonstrated that propionate could also be used by acs with propionate coa production hele 1954 li et al 2011 sealy lewis 1994 additionally the propionate activation capability of an acs like protein kustc1128 found in k stuttgartiensis was demonstrated in a heterologous host russ et al 2012 the produced propionate coa could be further transformed to succinyl coa through an α carboxylation reaction and then to acetyl coa through the tca cycle fig 2 which is the pathway for propionate conversion in a syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacterium plugge et al 1993 all three genes encoding the α carboxylation pathway were encoded and two of them were transcribed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 table s8 the transcribed genes related to acetate and propionate oxidation suggesting that small organic acid oxidation was active in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans therefore we propose that ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans could use the available small organics in wastewater as electron donors for certain redox reactions such as nitrate nitrite assimilatory or oxygen elimination see below this capability would give ca loosdrechtia aerolerans a competitive advantage over other microorganisms in the dynamic wastewater treatment environments where substrate concentrations might fluctuate all known anammox bacteria have the genetic potential for acetate conversion but the homologs of the complete α carboxylation pathway for propionate transformation were identified only in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans and three ca brocadia genomes fig 3 the capabilities and efficiencies of co oxidation of ammonium and acetate propionate likely determine the ecological niches of distinct anammox bacteria ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans also encoded the genetic potential to replenish the intracellular carbon cycle using other extracellular organic compounds such as proteins peptides amino acids long chain fatty acids maltodextrin and c4 dicarboxylate and to store carbon and energy in the form of glycogen see the supplemental material utilization of other organic substrates and storage compound 3 5 diverse oxygen resistance strategies of anammox bacteria next to the utilization of alternative energy conservation pathways resistance and adaptability of anammox bacteria to changing environmental conditions plays an important role in the niche differentiation of these microorganisms kartal et al 2013 the reports from distinct anammox enrichment cultures suggest that anammox bacteria are most likely oxygen tolerant rather than strictly anaerobic oshiki et al 2016b nevertheless the underlying mechanism of oxygen tolerance and the activity of a protein used against oxygen toxicity has not been shown in anammox bacteria before like in many other microorganisms superoxide dismutase and catalase related to oxidative stress resistance were encoded and expressed by ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 and thus are well prepared for defense against reactive oxygen species ros interestingly the catalase coding gene was absent in some ca brocadia and ca jettenia strains suggesting that these microorganisms employ different oxygence defense systems fig 3 an additional bifunctional catalase peroxidase was uniquely encoded by ca scalindua strains fig 3 with both catalase catalyzes high concentration of h2o2 and peroxidase catalyzes low concentration of h2o2 activities hillar et al 2000 may confer a selective advantage to ca scalindua when facing frequent oxygen intrusions in the oxygen minimum zones of the ocean ulloa et al 2012 the absence of oxygen tolerance systems in ca scalindua rubra bsi 1 obtained from the anoxic deep sea speth et al 2017 would make sense fig 3 which are not necessary for the niche adaptability of anammox bacteria to the anoxic environment and would be additional energy consumption burdens in cell replication and growth under the oligotrophic environment unexpectedly ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans encoded a cota like multicopper oxidase mco with three specific copper binding sites figs 5a b s17 a signal peptide identified at the n terminal of its sequence indicates that the protein will not reside in the cytoplasm whether it is transported to the periplasm or the anammoxosome compartment remains to be determined the cota like protein had a high amino acid sequence identity with the oxygen utilizing laccases and bilirubin oxidases bod and it clustered into the bod group fig 5c d a detailed analysis revealed that putative bod like proteins were also found in four ca brocadia strains albeit with low sequence identities 40 with the ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans bod figs 5a d s17 consequently bods from ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans e3k32 04160 ca brocadia caroliniensis oop56653 1 and ca brocadia sp amx2 rik02322 1 were selected for heterologous expression the bods expressed in e coli were further purified and displayed one major band in a denaturing sds polyacrylamide gel fig 5e the activities of the purified bods were determined towards bilirubin oxidation fig 5f in line with the suggested role of bods in oxygen resistance higher oxygen tolerances were previously observed in the two bod positive ca brocadia caroliniensis and ca brocadia fulgida compared to the two bod negative ca brocadia sinica and ca brocadia anammoxidans oshiki et al 2016b although the in situ transcription of gene encoding bod was not detected in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans fig 2 the oxygen converting bod could be used as a protective protein involved in low potential electron carriers used by the anammox bacteria for example in the anammoxosome a survey of oxygen active proteins revealed the presence of a varying number of genes that could be involved in oxygen defense in anammox bacteria ca kuenenia and ca scalindua contain a terminal cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase fig 3 which is normally involved in aerobic respiration in line with this finding the transcriptions of terminal oxidases were detected previously in an anaerobic anammox bioreactor likely associated with protection against oxygen lawson et al 2017 richardson 2000 the cbb3 type cytochrome c oxidase has a high affinity for oxygen hamada et al 2014 which might function as an oxygen detoxifying enzyme to protect anammox bacteria against oxygen intrusion in dynamic natural e g oxygen minimum zones in the ocean and engineered environments such as wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions and implications in the present study we described the discovery of a new anammox bacterium in the full scale biofilm landfill leachate treating bioreactor the nearly complete genome of the novel anammox bacterium tentatively named ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans was constructed by metagenomic analysis all the genes related to anammox core metabolism are conserved in ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans as expected core genes essential for anaerobic ammonia oxidization were among the most highly transcribed genes reflecting a high nitrogen removal potential of ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans in the full scale biofilm system the low transcribed nir gene indicates ca loosdrechtia aerotolerans might heavily rely on the hao like protein to fulfill the function of nitrite reduction to no as previously obsevred in k stuttgartiensis ferousi et al 2019 furthermore its metabolic versatility related to its survival in unfavorable and fluctuating environmental parameters was investigated earlier observations and our findings show that anammox bacteria have a versatile lifestyle are able to utilize different substrates to survive in distinct dynamic environments furthermore these microorganisms are equipped with diverse strategies to protect themselves against changing environmental conditions such as oxygen fluctuations in both manmade and natural ecosystems where they remove ammonium from wastewater or contribute to the input of dinitrogen gas into our atmosphere overall the examined full scale anammox biofilm system provides an interesting case study of anammox based nitrogen removal the discovery of this new genus with high transcriptional activity and metabolic versatility advances our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity ecophysiology and niche adaptability of anammox bacteria in full scale wastewater treatment systems future research efforts might aim to exploit the enrichment strategy and unique physiological versatility of novel anammox

15362,the combination of microbial fuel cells mfcs with constructed wetlands cws for enhancing water purification efficiency and generating bioelectricity has attracted extensive attention however the other benefits of mfc cws are seldom reported especially the potential for controlling gaseous emissions in this study we have quantitatively compared the pollutant removal efficiency and the emission of multiple gases between mfc cws and batch fed wetland systems bf cws mfc cws exhibited significantly p 0 01 higher cod nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiencies and significantly p 0 01 lower global warming potential gwp than bf cws the integration of mfc decreased gwp by 23 88 due to the reduction of ch4 and n2o fluxes whereas the co2 fluxes were slightly promoted the quantitative pcr results indicate that the reduced n2o fluxes in mfc cws were driven by the reduced transcription of the nosz gene and enhanced the ratio of nosz nirs nirk the reduced ch4 fluxes were related to poma and mcra additionally the nh3 fluxes were reduced by 52 20 in mfc cws compared to bf cws the integration of mfc promoted the diversity of microbial community especially anaerolineaceae saprospiraceae and clostridiacea this study highlights a further benefit of mfc cws and provides a new strategy for simultaneously removing pollutants and abating multiple gas emissions in bf cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cells constructed wetlands greenhouse gas emission ammonia volatilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws as a typical nature based solutions nbs have been globally applied for wastewater treatment for their simple operation economic competitiveness and ecological service functions xu et al 2020 however due to the regular influx of organics and nutrients cws can release considerable quantities of greenhouse gases ghgs and ammonia nh3 although different types of cws exhibited distinct ghgs emission characteristics for example subsurface flow ssf cws are reported to emit less methane ch4 than free water surface flow fws cws and the vertical subsurface flow vssf cws emit more nitrous oxide n2o than fws cws maucieri et al 2017 it is commonly agreed that cws emit more ghgs than natural wetlands and 2 10 times higher ghgs fluxes have been reported in cws than in natural wetlands maltais landry et al 2009 nh3 volatilization could take up to 44 of the total ammoniacal nitrogen removal in cws vanderzaag et al 2008 the emission of ghgs especially ch4 and n2o are increasing global warming while the excessive emission of nh3 impacts both the natural biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and human health as nh3 is responsible for the formation of haze erisman et al 2021 thus with the continuously increasing number and coverage of cws worldwide zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2019a the synchronous maximizing of pollutant removal efficiency and minimizing of ghg and nh3 emissions has become a paramount focus of cws previous studies mainly paid attention to the impact of design and operational conditions of cws e g wetland structure plant species and c n ratios etc on one or two but seldom three ghgs emissions chen et al 2020 luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a or nh3 volatilization zhang et al 2018a luo et al 2016 however the microbial mediated biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nitrogen in cws is complicated the regulation of one water and or gas parameter could impact many other parameters in other words there might be some synergistic effect or trade off among different parameters especially within these multiple gases based on mass balance rules therefore it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate these carbon related and nitrogen related gases when exploring any new water purification intensification and or gas reduction strategies microbial fuel cells mfcs utilize microorganisms as biocatalysts to degrade organics and generate bioelectricity via redox reactions occurring on the anodes and cathodes cws integrated with microbial fuel cells mfc cws have been recently developed and were proved to be efficient for improving various pollutants removal in cws wen et al 2022 yan et al 2021 however despite the attractiveness of mfc cws only two literature sources can be found regarding their ghg emissions one study focused on only ch4 emission zhang et al 2020 and the other evaluated three ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o but without an exploration of the internal mechanism and molecular drivers based on microbial and functional gene analysis wang et al 2019a overall the comprehensive effectiveness of mfc on both ghg emission and nh3 volatilization in cws remains blank and the mechanism of interaction between multiple water gas and microbial parameters and functional genes is unknown in order to investigate the above knowledge gaps we designed a comparative experiment to quantify the multiple parameters in mfc cws and batch fed wetland systems bf cws the specific objectives include 1 evaluate the nutrient and organic removal efficiency ghg i e co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and ammonia volatilization in mfc cws and bf cws 2 clarify the relationships among water and gas parameters microbial community and functional gene abundances thereby revealing the microbial and molecular drivers of ghg emissions and ammonia volatilization in different cws the results obtained will provide first hand information regarding the role of mfc in regulating ghg emissions and ammonia volatilization in cws as well as its internal mechanisms which is of great significance for the synchronous implementation of carbon reduction water purification and air pollution prevention 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup inoculation and operation the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse condition with the mean temperature and relative humidity of 24 28 c and 62 75 respectively six microcosm scale reactors made of polyethylene plastic with an internal diameter of 19 cm and height of 45 cm were constructed fig 1 there are four layers of each reactor i e bottom and middle layers which were both filled with 15 cm height of uniform quartz sand 6 7 mm in diameter and anode and cathode layers which were both filled with a mixture of granular activated carbon gac 3 5 mm in diameter ρ 0 167 g cm3 and activated sludge v v 5 1 with the height of 10 cm and 5 cm respectively the activated sludge was utilized as an inoculation source and was collected from southeast municipal wastewater treatment plant changchun china a stainless steel mesh was respectively embedded in the cathode and anode layers a 1000 ω external resistance was attached to the stainless steel meshes by a conducting wire which was formed by linking a copper wire 3 mm diameter with a titanium wire 2 mm diameter each reactor can store a total volume of 5 93 l water with a net volume of 1 4 l in the anode the quartz sand gac stainless steel

circuit mode referring to mfc cws group 2 open circuit mode referring to bf cws giant reed arundo donax was selected as wetland plant species as it is distributed in various regions and has been widely utilized in cws due to its excellent purification efficiency cheng et al 2021 three seedlings of a donax with the same size and height 30 cm were transplanted into the cathode layer of each reactor after a 35 day cultivation in 1 4 hoagland nutrient solution before the formal experiment 1 12 hoagland nutrient solution was fed to all the reactors from the inlet at the bottom of each reactor by a peristaltic pump in batch mode and was refreshed every 48 h until the voltage output maintained stable start up period mfc cws were operated in an intermittent intake pattern and the effluent in each reactor was emptied before supplying influent for the subsequent trial this operation lasted for 45 days in the formal experiment synthetic wastewater was prepared by c6h12o6 nh4cl

it is also available in our previous publications chen et al 2020 ghg samples were collected at 0 h 24 h and 48 h after supplying wastewater in each trial ghg samples were extracted by polyurethane syringes at 0 20 40 and 60 min after the enclosure and placed into the 100 ml vacuum sampling bags plasticgas delin company china the air temperature and atmospheric pressure inside the static chamber were monitored before and after gas extraction the device for nh3 collecting was basically the same as ghgs but without shading a detailed description and the nh3 volatilization flux rate calculation have been included in text s2 of supplementary materials the ammonia samples were collected after ghg samples starting at about 9 a m the time of ammonia collection was determined as 30 minutes according to vacuum pump flow rate and closed static chamber specifications after the collection the ammonia samples were taken back to the laboratory and the ph of the nh3 absorption solution concentration was adjusted to 6 7 by 0 01 mol of dilute sulfuric acid the ghgs were analyzed by gas chromatography gc 2010 plus shimadzu corporation japan equipped with an electron capture detector

salicylate sodium hypochlorite spectrophotometric method a regression model was used to calculate the ghg fluxes with the minimum deterministic coefficients of 0 8 olsson et al 2015 in order to quantify the role of gas emission in the removal of pollutants the ratios of n2o n emission to tn removal and nh3 n emission to tn removal were calculated following the methods described in previous

concentrations in bf cws were 5 18 mg l and 8 63 mg l respectively the values in mfc cws were 3 23 mg l and 4 21 mg l respectively which were all below the standard a first class quality in china as reported in discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18981 2002 the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies at hrt of 48 h were significantly p 0 01 increased by 10 41 10 70 and 9 71 10 89 after the integration of mfc the effluent no2 n concentrations increased from 1 h to 3 h after supplying wastewater and then generally decreased to below 0 1 mg l at 48 h after a fluctuation during 6 12 h fig 3b there was no significant difference in effluent no2 n concentrations between bf cws and mfc cws the effluent no3 n concentrations in both bf cws and mfc cws decreased

observed in effluent no3 n concentrations between bf cws and mfc cws the effluent tp concentrations in both bf cws and mfc cws decreased sharply after supplying wastewater and 70 of tp was removed at 1h in both bf cws and mfc cws fig 3e the average tp removal efficiency in bf cws at hrt of 48 h during the three trials was 87 64 while the value was 91 07 in mfc cws the integration of mfc significantly improved the tp removal efficiency of bf cws p 0 01 3 2 ghg emissions and ammonia volatilization 3 2 1 co2 emission the co2 emission fluxes increased over time after supplying wastewater during all the three trials in both bf cws and mfc cws fig 4 the co2 emission fluxes in mfc cws were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in bf cws at each respective monitoring time point the average cumulative co2 emission fluxes in bf cws for each trial was 663 98 8 14 mg m2 h while after the integration of mfc the average cumulative co2 emission fluxes for each trial was significantly p 0 05 increased to 808 36 8 95 mg m2 h 3 2 2 ch4 emission the ch4 emission fluxes were always positive and were slightly increased over time during all the three trials in both bf cws and mfc cws fig 5 therein the values ranged from 4 66 0 34 mg m2 h to 6 86 0 12 mg m2 h with the average of 5 56 0 10 mg m2 h in bf cws and ranged from 3 02 0 47 mg m2 h to 4 42 0 21 mg m2 h with the average of 3 69 0 27 mg m2 h in mfc cws the integration of mfc significantly p 0 05 reduced the average ch4 emission fluxes by 33 73 1 39 the average cumulative ch4 emission flux in bf cws for each trial was 16 66 0 88 mg m2 h while the value was significantly p 0 05 increased to 11 06 1 42 mg m2 h in mfc cws 3 2 3 n2o emission the greatest n2o emission fluxes were observed 24 h after supplying wastewater to both bf cws and mfc cws with the average values of 3 67 0 28 mg m2 h bf cws and 2 76 0 13 mg m2 h mfc cws respectively fig 6 although not statistically significant the n2o fluxes in mfc cws were always lower than those in bf cws the ratio of n2o n emitted tn removal in bf cws and mfc cws were 7 09 and 4 76 respectively indicating that the coupling of mfc with bf cws reduced the proportion of n2o emission in the total nitrogen removal overall the integration of mfc reduced 27 97 0 65 of the average n2o fluxes in bf cws 3 2 4 gwp the gwp in bf cws and mfc cws was calculated based on only the average values of ch4 and n2o fluxes following previous studies chen et al 2020 as illustrated in table 1 the gwp values in mfc cws were always lower than those in bf cws during the three trials the integration of mfc reduced 13 33 of gwp in bf cws with the mean values of 23 90 1 10 indicating the good potential of mfc for carbon reduction 3 2 5 ammonia volatilization the nh3 emission fluxes in both bf cws and mfc cws increased over time the values in bf cws reached 47 26 μg m2 d and 65 29 μg m2 d at 24 h and 48 h respectively after supplying wastewater while the corresponding values were 26 78 μg m2 d and 32 40 μg m2 d respectively in mfc cws fig 7 although not statistically significant the nh3 fluxes in mfc cws were lower than those of bf cws throughout the entire experiments and an average of 52 20 of the nh3 flux was reduced by the integration of mfc the ratio of nh3 n emitted tn removal in bf cws and mfc cws was 8 41 and 3 87 3 3 microbial community characteristics in bf cws and mfc cws a total of 300 252 effective sequence reads were obtained in bf cws and mfc cws according to biostatistics analysis the species coverage in both bf cws and mfc cws was above 99 indicating that the data were sufficient to reflect the microbial community distribution in bf cws and mfc cws the operational taxonomic units otus are an indicator of the artificial classification of microbial species which can be used to analyze the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the environment ebrahimi et al 2010 in this study the number of otus in bf cws 1092 33 15 78 was higher than mfc cws 1019 73 33 the chao 1 and ace index can indicate the community richness zhang et al 2015 the chao 1 index of bf cws and mfc cws were 1141 17 10 25 and 1129 46 41 13 the ace index of bf cws and mfc cws were 1129 46 12 16 and 1083 66 37 20 respectively compared with bf cws the species richness in the substrate of the anode electrode layer in mfc cws decreased significantly due to electron transfer shannon and simpson indices were commonly used to estimate the community diversity in samples classen et al 2007 the shannon index of the anode layer in bf cws 5 15 0 08 was higher than mfc cws 4 72 0 17 while the simpson index was higher in mfc cws 0 0250 0 0027 than bf cws 0 0388 0 0062 compared with bf cws the shannon index of mfc cws decreased and the simpson index increased indicating that the presence of mfc reduced the species diversity of bf cws fig 8 presents the microbial community composition in substrate of the anode layer in bf cws and mfc cws at phylum class and family levels chloroflexi 25 47 34 32 bacteroidetes 18 99 31 19 proteobacteria 14 81 22 81 planctomycetes 3 45 6 59 actinobacteria 1 45 8 59 and firmicutes 1 78 2 89 were the dominant phyla in both treatments fig 9 a the relative abundance of bacteroidetes planctomycetes proteobacteria and firmicutes in mfc cws were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in bf cws at class level fig 8b the dominant microorganisms mainly included anaerolineae 22 97 33 26 bacteroidia 15 73 29 53 betaproteobacteria 3 13 9 85 deltaproteobacteria 3 69 6 48 and alphaproteobacteria 3 11 4 00 in both bf cws and mfc cws the relative abundance of anaerolineae bacteroidia and deltaproteobacteria in mfc cws was substantially greater than those in bf cws at family level fig 8c anaerolineaceae was the most predominant family 36 27 47 22 followed by rhodobacteraceae 2 28 3 00 caldilineaceae 1 05 1 83 sinobacteraceae 1 04 1 19 saprospiraceae 1 26 1 48 porphyromonadaceae 1 00 1 22 chlorobiaceae 1 70 1 79 syntrophaceae 1 02 1 23 and planctomycetaceae 1 01 1 05 rhodobacteraceae caldilineaceae sinobacteraceae and saprospiraceae were significantly p 0 05 more abundant in bf cws than mfc cws 3 4 relative abundance of functional genes in bf cws and mfc cws the abundance of functional genes in bf cws and mfc cws are presented in fig 9 the pmoa and mcra genes are associated with the production of ch4 ji et al 2021 n2o is the by product of nitrification and its production is mainly regulated by the amoa gene nitrite reductase nir and nitrous oxide reductase nos wu et al 2020 the pmoa and the mcra genes can be used to explore the abundance of methanogenic bacteria ji et al 2021 the abundance of pmoa genes was significantly p 0 05 lower in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9a but the abundance of mcra genes was significantly p 0 05 higher in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9b additionally the genes associated with the cycling of nitrogen amoa nirs nirk and nosz were also significantly p 0 05 different in mfc cws and bf cws the abundance of amoa genes was significantly p 0 05 different between mfc cws and bf cws and was 4 87 times higher in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9c effluent nh4 n and tn concentrations were positively correlated with amoa gene abundance r 0 73 p 0 05 and r 0 69 p 0 05 respectively table 2 as the functional genes encoding no2 n reductase the relative abundance of the nirk nosz and nirs genes in bf cws were significantly p 0 05 higher than in mfc cws which decreased 1 87 times the abundance of nirk 3 35 times the abundance of nosz and 4 52 times the abundances of nirs fig 9d f in addition the ratio of nosz bacterial 16s rrna was significantly p 0 05 elevated by the coupling of mfc which was 3 32 times higher than in bf cws fig 9g in this study the ratio of nirk nirs in mfc cws 2 72 was significantly p 0 05 higher in nirk nirs than in bf cws 1 83 but the ratio of nosz nirs nirk 0 43 was significantly p 0 05 lower than in bf cws 0 57 fig 9h and i furthermore the n2o flux exhibited a negative correlation of 0 75 p 0 05 to the ratio of nosz nirs nirk table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of mfc integration on increasing pollutant removal as an indicator of the quality of the water column in mfc cws cod is a crucial reaction substrate for the microbial reduction process and the effluent cod concentration can also reflect the performance of mfc cws in terms of electricity production wang et al 2017 in this study mfc cws were effective in electricity generation see text s3 and fig s1 in supplemental material the cod removal efficiency in mfc cws was significantly p 0 01 higher than in bf cws because of a synergistic action between mfc and cws the removal of organic matter by mfc cws mainly occurs in the anode layer teoh et al 2022 therefore the substance samples were taken from the anode layer in this study and the microbial analysis showed that the abundance of betaproteobacteria in mfc cws was higher than that in bf cws fig 8b β proteobacteria belonging to betaproteobacteria is a multifunctional parthenogenic anaerobic bacteria which mainly relies on small molecules for growth and reproduction and causes more organic matter to be oxidized dai et al 2021 moreover plant root secretions in the cathode layer could also act directly as nutrients for microbial growth and metabolism further enhancing the biodegradation of pollutants timmers et al 2012 the higher co2 emissions in mfc cws fig 4 in this study may result in more plant root secretion as an increase in co2 within a certain range can reportedly cause the accumulation of higher amounts of organic matter by plants which can promote plant growth hungate et al 1997 additionally higher dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic cathodic layer in mfc cws can lead to the residual organic matter in the water being adequately metabolized by aerobic bacteria liu et al 2014 therefore it is inferred that the higher cod removal efficiency is caused by the combined effect of the oxidation of microorganisms in the anode layer and the aerobic bacteria in the cathode layer it is universally accepted that coupling mfc into cws could accelerate the enrichment and growth of electrochemical bacteria promoting nitrification and denitrification in cws lu et al 2015 in this study the abundance of both electrochemical bacteria e g proteobacteria and firmicutes and ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g planctomycetes in mfc cws were higher than in bf cws fig 8 which enhanced the nitrification reaction of microorganisms and resulted in significantly p 0 01 higher nh4 n removal efficiency in mfc cws planctomycetes could effectively degrade nutrients and organic pollutants in sewage wang et al 2021 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria belonging to planctomycetes could directly convert nh4 to n2 under anaerobic conditions by using no2 as an electron acceptor to achieve denitrogenation wang et al 2021 firmicutes and proteobacteria are the electrochemically active bacteria eab found in mfc dai et al 2021 proteobacteria could be activated by circuit pathways and enriched in mfc playing pivotal roles in the degradation of substrates and electricity generation obata et al 2020 the electricity generating microenvironment in mfc cws promoted the removal of nh4 n however nitrification led to more no3 n production which may be the reason for the higher effluent concentration of no3 n in mfc cws xu et al 2018a in this study the nitrogen of the synthetic wastewater was derived from nh4 n without any addition of no2 n or no3 n so the removal of no2 n and no3 n showed no significant difference between mfc cws and bf cws this is also the reason why the trend of tn removal was consistent with nh4 n in general although both systems exhibited promising nitrogen removal efficiency mfc cws outperformed bf cws tp is mainly removed by substrate adsorption plant absorption and microbial adsorption ebrahimi et al 2020 the direct comparison between bf cws and mfc cws established with the same substrate and plant species indicates that microbial adsorption was crucial for tp removal the electrogenic microenvironment in mfc cws provided favorable conditions for the growth and propagation of polyphosphoric bacteria e g gammaproteobacteria fig 8 which accelerated the tp removal in mfc cws xu et al 2018b 4 2 the retarding effect of mfc on gaseous emission 4 2 1 co2 emissions in this study the existence of mfc increased the co2 emission fluxes by 17 91 2 64 compared to bf cws this observation was similar to the result reported by wang et al 2019a who combined vssf cws with mfc microorganisms in mfc oxidized the organic matter in the anaerobic anode layer and produced co2 protons and electrons which increased the co2 emissions from mfc cws bian et al 2020 as shown in the pearson correlation analysis table 2 co2 fluxes had a significantly positive correlation with cod removal efficiency r 0 93 p 0 01 which was consistent with the observation that mfc cws exhibited higher cod removal efficiency than bf cws 4 2 2 ch4 emissions during the experimental period the ch4 emission fluxes ranged from 3 02 to 6 86 mg m2 h which were similar to ch4 fluxes measured by picek et al 2007 and liu 2009 in horizontal subsurface flow hssf cws with the values of 0 93 mg m2 h and 0 3 4 1 mg m2 h respectively the ch4 emission fluxes in mfc cws decreased by about 34 compared to bf cws indicating that the integration of mfc into cws might cause competition between electrogenic microorganisms and methanogens in consumption of organic matter ishii et al 2008 in this study the number of dominant electric producing bacteria e g bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes was more abundant in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9a these electrogenic microorganisms consumed more organic matter and consequently inhibited the activity of methanogens which reduced the ch4 emission fluxes moreover the dissolved oxygen in mfc cws is usually much higher than in bf cws leading to a slower rate of ch4 production zhao et al 2022 which might also partly explain the lower ch4 emission fluxes in mfc cws the analysis of functional genes in this study demonstrated that the mcra and pmoa genes were the primary pulse driver of ch4 production the mcra gene generally catalyzes the release of ch4 through the transformation process of methanogens while the pmoa gene utilizes ch4 as energy to oxidize ch4 to co2 yuan et al 2018 it is generally believed that the ch4 emission fluxes are positively correlated with the mcra gene abundance but negatively correlated with pmoa gene abundance zhang et al 2019 in this study the coupling of mfc and cws significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of mcra gene but significantly p 0 05 decreased the abundance of pmoa genes compared to bf cws fig 9b and c and the ch4 emission flux was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of mcra r 0 94 p 0 01 table 2 the high gene abundance values of mcra and pmoa typically imply a strong ch4 oxidation capacity and low ch4 emission flux zhang et al 2018b which could explain the inhibition of ch4 emissions by mfc arends also found that introducing mfc into wetland or soil allowed the electrogenic microorganisms to compete with methanogens for organic matter and reduced the ch4 emissions arends et al 2014 in summary embedding mfc into cws can effectively reduce the ch4 emissions from cws into the atmosphere 4 2 3 n2o emissions in this study mfc cws reduced n2o emission fluxes by 27 97 0 65 compared to bf cws and decreased the n2o n emitted tn removal ratio by 2 33 which was consistent with the study by pan et al 2014 n2o in wetlands was mainly produced by the denitrification processes lin et al 2019 the results of xing et al 2016 revealed that the presence of mfc provided electrons for the denitrification process during water treatment and no3 and no2 could be directly reduced to n2 using the electrons generated the electron producing microenvironment in mfc promoted the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter providing a sufficient carbon source for denitrifying bacteria e g rhodobacteraceae bacteroidetes wang et al 2019b which promoted the complete denitrification moreover microorganisms in mfc could use hydrogen and inorganic carbon as electron donors to complete autotrophic denitrification ebrahimi et al 2020 when evaluating the relationship between n2o related genes and n2o fluxes individually for each treatment n2o emission fluxes were positively correlated with nirs and nirk genes abundance r 0 95 p 0 01 and r 0 94 p 0 01 respectively table 2 indicating that nirs and nirk genes induce n2o emission the higher abundance of nirs and nirk genes in bf cws resulted in higher n2o emissions in bf cws compared to mfc cws the nosz gene determines whether n2o is converted to n2 or emitted to the atmosphere and is the key functional gene for achieving n2o reduction in denitrification xu et al 2020 the nosz gene can reduce n2o emissions and the ratio of nosz nirs nirk can also characterize the genetic capacity of wetlands to reduce n2o wu et al 2020 harter et al 2014 in this study the ratio of nosz nirs nirk in mfc cws was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in bf cws which was consistent with the lower n2o emission fluxes observed in mfc cws 4 2 4 nh3 emissions in this study the nh3 emission fluxes in mfc cws were decreased by 51 5 compared to bf cws nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are potentially chemoautotrophic bacteria and the currently known nobs include those from nitrospinae e g deltaproteobacteria nitrobacter e g alphaproteobacteria and nitrococcus e g gammaproteobacteria from strains obtained by culture isolation their abundance was correlated with the rate of nitrite oxidation sintes et al 2017 in this study the abundance of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria was lower in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 8 a possible explanation for the reduction in nh3 emissions in mfc cws could be that the reduction of nob inhibited the production of no3 which indirectly weakened the ammonification and then reduced nh3 volatilization zhu et al 2021 li et al 20200 luo s study found that high organic matter content or cation exchange capacity could reduce the generation of nh3 luo et al 2016 the electrochemical bacteria e g proteobacteria and firmicutes in mfc cws fig 8 might have enhanced the reactive ion exchange reaction and improved the adsorption capacity of the substrate to nh4 thus reducing nh4 concentration and inhibiting nh3 volatilization behera et al 2013 meanwhile the higher abundance of amoa gene in mfc cws could enhance the ammoxidation francis et al 2005 which reduced nh4 concentration and nh3 volatilization fig 9c the above findings are consistent with the positive correlation observed between effluent nh4 n concentrations and nh3 emission fluxes in this study r 0 84 p 0 05 table 2 additionally our study found a positive correlation between n2o emission fluxes and nh3 emission fluxes r 0 87 p 0 05 table 2 and the same conclusion was confirmed by venterea 2015 5 conclusion in this study mfc cws and bf cws were compared in terms of pollutant removal efficiency ghg emissions and nh3 volatilization mfc cws outperformed bf cws in maintaining high removal efficiency of water pollutants especially cod nh4 n tn and tp reducing the gwp and decreasing the nh3 volatilization the coupling of mfc reduced ch4 fluxes by 34 n2o fluxes by 28 and gwp by 24 while nh3 volatilization was reduced by 52 the electricity producing environment in mfc cws was suitable for the growth and reproduction of specific microorganisms which promoted the removal of cod tn and tp the reduced n2o fluxes in mfc cws were mainly due to the increase in the nosz nirs nirk ratio the decreased ch4 fluxes were associated with the changes in poma and mcra gene abundance and nh3 fluxes were positively correlated with effluent nh4 n concentrations and n2o fluxes overall this study highlights a new benefit of mfc cws and provides a new strategy for simultaneously obtaining high pollutant removal efficiency and reducing the emission of multiple gases in bf cws further studies on optimizing the electrode materials are recommended to achieve higher rates of reduction of gas

15362,the combination of microbial fuel cells mfcs with constructed wetlands cws for enhancing water purification efficiency and generating bioelectricity has attracted extensive attention however the other benefits of mfc cws are seldom reported especially the potential for controlling gaseous emissions in this study we have quantitatively compared the pollutant removal efficiency and the emission of multiple gases between mfc cws and batch fed wetland systems bf cws mfc cws exhibited significantly p 0 01 higher cod nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiencies and significantly p 0 01 lower global warming potential gwp than bf cws the integration of mfc decreased gwp by 23 88 due to the reduction of ch4 and n2o fluxes whereas the co2 fluxes were slightly promoted the quantitative pcr results indicate that the reduced n2o fluxes in mfc cws were driven by the reduced transcription of the nosz gene and enhanced the ratio of nosz nirs nirk the reduced ch4 fluxes were related to poma and mcra additionally the nh3 fluxes were reduced by 52 20 in mfc cws compared to bf cws the integration of mfc promoted the diversity of microbial community especially anaerolineaceae saprospiraceae and clostridiacea this study highlights a further benefit of mfc cws and provides a new strategy for simultaneously removing pollutants and abating multiple gas emissions in bf cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cells constructed wetlands greenhouse gas emission ammonia volatilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws as a typical nature based solutions nbs have been globally applied for wastewater treatment for their simple operation economic competitiveness and ecological service functions xu et al 2020 however due to the regular influx of organics and nutrients cws can release considerable quantities of greenhouse gases ghgs and ammonia nh3 although different types of cws exhibited distinct ghgs emission characteristics for example subsurface flow ssf cws are reported to emit less methane ch4 than free water surface flow fws cws and the vertical subsurface flow vssf cws emit more nitrous oxide n2o than fws cws maucieri et al 2017 it is commonly agreed that cws emit more ghgs than natural wetlands and 2 10 times higher ghgs fluxes have been reported in cws than in natural wetlands maltais landry et al 2009 nh3 volatilization could take up to 44 of the total ammoniacal nitrogen removal in cws vanderzaag et al 2008 the emission of ghgs especially ch4 and n2o are increasing global warming while the excessive emission of nh3 impacts both the natural biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and human health as nh3 is responsible for the formation of haze erisman et al 2021 thus with the continuously increasing number and coverage of cws worldwide zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2019a the synchronous maximizing of pollutant removal efficiency and minimizing of ghg and nh3 emissions has become a paramount focus of cws previous studies mainly paid attention to the impact of design and operational conditions of cws e g wetland structure plant species and c n ratios etc on one or two but seldom three ghgs emissions chen et al 2020 luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2019a or nh3 volatilization zhang et al 2018a luo et al 2016 however the microbial mediated biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nitrogen in cws is complicated the regulation of one water and or gas parameter could impact many other parameters in other words there might be some synergistic effect or trade off among different parameters especially within these multiple gases based on mass balance rules therefore it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate these carbon related and nitrogen related gases when exploring any new water purification intensification and or gas reduction strategies microbial fuel cells mfcs utilize microorganisms as biocatalysts to degrade organics and generate bioelectricity via redox reactions occurring on the anodes and cathodes cws integrated with microbial fuel cells mfc cws have been recently developed and were proved to be efficient for improving various pollutants removal in cws wen et al 2022 yan et al 2021 however despite the attractiveness of mfc cws only two literature sources can be found regarding their ghg emissions one study focused on only ch4 emission zhang et al 2020 and the other evaluated three ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o but without an exploration of the internal mechanism and molecular drivers based on microbial and functional gene analysis wang et al 2019a overall the comprehensive effectiveness of mfc on both ghg emission and nh3 volatilization in cws remains blank and the mechanism of interaction between multiple water gas and microbial parameters and functional genes is unknown in order to investigate the above knowledge gaps we designed a comparative experiment to quantify the multiple parameters in mfc cws and batch fed wetland systems bf cws the specific objectives include 1 evaluate the nutrient and organic removal efficiency ghg i e co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and ammonia volatilization in mfc cws and bf cws 2 clarify the relationships among water and gas parameters microbial community and functional gene abundances thereby revealing the microbial and molecular drivers of ghg emissions and ammonia volatilization in different cws the results obtained will provide first hand information regarding the role of mfc in regulating ghg emissions and ammonia volatilization in cws as well as its internal mechanisms which is of great significance for the synchronous implementation of carbon reduction water purification and air pollution prevention 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup inoculation and operation the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse condition with the mean temperature and relative humidity of 24 28 c and 62 75 respectively six microcosm scale reactors made of polyethylene plastic with an internal diameter of 19 cm and height of 45 cm were constructed fig 1 there are four layers of each reactor i e bottom and middle layers which were both filled with 15 cm height of uniform quartz sand 6 7 mm in diameter and anode and cathode layers which were both filled with a mixture of granular activated carbon gac 3 5 mm in diameter ρ 0 167 g cm3 and activated sludge v v 5 1 with the height of 10 cm and 5 cm respectively the activated sludge was utilized as an inoculation source and was collected from southeast municipal wastewater treatment plant changchun china a stainless steel mesh was respectively embedded in the cathode and anode layers a 1000 ω external resistance was attached to the stainless steel meshes by a conducting wire which was formed by linking a copper wire 3 mm diameter with a titanium wire 2 mm diameter each reactor can store a total volume of 5 93 l water with a net volume of 1 4 l in the anode the quartz sand gac stainless steel mesh copper and titanium wires were immersed in 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solution for removing metal ions and then rinsed three times with deionized water each reactor was equipped with a current collecting system including a current collector resistance box data acquisition module dam3057 rs485 and a laptop the sewage was injected into the bottom of mfc cws through a peristaltic pump huiyu bt100j 1a china a drainage tap for collecting effluents was installed at the top of each mfc cw and the sampling port for collecting gac samples was respectively set up at the height of 20 cm anode layer from the bottom of each mfc cw all reactors were coated with black plastic film for avoiding the interference from sunlight the six reactors were divided into two groups i e group1 closed circuit mode referring to mfc cws group 2 open circuit mode referring to bf cws giant reed arundo donax was selected as wetland plant species as it is distributed in various regions and has been widely utilized in cws due to its excellent purification efficiency cheng et al 2021 three seedlings of a donax with the same size and height 30 cm were transplanted into the cathode layer of each reactor after a 35 day cultivation in 1 4 hoagland nutrient solution before the formal experiment 1 12 hoagland nutrient solution was fed to all the reactors from the inlet at the bottom of each reactor by a peristaltic pump in batch mode and was refreshed every 48 h until the voltage output maintained stable start up period mfc cws were operated in an intermittent intake pattern and the

mg m2 h while the value was significantly p 0 05 increased to 11 06 1 42 mg m2 h in mfc cws 3 2 3 n2o emission the greatest n2o emission fluxes were observed 24 h after supplying wastewater to both bf cws and mfc cws with the average values of 3 67 0 28 mg m2 h bf cws and 2 76 0 13 mg m2 h mfc cws respectively fig 6 although not statistically significant the n2o fluxes in mfc cws were always lower than those in bf cws the ratio of n2o n emitted tn removal in bf cws and mfc cws were 7 09 and 4 76 respectively indicating that the coupling of mfc with bf cws reduced the proportion of n2o emission in the total nitrogen removal overall the integration of mfc reduced 27 97 0 65 of the average n2o fluxes in bf cws 3 2 4 gwp the gwp in bf cws and mfc cws was calculated based on only the average values of ch4 and n2o fluxes following previous studies chen et al 2020 as illustrated in table 1 the gwp values in mfc cws were always lower than those in bf cws during the three trials the integration of mfc reduced 13 33 of gwp in bf cws with the mean values of 23 90 1 10 indicating the good potential of mfc for carbon reduction 3 2 5 ammonia volatilization the nh3 emission fluxes in both bf cws and mfc cws increased over time the values in bf cws reached 47 26 μg m2 d and 65 29 μg m2 d at 24 h and 48 h respectively after supplying wastewater while the corresponding values were 26 78 μg m2 d and 32 40 μg m2 d respectively in mfc cws fig 7 although not statistically significant the nh3 fluxes in mfc cws were lower than those of bf cws throughout the entire experiments and an average of 52 20 of the nh3 flux was reduced by the integration of mfc the ratio of nh3 n emitted tn removal in bf cws and mfc cws was 8 41 and 3 87 3 3 microbial community characteristics in bf cws and mfc cws a total of 300 252 effective sequence reads were obtained in bf cws and mfc cws according to biostatistics analysis the species coverage in both bf cws and mfc cws was above 99 indicating that the data were sufficient to reflect the microbial community distribution in bf cws and mfc cws the operational taxonomic units otus are an indicator of the artificial classification of microbial species which can be used to analyze the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the environment ebrahimi et al 2010 in this study the number of otus in bf cws 1092 33 15 78 was higher than mfc cws 1019 73 33 the chao 1 and ace index can indicate the community richness zhang et al 2015 the chao 1 index of bf cws and mfc cws were 1141 17 10 25 and 1129 46 41 13 the ace index of bf cws and mfc cws were 1129 46 12 16 and 1083 66 37 20 respectively compared with bf cws the species richness in the substrate of the anode electrode layer in mfc cws decreased significantly due to electron transfer shannon and simpson indices were commonly used to estimate the community diversity in samples classen et al 2007 the shannon index of the anode layer in bf cws 5 15 0 08 was higher than mfc cws 4 72 0 17 while the simpson index was higher in mfc cws 0 0250 0 0027 than bf cws 0 0388 0 0062 compared with bf cws the shannon index of mfc cws decreased and the simpson index increased indicating that the presence of mfc reduced the species diversity of bf cws fig 8 presents the microbial community composition in substrate of the anode layer in bf cws and mfc cws at phylum class and family levels chloroflexi 25 47 34 32 bacteroidetes 18 99 31 19 proteobacteria 14 81 22 81 planctomycetes 3 45 6 59 actinobacteria 1 45 8 59 and firmicutes 1 78 2 89 were the dominant phyla in both treatments fig 9 a the relative abundance of bacteroidetes planctomycetes proteobacteria and firmicutes in mfc cws were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in bf cws at class level fig 8b the dominant microorganisms mainly included anaerolineae 22 97 33 26 bacteroidia 15 73 29 53 betaproteobacteria 3 13 9 85 deltaproteobacteria 3 69 6 48 and alphaproteobacteria 3 11 4 00 in both bf cws and mfc cws the relative abundance of anaerolineae bacteroidia and deltaproteobacteria in mfc cws was substantially greater than those in bf cws at family level fig 8c anaerolineaceae was the most predominant family 36 27 47 22 followed by rhodobacteraceae 2 28 3 00 caldilineaceae 1 05 1 83 sinobacteraceae 1 04 1 19 saprospiraceae 1 26 1 48 porphyromonadaceae 1 00 1 22 chlorobiaceae 1 70 1 79 syntrophaceae 1 02 1 23 and planctomycetaceae 1 01 1 05 rhodobacteraceae caldilineaceae sinobacteraceae and saprospiraceae were significantly p 0 05 more abundant in bf cws than mfc cws 3 4 relative abundance of functional genes in bf cws and mfc cws the abundance of functional genes in bf cws and mfc cws are presented in fig 9 the pmoa and mcra genes are associated with the production of ch4 ji et al 2021 n2o is the by product of nitrification and its production is mainly regulated by the amoa gene nitrite reductase nir and nitrous oxide reductase nos wu et al 2020 the pmoa and the mcra genes can be used to explore the abundance of methanogenic bacteria ji et al 2021 the abundance of pmoa genes was significantly p 0 05 lower in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9a but the abundance of mcra genes was significantly p 0 05 higher in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9b additionally the genes associated with the cycling of nitrogen amoa nirs nirk and nosz were also significantly p 0 05 different in mfc cws and bf cws the abundance of amoa genes was significantly p 0 05 different between mfc cws and bf cws and was 4 87 times higher in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9c effluent nh4 n and tn concentrations were positively correlated with amoa gene abundance r 0 73 p 0 05 and r 0 69 p 0 05 respectively table 2 as the functional genes encoding no2 n reductase the relative abundance of the nirk nosz and nirs genes in bf cws were significantly p 0 05 higher than in mfc cws which decreased 1 87 times the abundance of nirk 3 35 times the abundance of nosz and 4 52 times the abundances of nirs fig 9d f in addition the ratio of nosz bacterial 16s rrna was significantly p 0 05 elevated by the coupling of mfc which was 3 32 times higher than in bf cws fig 9g in this study the ratio of nirk nirs in mfc cws 2 72 was significantly p 0 05 higher in nirk nirs than in bf cws 1 83 but the ratio of nosz nirs nirk 0 43 was significantly p 0 05 lower than in bf cws 0 57 fig 9h and i furthermore the n2o flux exhibited a negative correlation of 0 75 p 0 05 to the ratio of nosz nirs nirk table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of mfc integration on increasing pollutant removal as an indicator of the quality of the water column in mfc cws cod is a crucial reaction substrate for the microbial reduction process and the effluent cod concentration can also reflect the performance of mfc cws in terms of electricity production wang et al 2017 in this study mfc cws were effective in electricity generation see text s3 and fig s1 in supplemental material the cod removal efficiency in mfc cws was significantly p 0 01 higher than in bf cws because of a synergistic action between mfc and cws the removal of organic matter by mfc cws mainly occurs in the anode layer teoh et al 2022 therefore the substance samples were taken from the anode layer in this study and the microbial analysis showed that the abundance of betaproteobacteria in mfc cws was higher than that in bf cws fig 8b β proteobacteria belonging to betaproteobacteria is a multifunctional parthenogenic anaerobic bacteria which mainly relies on small molecules for growth and reproduction and causes more organic matter to be oxidized dai et al 2021 moreover plant root secretions in the cathode layer could also act directly as nutrients for microbial growth and metabolism further enhancing the biodegradation of pollutants timmers et al 2012 the higher co2 emissions in mfc cws fig 4 in this study may result in more plant root secretion as an increase in co2 within a certain range can reportedly cause the accumulation of higher amounts of organic matter by plants which can promote plant growth hungate et al 1997 additionally higher dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic cathodic layer in mfc cws can lead to the residual organic matter in the water being adequately metabolized by aerobic bacteria liu et al 2014 therefore it is inferred that the higher cod removal efficiency is caused by the combined effect of the oxidation of microorganisms in the anode layer and the aerobic bacteria in the cathode layer it is universally accepted that coupling mfc into cws could accelerate the enrichment and growth of electrochemical bacteria promoting nitrification and denitrification in cws lu et al 2015 in this study the abundance of both electrochemical bacteria e g proteobacteria and firmicutes and ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g planctomycetes in mfc cws were higher than in bf cws fig 8 which enhanced the nitrification reaction of microorganisms and resulted in significantly p 0 01 higher nh4 n removal efficiency in mfc cws planctomycetes could effectively degrade nutrients and organic pollutants in sewage wang et al 2021 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria belonging to planctomycetes could directly convert nh4 to n2 under anaerobic conditions by using no2 as an electron acceptor to achieve denitrogenation wang et al 2021 firmicutes and proteobacteria are the electrochemically active bacteria eab found in mfc dai et al 2021 proteobacteria could be activated by circuit pathways and enriched in mfc playing pivotal roles in the degradation of substrates and electricity generation obata et al 2020 the electricity generating microenvironment in mfc cws promoted the removal of nh4 n however nitrification led to more no3 n production which may be the reason for the higher effluent concentration of no3 n in mfc cws xu et al 2018a in this study the nitrogen of the synthetic wastewater was derived from nh4 n without any addition of no2 n or no3 n so the removal of no2 n and no3 n showed no significant difference between mfc cws and bf cws this is also the reason why the trend of tn removal was consistent with nh4 n in general although both systems exhibited promising nitrogen removal efficiency mfc cws outperformed bf cws tp is mainly removed by substrate adsorption plant absorption and microbial adsorption ebrahimi et al 2020 the direct comparison between bf cws and mfc cws established with the same substrate and plant species indicates that microbial adsorption was crucial for tp removal the electrogenic microenvironment in mfc cws provided favorable conditions for the growth and propagation of polyphosphoric bacteria e g gammaproteobacteria fig 8 which accelerated the tp removal in mfc cws xu et al 2018b 4 2 the retarding effect of mfc on gaseous emission 4 2 1 co2 emissions in this study the existence of mfc increased the co2 emission fluxes by 17 91 2 64 compared to bf cws this observation was similar to the result reported by wang et al 2019a who combined vssf cws with mfc microorganisms in mfc oxidized the organic matter in the anaerobic anode layer and produced co2 protons and electrons which increased the co2 emissions from mfc cws bian et al 2020 as shown in the pearson correlation analysis table 2 co2 fluxes had a significantly positive correlation with cod removal efficiency r 0 93 p 0 01 which was consistent with the observation that mfc cws exhibited higher cod removal efficiency than bf cws 4 2 2 ch4 emissions during the experimental period the ch4 emission fluxes ranged from 3 02 to 6 86 mg m2 h which were similar to ch4 fluxes measured by picek et al 2007 and liu 2009 in horizontal subsurface flow hssf cws with the values of 0 93 mg m2 h and 0 3 4 1 mg m2 h respectively the ch4 emission fluxes in mfc cws decreased by about 34 compared to bf cws indicating that the integration of mfc into cws might cause competition between electrogenic microorganisms and methanogens in consumption of organic matter ishii et al 2008 in this study the number of dominant electric producing bacteria e g bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes was more abundant in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 9a these electrogenic microorganisms consumed more organic matter and consequently inhibited the activity of methanogens which reduced the ch4 emission fluxes moreover the dissolved oxygen in mfc cws is usually much higher than in bf cws leading to a slower rate of ch4 production zhao et al 2022 which might also partly explain the lower ch4 emission fluxes in mfc cws the analysis of functional genes in this study demonstrated that the mcra and pmoa genes were the primary pulse driver of ch4 production the mcra gene generally catalyzes the release of ch4 through the transformation process of methanogens while the pmoa gene utilizes ch4 as energy to oxidize ch4 to co2 yuan et al 2018 it is generally believed that the ch4 emission fluxes are positively correlated with the mcra gene abundance but negatively correlated with pmoa gene abundance zhang et al 2019 in this study the coupling of mfc and cws significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of mcra gene but significantly p 0 05 decreased the abundance of pmoa genes compared to bf cws fig 9b and c and the ch4 emission flux was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of mcra r 0 94 p 0 01 table 2 the high gene abundance values of mcra and pmoa typically imply a strong ch4 oxidation capacity and low ch4 emission flux zhang et al 2018b which could explain the inhibition of ch4 emissions by mfc arends also found that introducing mfc into wetland or soil allowed the electrogenic microorganisms to compete with methanogens for organic matter and reduced the ch4 emissions arends et al 2014 in summary embedding mfc into cws can effectively reduce the ch4 emissions from cws into the atmosphere 4 2 3 n2o emissions in this study mfc cws reduced n2o emission fluxes by 27 97 0 65 compared to bf cws and decreased the n2o n emitted tn removal ratio by 2 33 which was consistent with the study by pan et al 2014 n2o in wetlands was mainly produced by the denitrification processes lin et al 2019 the results of xing et al 2016 revealed that the presence of mfc provided electrons for the denitrification process during water treatment and no3 and no2 could be directly reduced to n2 using the electrons generated the electron producing microenvironment in mfc promoted the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter providing a sufficient carbon source for denitrifying bacteria e g rhodobacteraceae bacteroidetes wang et al 2019b which promoted the complete denitrification moreover microorganisms in mfc could use hydrogen and inorganic carbon as electron donors to complete autotrophic denitrification ebrahimi et al 2020 when evaluating the relationship between n2o related genes and n2o fluxes individually for each treatment n2o emission fluxes were positively correlated with nirs and nirk genes abundance r 0 95 p 0 01 and r 0 94 p 0 01 respectively table 2 indicating that nirs and nirk genes induce n2o emission the higher abundance of nirs and nirk genes in bf cws resulted in higher n2o emissions in bf cws compared to mfc cws the nosz gene determines whether n2o is converted to n2 or emitted to the atmosphere and is the key functional gene for achieving n2o reduction in denitrification xu et al 2020 the nosz gene can reduce n2o emissions and the ratio of nosz nirs nirk can also characterize the genetic capacity of wetlands to reduce n2o wu et al 2020 harter et al 2014 in this study the ratio of nosz nirs nirk in mfc cws was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in bf cws which was consistent with the lower n2o emission fluxes observed in mfc cws 4 2 4 nh3 emissions in this study the nh3 emission fluxes in mfc cws were decreased by 51 5 compared to bf cws nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are potentially chemoautotrophic bacteria and the currently known nobs include those from nitrospinae e g deltaproteobacteria nitrobacter e g alphaproteobacteria and nitrococcus e g gammaproteobacteria from strains obtained by culture isolation their abundance was correlated with the rate of nitrite oxidation sintes et al 2017 in this study the abundance of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria was lower in mfc cws than in bf cws fig 8 a possible explanation for the reduction in nh3 emissions in mfc cws could be that the reduction of nob inhibited the production of no3 which indirectly weakened the ammonification and then reduced nh3 volatilization zhu et al 2021 li et al 20200 luo s study found that high organic matter content or cation exchange capacity could reduce the generation of nh3 luo et al 2016 the electrochemical bacteria e g proteobacteria and firmicutes in mfc cws fig 8 might have enhanced the reactive ion exchange reaction and improved the adsorption capacity of the substrate to nh4 thus reducing nh4 concentration and inhibiting nh3 volatilization behera et al 2013 meanwhile the higher abundance of amoa gene in mfc cws could enhance the ammoxidation francis et al 2005 which reduced nh4 concentration and nh3 volatilization fig 9c the above findings are consistent with the positive correlation observed between effluent nh4 n concentrations and nh3 emission fluxes in this study r 0 84 p 0 05 table 2 additionally our study found a positive correlation between n2o emission fluxes and nh3 emission fluxes r 0 87 p 0 05 table 2 and the same conclusion was confirmed by venterea 2015 5 conclusion in this study mfc cws and bf cws were compared in terms of pollutant removal efficiency ghg emissions and nh3 volatilization mfc cws outperformed bf cws in maintaining high removal efficiency of water pollutants especially cod nh4 n tn and tp reducing the gwp and decreasing the nh3 volatilization the coupling of mfc reduced ch4 fluxes by 34 n2o fluxes by 28 and gwp by 24 while nh3 volatilization was reduced by 52 the electricity producing environment in mfc cws was suitable for the growth and reproduction of specific microorganisms which promoted the removal of cod tn and tp the reduced n2o fluxes in mfc cws were mainly due to the increase in the nosz nirs nirk ratio the decreased ch4 fluxes were associated with the changes in poma and mcra gene abundance and nh3 fluxes were positively correlated with effluent nh4 n concentrations and n2o fluxes overall this study highlights a new benefit of mfc cws and provides a new strategy for simultaneously obtaining high pollutant removal efficiency and reducing the emission of multiple gases in bf cws further studies on optimizing the electrode materials are recommended to achieve higher rates of reduction of gas

15363,to improve the performance of the conventional coagulation process a permanganate mn vii pre oxidation combined with fe iii peroxymonosulfate pms coagulation process mn vii fe iii pms that can significantly improve the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc turbidity and micropollutants is proposed in this study compared with conventional fe iii coagulation the mn vii fe iii pms process can also significantly enhance the removal of iohexol and sulfamethoxazole in raw water during this process the primary reduction product mn iv after mn vii pre oxidation was adsorbed on the floc surfaces and involved in the fe iii pms process the natural organic matter nom in raw water mediated the redox cycle of iron the synergistic effect of nom fe and mn facilitated the redox cycle of mn iii mn iv and fe iii fe ii to promote the activation of pms the sulfate radical so4 played an important role in the degradation of micropollutants the formation potential of the detected volatile disinfection by product dbp during the subsequent chlorination was reduced by 21 9 after the mn vii fe iii pms process this study demonstrated the promising application of the mn vii fe iii pms process for coagulation and micropollutant control and illustrated the reaction mechanism this study provides guidance for improving conventional drinking water treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords synergistic effect oxidation coagulation micropollutants peroxymonosulfate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with global shortages of water and serious environmental pollution ensuring drinking water safety is critical to public health emerging organic contaminants eocs with small molecular weights mws have been frequently detected in surface water and have attracted attention for their potential threats to ecosystems and human health westerhoff et al 2005 petrie et al 2015 during conventional drinking water treatment processes dwtps coagulation sedimentation and filtration raw water is treated to remove natural organic matter nom dissolved organic matter dom and colloidal particles studies have shown that nom with large mws can be easily removed by coagulation siddique et al 2022 su et al 2017 however eocs and nom with smaller mws cannot be effectively removed by conventional dwtps liu et al 2021 ren et al 2021 leading to adverse effects on drinking water safety therefore it is necessary to enhance the removal efficiency of these nom and eocs during drinking water treatment processes peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely utilized to eliminate various eocs due to the generation of strong oxidative free radicals lee et al 2020 yin et al 2021 ferrous fe ii is commonly used as an activator for pms to generate sulfate radicals so4 eq 1 cheng et al 2017 the generated ferric iron fe iii will then react with pms slowly to form fe ii and peroxymonosulfate radicals so5 with weak oxidation abilities eq 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 however the slow transformation efficiency of the formed fe iii back to fe ii limits the generation of so4 resulting in inhibited pollutant degradation dong et al 2021 to address this problem previous studies have found that the application of redox mediators such as natural polyphenols and quinones can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii to activate pms li et al 2022 wang et al 2019 however considering the safety of drinking water the addition of extra chemicals might cause secondary pollution 1 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh 2 fe iii hso5 fe ii so5 h it has been reported that nom in natural water contains numerous quinones and phenolic groups cory and mcknight 2005 during drinking water treatment fe iii salts are commonly used as coagulants to remove some nom and suspended solids due to the formation of larger flocs that can settle more efficiently davis and edwards 2017 previous studies have found that hydroquinone and quinones in nom are involved in the fe iii fe ii redox cycle uchimiya and stone 2006 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 also reported that the combination of fe iii and nom can effectively activate pms to remove micropollutants therefore considering that nom in natural waters might be involved in the redox cycle of iron the addition of pms to the fe iii coagulation process might facilitate pms activation to enhance the removal of pollutants however the mechanism of the fe iii pms coagulation process in raw water treatment and micropollutant control is complex and the roles of nom and fe iii require further exploration chemical oxidation processes have been applied in advance of conventional water treatment processes to remove contaminants in many drinking water treatment plants von gunten 2018 permanganate mn vii has been commonly used as a pre oxidant in water treatment due to its low cost stability and negligible formation of halogenated byproducts li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in addition mno2 as the reduction product can be removed by coagulation and sedimentation processes after mn vii pre oxidation in raw water a mixed solution that includes residual nom and mn species will inevitably be involved in the subsequent fe iii coagulation process previous studies have found that the fe and mn bimetallic systems have a synergistic effect in peroxide activation dong et al 2019 huang et al 2017 qiao et al 2021 however the mechanism of mn vii oxidation combined with the fe iii pms coagulation process mn vii fe iii pms for raw water treatment and micropollutant control has not been systematically investigated therefore it is necessary to explore the mechanism of nom iron coagulants and mn species the results will also assist in understanding and applying the mn vii fe iii pms process to improve the performance of conventional treatment processes in this study the performance and mechanisms of the mn vii fe iii pms process in raw water treatment and micropollutant control are investigated eocs including iohexol and sulfamethoxazole are selected as the target contaminants due to their potential presence in surface water and difficulty in removal using conventional treatment processes the performance of the mn vii fe iii pms process is investigated for the control of nom and micropollutants in raw water and a humic acid ha solution the synergistic mechanism in the mn vii fe iii pms process is then proposed the appropriate dosages of oxidants and coagulants for water treatment are also explored these results provide guidance for the application of the mn vii fe iii pms process for water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the iohexol ihx sulfamethoxazole smx

3 1 doc and micropollutant removal via different processes the removal of doc and turbidity via different processes pms alone fe iii alone and fe iii pms was investigated with or without mn vii pre oxidation as shown in fig 1 a without mn vii pre oxidation the doc removal efficiencies for the rw and ha solution by fe iii coagulation alone were only 6 7 and 38 7 respectively the doc removal efficiency for the ha solution by pms alone was approximately 6 3 which might have been due to the fact that ha can activate pms to enhance doc removal fang et al 2013 conventional fe iii coagulation has an unsatisfactory doc removal efficiency for rw due to its complex composition liu et al 2021 a previous study has shown that fe iii coagulation exhibited a better removal efficiency for ha due to the formation of polynuclear hydrolysis products with large flocs yue et al 2022 therefore the doc removal efficiency for the ha solution was higher than that for the rw in the fe iii pms process the doc removal efficiency for the rw and ha solution was 9 6 and 41 2 respectively during mn vii pre oxidation alone the removal rate of doc increased with an increase of mn vii concentration fig s1 however high concentration of mn vii can also cause color problems in drinking water therefore the dosage of mn vii was chosen to be 0 4 mg l for subsequent experiments after mn vii pre oxidation alone for 5 min the doc removal efficiency for the rw and ha solution was 3 4 and 7 1 respectively fig s2 in contrast the doc removal efficiency improved for both the rw and ha solution after mn vii pre oxidation combined with the different processes fig 1 a among these the mn vii fe iii pms process showed the best performance with the doc removal efficiency significantly increased to 22 9 and 54 8 for the rw and ha solution respectively the doc removal efficiency by the mn vii fe iii pms process was significantly higher than that by the mn vii alone and fe iii pms alone processes after mn vii pre oxidation the ph values of the rw and ha solution increased slightly to 7 76 and 7 69 respectively this may have been due to the reaction of mn vii to generate oh and mno2 under neutral or slightly alkaline conditions eq 3 cheng et al 2016 in addition the slight changes in the ph values had no effect on the doc removal efficiency by the fe iii pms process in both the rw and ha solution fig s3 therefore there should have been a synergistic effect in the mn vii fe iii pms process that led to its considerably improved performance 3 mno4 2h2o 3e mno2 4oh both the fe iii alone and fe iii pms processes effectively removed the turbidity in rw fig 1 b after the mn vii fe iii pms process the turbidity of rw was reduced from 27 4 ntu to 1 25 ntu since mno2 as a reduction product can be adsorbed on the particle surface through surface bonding the collision of particles in water and the volume of flocs were increased resulting in an increase in the turbidity removal efficiency xie et al 2016 the slight change in ph during fe iii coagulation can be attributed to the hydrolysis of fe iii ions eq 4 duan and gregory 2003 the slight changes in ph during the fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes may have been due to the acidity of pms due to the low dosage of pms the change in ph was relatively less in the fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes 4 fe iii 3h2o fe oh 3 3h changes in the particle surface charge are important for the coagulation process as shown in figs 1 b and s4 the zeta potential of the untreated rw was 19 2 mv the zeta potential of the particles in the mn vii pre oxidation fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms alone processes was 18 3 mv 17 4 mv and 14 9 mv respectively while in mn vii fe iii pms process can be increased to 13 2 mv mn vii pre oxidation can destroy the organic coating on the surface of particles and reduce the negativity to change the zeta potential which is also one of the important reasons for improving coagulation in addition the formed active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process might also attack the surface of colloidal particles and reduce electrostatic repulsion promoting the particle destabilization and aggregation to achieve a higher turbidity removal efficiency yang et al 2022 the removals of uv254 by the different processes are shown in fig s5 after mn vii oxidation the removal of uv254 in the rw was improved in each process after the mn vii fe iii pms process the uv254 decreased by 68 5 and 87 3 in the rw and ha solution respectively this was attributed to the fact that oxidants and or the formed radicals enhance dom removal and reduce its aromaticity hua et al 2019 in summary compared with conventional fe iii coagulation the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly improved all of the doc turbidity and uv254 removal the mw distribution of the rw after fe iii coagulation the fe iii pms and the mn vii fe iii pms processes was investigated as shown in fig 2 fractions i ii iii and iv are biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 300 500 da and low molecular weight substances 350 da respectively huber et al 2011 macromolecular substances such as biopolymers and humic substances in the rw can be effectively removed by the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes and this result was similar to that of a previous report diemert et al 2013 this can also explain the reason why the doc and uv254 removal efficiencies for the ha solution were significantly higher than that for the rw fig 1 a the mn vii fe iii pms and fe iii pms processes were slightly better than fe iii coagulation in removing macromolecules and low molecular weight substances this result may have been due to the generation of other active species that promote the degradation of low mw species discussed in section 3 2 3 2 mechanisms of the mn vii fe iii pms process conventional coagulation processes are often ineffective in removing low mw organics the abovementioned results demonstrated that the mn vii fe iii pms process had a certain removal efficiency for low mw substances to further explore the low mw pollutant degradation efficiency of the mn vii fe iii pms process smx and ihx both of which had low reactivity with mn vii and were difficult to remove by coagulation were selected as the target low mw pollutants to verify the application of the different processes as shown in figs 3 and s6 the ihx and smx removal efficiency in the rw and ha solution by fe iii coagulation alone was only 2 2 6 and 3 1 3 4 respectively this result might have been due to the limited low mw pollutant removal efficiency of conventional coagulation mn vii alone also showed a poor removal efficiency for both smx and ihx due to the low reactivity gao et al 2014 the ihx and smx removal efficiencies by the fe iii pms process for the rw and ha were only 8 3 11 1 and 10 2 13 3 respectively in contrast the ihx and smx removal efficiencies of the mn vii fe iii pms process for both the rw and ha solution were significantly improved to 28 9 33 8 and 31 8 43 respectively figs 3 and s6 this may have been due to the generation of so4 and ho and this was confirmed in the following quenching experiments the micropollutant degradation efficiency for the ha solution was slightly greater than that for the rw which may have been due to the complex matrix of rw that led to the consumption of active substances during the process liu et al 2021 to reveal the mechanism of the mn vii fe iii pms process the main active species were determined using quenching experiments meoh and tba were used as scavengers to evaluate the contribution of so4 and ho the reaction rate constants of meoh with so4 and ho are 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 respectively the reaction rate constant of tba with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that with so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 george and dionysios 2004 therefore meoh was used to quench so4 and ho and tba was used to quench ho as shown in figs 3 and s6 both meoh and tba had inhibitory effects on the degradation of micropollutants during the mn vii fe iii pms process in the rw and ha solution this indicated that both so4 and ho contributed to the removal of micropollutants the formation of ho is primarily through the reaction of so4 with h2o oh under neutral conditions eqs 5 6 as shown in fig s7 the removal of smx and ihx decreased significantly in both the rw and ha solution with an increase in the meoh concentration from 10 to 20 mm however as the concentration of tba increased from 10 to 20 mm the micropollutant degradation efficiency was not obviously inhibited the results indicated that so4 played an important role in the removal of micropollutants it was observed that ihx and smx still had a slight removal efficiency 10 after dosing with 20 mm meoh in the mn vii fe iii pms process the adsorption of coagulation flocs may also lead to the reduction of pollutants in addition it has been reported that the self decomposition of pms can slowly generate 1o2 eq 7 zhou et al 2015 and the presence of ho might also promote the generation of 1o2 eq 8 long et al 2022 ffa was used as a quencher to verify the contribution of 1o2 with a rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s8 ffa showed a minor effect on the degradation of ihx and smx indicating that 1o2 might be involved in the reaction but may not be the main active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process this result was similar to those of previous studies based on the fe pms coagulation process wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 overall so4 ho and 1o2 were involved in the removal of micropollutants and so4 was the main active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process previous studies have shown that activation of pms by fe iii cannot efficiently generate free radicals to remove pollutants wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 therefore it is speculated that there might have been a synergistic effect in the mn vii fe iii pms system that enhanced the activation of pms to generate more radicals and thus promoted the micropollutant removal efficiency 5 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h 6 so4 oh so4 2 ho 7 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 8 hso5 so5 2 ho e 2so4 2 h2o 1o2 to further explore the mechanism of the mn vii fe iii pms process xps was used to analyze the valence of fe and mn on the formed floc surfaces after the different reactions the xps spectra of the fe element in the formed flocs after the fe iii pms process are shown in fig s9 fe2p3 2 splits into two peaks at 710 7 ev and 711 9 ev and these are the characteristic peaks of fe ii and fe iii respectively wu et al 2020 indicating that fe ii and fe iii coexisted in the flocs after the fe iii pms process the ratios of fe iii fe ii in the rw and ha solution were 3 2 and 2 1 respectively it was found that a portion of fe iii was reduced to fe ii during the coagulation process in fact fe iii is stable in the environment and is difficult to be reduced to fe ii resulting in the inefficient activation of pms dong et al 2021 this might have been due to the fact that nom in the rw and ha solution is rich in quinones and phenolic groups that can partially reduce fe iii to fe ii during iron coagulation through electron transfer eq 9 garg et al 2015 to further confirm the role of nom the degradation of ihx and smx in pure water by fe iii pms coagulation was investigated under the same experimental conditions as shown in fig s10 the removal of smx and ihx in pure water was lower than that in rw and ha solution by fe iii pms coagulation the results demonstrated that nom involved in the fe iii pms process and promoted the redox cycle of iron in addition nom can also act as a ligand for fe iii to generate fe iii nom that can reduce the redox potential of fe iii fe ii eq 10 strathmann 2011 therefore the flocs primarily consisted of an fe ii and fe iii mixture after the fe iii pms process the formed fe ii could have also promoted the activation of pms to generate radicals eq 1 resulting in the removal of doc and micropollutants druing the fe iii pms process 9 fe iii nomred fe ii nomox 10 fe iii nom hso5 fe ii nom so5 h fe and mn elements were detected in the xps spectra of the formed flocs in the rw and ha solution after mn vii fe iii pms process as shown in figs 4 a and s11 a the fe elements in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process in the rw and ha solution were mainly fe iii and fe ii with ratios of 1 7 and 1 5 respectively compared with the fe iii pms process the content of fe ii in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly increased the increase in fe ii enhanced the activation of pms to generate so4 to further explore the mechanism in the mn vii fe iii pms process the xps spectra of the mn elements in the flocs were further analyzed as shown in figs 4 b and s11 b the peaks of mn2p3 2 in the floc were fitted using the binding peaks of mn iii and mn iv at 641 2 ev and 642 5 ev respectively tang et al 2014 the ratios of mn iv mn iii in the rw and ha solution were 1 9 and 1 6 respectively in fact after the mn vii pre oxidation the formed mn iv is a relatively stable product while mn iii is an unstable manganese intermediate and is easily disproportionated to mn iv and mn ii li et al 2021 it was found that there were mixed valence fe and mn elements on the floc surface after the mn vii fe iii pms process in addition compared with the fe iii pms process the content of fe ii in the floc after the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly increased these results demonstrated that there was a synergistic effect between fe mn and nom in the system that promoted the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iv mn iii to enhance pms activation it has been reported that mn iv on the floc surface can react with pms to form mn iii eq 11 and then the formed mn iii can continue to react with pms to form mn iv mn ii and so4 eqs 12 13 huang et al 2017 the formed mn ii can also react with pms to form mn iii eq 14 therefore mn iii and mn iv can be detected in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process moreover studies have shown that the presence of fe iii can promote the establishment of iron manganese redox pairs and the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by mn ii is thermodynamically favorable eq 15 fronaeus et al 1998 yao et al 2014 therefore after the mn vii fe iii pms process the fe ii content in the flocs was higher than that in the fe iii pms process fig 4 the synergistic effect of nom fe and mn can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv resulting in the formed flocs with mixed valences of fe and mn after the mn vii fe iii pms process the formed fe ii and mn iii can promote the activation of pms to generate so4 eqs 1 and 12 resulting in considerably improved performance for the removal of micropollutants during the mn vii fe iii pms process 11 mn iv hso5 mn iii so5 h 12 mn iii hso5 mn iv so4 oh 13 mn iii hso5 mn ii so5 h 14 mn ii hso5 mn iii so4 oh 15 mn ii fe iii mn iii fe ii in summary the primary mechanisms of micropollutant degradation during the mn vii fe iii pms process are proposed in scheme 1 after mn vii pre oxidation the primary reduction product mno2 can be adsorbed on the surface of the coagulated flocs through surface bonding during the mn vii fe iii pms process the nom in rw can partially reduce fe iii in flocs to fe ii moreover nom can also complex with fe iii to reduce the redox potential of fe iii fe ii and the formed fe iii nom is more likely to react with pms to form fe ii nom the increase in fe ii can promote the activation of pms to generate so4 in addition mn iv on the floc surface can react with pms to form mn iii and so5 eq 11 additionally the formed mn iii can activate pms to generate so4 and mn iv or react with pms to generate mn ii and so5 eqs 12 13 mn ii can continue to activate pms to generate mn iii and so4 eq 14 or react with fe iii to generate fe ii and mn iii eq 15 the synergistic effect between nom fe and mn can promote fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv cycling to enhance the activation of pms to generate more radicals therefore the mn vii fe iii pms process can improve the micropollutant removal 3 3 dbp formation in the different processes to further explore the application of the process the formation potential of volatile dbps during the sequential chlorination after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes was studied as shown in fig 5 compared with the conventional fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process achieved better performance in controlling dbp formation in both the rw and ha solution compared with fe iii coagulation the formation potential of the detected dbps reduced by 21 9 and 28 6 in the rw and ha solution respectively after the mn vii fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process inhibited the formation of trihalomethanes thms more effectively than the conventional fe iii coagulation process the formation of thms was reduced by 22 9 and 47 6 in the rw and ha solution respectively the control of dbps in the ha solution by the different processes was better than that in the rw and this may have been due to the higher doc removal in the ha solution fig 1 a in addition previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans are more toxic than the regulated dbps muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 however conventional coagulation has unsatisfactory efficiency in controlling highly toxic n dbps zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this study fe iii coagulation alone also had a poor control efficiency for the formation of the detected hans including dcan and tcan fig 5 after the mn vii fe iii pms process the formation of the detected dcan was significantly reduced and the dcan associated cti values were also reduced by 38 4 and 79 5 in the rw and ha solution respectively fig s12 there was only little variation in the concentration of trichloroacetaldehyde tcal in the rw and ha solution after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes it has been reported that phenolic structures in natural water may serve as the important precursors for haloacetaldehydes chuang et al 2015 therefore some tcal precursors might still remain in the treated water toxicity assessment of post chlorination after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes were performed using the cho cell viability index as shown in fig s13 compared with fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process has a weaker effect on the cho cell viability in the rw and ha solution this result was similar to the trend of cti values fig s12 in addition it can be found that the cho cell viability is about 90 in the rw and ha after different processes indicating that the processes used in this study have no significant toxicity to cho cell the fluorescence eem spectra of the rw and ha solution after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes were analyzed to characterize the variation in the dom properties as shown in figs 6 and s14 rw has aromatic protein like peaks regions i and ii and soluble microbial byproduct like peaks region iv and the ha solution has a strong ha like peak region v chen et al 2003 due to the more protein like substances contained in rw it has a higher n dbp formation potential than the ha solution the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes effectively removed ha like substances in the ha solution fig s14 this result can also explain the phenomenon that both the doc and dbps in the ha solution were effectively controlled 3 4 exploration of suitable oxidation and coagulation conditions for water treatment to effectively apply the mn vii fe iii pms process the appropriate dosages of oxidants and coagulants for water treatment were explored as shown in fig 7 the doc removal efficiency increased with an increase in the mn vii and pms concentrations at an fe iii dosage of 80 μm when the dosage of mn vii was greater than 0 2 mg l the doc removal rate of the fe iii pms process increased significantly and this might have been due to an insufficient dosage of the mn vii oxidant at low concentrations that was completely consumed by the organic matter in the rw as the mn vii concentration increased the residual mn species would participate in the coagulation process and have a synergistic effect with iron when the ratio of fe iii to pms increased to 1 0 625 the doc and turbidity removal efficiency for the rw also increased compared with fe iii 80 μm the doc removal efficiencies were improved under different concentrations of mn vii and pms when the dosage of fe iii reached 100 μm fig s15 this may have been because the dosage of coagulant increased and more flocs were produced these ratios of coagulants and oxidants achieved a higher utilization and promoted doc removal the doc and turbidity removal efficiency increased slightly when the pms concentration was increased further fe iii pms 1 0 75 this may have been attributed to the fact that an increasing oxidant concentration can also lead to the consumption of active species in the system eq 16 guan et al 2011 however the turbidity control efficiency was weakened when the fe iii dosage reached 100 μm this may have been due to the more flocs produced and the longer settling time required it is also possible that an increase in the amount of fe ii reduced by fe iii resulted in an increased turbidity in the solution in addition excess mn vii would also cause color problems in the water the formation potential of the detected dbps after chlorination with different oxidant and coagulant dosages is shown in fig s16 without mn vii pre oxidation the addition of different concentrations of pms in the fe iii coagulation had little effect on the formation potential of the detected dbps in the rw this may have been attributed to the limited doc removal rate higher dosages of mn vii and pms could have reduced the formation potential of the detected dbps among them the inhibitory effect on the formation of trichloromethane tcm was better than that on the formation of tcal considering that an excessive dosage of chemicals in the drinking water treatment process is unfavorable the recommended dosage of mn vii was determined to be 0 4 0 6 mg l and that of fe iii was 80 μm the ratio of fe iii pms was 1 0 5 1 0 625 for future application and these parameters could achieve satisfactory oxidation and coagulation efficacy 16 so4 hso5 so5 hso4 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that mn vii oxidation combined with the fe iii pms coagulation process improve the treatment efficiency for raw water and micropollutant compared with the conventional fe iii coagulation process the mn vii fe iii pms process effectively improved the doc turbidity uv254 and micropollutant such as smx and ihx removal efficiency for rw during the mn vii fe iii pms process the synergistic effect between nom fe and mn can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv to accelerate the activation of pms so4 played a major role in the removal of pollutants compared with fe iii coagulation the mn vii fe iii pms process reduced the formation potential of dcan in the rw and ha solution after chlorination increasing the dosages of mn vii fe iii and pms improved the removal of doc from the rw for the application in drinking water treatment the dosages of mn vii 0 4 0 6 mg l fe iii 80 μm and the ratio of fe iii pms 1 0 5 1 0 625 are optional this study demonstrated that the mn vii fe iii pms process is a promising process for enhancing the efficiency of drinking water treatment considering the complexity of the water matrix future studies should explore the effects and mechanisms of the different

that nom with large mws can be easily removed by coagulation siddique et al 2022 su et al 2017 however eocs and nom with smaller mws cannot be effectively removed by conventional dwtps liu et al 2021 ren et al 2021 leading to adverse effects on drinking water safety therefore it is necessary to enhance the removal efficiency of these nom and eocs during drinking water treatment processes peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely utilized to eliminate various eocs due to the generation of strong oxidative free radicals lee et al 2020 yin et al 2021 ferrous fe ii is commonly used as an activator for pms to generate sulfate radicals so4 eq 1 cheng et al 2017 the generated ferric iron fe iii will then react with pms slowly to form fe ii and peroxymonosulfate radicals so5 with weak oxidation abilities eq 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 however the slow transformation efficiency of the formed fe iii back to fe ii limits the generation of so4 resulting in inhibited pollutant degradation dong et al 2021 to address this problem previous studies have found that the application of redox mediators such as natural polyphenols and quinones can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii to activate pms li et al 2022 wang et al 2019 however considering the safety of drinking water the addition of extra chemicals might cause secondary pollution 1 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh 2 fe iii hso5 fe ii so5 h it has been reported that nom in natural water contains numerous quinones and phenolic groups cory and mcknight 2005 during drinking water treatment fe iii salts are commonly used as coagulants to remove some nom and suspended solids due to the formation of larger flocs that can settle more efficiently davis and edwards 2017 previous studies have found that hydroquinone and quinones in nom are involved in the fe iii fe ii redox cycle uchimiya and stone 2006 jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 also reported that the combination of fe iii and nom can effectively activate pms to remove micropollutants therefore considering that nom in natural waters might be involved in the redox cycle of iron the addition of pms to the fe iii coagulation process might facilitate pms activation to enhance the removal of pollutants however the mechanism of the fe iii pms coagulation process in raw water treatment and micropollutant control is complex and the roles of nom and fe iii require further exploration chemical oxidation processes have been applied in advance of conventional water treatment processes to remove contaminants in many drinking water treatment plants von gunten 2018 permanganate mn vii has been commonly used as a pre oxidant in water treatment due to its low cost stability and negligible formation of halogenated byproducts li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in addition mno2 as the reduction product can be removed by coagulation and sedimentation processes after mn vii pre oxidation in raw water a mixed solution that includes residual nom and mn species will inevitably be involved in the subsequent fe iii coagulation process previous studies have found that the fe and mn bimetallic systems have a synergistic effect in peroxide activation dong et al 2019 huang et al 2017 qiao et al 2021 however the mechanism of mn vii oxidation combined with the fe iii pms coagulation process mn vii fe iii pms for raw water treatment and micropollutant control has not been systematically investigated therefore it is necessary to explore the mechanism of nom iron coagulants and mn species the results will also assist in understanding and applying the mn vii fe iii pms process to improve the performance of conventional treatment processes in this study the performance and mechanisms of the mn vii fe iii pms process in raw water treatment and micropollutant control are investigated eocs including iohexol and sulfamethoxazole are selected as the target contaminants due to their potential presence in surface water and difficulty in removal using conventional treatment processes the performance of the mn vii fe iii pms process is investigated for the control of nom and micropollutants in raw water and a humic acid ha solution the synergistic mechanism in the mn vii fe iii pms process is then proposed the appropriate dosages of oxidants and coagulants for water treatment are also explored these results provide guidance for the application of the mn vii fe iii pms process for water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the iohexol ihx sulfamethoxazole smx

the dosage of mn vii and the pre oxidation time were set at 0 4 mg l and 5 min respectively according to the results of the preliminary experimental values a six place electric stirrer zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china was utilized for the different processes fe iii fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms both the rw and ha solution were treated using mn vii pre oxidation

3 1 doc and micropollutant removal via different processes the removal of doc and turbidity via different processes pms alone fe iii alone and fe iii pms was investigated with or without mn vii pre oxidation as shown in fig 1 a without mn vii pre oxidation the doc removal efficiencies for the rw and ha solution by fe iii coagulation alone were only 6 7 and 38 7 respectively the doc removal efficiency for the ha solution by pms alone was approximately 6 3 which might have been due to the fact that ha can activate pms to enhance doc removal fang et al 2013 conventional fe iii coagulation has an unsatisfactory doc removal efficiency for rw due to its complex composition liu et al 2021 a previous study has shown that fe iii coagulation exhibited a better removal efficiency for ha due to the formation of polynuclear hydrolysis products with large flocs yue et al 2022 therefore the doc removal efficiency for the ha solution was higher than that for the rw in the fe iii pms process the doc removal efficiency for the rw and ha solution was 9 6 and 41 2 respectively during mn vii pre oxidation alone the removal rate of doc increased with an increase of mn vii concentration fig s1 however high concentration of mn vii can also cause color problems in drinking water therefore the dosage of mn vii was chosen to be 0 4 mg l for subsequent experiments after mn vii pre oxidation alone for 5 min the doc removal efficiency for the rw and ha solution was 3 4 and 7 1 respectively fig s2 in contrast the doc removal efficiency improved for both the rw and ha solution after mn vii pre oxidation combined with the different processes fig 1 a among these the mn vii fe iii pms process showed the best performance with the doc removal efficiency significantly increased to 22 9 and 54 8 for the rw and ha solution respectively the doc removal efficiency by the mn vii fe iii pms process was significantly higher than that by the mn vii alone and fe iii pms alone processes after mn vii pre oxidation the ph values of the rw and ha solution increased slightly to 7 76 and 7 69 respectively this may have been due to the reaction of mn vii to generate oh and mno2 under neutral or slightly alkaline conditions eq 3 cheng et al 2016 in addition the slight changes in the ph values had no effect on the doc removal efficiency by the fe iii pms process in both the rw and ha solution fig s3 therefore there should have been a synergistic effect in the mn vii fe iii pms process that led to its considerably improved performance 3 mno4 2h2o 3e mno2 4oh both the fe iii alone and fe iii pms processes effectively removed the turbidity in rw fig 1 b after the mn vii fe iii pms process the turbidity of rw was reduced from 27 4 ntu to 1 25 ntu since mno2 as a reduction product can be adsorbed on the particle surface through surface bonding the collision of particles in water and the volume of flocs were increased resulting in an increase in the turbidity removal efficiency xie et al 2016 the slight change in ph during fe iii coagulation can be attributed to the hydrolysis of fe iii ions eq 4 duan and gregory 2003 the slight changes in ph during the fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes may have been due to the acidity of pms due to the low dosage of pms the change in ph was relatively less in the fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes 4 fe iii 3h2o fe oh 3 3h changes in the particle surface charge are important for the coagulation process as shown in figs 1 b and s4 the zeta potential of the untreated rw was 19 2 mv the zeta potential of the particles in the mn vii pre oxidation fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms alone processes was 18 3 mv 17 4 mv and 14 9 mv respectively while in mn vii fe iii pms process can be increased to 13 2 mv mn vii pre oxidation can destroy the organic coating on the surface of particles and reduce the negativity to change the zeta potential which is also one of the important reasons for improving coagulation in addition the formed active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process might also attack the surface of colloidal particles and reduce electrostatic repulsion promoting the particle destabilization and aggregation to achieve a higher turbidity removal efficiency yang et al 2022 the removals of uv254 by the different processes are shown in fig s5 after mn vii oxidation the removal of uv254 in the rw was improved in each process after the mn vii fe iii pms process the uv254 decreased by 68 5 and 87 3 in the rw and ha solution respectively this was attributed to the fact that oxidants and or the formed radicals enhance dom removal and reduce its aromaticity hua et al 2019 in summary compared with conventional fe iii coagulation the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly improved all of the doc turbidity and uv254 removal the mw distribution of the rw after fe iii coagulation the fe iii pms and the mn vii fe iii pms processes was investigated as shown in fig 2 fractions i ii iii and iv are biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 300 500 da and low molecular weight substances 350 da respectively huber et al 2011 macromolecular substances such as biopolymers and humic substances in the rw can be effectively removed by the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes and this result was similar to that of a previous report diemert et al 2013 this can also explain the reason why the doc and uv254 removal efficiencies for the ha solution were significantly higher than that for the rw fig 1 a the mn vii fe iii pms and fe iii pms processes were slightly better than fe iii coagulation in removing macromolecules and low molecular weight substances this result may have been due to the generation of other active species that promote the degradation of low mw species discussed in section 3 2 3 2 mechanisms of the mn vii fe iii pms process conventional coagulation processes are often ineffective in removing low mw organics the abovementioned results demonstrated that the mn vii fe iii pms process had a certain removal efficiency for low mw substances to further explore the low mw pollutant degradation efficiency of the mn vii fe iii pms process smx and ihx both of which had low reactivity with mn vii and were difficult to remove by coagulation were selected as the target low mw pollutants to verify the application of the different processes as shown in figs 3 and s6 the ihx and smx removal efficiency in the rw and ha solution by fe iii coagulation alone was only 2 2 6 and 3 1 3 4 respectively this result might have been due to the limited low mw pollutant removal efficiency of conventional coagulation mn vii alone also showed a poor removal efficiency for both smx and ihx due to the low reactivity gao et al 2014 the ihx and smx removal efficiencies by the fe iii pms process for the rw and ha were only 8 3 11 1 and 10 2 13 3 respectively in contrast the ihx and smx removal efficiencies of the mn vii fe iii pms process for both the rw and ha solution were significantly improved to 28 9 33 8 and 31 8 43 respectively figs 3 and s6 this may have been due to the generation of so4 and ho and this was confirmed in the following quenching experiments the micropollutant degradation efficiency for the ha solution was slightly greater than that for the rw which may have been due to the complex matrix of rw that led to the consumption of active substances during the process liu et al 2021 to reveal the mechanism of the mn vii fe iii pms process the main active species were determined using quenching experiments meoh and tba were used as scavengers to evaluate the contribution of so4 and ho the reaction rate constants of meoh with so4 and ho are 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 respectively the reaction rate constant of tba with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that with so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 george and dionysios 2004 therefore meoh was used to quench so4 and ho and tba was used to quench ho as shown in figs 3 and s6 both meoh and tba had inhibitory effects on the degradation of micropollutants during the mn vii fe iii pms process in the rw and ha solution this indicated that both so4 and ho contributed to the removal of micropollutants the formation of ho is primarily through the reaction of so4 with h2o oh under neutral conditions eqs 5 6 as shown in fig s7 the removal of smx and ihx decreased significantly in both the rw and ha solution with an increase in the meoh concentration from 10 to 20 mm however as the concentration of tba increased from 10 to 20 mm the micropollutant degradation efficiency was not obviously inhibited the results indicated that so4 played an important role in the removal of micropollutants it was observed that ihx and smx still had a slight removal efficiency 10 after dosing with 20 mm meoh in the mn vii fe iii pms process the adsorption of coagulation flocs may also lead to the reduction of pollutants in addition it has been reported that the self decomposition of pms can slowly generate 1o2 eq 7 zhou et al 2015 and the presence of ho might also promote the generation of 1o2 eq 8 long et al 2022 ffa was used as a quencher to verify the contribution of 1o2 with a rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s8 ffa showed a minor effect on the degradation of ihx and smx indicating that 1o2 might be involved in the reaction but may not be the main active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process this result was similar to those of previous studies based on the fe pms coagulation process wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 overall so4 ho and 1o2 were involved in the removal of micropollutants and so4 was the main active species in the mn vii fe iii pms process previous studies have shown that activation of pms by fe iii cannot efficiently generate free radicals to remove pollutants wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 therefore it is speculated that there might have been a synergistic effect in the mn vii fe iii pms system that enhanced the activation of pms to generate more radicals and thus promoted the micropollutant removal efficiency 5 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h 6 so4 oh so4 2 ho 7 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 8 hso5 so5 2 ho e 2so4 2 h2o 1o2 to further explore the mechanism of the mn vii fe iii pms process xps was used to analyze the valence of fe and mn on the formed floc surfaces after the different reactions the xps spectra of the fe element in the formed flocs after the fe iii pms process are shown in fig s9 fe2p3 2 splits into two peaks at 710 7 ev and 711 9 ev and these are the characteristic peaks of fe ii and fe iii respectively wu et al 2020 indicating that fe ii and fe iii coexisted in the flocs after the fe iii pms process the ratios of fe iii fe ii in the rw and ha solution were 3 2 and 2 1 respectively it was found that a portion of fe iii was reduced to fe ii during the coagulation process in fact fe iii is stable in the environment and is difficult to be reduced to fe ii resulting in the inefficient activation of pms dong et al 2021 this might have been due to the fact that nom in the rw and ha solution is rich in quinones and phenolic groups that can partially reduce fe iii to fe ii during iron coagulation through electron transfer eq 9 garg et al 2015 to further confirm the role of nom the degradation of ihx and smx in pure water by fe iii pms coagulation was investigated under the same experimental conditions as shown in fig s10 the removal of smx and ihx in pure water was lower than that in rw and ha solution by fe iii pms coagulation the results demonstrated that nom involved in the fe iii pms process and promoted the redox cycle of iron in addition nom can also act as a ligand for fe iii to generate fe iii nom that can reduce the redox potential of fe iii fe ii eq 10 strathmann 2011 therefore the flocs primarily consisted of an fe ii and fe iii mixture after the fe iii pms process the formed fe ii could have also promoted the activation of pms to generate radicals eq 1 resulting in the removal of doc and micropollutants druing the fe iii pms process 9 fe iii nomred fe ii nomox 10 fe iii nom hso5 fe ii nom so5 h fe and mn elements were detected in the xps spectra of the formed flocs in the rw and ha solution after mn vii fe iii pms process as shown in figs 4 a and s11 a the fe elements in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process in the rw and ha solution were mainly fe iii and fe ii with ratios of 1 7 and 1 5 respectively compared with the fe iii pms process the content of fe ii in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly increased the increase in fe ii enhanced the activation of pms to generate so4 to further explore the mechanism in the mn vii fe iii pms process the xps spectra of the mn elements in the flocs were further analyzed as shown in figs 4 b and s11 b the peaks of mn2p3 2 in the floc were fitted using the binding peaks of mn iii and mn iv at 641 2 ev and 642 5 ev respectively tang et al 2014 the ratios of mn iv mn iii in the rw and ha solution were 1 9 and 1 6 respectively in fact after the mn vii pre oxidation the formed mn iv is a relatively stable product while mn iii is an unstable manganese intermediate and is easily disproportionated to mn iv and mn ii li et al 2021 it was found that there were mixed valence fe and mn elements on the floc surface after the mn vii fe iii pms process in addition compared with the fe iii pms process the content of fe ii in the floc after the mn vii fe iii pms process significantly increased these results demonstrated that there was a synergistic effect between fe mn and nom in the system that promoted the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iv mn iii to enhance pms activation it has been reported that mn iv on the floc surface can react with pms to form mn iii eq 11 and then the formed mn iii can continue to react with pms to form mn iv mn ii and so4 eqs 12 13 huang et al 2017 the formed mn ii can also react with pms to form mn iii eq 14 therefore mn iii and mn iv can be detected in the flocs after the mn vii fe iii pms process moreover studies have shown that the presence of fe iii can promote the establishment of iron manganese redox pairs and the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by mn ii is thermodynamically favorable eq 15 fronaeus et al 1998 yao et al 2014 therefore after the mn vii fe iii pms process the fe ii content in the flocs was higher than that in the fe iii pms process fig 4 the synergistic effect of nom fe and mn can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv resulting in the formed flocs with mixed valences of fe and mn after the mn vii fe iii pms process the formed fe ii and mn iii can promote the activation of pms to generate so4 eqs 1 and 12 resulting in considerably improved performance for the removal of micropollutants during the mn vii fe iii pms process 11 mn iv hso5 mn iii so5 h 12 mn iii hso5 mn iv so4 oh 13 mn iii hso5 mn ii so5 h 14 mn ii hso5 mn iii so4 oh 15 mn ii fe iii mn iii fe ii in summary the primary mechanisms of micropollutant degradation during the mn vii fe iii pms process are proposed in scheme 1 after mn vii pre oxidation the primary reduction product mno2 can be adsorbed on the surface of the coagulated flocs through surface bonding during the mn vii fe iii pms process the nom in rw can partially reduce fe iii in flocs to fe ii moreover nom can also complex with fe iii to reduce the redox potential of fe iii fe ii and the formed fe iii nom is more likely to react with pms to form fe ii nom the increase in fe ii can promote the activation of pms to generate so4 in addition mn iv on the floc surface can react with pms to form mn iii and so5 eq 11 additionally the formed mn iii can activate pms to generate so4 and mn iv or react with pms to generate mn ii and so5 eqs 12 13 mn ii can continue to activate pms to generate mn iii and so4 eq 14 or react with fe iii to generate fe ii and mn iii eq 15 the synergistic effect between nom fe and mn can promote fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv cycling to enhance the activation of pms to generate more radicals therefore the mn vii fe iii pms process can improve the micropollutant removal 3 3 dbp formation in the different processes to further explore the application of the process the formation potential of volatile dbps during the sequential chlorination after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes was studied as shown in fig 5 compared with the conventional fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process achieved better performance in controlling dbp formation in both the rw and ha solution compared with fe iii coagulation the formation potential of the detected dbps reduced by 21 9 and 28 6 in the rw and ha solution respectively after the mn vii fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process inhibited the formation of trihalomethanes thms more effectively than the conventional fe iii coagulation process the formation of thms was reduced by 22 9 and 47 6 in the rw and ha solution respectively the control of dbps in the ha solution by the different processes was better than that in the rw and this may have been due to the higher doc removal in the ha solution fig 1 a in addition previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans are more toxic than the regulated dbps muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 however conventional coagulation has unsatisfactory efficiency in controlling highly toxic n dbps zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this study fe iii coagulation alone also had a poor control efficiency for the formation of the detected hans including dcan and tcan fig 5 after the mn vii fe iii pms process the formation of the detected dcan was significantly reduced and the dcan associated cti values were also reduced by 38 4 and 79 5 in the rw and ha solution respectively fig s12 there was only little variation in the concentration of trichloroacetaldehyde tcal in the rw and ha solution after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes it has been reported that phenolic structures in natural water may serve as the important precursors for haloacetaldehydes chuang et al 2015 therefore some tcal precursors might still remain in the treated water toxicity assessment of post chlorination after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes were performed using the cho cell viability index as shown in fig s13 compared with fe iii coagulation and fe iii pms process the mn vii fe iii pms process has a weaker effect on the cho cell viability in the rw and ha solution this result was similar to the trend of cti values fig s12 in addition it can be found that the cho cell viability is about 90 in the rw and ha after different processes indicating that the processes used in this study have no significant toxicity to cho cell the fluorescence eem spectra of the rw and ha solution after the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes were analyzed to characterize the variation in the dom properties as shown in figs 6 and s14 rw has aromatic protein like peaks regions i and ii and soluble microbial byproduct like peaks region iv and the ha solution has a strong ha like peak region v chen et al 2003 due to the more protein like substances contained in rw it has a higher n dbp formation potential than the ha solution the fe iii coagulation fe iii pms and mn vii fe iii pms processes effectively removed ha like substances in the ha solution fig s14 this result can also explain the phenomenon that both the doc and dbps in the ha solution were effectively controlled 3 4 exploration of suitable oxidation and coagulation conditions for water treatment to effectively apply the mn vii fe iii pms process the appropriate dosages of oxidants and coagulants for water treatment were explored as shown in fig 7 the doc removal efficiency increased with an increase in the mn vii and pms concentrations at an fe iii dosage of 80 μm when the dosage of mn vii was greater than 0 2 mg l the doc removal rate of the fe iii pms process increased significantly and this might have been due to an insufficient dosage of the mn vii oxidant at low concentrations that was completely consumed by the organic matter in the rw as the mn vii concentration increased the residual mn species would participate in the coagulation process and have a synergistic effect with iron when the ratio of fe iii to pms increased to 1 0 625 the doc and turbidity removal efficiency for the rw also increased compared with fe iii 80 μm the doc removal efficiencies were improved under different concentrations of mn vii and pms when the dosage of fe iii reached 100 μm fig s15 this may have been because the dosage of coagulant increased and more flocs were produced these ratios of coagulants and oxidants achieved a higher utilization and promoted doc removal the doc and turbidity removal efficiency increased slightly when the pms concentration was increased further fe iii pms 1 0 75 this may have been attributed to the fact that an increasing oxidant concentration can also lead to the consumption of active species in the system eq 16 guan et al 2011 however the turbidity control efficiency was weakened when the fe iii dosage reached 100 μm this may have been due to the more flocs produced and the longer settling time required it is also possible that an increase in the amount of fe ii reduced by fe iii resulted in an increased turbidity in the solution in addition excess mn vii would also cause color problems in the water the formation potential of the detected dbps after chlorination with different oxidant and coagulant dosages is shown in fig s16 without mn vii pre oxidation the addition of different concentrations of pms in the fe iii coagulation had little effect on the formation potential of the detected dbps in the rw this may have been attributed to the limited doc removal rate higher dosages of mn vii and pms could have reduced the formation potential of the detected dbps among them the inhibitory effect on the formation of trichloromethane tcm was better than that on the formation of tcal considering that an excessive dosage of chemicals in the drinking water treatment process is unfavorable the recommended dosage of mn vii was determined to be 0 4 0 6 mg l and that of fe iii was 80 μm the ratio of fe iii pms was 1 0 5 1 0 625 for future application and these parameters could achieve satisfactory oxidation and coagulation efficacy 16 so4 hso5 so5 hso4 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that mn vii oxidation combined with the fe iii pms coagulation process improve the treatment efficiency for raw water and micropollutant compared with the conventional fe iii coagulation process the mn vii fe iii pms process effectively improved the doc turbidity uv254 and micropollutant such as smx and ihx removal efficiency for rw during the mn vii fe iii pms process the synergistic effect between nom fe and mn can promote the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn iii mn iv to accelerate the activation of pms so4 played a major role in the removal of pollutants compared with fe iii coagulation the mn vii fe iii pms process reduced the formation potential of dcan in the rw and ha solution after chlorination increasing the dosages of mn vii fe iii and pms improved the removal of doc from the rw for the application in drinking water treatment the dosages of mn vii 0 4 0 6 mg l fe iii 80 μm and the ratio of fe iii pms 1 0 5 1 0 625 are optional this study demonstrated that the mn vii fe iii pms process is a promising process for enhancing the efficiency of drinking water treatment considering the complexity of the water matrix future studies should explore the effects and mechanisms of the different

15364,leachate is a critical reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes args and its proper treatment is closely related to human health and ecosystem safety here we used high throughput qpcr to explore the removal behavior of args in two full scale leachate treatment plants ltps where biological treatment and membrane filtration processes were integrated a total of 286 args and 55 mobile genetic elements mges were detected with aminoglycoside multidrug and mlsb resistance genes being the most prevalent and abundant anaerobic digestion was found to be an important pretreatment process for leachate while anoxic aerobic tanks in membrane bioreactor mbr acted as incubators for args due to their significant proliferation effect on args integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro excelled in args removal with absolute abundances reduced by 3 to 6 orders of magnitude from about 109 copies ml in raw leachate to 103 105 copies ml in effluents our results also showed that leachate treatment processes significantly altered the composition of args and bacterial communities procrustes analysis and network analysis revealed strong associations between microbes and args with several hub genes and bacterial genera identified structural equation models sems indicated that bacterial composition mges and basic water properties were the key drivers shaping args dynamics in the raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively notably several pathogens e g klebsiella vibrio aeromonas were closely correlated with args in raw leachate and may amplify the dissemination risks of args moreover insertion sequences in biological systems would accelerate the horizontal gene transfer of args in short this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of args removal and

priority for environmental management in megacities rapid urbanization and population growth have led to a dramatic increase in msw generation ding et al 2021 khandelwal et al 2019 the world bank predicted that by 2050 the global annual msw generated will reach 3 4 109 tonnes kaza et al 2018 in particular food waste accounted for 50 to 60 of total msw in china with a moisture content of up to 70 ding et al 2021 faced with the challenge of huge quantities of msw the shanghai government issued guidelines on msw classification in 2019 for effective disposal msw is classified as food waste recyclable waste hazardous waste and residual waste and is mainly treated by landfill incineration and bio treatment mian et al 2017 however due to waste decomposition inherent water and rainwater percolation these disposal practices produce enormous leachate containing pollutants such as organic matter heavy metals antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args hussein et al 2021 liu et al 2022 if not properly treated these contaminants may cause irrevocable damage to environments as emerging contaminants args are of particular concern due to the threats they pose to medical sectors human health and ecological sustainability o neill 2014 previous investigations have shown that leachate is a critical hotspot for args accumulation and proliferation li et al 2021 wang et al 2020a since landfill is the most common strategy for msw disposal worldwide previous studies have mainly focused on the behavior of landfill leachate eggen et al 2010 however food waste leachate which is also considered a critical reservoir of args li et al 2021 has lacked sufficient attention it should be noted that human food may be at risk of antimicrobial resistance amr owing to antibiotic contamination in agricultural production and manufacturing processes zhu et al 2017 currently various antibiotics are used in livestock breeding resulting in meat and seafood not being spared from antibiotics and args li et al 2022 moreover crops and vegetables grown in soil fertilized by manure may also raise amr concerns wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 since food waste is perishable and produces huge leachate the high organic matter content and rich nutrients in leachate may facilitate the growth and propagation of microbes especially pathogens and args wang et al 2020b therefore it is necessary to remove args by leachate treatment plants ltps to mitigate environmental risks unlike municipal wastewater leachate treatment is more difficult and complex traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as those using conventional activated sludge cas and sequencing batch reactor sbr systems were designed to remove nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon but exhibited low removal efficiency for antibiotics and args zhu et al 2021 however anaerobic digestion ad jang et al 2020 anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o li et al 2021 and membrane bioreactor mbr le et al 2018 processes showed better performance in the elimination of args in wastewater or leachate moreover several chemical based technologies e g chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet have been applied as disinfection methods for treating wastewater effluent and drinking water lüddeke et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 disappointingly these approaches are not ideal and even worse may actually increase amr risks due to co selection by disinfection byproducts and reactivation of arb lv et al 2014 pei et al 2019 conversely with recent advances in membrane technology and lower production costs membrane filtration is becoming one of the promising technologies to remove emerging contaminants from wastewater including ultra filtration uf nano filtration nf reverse osmosis ro etc liang et al 2021 lu et al 2020 previous study showed that integrated uf and two stage ro could reduce 99 79 of total args and more than 99 0 of conventional pollutants from swine wastewater liang et al 2021 thus the integration of biological treatment and membrane filtration processes provides new insights to treat leachate however most previous studies tracked limited args by quantitative pcr qpcr whereas high throughput qpcr ht qpcr offers the possibility to simultaneously determine several hundred args to the best of our knowledge our current study is the first systematic study using ht qpcr to investigate the fate of args in full scale ltps adopting integrated treatment processes the evolution and dissemination of args are affected by diverse environmental factors such as basic properties antibiotics heavy metals mobile genetic elements mges and microbial community chen et al 2019a yu et al 2020a args in leachate can be co selected or induced under multiple pressures since leachate is a rather complex reservoir containing varied contaminants yu et al 2016 multi nutritional food waste leachate is conducive to the dissemination of args due to the excellent growth of bacterial hosts of args he et al 2019 li et al 2021 integrons were found to play vital roles in the propagation of args in food waste treatment systems through horizontal gene transfer hgt jang et al 2020 wang et al 2020b moreover args levels in landfill ltps with the co occurrence of heavy metals resulted in ltps exhibiting greater environmental risk zhang et al 2016 overall multiple factors can co drive the fate of args in leachate while the influencing mechanism still remains unclear therefore deciphering the correlations between environmental factors and args in ltps and identifying key drivers affecting args dynamics are essential for understanding args dissemination behaviors and designing mitigation strategies to address the knowledge gaps of args removal behaviors and driving factors in the full scale ltps ht qpcr was applied to investigate the fate of args and structural equation models sems were constructed to analyze how environmental factors affect the dissemination of args specifically this study aimed to 1 explore the variation and removal capacity of args by biological treatment and integrated membrane filtration processes 2 reveal the evolution of bacterial communities during leachate treatment and co occurrence patterns with args and 3 evaluate the impacts of multiple factors on args dynamics and identify key drivers in all this study has important practical and scientific implications for args removal and controlling their dissemination in ltps 2 material and methods 2 1 description of ltps and sample collection two full scale ltps namely plant y and plant l were chosen for investigation in shanghai china plant y is located in the largest solid waste treatment center in china with several landfills waste incineration plants food waste treatment plants and leachate treatment plants thus plant y receives mixed leachate from these plants and has a treatment capacity of 3 200 m3 day its main process is external mbr combined with integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro plant l was built to support food waste treatment in minhang district with a capacity of 600 m3 day an integrated process including anaerobic digestion ad and external mbr was utilized fig 1 shows the details of treatment processes and sampling sites for two ltps briefly the ltps were divided into three systems i e raw leachate biological system and filtration system for external mbr process the sludge retention time srt was approximately 4 10 1 5 and 1 1 days for the primary anoxic primary aerobic secondary anoxic and secondary aerobic tanks respectively in addition the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and sludge loading was 15 kg m3 and 0 15 kg cod kg mlss d respectively the sludge return ratio was set to 220 for ad process the srt was about 25 30 days four sampling events were conducted in plant y including october 2020 autumn january 2021 winter april 2021 spring and august 2021 summer while only the latter three events were performed in plant l a total of 12 and 9 leachate and sludge samples were collected in plant y and plant l for each event respectively all samples were collected in triplicate and transported to the laboratory within 3 hours 2 2 sample pretreatment and dna extraction the sample volume used for dna extraction was as follows raw leachate y1 y2 y3 y4 and l1 10 ml biological system y5 y6 ya ye l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 and l7 2 ml

and metal resistance genes mrgs using the wafergen smartchip real time pcr system a total of 376 primer sets table s1 were selected targeting 308 args 57 mges 10 mrgs and a 16s rrna gene args conferred resistance to twelve classes of antibiotics and mges included insertion sequences integrases transposases and plasmids the qpcr reaction system and amplification condition were in accordance with previous study yang et al 2022a all qpcrs were performed in triplicates with negative controls and amplification efficiencies beyond the range of 90 110 were discarded gene copy number n was calculated by eq 1 1 n 10 31 c t 10 3 where ct refers to the threshold cycle and the detection limit is 31 the relative abundance of args was obtained by dividing the copy number of args by the copy number of 16s rrna gene copies copy of 16s rrna gene in addition the lightcycle roche 480 system roche inc usa was used to quantify the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene according to plasmid

analyzed by ion chromatograph metrohm switzerland total phosphorus tp and ammonia nh3 n were analyzed according to national standards of gb11893 89 and hj535 2009 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis basic data analysis and graphics were conducted using excel 2017 origin 2021 and past 4 01 hammer et al 2001 one way anova and kruskal wallis test k w test were used for parametric data and nonparametric data comparison respectively procrustes analysis mantle test anosim test and principle coordinates analysis pcoa were performed in r studio 4 0 3 with vegan and ggplot2 packages all statistical tests were considered significant if p 0 05 the diversity and abundances of args were visualized by complexupset and complexheatmap packages in r the co occurrence networks of args mges mrgs and bacterial genera were generated using gephi 0 9 2 sems were built in amos 24 spss inc usa to estimate the effects of multiple factors on args dynamics according to the maximum likelihood estimation method the indirect effects of selected factors on args were obtained by multiplying the standardized coefficients of all possible pathways e g from one factor to another and then to args as a pathway the total effects were the sum of normalized indirect and direct effects chen et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 fate of args mges and mrgs in the full scale ltps 3 1 1 diversity of args mges and mrgs among the 375 target genes 350 subtypes of args n 286 mges n 55 and mrgs n 9 were detected in the two ltps aminoglycoside beta lactamase and mlsb resistance genes were the three dominant args classes accounting for 52 8 while insertion sequences 40 0 were the main mges detected to be specific 298 319 291 262 204 206 134 and 82 kinds of genes were observed in food leachate other leachate activated sludge excess sludge dewatered sludge uf effluent nf effluent and ro effluent respectively fig 2 the most abundant subtypes of args were found in leachate emphasizing that leachate was a critical reservoir for args in particular 71 genes were shared based on the above eight classified groups showing high persistence and stability of these genes fig s1 antibiotic deactivation was the dominant resistance mechanism of shared genes followed by efflux pumps likewise some unique genes were identified in different groups table s3 for example 17 genes were only observed in leachate and disappeared before entering subsequent treatment processes indicating that these genes were susceptible to apoptosis notably ltps are effective in reducing the diversity of args and mges in leachate in the anoxic and aerobic tanks of both ltps the number of args and mges remained relatively constant while sharp reductions in numbers were observed after uf nf and ro processes figs 2 and s2 a total of 56 72 and 52 genes were removed by uf nf and ro respectively demonstrating the strong interception and removal of args by membranes the ad processes y1 to ya and l1 to l2 also showed high efficiency in removing args and mges confirming the effectiveness of ad for leachate pretreatment moreover plant y possessed more diverse args than plant l due to the greater complexity of leachate seasonal changes also altered the diversity of args and higher diversity was observed in winter while obviously lower diversity was found in spring and summer in plant y and plant l respectively kw test p 0 01 3 1 2 abundance of args mges and mrgs the abundance of args mges and mrgs throughout the treatment train is shown in fig 3 briefly aminoglycoside mdr and mlsb resistance genes were the most prevalent and abundant args while insertion sequences contributed the most to the total abundance of mges furthermore higher abundances of mrgs were observed in plant l than plant y as revealed by pcoa fig s3 the leachate treatment process significantly altered the composition of args an obvious clustering was observed for the raw leachate biological system and filtration system samples anosim r 0 292 p 0 001 for relative abundance fig 3a sludge showed the highest args abundance with mean value of 1 33 and 1 31 for excess sludge and dewatered sludge in plant y respectively in addition sludge from both anoxic and aerobic tanks maintained high args abundance throughout the four seasons and did not show any seasonal differences anova p 0 05 however much lower abundance was observed in the sludge from plant l ranging from 0 25 to 0 55 in particular the mean args abundance of raw leachate in plant y 0 503 was almost one order of magnitude greater than that in plant l 0 067 suggesting more severe resistome pollution in plant y during the membrane filtration process ro can critically reduce args abundance kw test p 0 001 interestingly filtration effluents showed higher relative abundance of mges than leachate especially for insertion sequences network analysis also indicated strong correlations between insertion sequences e g is6 257 is26 is256 and args fig s4 for absolute abundance fig 3b aminoglycoside mdr and mlsb resistance genes accounted for 79 5 of the total abundance dewatered sludge had the highest args abundance with mean value of 4 91 5 92 1011 and 1 56 0 82 1011 copies g respectively a clear downward trend can be seen for args and mges abundances from biological system to filtration system which was related to the reduction of bacterial biomass as indicated by 16s rrna gene fig s5 more specifically the abundance of args in the activated sludge ranged from 3 44 109 to 2 20 1010 copies ml while their average abundances were decreased to 9 33 105 1 06 105 and 6 13 103 copies ml after uf nf and ro treatments respectively similarly mges abundances were reduced from about 109 copies ml in sludge to 104 105 copies ml in effluents 3 1 3 removal of args mges and mrgs lrv was calculated to evaluate the removal efficiency of args mges and mrgs by different treatments fig 4 for biological processes the lrv of total args mges and mrgs by mbr treatment was 3 15 0 46 2 08 0 42 and 2 51 2 30 for plant y and 3 35 0 14 2 11 0 36 and 2 83 0 55 for plant l respectively both ltps performed well in removing mlsb resistance genes showing lrv as high as 4 10 and 4 87 followed by tetracycline and phenicol resistance genes ad can reduce args and mges abundances to some extent with lrv ranging from 0 32 to 1 73 however higher absolute abundances of args and mges were observed in the activated sludge from aerobic anoxic tanks compared to leachate therefore their removal depended more on membrane units nested in mbr systems rather than biological degradation moreover plant y showed high removal efficiencies by integrated membrane filtration with mean lrv of 0 99 0 42 and 1 07 1 00 for args by nf and ro processes fig 4a overall plant l exhibited more outstanding args removal through biological treatment while integrated membrane filtration systems in plant y greatly improved the removal capacity 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities in the ltps in total 4 060 706 sequences were obtained and classified into 6 001 otus fig s6a pcoa revealed the differentiated distribution pattern of bacterial communities at otu level in three systems anosim test r 0 634 p 0 001 fig 5 c the bacterial diversity indices shannon and simpson and richness indices sobs chao1 and ace are summarized in table s4 briefly sludge showed the highest bacterial diversity and richness followed by raw leachate and a sharp reduction was observed in effluents this is consistent with the variation in 16s rrna gene abundance which was decreased from 108 1011 copies ml in raw leachate to 104 107 copies ml in effluents fig s5 the otus obtained were classified into 54 phyla and 1 413 genera fig s6b the composition of main phyla is shown in fig 5a exhibiting significant shifts during leachate treatment processes at phylum level the composition of bacterial communities in leachate was evidently distinct from other samples which was dominated by firmicutes kw test p 0 001 for sludge in anoxic and aerobic tanks calditrichota and bacteroidota were the most abundant phyla in plant y and plant l respectively after filtration treatment the proportion of proteobacteria increased and became the dominant phylum overall the proportions of firmicutes bacteroidota and chloroflexi decreased while proteobacteria and actinobacteriota increased throughout the treatment processes to further elucidate the evolution of bacterial communities the composition of top 50 bacterial genera was visualized by heatmap fig s7 lactobacillus a potential pathogen was the most striking genus in food leachate 75 3 for l1 and 25 1 for y3 the composition of main genera varied in different leachate fig s8a for example defluviitoga and sphaerochaeta were the predominant genera in landfill leachate while syntrophococcus and caproiciproducens dominated in waste incineration plant leachate furthermore calorithrix and thauera genera showed higher abundances in the biological system of plant y and plant l respectively fig 5b notably sludge in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks exhibited varied bacterial composition fig s8b however these genera gradually disappeared or were seldom detected after membrane filtration treatment with pseudomonas dominating 3 3 tracking of potential bacterial hosts of args mges and mrgs to explore the overall relationship between args and bacterial communities procrustes analysis and mantle test were conducted based on the bray curtis distance and dissimilarity metrics a strong relationship m2 0 4458 p 0 001 procrustes test and a goodness of fit r 0 6186 p 0 0001 mantle test between args and microbe were observed for both ltps fig 5d to be specific more significant relationships were shown in raw leachate fig s9a m2 0 5727 p 0 001 and the biological system fig s9b m2 0 3717 p 0 001 while weaker association was found in the filtration system fig s9c m2 0 8094 p 0 110 meanwhile network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence patterns between major bacterial genera args mges and mrgs potential bacterial hosts for individual genes could be inferred based on the significant correlations the genes with the most connected nodes are defined as hub genes and the node size is related to connections number a total of 121 nodes 103 genera 14 args and 4 mges were accessed from both ltps and segmented into 6 modules fig 6 most genera fell within proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidota with proteobacteria being the most critical potential host notably issm2 xanthob a subtype of insertion sequences was identified as hub gene due to the most frequent connections followed by args of dfrb4 tett blaveb and qach 351 likewise 4 genera caldicoprobacter pseudoalteromonas acholeplasma and dysgonomonadaceae norank were considered as hub genera in terms of individual systems vatb dfrb4 and tet 39 were regarded as hub genes in raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively a more intensive network between args and microbes was observed in raw leachate with 143 nodes obtained fig s10a conversely a more scattered connection and weaker association was shown for the filtration system with up to 46 56 of nodes not being included in the modules fig s10c in addition several hub genera were identified for different systems for example klebsiella vibrio aeromonas ercella and macellibacteroides were hub genera for raw leachate while candidatus competibacter portibacter planktosalinus and thioalkalivibrio were more connected in the biological system fig s10b 3 4 variation of basic properties antibiotics and heavy metals in ltps as presented in table s5 food waste leachate showed a low ph value of 4 09 0 18 while ph tended to be neutral in other leachates the cod contents 3 400 117 100 mg l were quite high in raw leachate with a mean removal efficiency of 83 9 by mbr treatment likewise mbr performed well in removing tn nh3 n tp and doc with mean removal efficiencies of 73 2 99 2 90 3 and 91 6 respectively 31 antibiotics 14 sas 6 qns 6 tcs and 5 mls were detected fig 7 a and tcs were the predominate antibiotic class detected the total antibiotic content in leachate ranged from 3 210 to 28 643 ng l and obviously higher levels were found in landfill leachate the average removal efficiencies of sas qns tcs and mls by mbr were 84 1 77 5 74 6 and 79 5 respectively fig s11 heavy metal contents ranged from undetected to 103 μg l fig 7b waste incineration plant leachate possessed the greatest metal content several heavy metal cu zn cd and pb contents dropped sharply via the mbr process and the total content was decreased to 114 5 and 69 8 μg l after nf and ro processes respectively 3 5 correlations of environmental factors with args and their contributions spearman correlation analysis was conducted to study the relationships between basic properties heavy metals antibiotics and args tables s6 s7 and s8 while canonical correspondence analysis cca revealed the correlations between environmental factors and bacterial communities fig s12 briefly heavy metals and antibiotics showed greater interactions with bacteria in leachate and sludge while basic properties exhibited stronger correlations with args in effluents based on these findings three sems were built to clarify the contributions of diverse factors to args dynamics fig 8 for raw leachate fig 8a bacterial composition showed the most significant correlation with args while it was negatively correlated with mges however bacterial alpha diversity had a positive effect on mges both heavy metals and antibiotics exhibited adverse effects on bacterial composition and args moreover basic properties contributed differently to args and mges with nitrogen and organic matter positively correlated with args and mges respectively for the biological system fig 8b mges was the dominant driver contributing to args while bacterial composition affected args indirectly by directly influencing mges heavy metals showed strong correlations with bacterial communities in different sludge groups most metals e g cu mn ni co cr and as were positively correlated with excess sludge and dewatered sludge but negatively related to activated sludge in addition sas and tcs showed great impacts on anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively for the filtration system fig 8c basic properties and heavy metals were the two main driving factors for args fate while bacterial communities and mges showed weaker impacts in particular tn cod ni as and pb were the most strongly correlated with args 0 57 ρ 0 63 4 discussion 4 1 args behaved differently during ad and mbr bio treatment not surprisingly args were ubiquitous and widely detected in the two ltps and they were resistant to almost all types of antibiotics used in human animal disease therapy hendriksen et al 2019 the fate of args behaved differently during ad and mbr bio treatment that is ad could effectively reduce args diversity and abundance while anoxic aerobic tanks in mbr may act as incubators and increase the proliferation potential of args as a pretreatment process for high cod leachate ad performs well in reducing organic load and facilitates subsequent aerobic treatment we insist that ad is a feasible and valid process in the elimination of args in ltps the removal effect of ad may be related to its operating conditions leachate and args properties high temperature 35 38 c and long sludge retention time srt 25 30 days are favorable conditions for the removal of args by ad sui et al 2016 furthermore the selective pressure of the acidogenic phase and anaerobic condition may disrupt the bacterial hosts of args leading to the release and degradation of args wu et al 2016 due to extremely high levels of contaminants in leachate args propagation could also be hindered by multiple stresses they receive vancomycin amphenicol and fluoroquinolone classes had higher lrv with resistance mechanisms mainly related to protection and regulators while mlsb and tetracycline classes primarily encoding antibiotic deactivation and efflux pumps had lower lrv therefore we speculate that resistance mechanisms of args can be instructive in influencing their fate and deserve more investigation in contrast higher abundances of args and mges were found in the anoxic aerobic tanks of mbr than leachate indicating that mbr bio treatment was not effective in removing args similar phenomena have been observed for food waste and landfill ltps li et al 2021 wang et al 2020a thus the desirable args removal capacity of mbr mainly relied on the membrane filtration process pei et al 2019 on the one hand suitable ph temperature and nutrients in mbr tanks favored the rapid growth of microbes and facilitated the proliferation of args accordingly excess sludge and dewatered sludge became the most critical args reservoirs due to sludge adsorption and precipitation and thus should be carefully considered for proper disposal on the other hand the short srt and large sludge return ratio of ao ao process promoted the homogenization of args distribution therefore the diversity and abundance of args was maintained at a consistent level in the mbr tanks unlike args chemical contaminants such as antibiotics nh3 n and cod could be effectively removed by mbr bio treatment which was mainly due to combined biodegradation and adsorption processes zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 briefly antibiotics can be partially biodegraded by microorganisms compared to tcs sas and qns were more biodegradable due to their smaller molecular mass and simpler structures oberoi et al 2019 instead heavy metals were removed mostly by sludge adsorption and precipitation 4 2 integrated membrane filtration played critical roles in args removal in total 180 genes were removed by integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro and the absolute abundance of args was reduced from about 109 copies ml in raw leachate to 103 105 copies ml in effluents showing a significant removal of args lrv 3 6 notably args abundances decreased to levels below those found in rivers and reservoirs after uf nf processes chen et al 2019b li et al 2020 and fell to similar levels as tap water after the ro process su et al 2018 which evidently reduced the amr dissemination risk to receiving environments previous studies analyzed the microfiltration mf ro process to treat reclaimed water showing high removal efficiencies of args by mf lrv 1 0 4 3 and ro lrv 1 6 3 8 lu et al 2020 these evidences emphasize the critical roles of membrane filtration in args removal the main mechanism of args removal by membrane filtration is size exclusion and electrostatic interaction cell colloid interaction and membrane fouling may be additional mechanisms krzeminski et al 2020 liang et al 2021 slipko et al 2019 our study showed that lrv ranged from 0 74 4 87 0 44 1 82 and 0 62 1 98 for args by uf nf and ro processes respectively notably the small uf membrane pores 30 40 nm can greatly intercept suspended colloidal particles and bacteria during mbr treatment resulting in a sharp reduction of args abundances in uf effluents in general most bacteria and plasmids such as e coli radius 0 2 0 4 μm length 1 3 μm and supercoiled plasmid molecules radius 71 nm length 455 nm were much larger than the pore size of uf membranes slipko et al 2019 colloidal particles e g protein polysaccharide in leachate can also interact with dna and cells to improve the membrane removal efficiency of args pei et al 2019 moreover negatively charged dna containing args would be repelled by negatively charged membranes due to electrostatic repulsion ager et al 2009 however a certain amount of args still persisted in the filtration effluents which can be explained from three aspects firstly dna can penetrate nanopores due to its special size shape and flexibility arkhangelsky et al 2011 previous studies have found that double stranded plasmid dna with a diameter of 350 nm can penetrate 10 nm membrane pores by stretching into long hair shaped flexible strands and move in a snake like manner at highly converging flow arkhangelsky et al 2011 latulippe and zydney 2011 pressure driven membrane filtration may deform bacteria causing intracellular fluid to escape thereby reducing cell volume and promoting dna to drag through membranes liang et al 2021 secondly args may be present in free dna forms e g linear fragments plasmid molecules extracellular dna or associated with other non retained microorganisms le et al 2018 linear dna fragments and plasmid molecules are more flexible than supercoiled structures and can extend across membranes latulippe and zydney 2011 morão et al 2011 in addition eargs are more recalcitrant compared to iargs as they usually cannot be removed simultaneously with the elimination of arbs lan et al 2019 thirdly bacteria remaining in effluents can use nutrients to further proliferate and induce args under the selective pressures of heavy metals and antibiotics due to long term operation membranes may be biologically contaminated and some biofilms on their surface may be shed to effluents nevertheless args can be further removed by nf 1 10 nm and ro 0 1 1 nm processes showing higher lrv for tetracycline fluoroquinolone beta lactamase and others resistance genes some variations were also observed for example nf showed lower removal ability for sulfonamide and mrgs classes while ro performed poorly in removing trimethoprim and mlsb classes args removal could be related to their different characteristics and membrane selectivity which deserves a follow up study unexpectedly we observed an increase in the relative abundance of mges in effluents compared to leachate suggesting that additional bacteria were equipped with mges during filtration treatment li et al 2021 more diverse and flexible forms of mges may explain this phenomenon especially for insertion sequences and transposases which may cross uf nf membranes in specific shapes under high operating pressure these mges were mainly existed in extracellular free dna fragments or plasmid molecules as most bacteria have been intercepted by uf membranes slipko et al 2019 interestingly the replacement of nf membranes in autumn and ro membranes in spring resulted in lower args removal in the corresponding seasons new membranes may allow more args to pass through while fouled membranes may contribute to higher args removal due to pore clogging and fouling layer characteristics cheng and hong 2017 however excessive membrane biofouling can reduce filtration capacity and flux thereby increasing energy consumption based on the trade off between args removal effects and operating costs mbr followed by the nf process is essential for args removal while ro can be chosen according to actual situations 4 3 identifying key drivers affecting args dynamics in full scale ltps as indicated by sems args dynamics in raw leachate biological system and filtration system were influenced to varying degrees by multiple drivers for raw leachate bacterial composition was the overriding driver for args enhancement microbes as hosts of args showed strong correlations with args however the effect of mges on args was weak indicating a low potential for hgt this highlighted that vertical gene transfer vgt could be the dominate pathway affecting the fate of args via bacteria proliferation in extremely high contamination environments similar results were found in landfill leachate wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2018 most heavy metals were positively correlated with bacterial genera in waste incineration plant leachate due to their remarkably high levels likewise bacteria in landfill leachate were closely associated with most antibiotics as the highest content occurred in landfills thus both heavy metals and antibiotics can pose selective pressure on microbes and influence their composition in ltps zhao et al 2018 moreover bacterial α diversity can positively influence the dynamics of mges and further indirectly affect args conversely bacterial composition can have a significant negative effect on mges this reflected the phenomenon that mges and args in leachate were differentially shaped by microbial diversity and composition notably the bacteria in leachate contained a wide range of pathogens based on the network analysis we identified several hub genera e g klebsiella vibrio aeromonas that were capable of encoding diverse args klebsiella spp a pathogen that frequently causes human infections is responsible for the production of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase kpc and extended spectrum β lactamase esbl resulting in strains harboring a super resistome navon venezia et al 2017 podschun and ullmann 1998 moreover higher levels of vibrio spp were found which may cause several clinical manifestations such as cholera and vibriosis baker austin et al 2018 therefore the associations between microorganisms in leachate especially pathogens and args may amplify the environmental dissemination risks of args and deserves in depth attention to better control their spread for biological systems mges significantly affected the occurrence of args including integrases inti1 inti2 transposases tnpa 1 tnpa 2 is613 plasmid pakd1 incp 1β and insertion sequences is26 is256 ispps1 pseud etc among them integrases and insertion sequences were the two main mges significantly correlated with args pearson s r 0 68 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively moreover the abundances of insertion sequences especially is26 is6100 issm2 xanthob and is1247 were obviously higher than other mges and widely detected throughout the system figs 3 and s1 therefore we infer that hgt was the main mechanism for args propagation during bio treatment and insertion sequences would enhance the mobilization and dissemination of args besides bacterial composition was positively correlated with mges and in turn indirectly affected the args thus microorganisms also played critical roles in regulating the fate of args previous studies have well illustrated the critical roles of integrases and transposases in the propagation of args in different matrices sun et al 2022b yu et al 2020a while other mges have been less explored insertion sequences are dna segments that can move autonomously mainly through a non replicative mechanism to facilitate mobilization within or between dna molecules partridge et al 2018 significant associations were found not only between insertion sequences and args but also with bacteria and even some pathogens issm2 xanthob one of the insertion sequences was identified as a hub gene in the network and was frequently associated with various bacterial genera figs 6 and s10b thus insertion sequences may affect the bacteria behaviors and further shape the dynamics of args previous studies have proposed that these strong associations existed mostly in human animal and wastewater impacted environments razavi et al 2020 we speculated that the complex leachate sludge environments would significantly enhance the mobilization of args by insertion sequences plasmids can independently replicate host chromosomes and transfer between bacterial cells which was thought to be another crucial pathway of hgt bottery et al 2019 higher abundances of plasmids in the mbr tanks may accelerate the dissemination of args during biological processes moreover the continuous flow state and suitable incubation conditions of biological systems would be more favorable for hgt of args than the static and highly contaminated state of leachate for filtration system args dynamics depended strongly on nutrients and heavy metals as they can be present in the dissolved state and removed thoroughly until the ro stage in contrast bacteria and mges showed a weak influence on args the associations between args and microbes in effluents were further apart as membrane separation led to an obvious reduction of bacterial biomass however we found that the bacterial α diversity showed positive correlations with mges although membrane filtration significantly removed the majority of bacteria and reduced their abundances the bacterial α diversity remained relative high level in filtration system table s4 and fig s6 moreover mges especially for insertion sequences and transposases were found in high relative abundance in filtrates therefore we hypothesized that microorganisms with low abundance but high diversity could be potential hosts for these mges although they mainly existed in extracellular form yu et al 2020b it is common to observe significant correlations between args and heavy metals because they may act as selective agents for args proliferation via the co selection process including co resistance and cross resistance baker austin et al 2006 ni as pb and cr were the four main metals contributing to co selection of args in effluents even at low concentration metals can pose selective pressures on the microbiome and amr and affect hgt efficiency rilstone et al 2021 moreover basic water properties e g tn nh3 n and cod significantly altered the fate of args as these substances can influence the growth of bacteria by regulating nutrient conditions sun et al 2022a however the factors we selected above explained less of the args variation in the filtration system r2 0 59 than in raw leachate r2 0 89 and the biological system r2 0 93 suggesting that args dynamics in effluents were determined more by intrinsic mechanisms than by extrinsic factors 5 conclusion this study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of the removal behavior and key drivers of args in full scale ltps using integrated biological and membrane filtration treatments the main findings are as follows biological treatment has limited capacity to remove args in ltps instead the anoxic aerobic tanks in mbr may serve as incubators for args proliferation excess and dewatered sludge were the most critical args reservoirs and should be disposed of properly nevertheless ad proved to be a feasible and valid process for leachate pretreatment and args removal membrane filtration processes played key roles in args removal with a high lrv of 3 6 the removal behavior depended on membrane selectivity resistance mechanism and the forms of args in particular nf and ro processes were found to be pretty effective reducing args levels to below those found in natural water bodies and thus alleviating amr risks bacterial composition mges and basic properties were key drivers shaping args dynamics in the raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively the close associations between pathogens and args in leachate may amplify the risks of args dissemination while mges especially insertion sequences in the biological system would enhance the mobilization and dissemination of args by hgt however the fate of args in effluents were less influenced by environmental factors declaration of competing

15364,leachate is a critical reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes args and its proper treatment is closely related to human health and ecosystem safety here we used high throughput qpcr to explore the removal behavior of args in two full scale leachate treatment plants ltps where biological treatment and membrane filtration processes were integrated a total of 286 args and 55 mobile genetic elements mges were detected with aminoglycoside multidrug and mlsb resistance genes being the most prevalent and abundant anaerobic digestion was found to be an important pretreatment process for leachate while anoxic aerobic tanks in membrane bioreactor mbr acted as incubators for args due to their significant proliferation effect on args integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro excelled in args removal with absolute abundances reduced by 3 to 6 orders of magnitude from about 109 copies ml in raw leachate to 103 105 copies ml in effluents our results also showed that leachate treatment processes significantly altered the composition of args and bacterial communities procrustes analysis and network analysis revealed strong associations between microbes and args with several hub genes and bacterial genera identified structural equation models sems indicated that bacterial composition mges and basic water properties were the key drivers shaping args dynamics in the raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively notably several pathogens e g klebsiella vibrio aeromonas were closely correlated with args in raw leachate and may amplify the dissemination risks of args moreover insertion sequences in biological systems would accelerate the horizontal gene transfer of args in short this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of args removal and

priority for environmental management in megacities rapid urbanization and population growth have led to a dramatic increase in msw generation ding et al 2021 khandelwal et al 2019 the world bank predicted that by 2050 the global annual msw generated will reach 3 4 109 tonnes kaza et al 2018 in particular food waste accounted for 50 to 60 of total msw in china with a moisture content of up to 70 ding et al 2021 faced with the challenge of huge quantities of msw the shanghai government issued guidelines on msw classification in 2019 for effective disposal msw is classified as food waste recyclable waste hazardous waste and residual waste and is mainly treated by landfill incineration and bio treatment mian et al 2017 however due to waste decomposition inherent water and rainwater percolation these disposal practices produce enormous leachate containing pollutants such as organic matter heavy metals antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args hussein et al 2021 liu et al 2022 if not properly treated these contaminants may cause irrevocable damage to environments as emerging contaminants args are of particular concern due to the threats they pose to medical sectors human health and ecological sustainability o neill 2014 previous investigations have shown that leachate is a critical hotspot for args accumulation and proliferation li et al 2021 wang et al 2020a since landfill is the most common strategy for msw disposal worldwide previous studies have mainly focused on the behavior of landfill leachate eggen et al 2010 however food waste leachate which is also considered a critical reservoir of args li et al 2021 has lacked sufficient attention it should be noted that human food may be at risk of antimicrobial resistance amr owing to antibiotic contamination in agricultural production and manufacturing processes zhu et al 2017 currently various antibiotics are used in livestock breeding resulting in meat and seafood not being spared from antibiotics and args li et al 2022 moreover crops and vegetables grown in soil fertilized by manure may also raise amr concerns wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 since food waste is perishable and produces huge leachate the high organic matter content and rich nutrients in leachate may facilitate the growth and propagation of microbes especially pathogens and args wang et al 2020b therefore it is necessary to remove args by leachate treatment plants ltps to mitigate environmental risks unlike municipal wastewater leachate treatment is more difficult and complex traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as those using conventional activated sludge cas and sequencing batch reactor sbr systems were designed to remove nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon but exhibited low removal efficiency for antibiotics and args zhu et al 2021 however anaerobic digestion ad jang et al 2020 anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o li et al 2021 and membrane bioreactor mbr le et al 2018 processes showed better performance in the elimination of args in wastewater or leachate moreover several chemical based technologies e g chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet have been applied as disinfection methods for treating wastewater effluent and drinking water lüddeke et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 disappointingly these approaches are not ideal and even worse may actually increase amr risks due to co selection by disinfection byproducts and reactivation of arb lv et al 2014 pei et al 2019 conversely with recent advances in membrane technology and lower production costs membrane filtration is becoming one of the promising technologies to remove emerging contaminants from wastewater including ultra filtration uf nano filtration nf reverse osmosis ro etc liang et al 2021 lu et al 2020 previous study showed that integrated uf and two stage ro could reduce 99 79 of total args and more than 99 0 of conventional pollutants from swine wastewater liang et al 2021 thus the integration of biological treatment and membrane filtration processes provides new insights to treat leachate however most previous studies tracked limited args by quantitative pcr qpcr whereas high throughput qpcr ht qpcr offers the possibility to simultaneously determine several hundred args to the best of our knowledge our current study is the first systematic study using ht qpcr to investigate the fate of args in full scale ltps adopting integrated treatment processes the evolution and dissemination of args are affected by diverse environmental factors such as basic properties antibiotics heavy metals mobile genetic elements mges and microbial community chen et al 2019a yu et al 2020a args in leachate can be co selected or induced under multiple pressures since leachate is a rather complex reservoir containing varied contaminants yu et al 2016 multi nutritional food waste leachate is conducive to the dissemination of args due to the excellent growth of bacterial hosts of args he et al 2019 li et al 2021 integrons were found to play vital roles in the propagation of args in food waste treatment systems through horizontal gene transfer hgt jang et al 2020 wang et al 2020b moreover args levels in landfill ltps with the co occurrence of heavy metals resulted in ltps exhibiting greater environmental risk zhang et al 2016 overall multiple factors can co drive the fate of args in leachate while the influencing mechanism still remains unclear therefore deciphering the correlations between environmental factors and args in ltps and identifying key drivers affecting args dynamics are essential for understanding args dissemination behaviors and designing mitigation strategies to address the knowledge gaps of args removal behaviors and driving factors in the full scale ltps ht qpcr was applied to investigate the fate of args and structural equation models sems were constructed to analyze how environmental factors affect the dissemination of args specifically this study aimed to 1 explore the variation and removal capacity of args by biological treatment and integrated membrane filtration processes 2 reveal the evolution of bacterial communities during leachate treatment and co occurrence patterns with args and 3 evaluate the impacts of multiple factors on args dynamics and identify key drivers in all this study has important practical and scientific implications for args removal and controlling their dissemination in ltps 2 material and methods 2 1 description of ltps and sample collection two full scale ltps namely plant y and plant l were chosen for investigation in shanghai china plant y is located in the largest solid waste treatment center in china with several landfills waste incineration plants food waste treatment plants and leachate treatment plants thus plant y receives mixed leachate from these plants and has a treatment capacity of 3 200 m3 day its main process is external mbr combined with integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro plant l was built to support food waste treatment in minhang district with a capacity of 600 m3 day an integrated process including anaerobic digestion ad and external mbr was utilized fig 1 shows the details of treatment processes and sampling sites for two ltps briefly the ltps were divided into three systems i e raw leachate biological system and filtration system for external mbr process the sludge retention time srt was approximately 4 10 1 5 and 1 1 days for the primary anoxic primary aerobic secondary anoxic and secondary aerobic tanks respectively in addition the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and sludge loading was 15 kg m3 and 0 15 kg cod kg mlss d respectively the sludge return ratio was set to 220 for ad process the srt was about 25 30 days four sampling events were conducted in plant y including october 2020 autumn january 2021 winter april 2021 spring and august 2021 summer while only the latter three events were performed in plant l a total of 12 and 9 leachate and sludge samples were collected in plant y and plant l for each event respectively all samples were collected in triplicate and transported to the laboratory within 3 hours 2 2 sample pretreatment and dna extraction the sample volume used for dna extraction was as follows raw leachate y1 y2 y3 y4 and l1 10 ml biological system y5 y6 ya ye l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 and l7 2 ml filtration system uf effluent y7 and l8 1 l nf effluent y8 3 l and ro effluent y9 5 l for raw leachate and sludge certain volumes of samples were added to sterilized centrifuge tubes and centrifuged

and metal resistance genes mrgs using the wafergen smartchip real time pcr system a total of 376 primer sets table s1 were selected targeting 308 args 57 mges 10 mrgs and a 16s rrna gene args conferred resistance to twelve classes of antibiotics and mges included insertion sequences integrases transposases and plasmids the qpcr reaction system and amplification condition were in accordance with previous study yang et al 2022a all qpcrs were performed in triplicates with negative controls and amplification efficiencies beyond the range of 90 110 were discarded gene copy number n was calculated by eq 1 1 n 10 31 c t 10 3 where ct refers to the threshold cycle and the detection limit is 31 the relative abundance of args was obtained by dividing the copy number of args by the copy number of 16s rrna gene copies copy of 16s rrna gene in addition the lightcycle roche 480 system roche inc usa was used to quantify the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene according to plasmid

basic data analysis and graphics were conducted using excel 2017 origin 2021 and past 4 01 hammer et al 2001 one way anova and kruskal wallis test k w test were used for parametric data and nonparametric data comparison respectively procrustes analysis mantle test anosim test and principle coordinates analysis pcoa were performed in r studio 4 0 3 with vegan and ggplot2 packages all statistical tests were considered significant if p 0 05 the diversity and abundances of args were visualized by complexupset and complexheatmap packages in r the co occurrence networks of args mges mrgs and bacterial genera were generated using gephi 0 9 2 sems were built in amos 24 spss inc usa to estimate the effects of multiple factors on args dynamics according to the maximum likelihood estimation method the indirect effects of selected factors on args were obtained by multiplying the standardized coefficients of all possible pathways e g from one factor to another and then to args as a pathway the total effects were the sum of normalized indirect and direct effects chen et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 fate of args mges and mrgs in the full scale ltps 3 1 1 diversity of args mges and mrgs among the 375 target genes 350 subtypes of args n 286 mges n 55 and mrgs n 9 were detected in the two ltps aminoglycoside beta lactamase and mlsb resistance genes were the three dominant args classes accounting for 52 8 while insertion sequences 40 0 were the main mges detected to be specific 298 319 291 262 204 206 134 and 82 kinds of genes were observed in food leachate other leachate activated sludge excess sludge dewatered sludge uf effluent nf effluent and ro effluent respectively fig 2 the most abundant subtypes of args were found in leachate emphasizing that leachate was a critical reservoir for args in particular 71 genes were shared based on the above eight classified groups showing high persistence and stability of these genes fig s1 antibiotic deactivation was the dominant resistance mechanism of shared genes followed by efflux pumps likewise some unique genes were identified in different groups table s3 for example 17 genes were only observed in leachate and disappeared before entering subsequent treatment processes indicating that these genes were susceptible to apoptosis notably ltps are effective in reducing the diversity of args and mges in leachate in the anoxic and aerobic tanks of both ltps the number of args and mges remained relatively constant while sharp reductions in numbers were observed after uf nf and ro processes figs 2 and s2 a total of 56 72 and 52 genes were removed by uf nf and ro respectively demonstrating the strong interception and removal of args by membranes the ad processes y1 to ya and l1 to l2 also showed high efficiency in removing args and mges confirming the effectiveness of ad for leachate pretreatment moreover plant y possessed more diverse args than plant l due to the greater complexity of leachate seasonal changes also altered the diversity of args and higher diversity was observed in winter while obviously lower diversity was found in spring and summer in plant y and plant l respectively kw test p 0 01 3 1 2 abundance of args mges and mrgs the abundance of args mges and mrgs throughout the treatment train is shown in fig 3 briefly aminoglycoside mdr and mlsb resistance genes were the most prevalent and abundant args while insertion sequences contributed the most to the total abundance of mges furthermore higher abundances of mrgs were observed in plant l than plant y as revealed by pcoa fig s3 the leachate treatment process significantly altered the composition of args an obvious clustering was observed for the raw leachate biological system and filtration system samples anosim r 0 292 p 0 001 for relative abundance fig 3a sludge showed the highest args abundance with mean value of 1 33 and 1 31 for excess sludge and dewatered sludge in plant y respectively in addition sludge from both anoxic and aerobic tanks maintained high args abundance throughout the four seasons and did not show any seasonal differences anova p 0 05 however much lower abundance was observed in the sludge from plant l ranging from 0 25 to 0 55 in particular the mean args abundance of raw leachate in plant y 0 503 was almost one order of magnitude greater than that in plant l 0 067 suggesting more severe resistome pollution in plant y during the membrane filtration process ro can critically reduce args abundance kw test p 0 001 interestingly filtration effluents showed higher relative abundance of mges than leachate especially for insertion sequences network analysis also indicated strong correlations between insertion sequences e g is6 257 is26 is256 and args fig s4 for absolute abundance fig 3b aminoglycoside mdr and mlsb resistance genes accounted for 79 5 of the total abundance dewatered sludge had the highest args abundance with mean value of 4 91 5 92 1011 and 1 56 0 82 1011 copies g respectively a clear downward trend can be seen for args and mges abundances from biological system to filtration system which was related to the reduction of bacterial biomass as indicated by 16s rrna gene fig s5 more specifically the abundance of args in the activated sludge ranged from 3 44 109 to 2 20 1010 copies ml while their average abundances were decreased to 9 33 105 1 06 105 and 6 13 103 copies ml after uf nf and ro treatments respectively similarly mges abundances were reduced from about 109 copies ml in sludge to 104 105 copies ml in effluents 3 1 3 removal of args mges and mrgs lrv was calculated to evaluate the removal efficiency of args mges and mrgs by different treatments fig 4 for biological processes the lrv of total args mges and mrgs by mbr treatment was 3 15 0 46 2 08 0 42 and 2 51 2 30 for plant y and 3 35 0 14 2 11 0 36 and 2 83 0 55 for plant l respectively both ltps performed well in removing mlsb resistance genes showing lrv as high as 4 10 and 4 87 followed by tetracycline and phenicol resistance genes ad can reduce args and mges abundances to some extent with lrv ranging from 0 32 to 1 73 however higher absolute abundances of args and mges were observed in the activated sludge from aerobic anoxic tanks compared to leachate therefore their removal depended more on membrane units nested in mbr systems rather than biological degradation moreover plant y showed high removal efficiencies by integrated membrane filtration with mean lrv of 0 99 0 42 and 1 07 1 00 for args by nf and ro processes fig 4a overall plant l exhibited more outstanding args removal through biological treatment while integrated membrane filtration systems in plant y greatly improved the removal capacity 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities in the ltps in total 4 060 706 sequences were obtained and classified into 6 001 otus fig s6a pcoa revealed the differentiated distribution pattern of bacterial communities at otu level in three systems anosim test r 0 634 p 0 001 fig 5 c the bacterial diversity indices shannon and simpson and richness indices sobs chao1 and ace are summarized in table s4 briefly sludge showed the highest bacterial diversity and richness followed by raw leachate and a sharp reduction was observed in effluents this is consistent with the variation in 16s rrna gene abundance which was decreased from 108 1011 copies ml in raw leachate to 104 107 copies ml in effluents fig s5 the otus obtained were classified into 54 phyla and 1 413 genera fig s6b the composition of main phyla is shown in fig 5a exhibiting significant shifts during leachate treatment processes at phylum level the composition of bacterial communities in leachate was evidently distinct from other samples which was dominated by firmicutes kw test p 0 001 for sludge in anoxic and aerobic tanks calditrichota and bacteroidota were the most abundant phyla in plant y and plant l respectively after filtration treatment the proportion of proteobacteria increased and became the dominant phylum overall the proportions of firmicutes bacteroidota and chloroflexi decreased while proteobacteria and actinobacteriota increased throughout the treatment processes to further elucidate the evolution of bacterial communities the composition of top 50 bacterial genera was visualized by heatmap fig s7 lactobacillus a potential pathogen was the most striking genus in food leachate 75 3 for l1 and 25 1 for y3 the composition of main genera varied in different leachate fig s8a for example defluviitoga and sphaerochaeta were the predominant genera in landfill leachate while syntrophococcus and caproiciproducens dominated in waste incineration plant leachate furthermore calorithrix and thauera genera showed higher abundances in the biological system of plant y and plant l respectively fig 5b notably sludge in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks exhibited varied bacterial composition fig s8b however these genera gradually disappeared or were seldom detected after membrane filtration treatment with pseudomonas dominating 3 3 tracking of potential bacterial hosts of args mges and mrgs to explore the overall relationship between args and bacterial communities procrustes analysis and mantle test were conducted based on the bray curtis distance and dissimilarity metrics a strong relationship m2 0 4458 p 0 001 procrustes test and a goodness of fit r 0 6186 p 0 0001 mantle test between args and microbe were observed for both ltps fig 5d to be specific more significant relationships were shown in raw leachate fig s9a m2 0 5727 p 0 001 and the biological system fig s9b m2 0 3717 p 0 001 while weaker association was found in the filtration system fig s9c m2 0 8094 p 0 110 meanwhile network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence patterns between major bacterial genera args mges and mrgs potential bacterial hosts for individual genes could be inferred based on the significant correlations the genes with the most connected nodes are defined as hub genes and the node size is related to connections number a total of 121 nodes 103 genera 14 args and 4 mges were accessed from both ltps and segmented into 6 modules fig 6 most genera fell within proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidota with proteobacteria being the most critical potential host notably issm2 xanthob a subtype of insertion sequences was identified as hub gene due to the most frequent connections followed by args of dfrb4 tett blaveb and qach 351 likewise 4 genera caldicoprobacter pseudoalteromonas acholeplasma and dysgonomonadaceae norank were considered as hub genera in terms of individual systems vatb dfrb4 and tet 39 were regarded as hub genes in raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively a more intensive network between args and microbes was observed in raw leachate with 143 nodes obtained fig s10a conversely a more scattered connection and weaker association was shown for the filtration system with up to 46 56 of nodes not being included in the modules fig s10c in addition several hub genera were identified for different systems for example klebsiella vibrio aeromonas ercella and macellibacteroides were hub genera for raw leachate while candidatus competibacter portibacter planktosalinus and thioalkalivibrio were more connected in the biological system fig s10b 3 4 variation of basic properties antibiotics and heavy metals in ltps as presented in table s5 food waste leachate showed a low ph value of 4 09 0 18 while ph tended to be neutral in other leachates the cod contents 3 400 117 100 mg l were quite high in raw leachate with a mean removal efficiency of 83 9 by mbr treatment likewise mbr performed well in removing tn nh3 n tp and doc with mean removal efficiencies of 73 2 99 2 90 3 and 91 6 respectively 31 antibiotics 14 sas 6 qns 6 tcs and 5 mls were detected fig 7 a and tcs were the predominate antibiotic class detected the total antibiotic content in leachate ranged from 3 210 to 28 643 ng l and obviously higher levels were found in landfill leachate the average removal efficiencies of sas qns tcs and mls by mbr were 84 1 77 5 74 6 and 79 5 respectively fig s11 heavy metal contents ranged from undetected to 103 μg l fig 7b waste incineration plant leachate possessed the greatest metal content several heavy metal cu zn cd and pb contents dropped sharply via the mbr process and the total content was decreased to 114 5 and 69 8 μg l after nf and ro processes respectively 3 5 correlations of environmental factors with args and their contributions spearman correlation analysis was conducted to study the relationships between basic properties heavy metals antibiotics and args tables s6 s7 and s8 while canonical correspondence analysis cca revealed the correlations between environmental factors and bacterial communities fig s12 briefly heavy metals and antibiotics showed greater interactions with bacteria in leachate and sludge while basic properties exhibited stronger correlations with args in effluents based on these findings three sems were built to clarify the contributions of diverse factors to args dynamics fig 8 for raw leachate fig 8a bacterial composition showed the most significant correlation with args while it was negatively correlated with mges however bacterial alpha diversity had a positive effect on mges both heavy metals and antibiotics exhibited adverse effects on bacterial composition and args moreover basic properties contributed differently to args and mges with nitrogen and organic matter positively correlated with args and mges respectively for the biological system fig 8b mges was the dominant driver contributing to args while bacterial composition affected args indirectly by directly influencing mges heavy metals showed strong correlations with bacterial communities in different sludge groups most metals e g cu mn ni co cr and as were positively correlated with excess sludge and dewatered sludge but negatively related to activated sludge in addition sas and tcs showed great impacts on anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively for the filtration system fig 8c basic properties and heavy metals were the two main driving factors for args fate while bacterial communities and mges showed weaker impacts in particular tn cod ni as and pb were the most strongly correlated with args 0 57 ρ 0 63 4 discussion 4 1 args behaved differently during ad and mbr bio treatment not surprisingly args were ubiquitous and widely detected in the two ltps and they were resistant to almost all types of antibiotics used in human animal disease therapy hendriksen et al 2019 the fate of args behaved differently during ad and mbr bio treatment that is ad could effectively reduce args diversity and abundance while anoxic aerobic tanks in mbr may act as incubators and increase the proliferation potential of args as a pretreatment process for high cod leachate ad performs well in reducing organic load and facilitates subsequent aerobic treatment we insist that ad is a feasible and valid process in the elimination of args in ltps the removal effect of ad may be related to its operating conditions leachate and args properties high temperature 35 38 c and long sludge retention time srt 25 30 days are favorable conditions for the removal of args by ad sui et al 2016 furthermore the selective pressure of the acidogenic phase and anaerobic condition may disrupt the bacterial hosts of args leading to the release and degradation of args wu et al 2016 due to extremely high levels of contaminants in leachate args propagation could also be hindered by multiple stresses they receive vancomycin amphenicol and fluoroquinolone classes had higher lrv with resistance mechanisms mainly related to protection and regulators while mlsb and tetracycline classes primarily encoding antibiotic deactivation and efflux pumps had lower lrv therefore we speculate that resistance mechanisms of args can be instructive in influencing their fate and deserve more investigation in contrast higher abundances of args and mges were found in the anoxic aerobic tanks of mbr than leachate indicating that mbr bio treatment was not effective in removing args similar phenomena have been observed for food waste and landfill ltps li et al 2021 wang et al 2020a thus the desirable args removal capacity of mbr mainly relied on the membrane filtration process pei et al 2019 on the one hand suitable ph temperature and nutrients in mbr tanks favored the rapid growth of microbes and facilitated the proliferation of args accordingly excess sludge and dewatered sludge became the most critical args reservoirs due to sludge adsorption and precipitation and thus should be carefully considered for proper disposal on the other hand the short srt and large sludge return ratio of ao ao process promoted the homogenization of args distribution therefore the diversity and abundance of args was maintained at a consistent level in the mbr tanks unlike args chemical contaminants such as antibiotics nh3 n and cod could be effectively removed by mbr bio treatment which was mainly due to combined biodegradation and adsorption processes zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 briefly antibiotics can be partially biodegraded by microorganisms compared to tcs sas and qns were more biodegradable due to their smaller molecular mass and simpler structures oberoi et al 2019 instead heavy metals were removed mostly by sludge adsorption and precipitation 4 2 integrated membrane filtration played critical roles in args removal in total 180 genes were removed by integrated membrane filtration uf nf ro and the absolute abundance of args was reduced from about 109 copies ml in raw leachate to 103 105 copies ml in effluents showing a significant removal of args lrv 3 6 notably args abundances decreased to levels below those found in rivers and reservoirs after uf nf processes chen et al 2019b li et al 2020 and fell to similar levels as tap water after the ro process su et al 2018 which evidently reduced the amr dissemination risk to receiving environments previous studies analyzed the microfiltration mf ro process to treat reclaimed water showing high removal efficiencies of args by mf lrv 1 0 4 3 and ro lrv 1 6 3 8 lu et al 2020 these evidences emphasize the critical roles of membrane filtration in args removal the main mechanism of args removal by membrane filtration is size exclusion and electrostatic interaction cell colloid interaction and membrane fouling may be additional mechanisms krzeminski et al 2020 liang et al 2021 slipko et al 2019 our study showed that lrv ranged from 0 74 4 87 0 44 1 82 and 0 62 1 98 for args by uf nf and ro processes respectively notably the small uf membrane pores 30 40 nm can greatly intercept suspended colloidal particles and bacteria during mbr treatment resulting in a sharp reduction of args abundances in uf effluents in general most bacteria and plasmids such as e coli radius 0 2 0 4 μm length 1 3 μm and supercoiled plasmid molecules radius 71 nm length 455 nm were much larger than the pore size of uf membranes slipko et al 2019 colloidal particles e g protein polysaccharide in leachate can also interact with dna and cells to improve the membrane removal efficiency of args pei et al 2019 moreover negatively charged dna containing args would be repelled by negatively charged membranes due to electrostatic repulsion ager et al 2009 however a certain amount of args still persisted in the filtration effluents which can be explained from three aspects firstly dna can penetrate nanopores due to its special size shape and flexibility arkhangelsky et al 2011 previous studies have found that double stranded plasmid dna with a diameter of 350 nm can penetrate 10 nm membrane pores by stretching into long hair shaped flexible strands and move in a snake like manner at highly converging flow arkhangelsky et al 2011 latulippe and zydney 2011 pressure driven membrane filtration may deform bacteria causing intracellular fluid to escape thereby reducing cell volume and promoting dna to drag through membranes liang et al 2021 secondly args may be present in free dna forms e g linear fragments plasmid molecules extracellular dna or associated with other non retained microorganisms le et al 2018 linear dna fragments and plasmid molecules are more flexible than supercoiled structures and can extend across membranes latulippe and zydney 2011 morão et al 2011 in addition eargs are more recalcitrant compared to iargs as they usually cannot be removed simultaneously with the elimination of arbs lan et al 2019 thirdly bacteria remaining in effluents can use nutrients to further proliferate and induce args under the selective pressures of heavy metals and antibiotics due to long term operation membranes may be biologically contaminated and some biofilms on their surface may be shed to effluents nevertheless args can be further removed by nf 1 10 nm and ro 0 1 1 nm processes showing higher lrv for tetracycline fluoroquinolone beta lactamase and others resistance genes some variations were also observed for example nf showed lower removal ability for sulfonamide and mrgs classes while ro performed poorly in removing trimethoprim and mlsb classes args removal could be related to their different characteristics and membrane selectivity which deserves a follow up study unexpectedly we observed an increase in the relative abundance of mges in effluents compared to leachate suggesting that additional bacteria were equipped with mges during filtration treatment li et al 2021 more diverse and flexible forms of mges may explain this phenomenon especially for insertion sequences and transposases which may cross uf nf membranes in specific shapes under high operating pressure these mges were mainly existed in extracellular free dna fragments or plasmid molecules as most bacteria have been intercepted by uf membranes slipko et al 2019 interestingly the replacement of nf membranes in autumn and ro membranes in spring resulted in lower args removal in the corresponding seasons new membranes may allow more args to pass through while fouled membranes may contribute to higher args removal due to pore clogging and fouling layer characteristics cheng and hong 2017 however excessive membrane biofouling can reduce filtration capacity and flux thereby increasing energy consumption based on the trade off between args removal effects and operating costs mbr followed by the nf process is essential for args removal while ro can be chosen according to actual situations 4 3 identifying key drivers affecting args dynamics in full scale ltps as indicated by sems args dynamics in raw leachate biological system and filtration system were influenced to varying degrees by multiple drivers for raw leachate bacterial composition was the overriding driver for args enhancement microbes as hosts of args showed strong correlations with args however the effect of mges on args was weak indicating a low potential for hgt this highlighted that vertical gene transfer vgt could be the dominate pathway affecting the fate of args via bacteria proliferation in extremely high contamination environments similar results were found in landfill leachate wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2018 most heavy metals were positively correlated with bacterial genera in waste incineration plant leachate due to their remarkably high levels likewise bacteria in landfill leachate were closely associated with most antibiotics as the highest content occurred in landfills thus both heavy metals and antibiotics can pose selective pressure on microbes and influence their composition in ltps zhao et al 2018 moreover bacterial α diversity can positively influence the dynamics of mges and further indirectly affect args conversely bacterial composition can have a significant negative effect on mges this reflected the phenomenon that mges and args in leachate were differentially shaped by microbial diversity and composition notably the bacteria in leachate contained a wide range of pathogens based on the network analysis we identified several hub genera e g klebsiella vibrio aeromonas that were capable of encoding diverse args klebsiella spp a pathogen that frequently causes human infections is responsible for the production of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase kpc and extended spectrum β lactamase esbl resulting in strains harboring a super resistome navon venezia et al 2017 podschun and ullmann 1998 moreover higher levels of vibrio spp were found which may cause several clinical manifestations such as cholera and vibriosis baker austin et al 2018 therefore the associations between microorganisms in leachate especially pathogens and args may amplify the environmental dissemination risks of args and deserves in depth attention to better control their spread for biological systems mges significantly affected the occurrence of args including integrases inti1 inti2 transposases tnpa 1 tnpa 2 is613 plasmid pakd1 incp 1β and insertion sequences is26 is256 ispps1 pseud etc among them integrases and insertion sequences were the two main mges significantly correlated with args pearson s r 0 68 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively moreover the abundances of insertion sequences especially is26 is6100 issm2 xanthob and is1247 were obviously higher than other mges and widely detected throughout the system figs 3 and s1 therefore we infer that hgt was the main mechanism for args propagation during bio treatment and insertion sequences would enhance the mobilization and dissemination of args besides bacterial composition was positively correlated with mges and in turn indirectly affected the args thus microorganisms also played critical roles in regulating the fate of args previous studies have well illustrated the critical roles of integrases and transposases in the propagation of args in different matrices sun et al 2022b yu et al 2020a while other mges have been less explored insertion sequences are dna segments that can move autonomously mainly through a non replicative mechanism to facilitate mobilization within or between dna molecules partridge et al 2018 significant associations were found not only between insertion sequences and args but also with bacteria and even some pathogens issm2 xanthob one of the insertion sequences was identified as a hub gene in the network and was frequently associated with various bacterial genera figs 6 and s10b thus insertion sequences may affect the bacteria behaviors and further shape the dynamics of args previous studies have proposed that these strong associations existed mostly in human animal and wastewater impacted environments razavi et al 2020 we speculated that the complex leachate sludge environments would significantly enhance the mobilization of args by insertion sequences plasmids can independently replicate host chromosomes and transfer between bacterial cells which was thought to be another crucial pathway of hgt bottery et al 2019 higher abundances of plasmids in the mbr tanks may accelerate the dissemination of args during biological processes moreover the continuous flow state and suitable incubation conditions of biological systems would be more favorable for hgt of args than the static and highly contaminated state of leachate for filtration system args dynamics depended strongly on nutrients and heavy metals as they can be present in the dissolved state and removed thoroughly until the ro stage in contrast bacteria and mges showed a weak influence on args the associations between args and microbes in effluents were further apart as membrane separation led to an obvious reduction of bacterial biomass however we found that the bacterial α diversity showed positive correlations with mges although membrane filtration significantly removed the majority of bacteria and reduced their abundances the bacterial α diversity remained relative high level in filtration system table s4 and fig s6 moreover mges especially for insertion sequences and transposases were found in high relative abundance in filtrates therefore we hypothesized that microorganisms with low abundance but high diversity could be potential hosts for these mges although they mainly existed in extracellular form yu et al 2020b it is common to observe significant correlations between args and heavy metals because they may act as selective agents for args proliferation via the co selection process including co resistance and cross resistance baker austin et al 2006 ni as pb and cr were the four main metals contributing to co selection of args in effluents even at low concentration metals can pose selective pressures on the microbiome and amr and affect hgt efficiency rilstone et al 2021 moreover basic water properties e g tn nh3 n and cod significantly altered the fate of args as these substances can influence the growth of bacteria by regulating nutrient conditions sun et al 2022a however the factors we selected above explained less of the args variation in the filtration system r2 0 59 than in raw leachate r2 0 89 and the biological system r2 0 93 suggesting that args dynamics in effluents were determined more by intrinsic mechanisms than by extrinsic factors 5 conclusion this study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of the removal behavior and key drivers of args in full scale ltps using integrated biological and membrane filtration treatments the main findings are as follows biological treatment has limited capacity to remove args in ltps instead the anoxic aerobic tanks in mbr may serve as incubators for args proliferation excess and dewatered sludge were the most critical args reservoirs and should be disposed of properly nevertheless ad proved to be a feasible and valid process for leachate pretreatment and args removal membrane filtration processes played key roles in args removal with a high lrv of 3 6 the removal behavior depended on membrane selectivity resistance mechanism and the forms of args in particular nf and ro processes were found to be pretty effective reducing args levels to below those found in natural water bodies and thus alleviating amr risks bacterial composition mges and basic properties were key drivers shaping args dynamics in the raw leachate biological system and filtration system respectively the close associations between pathogens and args in leachate may amplify the risks of args dissemination while mges especially insertion sequences in the biological system would enhance the mobilization and dissemination of args by hgt however the fate of args in effluents were less influenced by environmental factors declaration of competing
