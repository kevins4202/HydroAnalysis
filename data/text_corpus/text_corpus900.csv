4500,the sea surface temperature sst southern oscillation index soi and north atlantic oscillation nao as the oceanic atmospheric parameters could be used as input parameters for long term drought modeling this study for the first time in hydro climatic studies applies the concept of the z number valued if then rules to predict the monthly dry wet and normal periods in contrast to the classic fuzzy logic which does not talk about the confidence and reliability of data and information z numbers consist of restraint and reliability and have significant potential to describe the uncertainty of human knowledge to highlight this approach classified monthly standardized precipitation index spi of two synoptic stations of tabriz and kermanshah in iran as predictands and different lags of sst time series of surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas nao and soi indices as predictors for 1955 2019 were used to construct teleconnection between inputs and outputs and the obtained results were compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy model the results indicated that the approach using z numbers could lead to more comprehensive and accurate results averagely up to 146 and 590 respectively for the kermanshah and tabriz owing to its ability to consider uncertainty and reliability of information and allocating appropriate weights to the rules keywords hydro climatologic processes teleconnection standardized precipitation index oceanic atmospheric indices fuzzy modeling z numbers 1 introduction due to the importance of extreme weather events several researchers have already investigated the impacts of large scale ocean atmospheric parameters at the climate extreme events e g see camberlin et al 2001 degefu and bewket 2017 elsanabary and gan 2015 ghasemi and khalili 2006 nazemosadat and ghaedamini 2010 such studies have shown the importance of large scale ocean atmospheric parameters in dealing with extreme events for examples camberlin et al 2001 indicated a significant relationship between south of the african sahara rainfall and atlantic sea surface temperature sst rowell 2003 investigated the influence of sst of the mediterranean sea on the african sahel rainfall stefan et al 2004 stated the impact of continuous positive periods of north atlantic oscillation nao on romania drought tadesse et al 2004 indicated the teleconnection between drought episodes of nebraska usa and several oceanic and climatic indices such as nao and southern oscillation index soi recently ying et al 2019 indicated the effect of global warming on tropical rainfall response to local sst anomalies likewise a few researches reported the impacts of large scale ocean atmospheric parameters on hydro climatologic systems of iran e g see dezfuli et al 2010 ghasemi and khalili 2008 meidani and araghinejad 2014 nazemosadat et al 2006 raziei et al 2009 the drought index is commonly utilized to monitor drought wet and normal periods to this end several drought indices were developed to evaluate drought or flood events belayneh and adamowski 2012 cancelliere et al 2007 mckee et al 1993 mishra and singh 2010 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the standardized precipitation index spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 is the most commonly used index the spi is a normalized index and can be used for the comparison of spi values among different locations because of the complexity and uncertainties of the long distance teleconnection processes the correlation between spi and oceanic atmospheric indices is very poor and classic black box models may not prove useful dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a the above mentioned researches used the same traditional methods e g linear and nonlinear regression or correlation to discover the potential teleconnection between hydro climatic parameters but when dealing with large scale extreme events e g drought events that are influenced by remote factors data mining tools can be appropriate alternatives to the conventional methods e g autoregressive integrated moving average and artificial intelligence based methods such as artificial neural network which are commonly used to perform short term predictions the data mining based association rules can be used to investigate highly uncertain processes and large scale extreme events by generating the rules that indicate the cause effect relationship among the various combinations of the hydro climatic variables danandeh mehr et al 2017a dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b nourani et al 2017 tadesse et al 2004 large scale teleconnection between hydro climatic parameters is a complex system and determining its accurate state in the future is difficult it is believed that fuzzy logic can partly reflect such uncertainty fuzzy logic has been widely used in the last few decades to model complex systems because of its capacity to deal with nonlinearity and uncertainty of the processes which are common in the hydro climatic issues e g see awan and bae 2016 gutenson et al 2018 he et al 2019 nadiri et al 2019 nivesh et al 2018 nourani et al 2014 nourani and komasi 2013 dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a used combined data mining and fuzzy logic method for point prediction of summer monsoon rainfall of india using different atmospheric indices as predictors the result of this study was reported based on correlation coefficient cc and root mean squared error rmse also according to legates and mccabe 1999 the determination coefficient dc criterion instead of cc should be used along with rmse to assess the performance of hydro environmental models the results of this study indicated the weak performance of point prediction in teleconnection modeling since the standardized predicted values indicated a difference of more than 50 with the observed values consequently some previous studies attempted to do point prediction to investigate large scale teleconnection but this is not easy since due to the complexity of the long distance teleconnection processes and weak correlation between predictors and predictands the point prediction output will show a weak performance e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a and it is believed that class prediction could be an appropriate alternative to deal with such situations e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b the principal problem of the classic fuzzy based method is its weakness when dealing with the vague conditions often involved in realistic settings despite the widespread application of the classic fuzzy logic concept it is critical to talk about the confidence and reliability of the analyzed information because the classic fuzzy variables only include constraints and do not provide reliability for example the decision which was accepted based on low reliability data tends to be useless or even harmful to practical usage glukhoded and smetanin 2016 thus the concept of z number presented by zadeh 2011 has received much attention from engineers recently the z number has notable potential in demonstrating the uncertainty of human science as both the expert s opinion and the z number consist of the constraint and reliability of the measured data abiyev et al 2018 aboutorab et al 2018 kang et al 2018a saravi et al 2019 a z number is an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers denoted as z a b the first component a is a restriction on the value of uncertain variable x the second component b is a measure of reliability for the first component typically a and b are presented in a natural language for instance finding parking near the campus in the early morning as uncertain variable x usually is difficult z a difficult b usually or sst of black sea as x seldom is very high z a very high r seldom the second component b here usually and seldom is the main difference between conventional fuzzy and z number that specifies the reliability of the value of uncertain variable x however the main problem here is quantification and algebraic operations on these linguistic variables for example what are the procedures of computation of approximately 1 hr usually approximately 45 min usually there are at least three methods of aggregation for the z numbers as i converting z numbers into simple fuzzy numbers and aggregating them using simple methods kang et al 2018b ii aggregating a and b parts separately glukhoded and smetanin 2016 iii obtaining z number based on z number aggregating z numbers and then obtaining z number based on given z number aliev et al 2016 2015 zadeh 2011 z number like z number is an ordered pair z a r where a plays the same role as in a z number but r is a probability distribution of the random number the concept and utilization of the first i and second ii approaches are easy but they may lose some information from an expert and are not applicable to all fuzzy numbers in the third approach the loss of information is minimized but it is more complicated and requires some non linear optimization algorithms glukhoded and smetanin 2016 therefore one of the principal objectives of this research was to modify and develop a code in matlab software based on a modified version of the third approach to make it easy to be used in various fields of engineering economics analysis and decision making as well as hydro climatic issues by developing this code and considering the teleconnections between large scale hydro climatic signals the concept of the z number valued if then rules was used in this study to predict the long term monthly dry wet and normal periods as the first application of z numbers in hydro climatic studies in this regard the classified spi data of kermanshah and tabriz stations in the northwest of iran were predicted using monthly sst time series of surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas nao and soi indices as predictors via the proposed method and the obtained results were then compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy logic method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in the current research the spi data of two synoptic stations in the northwest of iran located at 38 05 n 46 17 e tabriz and 34 21 n 47 90 e kermanshah with the altitudes of about 1350 m above sea level also ssts of the surrounding seas black mediterranean and red nao and soi indices were adopted for implementing the proposed technique see fig 1 the used precipitation data for computation of spi were obtained from the iran meteorological organization http www irimo ir and the monthly sst data were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website http www esrl noaa gov psd cgi bin data timeseries timeseries1 pl where the monthly sst data are accessible for 1 grid squares of the seas it is worth mentioning that the monthly ssts of the chosen grid points for each sea were averaged and applied in this research as the sst time series of each sea in addition the monthly soi and nao data were obtained from the noaa https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the time series data of 65 years from 1955 to 2019 were employed in the modeling process as previous studies the first 75 part of the data considered as the training set and the rest 25 2003 2019 as the test data set although the data were divided into calibration and test sets it should be noted that for the fuzzy logic method z number based model if the rules are correctly determined there is practically no need for the calibration since there is not any parameter for that and data division here is just to see the capability of the derived rules table 1 presents more information about the data used in this research precipitation fluctuations of different regions of iran are not significant and such fluctuations can be found only in western iran see fig 2 also only the west of iran is affected by ssts of the red mediterranean and black seas for this reason in this study the data of tabriz station in northwestern iran and kermanshah station close to the center of western iran which have data with appropriate quality and quantity were used as the representative of western iran 2 2 influence of teleconnection on hydro climatologic systems of iran climatic oceanic indices such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo nao soi and el niño southern oscillation enso provide important predictive information about hydrologic variability in regions around the world soukup et al 2009 it is believed that sst is the main factor almost in all of such indices the pdo is based on the monthly sea surface temperature variability of the north pacific ocean in decadal scale mantua and hare 2002 the continuing sequences of long duration changes in the sea surface temperature of the north atlantic ocean are termed as amo with the cool and warm phases that can last from 20 to 40 years for a period enfield et al 2001 el niño is one of the largest oscillations of the climate system and is defined as warmer than the normal condition of pacific ocean surface temperature in eastern parts commonly used enso indices include regional sst indices e g nino 1 2 nino 3 nino 4 and nino 3 4 meidani and araghinejad 2014 soi is an atmospheric pressure based index and is the standardized anomaly of the mean sea level pressure difference tadesse et al 2004 a positive soi means la niña and a negative soi indicates el niño conditions the nao index is the winter climate variability mode in north atlantic ocean and is defined as the difference in normalized mean winter december march sea level pressure anomalies between iceland and portugal hurrell 1995 although there is only a little literature on teleconnection impacts of ssts on precipitations over iran several researches reported the impacts of large scale ocean atmospheric parameters such as enso nazemosadat et al 2006 raziei et al 2009 enso and nao dezfuli et al 2010 hosseinzadeh talaee et al 2014 on hydro climatologic systems of iran in this regard ghasemi and khalili 2006 indicated the impact of the arctic oscillation ao on the winter surface air temperature over iran nazemosadat and ghaedamini 2010 demonstrated the impact of madden julian oscillation mjo on precipitation of southern iran and arabian peninsula nazemosadat et al 2006 showed the impact of enso on climate change of iran also raziei et al 2009 demonstrated the impact of enso on hydrological droughts in western iran hosseinzadeh talaee et al 2014 investigated the impact of enso and nao on hydrological drought of hamedan in the west of iran utilizing the standardized streamflow index and showed the teleconnection impact of enso on hydrological drought of hamedan dezfuli et al 2010 indicated the teleconnection impact of nao and soi on meteorological drought over southwest of iran thus according to the above mentioned literature the nao and soi indices could be used to monitor drought episodes in northwest of iran meidani and araghinejad 2014 derived the significant relationship between the streamflow of southwestern iran and the sst of the mediterranean sea the results of this study showed that application of sst as predictors of streamflow in southwestern iran led to better performance than when using nao pdo and amo indices rezaebanafsheh et al 2011 studied the relations of winter and autumn precipitation with previous season anomalies of mediterranean sst in several stations in west of iran and showed that the cooler condition of the sea in autumn has led to wetter winter ghasemi and khalili 2008 indicated that the wet conditions in iran are found to be characterized by a negative sst anomaly in the mediterranean and the black sea while dry conditions are found to be characterized by a positive sst anomaly in the mediterranean and the black sea analyses of the results also revealed that the winter precipitation in iran is mainly related to the black mediterranean and red seas rahimikhoob 2010 demonstrated the teleconnection impact of ssts of the persian gulf and the red sea on mp of ilam in west of iran hydro climatic indices such as pdo nao amo soi and ssts could be used as predictors of the long term precipitation but in regions surrounding by seas priority could be on using the ssts of the surrounding seas meidani and araghinejad 2014 previous studies have mostly focused on the correlation of enso and nao with iran s hydrological cycle while iran is surrounded by seas and use of their ssts could improve the forecasting results meidani and araghinejad 2014 this may be due to the fact that the mediterranean black and red seas as sources of moisture of western iran are placed on western iran affecting various areas around for example in the cold period of the year due to the warm sst of the mediterranean sea compared to the air temperature the continental polar and polar maritime air masses by crossing the mediterranean sea and gaining heat from it become unstable and turn into the mediterranean air masses that provide winter rainfall in most parts of iran in terms of physical dependency approximately 70 of the cyclones that move into iran originate from either in the black sea or in the mediterranean sea these low pressure systems enter the country through the northwestern or western provinces the other 30 of the cyclones mainly originate from in north africa and the red sea and come to the country through saudi arabia and the persian gulf in other words two main air currents influence the winter precipitation in iran one is the western current and the other is the southern current ghasemi and khalili 2008 seemingly in the winter of the northern hemisphere while the red sea and the persian gulf act as powerful sources of water vapor and trigger little precipitation locally due to descending air in the hadley cell the mediterranean lake of low pressure lying between the two regions of high pressure in the north atlantic centered at about 30 n and those over asia at about 45 n cause the westerly prevailing winds move along the north coast of africa towards iran kendrew 1922 iran is one of the world s most mountainous countries the two main mountain chains consist of the zagros and the alborz mountains located in the northwestern western and northern parts of iran tabriz and kermanshah stations are located in northwest of iran with annual precipitation 283 and 443 mm respectively fig 2 indicates the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in western iran earlier researches revealed that the precipitation over northwest of iran is not significantly affected by the sst of the persian gulf and the caspian sea which may be mostly due to the obstacle made by alborz and zagros mountain ranges nourani et al 2017 raziei et al 2008 and therefore their sst data were not considered in the current modeling water bodies temperatures influence precipitation patterns also droughts throughout the world so when ssts of oceans or seas change precipitation patterns tend to change as well in addition sst is the main factor almost in all of the above mentioned indices e g amo pdo enso etc even the nao and soi indices are strongly correlated with large scale changes in ssts of the atlantic and pacific oceans travasso et al 2009 wang et al 2004 consequently in this study in addition to nao and soi indices ssts of surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas as sources of moisture of iran western were used for prediction of tabriz and kermanshah drought wet and normal episodes via spi 2 3 the standard precipitation index spi the spi is calculated using only precipitation data making it relatively easy for application and evaluation the standard drought index is independent of the geographical location because the desired index is calculated according to the average precipitation of the same place cacciamani et al 2007 the spi index is computed based on precipitation data at least 30 years cumulated over a chosen time scale belayneh et al 2014 as spi can be calculated over different precipitation accumulation periods typically varying from 1 to 48 months the resulting different spi indices allow for estimating different potential impacts of meteorological drought or flood as spi could be determined over different precipitation accumulation periods typically varying from 1 to 48 months the result of different spi index could be used to estimate possible consequences of meteorological drought or flood in this study for each station spi 1 one month was computed to predict dry wet and normal episodes as presented in table 2 the monthly spi values of the stations were classified into seven classes 2 4 proposed methodology the schematic procedure of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in fig 3 the proposed methodology in the current study contains 4 distinct steps i e data pre processing extraction of the association rules modeling by z number and conventional fuzzy tools and finally comparing and evaluating the obtained results using sst soi and nao monthly time series to predict the occurrence of different drought wet and normal episodes according spi values at the first step as presented in table 3 the monthly ssts and nao data were classified into five classes of very high vh high h medium m low l and very low vl within bounds of µ iσ where µ and σ are respectively average and standard division of time series and for ssts i 1 1 5 and for nao i 2 3 the monthly soi data were classified into seven classes of extremely high eh vh h m l vl and extremely low el within bounds of µ iσ where i 0 5 1 and 1 5 on the other hand the monthly spi values of the stations were classified into seven classes see table 2 at the second step the association rule data mining method was used to discover the patterns among the ssts nao and soi and spi datasets to construct if then rules in addition the confidence measure of each association rule was calculated to evaluate the degrees of the reliability of rules at the third step conventional fuzzy modeling and z number based modeling were applied by the means of the patterns found in the second step therefore if then rules were constructed and then the modeling was conducted it is notable that in z number rules the reliability part of z number was created with the help of the confidence criterion of association rule and the frequency of occurrence of the sst nao and soi classifications i e vl l etc then the rules were weighted using the z numbers distance concept and the best rules were selected and aggregated so at the training phase the possible teleconnections could be found between the monthly spi t sst t i nao t i and soi t i time series ssts nao and soi at different lags as 1 spi t f s s t t i j nao t i soi t i where i represents the number of lag time and j 1 2 and 3 stands for the sst of the black mediterranean and res seas finally at the fourth step the results of both methods classic fuzzy and z number were evaluated and compared with each other based on the used efficiency criteria in the following the main components of the proposed methodology i e association rules z numbers and evaluation criteria are briefly reviewed 2 5 association rule the dominant patterns of large databases can be extracted by association rule mining the association rule a b represents whenever a as antecedent occurs b as consequent also occurs with a certain probability the validity of such rules is determined by support and confidence criteria the support criterion eq 2 shows the ratio of simultaneous events of a and b to all events the confidence criterion eq 3 shows the ratio of simultaneous events of a and b to the total events of a han et al 2011 2 support a b p a b 3 confidence a b p a b support a b support a for more details about association rule mining the readers are referred to han et al 2011 2 6 description of z number concept zadeh 2011 presented a z number associated with the uncertain variable x as an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers a b where a is a restriction on the value of uncertain variable x and b is a measure of reliability for the uncertain variable x the concept of z numbers is used to perform calculations with data that is not entirely reliable in the following sub sections of the z number definitions are briefly described but for more details readers are referred to aliev et al 2015 and zadeh 2011 2 6 1 discrete z number briefly a discrete fuzzy number is a fuzzy number with convex membership function r 0 1 and with finite support of supp a x 1 x s in which x 1 x s r with x 1 x 2 x s a discrete z number is an ordered pair z a b of discrete fuzzy numbers a and b a plays the role of a fuzzy constraint on values that a random variable x may take b is a discrete fuzzy number with a membership function μb b 1 b s 0 1 b 1 b s 0 1 playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on the probability measure of a p a i 1 s μ a x i p x i p a supp b a concept of a discrete z number is closely related to the concept of a discrete z number given a discrete z number z a b z number is a pair consisting of a fuzzy number a and a random number r z a r where a plays the same role as it does in a discrete z number and r plays the role of the probability distribution for b aliev et al 2015 2 6 2 z valued if then rules based reasoning a problem of interpolation of z rules termed as z interpolation was addressed by zadeh 2011 this problem is the generalization of the interpolation of fuzzy rules kóczy and hirota 1991 the problem of z interpolation is given below given the following n z rules if x 1 is zx 1 1 a x 1 1 b x 1 1 and and xm is zx m 1 a x m 1 b x m 1 then y is zy ay 1 by 1 if x 1 is zx 1 2 a x 1 2 b x 1 2 and and xm is zx m 2 a x m 2 b x m 2 then y is zy ay 2 by 2 if x 1 is zx 1 n a x 1 n b x 1 n and and xm is zx m n a x m n b x m n then y is zy ay n by n and a current observation as x 1 is ź x 1 á x 1 b x 1 and and xm is z x m á x m b x m it is interesting to find the z value of y z y for the observation here m is the number of z valued input variables and n is the number of rules the idea underlying the suggested interpolation approach is that the ratio of distances between the resulting output and the consequent parts is equal to one between the current input and the antecedent parts kóczy and hirota 1991 this implies for z rules that the resulting output z y is computed as 4 z â y j 1 nn w â j z y j j 1 nn w â j a y j b y j where 5 w â j w j j 1 nn w j w h e r e n n i s t h e n u m b e r o f s e l e c t e d r u l e s h i g h w e i g h t r u l e s 6 w j 1 ρ j j 1 n 1 ρ j j 1 n 7 ρ j i 1 m d z xi z xi j 8 d z 1 z 1 d a 1 a 2 d b 1 b 2 where 9 d a 1 a 2 sup d h a 1 α a 2 α 0 α 1 where d h is fuzzy hausdorff distance 10 d h a 1 a 2 α 0 1 α d h α a 1 a 2 w h e r e u i n d i c a t e s t h e u n i o n s o f c l a s s i c s e t s where zy is the z number valued consequent of the jth rule wj j 1 n are coefficients of linear interpolation and n is the number of z rules d is the distance between current ith z number valued input and the ith z number valued antecedent of the jth rule thus ρ computes the distance between a current input vector and the vector of the antecedents of the jth rule the rules are weighted based on equations 6 10 and only the best rules are applied to equation 4 it is notable that to comply with the superposition principle w 1 w 2 w nn 1 the selected rules should be re weighted based on eq 5 although a low weight rule has a little negative impact on output simultaneous combining several low weight rules can have significant negative impacts on output for this reason and for decreasing the computational cost only high weight rules rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight are chosen in the adopted method of this paper the selected rules weights should be multiplied to z numbers it is notable that zy λ zx ax bx is obtained as zy zx λ a x bx thus the bx reliability part of z number is not affected by multiplying by λ so a scalar multiplication of a discrete fuzzy number a by a real number λ r is the discrete fuzzy number a 1 λa whose α cut is defined as aliev et al 2016 aliev et al 2015 11 a 1 α x λ s u p p a m i n λ a α x m a x λ a α where 12 λ s u p p a λ x x s u p p a m i n λ a α m i n λ x x a α m a x λ a α m a x λ x x a α and the membership function is defined as 13 μ λ a x s u p α 0 1 x λ a α w h e r e s u p i n d i c a t e s t h e s u p r e m u m o r m a x the operation of the addition of discrete z numbers which is used in the current study to aggregate the consequents of the selected rules is briefly described below 2 6 3 addition of discrete z numbers let z1 a 1 b 1 and z2 a 2 b 2 be discrete z numbers describing imperfect information about values of variables x 1 and x 2 consider the problem of computation of addition z 12 z 1 z 2 the first stage is the addition computation of discrete fuzzy numbers a 12 a 1 a 2 based on following concept for discrete fuzzy numbers a 1 a 2 their addition a 12 a 1 a 2 is the discrete fuzzy number whose α cut is defined as aliev et al 2015 14 a 12 α x s u p p a 1 s u p p a 2 m i n a 1 α a 2 α x m a x a 1 α a 2 α where supp a1 supp a2 x1 x2 xj supp aj j 1 2 min a 1 α a 2 α min x1 x2 xj a j α j 1 2 max a 1 α a 2 α max x1 x2 xj a j α j 1 2 and the membership function is defined as 15 μ a 1 a 2 x s u p α 0 1 x a 1 α a 2 α the second stage involves the stage by stage construction of b 12 which is related to the propagation of probabilistic restrictions to this end first the z numbers should be determined based on z numbers of z 1 a 1 b 1 and z 2 a 2 b 2 but the true probability distributions p1 for z1 and p2 for z2 are not exactly known conversely the data are expressed by the fuzzy constraints as aliev et al 2015 zadeh 2011 16 k 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k i s b 1 k 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k i s b 2 where s1 is the number of supp a1 and s2 is the number of supp a2 expressed in terms of the membership functions as follows 17 i 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k i 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k thus the fuzzy sets of probability distributions of p 1 and p 2 will have the membership functions of 18 μ p 1 p 1 μ b 1 i 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k μ p 2 p 2 μ b 2 i 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k these fuzzy sets should be constructed bj j 1 2 is a discrete fuzzy number that plays the role of a soft constraint on a value of a probability measure of aj therefore basic values bjl supp bj l 1 s of a discrete fuzzy number bj are values of a probability measure of aj bjl p aj thus given bjl such probability distribution which satisfies the following condition has to be found 19 b jl μ aj x j 1 p j l x j 1 μ aj x j 2 x j 2 μ aj x js x js at the same time pjl has to satisfy 20 k 1 s p jl x jk 1 p jl x jk 0 consequently the above goal of programming problem eq 19 must be solved to compute pj l subject to eq 20 aliev et al 2015 zadeh 2011 it is notable that generally the answers of equations 19 and 20 are not unique to guarantee a unique answer the compatibility condition is defined as 21 k 1 s x jk p jl x jk k 1 s x jk μ aj x jk k 1 s μ aj x jk this points out that the centroid of aj is to coincide with that of pjl probability distributions xjk k 1 s naturally induce probabilistic uncertainty over the result x x 1 x 2 this implies that given any possible pair p 1 l p 2 l of the extracted distributions the convolution p 12q p 1 l p 2 l q 1 s2 is to be computed as 22 p 12 x x x 1 x 2 p 1 x 1 p 2 x 2 x x 12 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 the fuzzy sets of probability distributions p 1 l and p 2 l induce the fuzzy set of convolutions p 12q with the membership function defined as μp 12 p 12 max μp 1 p 1 μp 2 p 2 23 where is min operation as a result the fuzziness of information on p 12q described by μp 12 induces fuzziness of the value of probability measure a 12 as a discrete fuzzy number b 12 the membership function μ b 12 is defined as μ b 12 b 12q sup μp 12q p 12q 24 subject to 25 b 12 q k 1 t p 12 q x 12 k μ a 12 x 12 k where t is the number of supp a12 overall z 12 z 1 z 2 is obtained as z 12 a 12 b 12 where a 12 a1 a2 is obtained through eqs 14 15 in order to obtain b12 fuzzy sets of probability distributions of z1 and z2 i e pjl are obtained through eqs 19 21 in other words z1 and z2 are converted to z numbers after that the z 12 a 12 p12 x is obtained through eqs 22 23 finally the b 12 is obtained through eqs 24 25 in other words z 12 is converted to z number the described algorithm for two z numbers was used to develop a matlab code to perform the addition operation of several z numbers for outputs of several possible rules 2 7 efficiency criteria in this study seven types of output i e ed sd md n mw sw and ew could be achieved as dry wet or normal periods so the conventional evaluation criteria such as root mean square error or determination coefficient cannot be used in classification issues due to their need for numerical results or crisp

research a new approach for modeling teleconnections between hydro climatic indices sst nao and soi and wet normal and dry episodes based on spi index through the z number concept is introduced see fig 4 the z number based model consists of the restraint and reliability of variables and allows uncertainty measures to quantify the ambiguity related to the prediction of hydro climatic parameters to this aim as it is seen in tables 2 and 3 after categorizing the hydro climatic indices and monthly spi values the association rule was used to discover the teleconnection patterns between the sst and monthly spi training datasets to construct if then rules also z rules then by considering the categorized sets interval sets the codebook or fuzzy sets was constructed by expert opinion see fig 5 in other words the intervals by rigid bounds were converted to fuzzy sets in order to consider the uncertainty after constructing the rules conventional fuzzy and z number based modeling were applied to the data set finally the performances of the proposed models were investigated and the results were compared with each other fuzzy logic methods including z number require defining linguistic variables and construction of the if then rules the required pattern to construct if then rules was extracted by association rules for association rule mining the data should be first classified into some classes see dadaser celik et al 2013 dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a 2009b tadesse et al 2004 in this way input variables as antecedents the ssts of red mediterranean and black seas nao and soi indices were partitioned into five to seven linguistic ranges see table 3 while the degree of reliability was partitioned into seven ranges vl l low medium lm high medium hm h vh and eh also output variables as consequent spi index were partitioned into seven ranges see table 2 the extracted rules by association mining are sensitive to these classifications and with poor classification and good rules in terms of confidence and support criteria may not be extracted this categorization was done based on expert opinion also trial and error and previous works but the number of categorized parts in inputs and output could be less or more for recognizing the best thresholds and class numbers for categorizing ssts also nao and soi and extracting rules via association mining different states were tested and examined according to the literature danandeh mehr et al 2017a glukhoded and smetanin 2016 tadesse et al 2004 the monthly ssts nao and soi data were classified into some classes within bounds of µ iσ for i and different values were tested such as i 1 1 5 5 classes i 0 5 1 5 5 classes i 0 5 1 1 5 7 classes and i 2 3 five classes also the decision tree algorithm with c4 5 scheme quinlan 1992 was used for categorizing ssts nevertheless the best rules with high confidence and support were obtained using the method that defines µ iσ i 1 1 5 as thresholds for the ssts classes µ iσ i 0 5 1 1 5 as thresholds for the soi classes and µ iσ i 2 3 as thresholds for the nao classes similarly to categorize the reliability according to the literature e g see aliev et al 2016 different states were tested the degree of reliability was classified into seven five and three classes but better results were obtained by increasing the number of classes so considering the computational cost the seven classes were used for categorizing the degree of reliability it is notable that the association rule method considers the mentioned linguistic variables as an interval but for fuzzy logic based modeling these interval sets should be converted to fuzzy sets to this end 2 and 2 were respectively applied to the beginning and end of each interval in addition min and max fuzzy numbers were considered as trapezoidal membership function but triangular membership function was considered for other fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number with supports of a1 a2 and a3 can be defined by triplet 0 a 1 1 a 2 0 a 3 where a1 and a3 with value of 0 for memberships are the boundary points and a2 is a peak point or the most probable value with value of 1 for membership in addition the considered trapezoidal fuzzy number can be defined by triplet 1 a 1 1 a 2 0 a 3 for min fuzzy numbers or 0 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 for max fuzzy numbers the codebook containing linguistic terms of values of antecedents consequents and degrees of reliability is given in fig 5 for example according to above mentioned rigid bounds µ iσ for the black sea see table 3 the interval 4 33 19 42 could be considered as medium or m but by converting it into the fuzzy set the triangular fuzzy number of 0 4 24 1 11 87 0 19 80 should be considered as m see fig 5 at the second step the patterns among the sst nao and soi and monthly spi datasets were extracted by association rule and if then rules were constructed also confidence measure of association rules was calculated to evaluate degrees of reliability of rules for instance converting the extracted pattern to conventional fuzzy if then rule and z rule is as association rule black sea temperature m mediterranean sea temperature l red sea temperature l nao m soi m tabriz spi n confidence 1 conventional fuzzy if black sea temperature m mediterranean sea temperature l red sea temperature l nao m and soi m then tabriz spi n z number if black sea temperature m hm mediterranean sea temperature l l red sea temperature l l nao m eh and soi m lm then tabriz spi n eh in z rules the reliability parts of consequents spi values were created using the confidence criterion of association rules and for antecedents they were created using the frequency of occurrence of the classification of ssts nao and soi therefore the degrees of reliability for the classification of ssts nao and soi could be determined as presented in table 4 the current study is looking for the optimum lag of combined sst nao and soi series so to find the most dominant lags between inputs and output several input combinations with different lagged inputs were examined to train and test the models according to the literature in some studies the correlation coefficient has been used for finding optimum lag dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b to this end the cross correlation functions ccfs between monthly spi and sst nao and soi time series in both synoptic stations for different values of i lag were computed for example according to fig 6 a the sst t 1 for black sea sst t 1 for mediterranean sea sst t 1 for red sea nao t 7 and soi t 9 were dominant lags for prediction of tabriz spi t one month in advance because of complexity of teleconnection between spi and hydro climatic indices the correlations between spi and ssts were about 0 1 for tabriz spi and averagely up to 0 4 for kermanshah spi in addition the correlations between spi and nao and soi were about 0 1 for tabriz and kermanshah however due to the linear nature of ccf there is no guarantee that the afore mentioned lags are the best choices for accounting the possible non linear relationships so different combinations of the ssts nao and soi lags were used and examined for the association mining and to extract the rules also seasonal differencing e g sst t sst t 12 was applied to remove trends of sst nao and soi series and different combinations of the de trended sst nao and soi lags were also examined in the modeling nevertheless the comparative analysis indicated that the performances of the models for sst nao and soi with no pre processing and using the selected lags by ccf would lead to better performance in terms of the results of modeling by the de trended data this may be due to the nonlinear filters of z number based model e g membership functions that guarantee no need for applying other data pre processing e g de trending techniques as mentioned in the section 2 7 in this study the ta and hss criterion were used as evaluation criteria thus 1 at the first step the possibility of extracting appropriate patterns with the help of association mining to construct z rules was investigated in this way if the extracted patterns were acceptable in terms of confidence and support criteria e g existing the many patterns with confidence 0 6 the required rules z rules for modeling with z numbers were constructed it is notable that the threshold for confidence criterion could be selected based on the expert opinion 2 at the second step modeling was performed by the z number model and its performance was evaluated by ta and hss evaluation criteria this process was performed for different combinations of inputs trial and error and the best input combination was selected in terms of evaluation criteria ta and hss for each time step and station therefore by using ccf different lags of antecedents were determined as optimal lags and were used for modeling the drought wet and normal episodes of tabriz and kermanshah stations up to 5 months in advance see table 5 as it can be seen in table 5 for both stations and all time steps the ssts end up with lag 1 this may be due to short spatial distances between seas and synoptic stations however the selected lags for nao and soi were different for each time step of spi nao t 7 and soi t 9 were selected for prediction of tabriz spi t also nao t 7 and soi t 12 were selected for the prediction of kermanshah spi t also by increasing the time step of spi the appropriate lags for nao and soi decreased according to the long spatial distances between synoptic stations and atlantic and pacific oceans the large lags for nao and soi are reasonable the z rules could be constructed based on the linguistic variables defined earlier see fig 5 as codebook examples of examined rules are given in table 6 it is notable that one of the important advantages of z number based method over conventional methods is that unlike the previous studies that selected the rules by introducing thresholds for confidence support or j measures e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b 2009a tadesse et al 2004 all of the possible rules were used in this study and the quality reliability of rules were determined by reliability part of z numbers the rules list is completed when all possible scenarios are considered and there exists at least one rule whose antecedent part participates in the current antecedent valuation at least partially generally in the conventional fuzzy logic methods for n inputs with m categories for each input the number of rules could be up to mn for the current modeling up to 54 7 4375 the increase of the rules leads to complication of the formulization which is called curse of dimensionality jayawardena et al 2014 however in this research for each station and lag time different rule list 5 2 10 lists for z rules was considered and only 133 to 138 rules were considered and examined for each model due to the association rule mining e g see table 6 as an example in the case of lack of rules the classical reasoning methods based on the compositional rule of inference reasoning approach e g mamdani 1976 takagi and sugeno 1985 zadeh 1973 are not efficient enough to generate an output for the sample covered by no rules aliev et al 2015 so the inference techniques weighting the rules based on the concept of distance were used in this research which for the lack of matching rules could perform approximately reasonable namely z interpolated method also in this research only the high weight rules rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight were considered to compute the outputs furthermore the z number based model output as a z number pair of fuzzy numbers must be converted to single value for verifying and comparing purposes to this end the output z number could be converted to an interval value based on its reliability so according to the codebook the outputs with reliability eh were considered for comparing purposes for instance if the output 0 0 48 1 1 0 1 52 mw 0 0 88 1 0 95 0 1 e h then tabriz spi will be mw with eh reliability and the first part of z number mw is approved but if the output 0 0 48 1 1 0 1 52 mw 0 0 1 0 05 0 12 v l then tabriz spi will be vl with vl reliability and according to its low reliability its output could be every seven classes of spi consequently for comparing purposes the outputs with reliability eh were considered for computing the hss and ta criteria for conventional fuzzy modeling after the construction of if then rules for each lag through the association rule mining and expert judgment the rules with confidence greater than 0 5 were selected and mamdani fuzzy inference system fis with the minimum implication maximum for aggregation and centroid method for de fuzzification were used in this study similar to other studies e g jayawardena et al 2014 the z number modeling procedure is explained here with an example after the construction of z number valued if then rules for each lag e g see table 6 the output of the z number model is computed via the following steps for example consider the computation of the tabriz spi at time t june 2018 based on the values of ssts at time t 1 nao at time t 7 and soi at time t 9 black sea 17 557 mediterranean sea 19 481 red sea 30 159 nao 2 12 and soi 0 4 i the quantitative inputs are converted to fuzzy numbers based on ssts nao and soi classification see tables 2 and 3 and fig 5 so 17 557 19 481 30 159 2 12 0 4 are converted to m m h h m ii the degree of reliability of these fuzzy numbers is determined based on table 4 so the m m h h m is converted to m hm m hm h l h vl m lm as z numbers iii in this step the rules are weighted based on equations 4 10 and the best rules are selected rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight this threshold for selecting rules 0 9 or any other number must be selected based on expert opinion the number of rules and quality of the rules in terms of confidence criterion also support criterion could affect this threshold in this example rules 94 111 and 121 are selected see table 6 iv now the consequents of the selected rules as z numbers considering their computed weights are aggregated based on the method described in section 2 6 as seen in table 6 the consequents of rules 94 111 and 121 are tabriz spi md reliability lm tabriz spi md reliability lm and tabriz spi mw reliability lm that by applying computed weights and aggregating them the output is computed as 0 0 87 1 0 44 0 0 17 0 0 68 1 0 70 0 0 73 according to the codebook fig 5 this output indicates that the tabriz spi in june 2018 will be normal with the reliability to be high to understand the procedure of computation with z numbers better an example has been presented in appendix a as mentioned before for comparing purposes only the z numbers outputs with the reliability of eh were considered considering the obtained results shown in table 7 the hss values and ta percentages of the z number and conventional fuzzy as a benchmark model models could be evaluated for each synoptic station it is notable that the ta criterion may not represent the performance of the model individually considering the seven classes of spi see table 2 the numbers of n class for tabriz about 45 of the total data are more than other classes such as ed about 2 of total data as a result the ta criterion may be affected by biased predictions for instance it is usually expected to obtain better performance for n events as major class versus poor performance for ew or ed events as the minority class consequently the hss criterion was also applied to investigate the performance of the proposed z number based model versus the conventional fuzzy model for this purpose confusion matrices for lag 1 of tabriz spi were provided as an example see table 8 as it can be seen in table 8 n class is the most frequent occurrence due to the majority of n class this confirms the possibility of biased results of ta so the ta criterion along with hss could properly investigate the performance of the applied models as it is seen in table 8 seven possible results of spi formed the confusion matrix which helps to compute the hss criterion sokolova and lapalme 2009 its rows indicate predicted values and columns indicate observed values for instance the number of observed n class with eh reliability is 1 6 37 12 1 57 in which 37 numbers are predicted correctly and 6 12 18 numbers are close to n class for all classes most of the predictions are correct and incorrect predictions are close to the observed class due to the performance results hss values of the applied methods table 7 z number based model performed better than the conventional fuzzy approach averagely up to 146 and 590 for the kermanshah and tabriz stations respectively this means that the z number based output provides the reliability of the prediction e g if output 0 0 47 1 0 04 0 0 47 0 0 88 1 0 95 0 1 according to the codebook fig 5 this output demonstrates the normal condition with an extremely high probability of occurrence besides it performs better than the conventional fuzzy model even by converting it to an interval value e g ed or sw value therefore from a practical point of view the z number based model can be a reliable option for prediction due to its ability to considering the reliability of the information the highest value of the hss criterion was obtained as 0 503 for tabriz lag 1 and 0 643 lag 1 for kermanshah stations in addition for these lags as best z number models the values of ta criterion were obtained as 64 8 for tabriz and 83 6 for kermanshah stations consequently with over 65 confidence in both stations the z number based model represented the wet dry and normal episodes of tabriz and kermanshah stations by the simultaneous use of ssts of black mediterranean and red seas nao and soi as predictors by comparing the values of hss with different lag times the most dominant lag of combined sst nao and soi time series for the z number teleconnection model could be identified for instance table 7 depicts that the z number based teleconnection model could be found at lag 1 for both tabriz and kermanshah stations this may be because the average total distances of the surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas from the stations are approximately equal 5200 km consequently the obtained results not only illustrate the dynamic teleconnections between monthly spi events and ssts of surrounding seas nao and soi but also affirm the prediction of the selected lags i e 1 to 5 lags in advance according to the results in table 9 the ability of z number based model and conventional fuzzy in the prediction of dry spi 0 5 wet spi 0 5 and normal 0 5 spi 0 5 periods could be compared and they were investigated for tabriz and kermanshah stations as it is seen in table 9 in all lags for both tabriz and kermanshah stations spis conventional fuzzy model outputs indicate biased performance and the results of normal periods are much better than dry and wet periods showing poor performance especially in the prediction of dry periods nevertheless z number based model outputs indicate better and almost similar performance and reliable for all different dry wet and normal periods since for both stations the best teleconnection models were found at lag 1 in the following the extracted rules for this lag lag 1 were analyzed the ed sd sw and ew events were rare events compared to the md mw and n events consequently the rules with high reliability for md mw and n events were much more than ed sd sw and ew events for both stations according to the extracted rules for lag 1 with reliability eh extreme events of ed and sd occurred with combinations of m l and vl classes of ssts and h or vh class of ssts did not appear at extracted rules according to the watershed physics of tabriz and kermanshah station usually there is no precipitation in summer but even with low precipitation the wet condition occurs in the summer therefore with summer approaching and occurring h and vh ssts for both stations the ed and sd events do not occur see table 10 and practically no rule with sst of h or vh class was extracted in addition extreme events of sw and ew occurred with combinations of m l and vl classes of ssts for tabriz station and with combinations of all classes of ssts for kermanshah station since the ew or sw could happen in each season see table 10 no regular pattern was observed in the combination of soi and noi classes this may be due to the fact that positive and negative values of noi and soi are more effective in winter precipitation in iran e g dehghani et al 2020 ghasemi and khalili 2008 but in this study drought events i e ed ew and etc for all seasons have been investigated some of the antecedents of rules for each station are common between the two stations but their consequences are not necessarily the same and even caused the different events with different degrees of reliability at another station consequently to predict the drought events of each station an engineering judgment is required and it is necessary to define distinct rules for each station which originate from the physics of that station or watershed although both tabriz and kermanshah synoptic stations are located in northwestern of iran and anomalies in the ssts of the surrounding seas nao and soi affect their drought events there is a clear deviation in the discrete classes taken by antecedents therefore for practical applications the use of the same rules may not be suitable for large regions this is because large scale teleconnection processes are highly uncertain and if the study area is large uncertainty will be increased dramatically therefore although some previous studies e g dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a vathsala and koolagudi 2017 divided continental regions with diverse precipitation regimes into sub continental areas with relatively homogenous precipitation patterns in this study ground based data in regional scale station were used for the modeling to make the results more practical for designing and management purposes the results of this study showed that for each station or watershed where fuzzy modeling has been used regarding the physics of the watershed and the judgment or patterns could be extracted by data mining to construct if then rules the z number based model could enhance the modeling performance by defining reliability for each variable and increasing use of the watershed physics as well as the judgment of the operator from the aspect of spatial assessment as stated in table 7 for all considered lag times z number based model for kermanshah station spi performed better than that for the tabriz station spi as it is clear in table 1 the coefficient of variation for tabriz station data is higher than that for the kermanshah station spi data which denotes more irregularity and nonlinearity of tabriz station data which led to a bit poor modeling performance in addition it is obvious that from table 7 by employing the z number model improvement of the modeling performance for tabriz station spi by z number regarding classic fuzzy averagely up to 590 is higher than that for the kermanshah spi up to 146 this may be due to the fact that the linear correlation between ssts and monthly spi at kermanshah station averagely up to 0 4 is higher than that for the tabriz station averagely up to 0 1 therefore the behavior of the tabriz station spi data is more complex and nonlinear compared to kermanshah station spi data the z number based model with defining reliability for each variable high degree of freedom and employing the z interpolated method as inference technique contributes to the enhancement of the performance for the tabriz station more than that for the kermanshah station the z number reasoning methodology in this paper is an improved version for example in terms of mathematics zadeh 2011 suggested the method of the zadeh extension principle for the addition of discrete fuzzy numbers but in this paper the alpha cut method was used in z numbers to satisfy the convexity of fuzzy numbers for z interpolation and obtaining output based on current observation the use of distance concept with defining a dynamic threshold for weights of rules selecting best rules was proposed also in terms of application for classes of ssts nao and soi as antecedents the reliability part of z numbers were created by frequency of occurrence of the sst nao and soi classifications i e vl l etc for the extraction of rules association mining was used also for classes of drought events as consequences the reliability parts of z numbers were created by confidence criterion that obtained using the association mining tool in fact the linkage of z number and association mining was proposed in this study 4 conclusions the uncertainties and ambiguities of real world problems in general and hydro climatic processes in particular have led to the use of fuzzy logic in modeling analyzing and decision making of such processes as suggested by previous studies e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b gadgil et al 2005 introducing nonlinearity and uncertainty in the classes taken by the indices such as ssts will enhance the long distance teleconnection modeling however conventional fuzzy logic does not discuss the reliability of data and information on the other hand the z numbers consist of the restraint and reliability of data and have significant potential to describe the uncertainty of human knowledge the use of z numbers can overcome ambiguity and enhance the objectivity of the decisions predicting drought as a complex natural hazard is associated with uncertainty and it is necessary to develop models to handle such uncertainty especially in regions such as iran which is categorized as arid to semi arid as discussed in sub section 2 2 due to the importance of teleconnections in the hydro climatic system of iran the main aim of this research was to design a system to predict the future state of the drought wet and normal episodes according to spi of tabriz and kermanshah stations based on the ssts of surrounding seas nao and soi due to the complexity of the large scale teleconnection processes and weak performance of point prediction tools in such situations using the concept of z numbers a system was designed to perform class prediction of the drought events the proposed method is a mathematical model which is based on the fuzzy logic method so for any regions or watershed where fuzzy modeling has been used or patterns could be extracted the proposed z number based model could enhance the modeling performance by defining reliability for each variable and increasing use of the watershed physics so that to predict the drought events of each station hydrological and engineering judgment will be incorpraite into the rules for each station the z number based model not only could provide reliability of the predictions but also performed better than the conventional fuzzy model even by converting its output from an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers to a single value or interval value the results indicated that the z number based model could present more comprehensive and accurate results averagely up to 146 and 590 for the kermanshah and tabriz station spis respectively because of its ability to consider uncertainty and reliability of the information and allocating appropriate weights to the rules overall the z number concept as a new generation of fuzzy logic concept can be applied to different fields of water resources engineering where considering the reliability of the events is possible and can improve the overall performance of the modeling credit authorship contribution statement vahid nourani conceptualization supervision

supp bj in this case 3 for each bj notably the number of pjl for each bj is equal to the number of supp bj so in this case l 3 then one will have to solve 9 eqs 19 21 3 problems for each bj to find

consider the convolution of p13 p23 and p32 for 46 40 supp a123 according the eq 22 p 123 46 40 46 40 14 74 16 99 14 67 p 13 14 74 p 22 16 99 p 32 14 67 0 5 0 27 0 95 0 1282 also according the eq 23 μ p 123 0 1 1 0 according the convolution of p13 p23 and p32 similarly for all 27 supports of a123 these operations should be done as p123 0 46 00 0 1282 46 40 0 46 41 0 46 48 0 46 81 0 11 46 88 0 46 89 0 47 30 0 13 125 15 0 01 296 with μ p 123 0 it is notable that for all 27 convolutions the p123 and their μ p 123 should be determined finally according the eq 25 b12 for each convolution is obtained also by eq 24 for equal values of b12q the max value of μ p 123 is chosen finally the convex form of b1 b2 b3 will be as follows b123 b1 b2 b3 0 0 64 1 0 88 0 0 89 thus z y z 1 z 2 z3 eq a 2 will be

results were compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy model the results indicated that the approach using z numbers could lead to more comprehensive and accurate results averagely up to 146 and 590 respectively for the kermanshah and tabriz owing to its ability to consider uncertainty and reliability of information and allocating appropriate weights to the rules keywords hydro

drought indices were developed to evaluate drought or flood events belayneh and adamowski 2012 cancelliere et al 2007 mckee et al 1993 mishra and singh 2010 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the standardized precipitation index spi introduced by mckee et al 1993 is the most commonly used index the spi is a normalized index and can be used for the comparison of spi values among different locations because of the complexity and uncertainties of the long distance teleconnection processes the correlation between spi and oceanic atmospheric indices is very poor and classic black box models may not prove useful dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a the above mentioned researches used the same traditional methods e g linear and nonlinear regression or correlation to discover the potential teleconnection between hydro climatic parameters but when dealing with large scale extreme events e g drought events that are influenced by remote factors data mining tools can be appropriate alternatives to the conventional methods e g autoregressive integrated moving average and artificial intelligence based methods such as artificial neural network which are commonly used to perform short term predictions the data mining based association rules can be used to investigate highly uncertain processes and large scale extreme events by generating the rules that indicate the cause effect relationship among the various combinations of the hydro climatic variables danandeh mehr et al 2017a dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b nourani et al 2017 tadesse et al 2004 large scale teleconnection between hydro climatic parameters is a complex system and determining its accurate state in the future is difficult it is believed that fuzzy logic can partly reflect such uncertainty fuzzy logic has been widely used in the last few decades to model complex systems because of its capacity to deal with nonlinearity and uncertainty of the processes which are common in the hydro climatic issues e g see awan and bae 2016 gutenson et al 2018 he et al 2019 nadiri et al 2019 nivesh et al 2018 nourani et al 2014 nourani and komasi 2013 dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a used combined data mining and fuzzy logic method for point prediction of summer monsoon rainfall of india using different atmospheric indices as predictors the result of this study was reported based on correlation coefficient cc and root mean squared error rmse also according to legates and mccabe 1999 the determination coefficient dc criterion instead of cc should be used along with rmse to assess the performance of hydro environmental models the results of this study indicated the weak performance of point prediction in teleconnection modeling since the standardized predicted values indicated a difference of more than 50 with the observed values consequently some previous studies attempted to do point prediction to investigate large scale teleconnection but this is not easy since due to the complexity of the long distance teleconnection processes and weak correlation between predictors and predictands the point prediction output will show a weak performance e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a and it is believed that class prediction could be an appropriate alternative to deal with such situations e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b the principal problem of the classic fuzzy based method is its weakness when dealing with the vague conditions often involved in realistic settings despite the widespread application of the classic fuzzy logic concept it is critical to talk about the confidence and reliability of the analyzed information because the classic fuzzy variables only include constraints and do not provide reliability for example the decision which was accepted based on low reliability data tends to be useless or even harmful to practical usage glukhoded and smetanin 2016 thus the concept of z number presented by zadeh 2011 has received much attention from engineers recently the z number has notable potential in demonstrating the uncertainty of human science as both the expert s opinion and the z number consist of the constraint and reliability of the measured data abiyev et al 2018 aboutorab et al 2018 kang et al 2018a saravi et al 2019 a z number is an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers denoted as z a b the first component a is a restriction on the value of uncertain variable x the second component b is a measure of reliability for the first component typically a and b are presented in a natural language for instance finding parking near the campus in the early morning as uncertain variable x usually is difficult z a difficult b usually or sst of black sea as x seldom is very high z a very high r seldom the second component b here usually and seldom is the main difference between conventional fuzzy and z number that specifies the reliability of the value of uncertain variable x however the main problem here is quantification and algebraic operations on these linguistic variables for example what are the procedures of computation of approximately 1 hr usually approximately 45 min usually there are at least three methods of aggregation for the z numbers as i converting z numbers into simple fuzzy numbers and aggregating them using simple methods kang et al 2018b ii aggregating a and b parts separately glukhoded and smetanin 2016 iii obtaining z number based on z number aggregating z numbers and then obtaining z number based on given z number aliev et al 2016 2015 zadeh 2011 z number like z number is an ordered pair z a r where a plays the same role as in a z number but r is a probability distribution of the random number the concept and utilization of the first i and second ii approaches are easy but they may lose some information from an expert and are not applicable to all fuzzy numbers in the third approach the loss of information is minimized but it is more complicated and requires some non linear optimization algorithms glukhoded and smetanin 2016 therefore one of the principal objectives of this research was to modify and develop a code in matlab software based on a modified version of the third approach to make it easy to be used in various fields of engineering economics analysis and decision making as well as hydro climatic issues by developing this code and considering the teleconnections between large scale hydro climatic signals the concept of the z number valued if then rules was used in this study to predict the long term monthly dry wet and normal periods as the first application of z numbers in hydro climatic studies in this regard the classified spi data of kermanshah and tabriz stations in the northwest of iran were predicted using monthly sst time series of surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas nao and soi indices as predictors via the proposed method and the obtained results were then compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy logic method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in the current research the spi data of two synoptic stations in the northwest of iran located at 38 05 n 46 17 e tabriz and 34 21 n 47 90 e kermanshah with the altitudes of about 1350 m above sea level also ssts of the surrounding seas black mediterranean and red nao and soi indices were adopted for implementing the proposed technique see fig 1 the used precipitation data for computation of spi were obtained from the iran meteorological organization http www irimo ir and the monthly sst data were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website http www esrl noaa gov psd cgi bin data timeseries timeseries1 pl where the monthly sst data are accessible for 1 grid squares of the seas it is worth mentioning that the monthly ssts of the chosen grid points for each sea were averaged and applied in this research as the sst time series of each sea in addition the monthly soi and nao data were obtained from the noaa https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections the time series data of 65 years from 1955 to 2019 were employed in the modeling process as previous studies the first 75 part of the data considered as the training set and the rest 25 2003 2019 as the test data set although the data were divided into calibration and test sets it should be noted that for the fuzzy logic method z number based model if the rules are correctly determined there is practically no need for the calibration since there is not any parameter for that and data division here is just to see the capability of the derived rules table 1 presents more information about the data used in this research precipitation fluctuations of different regions of iran are not significant and such fluctuations can be found only in western iran see fig 2 also only the west of iran is affected by ssts of the red mediterranean and black seas for this reason in this study the data of tabriz station in northwestern iran and kermanshah station close to the center of western iran which have data with appropriate quality and quantity were used as the representative of western iran 2 2 influence of teleconnection on hydro climatologic systems of iran climatic oceanic indices such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo nao soi and el niño southern oscillation enso provide important predictive information about hydrologic variability in regions around the world soukup et al 2009 it is believed that sst is the main factor almost in all of such indices the pdo is based on the monthly sea surface temperature variability of the north pacific ocean in decadal scale mantua and hare 2002 the continuing sequences of long duration changes in the sea surface temperature of the north atlantic ocean are termed as amo with the cool and warm phases that can last from 20 to 40 years for a period enfield et al 2001 el niño is one of the largest oscillations of the climate system and is defined as warmer than the normal condition of pacific ocean surface temperature in eastern parts commonly used enso indices include regional sst indices e g nino 1 2 nino 3 nino 4 and nino 3 4 meidani and araghinejad 2014 soi is an atmospheric pressure based index and is the standardized anomaly of the mean sea level pressure difference tadesse et al 2004 a positive soi means la niña and a negative soi indicates el niño conditions the nao index is the winter climate variability mode in north atlantic ocean and is defined as the difference in normalized mean winter december march sea level pressure anomalies between iceland and portugal hurrell 1995 although there is only a little literature on teleconnection impacts of ssts on precipitations over iran several researches reported the impacts of large scale ocean atmospheric parameters such as enso nazemosadat et al 2006 raziei et al 2009 enso and nao dezfuli et al 2010 hosseinzadeh talaee et al 2014 on hydro climatologic systems of iran in this regard ghasemi and khalili 2006 indicated the impact of the arctic oscillation ao on the winter surface air temperature over iran nazemosadat and ghaedamini 2010 demonstrated the impact of madden julian oscillation mjo on precipitation of southern iran and arabian peninsula nazemosadat et al 2006 showed the impact of enso on climate change of iran also raziei et al 2009 demonstrated the impact of enso on hydrological droughts in western iran hosseinzadeh talaee et al 2014 investigated the impact of enso and nao on hydrological drought of hamedan in the west of iran utilizing the standardized streamflow index and showed the teleconnection impact of enso on hydrological drought of hamedan dezfuli et al 2010 indicated the teleconnection impact of nao and soi on meteorological drought over southwest of iran thus according to the above mentioned literature the nao and soi indices could be used to monitor drought episodes in northwest of iran meidani and araghinejad 2014 derived the significant relationship between the streamflow of southwestern iran and the sst of the mediterranean sea the results of this study showed that application of sst as predictors of streamflow in southwestern iran led to better performance than when using nao pdo and amo indices rezaebanafsheh et al 2011 studied the relations of winter and autumn precipitation with previous season anomalies of mediterranean sst in several stations in west of iran and showed that the cooler condition of the sea in autumn has led to wetter winter ghasemi and khalili 2008 indicated that the wet conditions in iran are found to be characterized by a negative sst anomaly in the mediterranean and the black sea while dry conditions are found to be characterized by a positive sst anomaly in the mediterranean and the black sea analyses of the results also revealed that the winter precipitation in iran is mainly related to the black mediterranean and red seas rahimikhoob 2010 demonstrated the teleconnection impact of ssts of the persian gulf and the red sea on mp of ilam in west of iran hydro climatic indices such as pdo nao amo soi and ssts could be used as predictors of the long term precipitation but in regions surrounding by seas priority could be on using the ssts of the surrounding seas meidani and araghinejad 2014 previous studies have mostly focused on the correlation of enso and nao with iran s hydrological cycle while iran is surrounded by seas and use of their ssts could improve the forecasting results meidani and araghinejad 2014 this may be due to the fact that the mediterranean black and red seas as sources of moisture of western iran are placed on western iran affecting various areas around for example in the cold period of the year due to the warm sst of the mediterranean sea compared to the air temperature the continental polar and polar maritime air masses by crossing the mediterranean sea and gaining heat from it become unstable and turn into the mediterranean air masses that provide winter rainfall in most parts of iran in terms of physical dependency approximately 70 of the cyclones that move into iran originate from either in the black sea or in the mediterranean sea these low pressure systems enter the country through the northwestern or western provinces the other 30 of the cyclones mainly originate from in north africa and the red sea and come to the country through saudi arabia and the persian gulf in other words two main air currents influence the winter precipitation in iran one is the western current and the other is the southern current ghasemi and khalili 2008 seemingly in the winter of the northern hemisphere while the red sea and the persian gulf act as powerful sources of water vapor and trigger little precipitation locally due to descending air in the hadley cell the mediterranean lake of low pressure lying between the two regions of high pressure in the north atlantic centered at about 30 n and those over asia at about 45 n cause the westerly prevailing winds move along the north coast of africa towards iran kendrew 1922 iran is one of the world s most mountainous countries the two main mountain chains consist of the zagros and the alborz mountains located in the northwestern western and northern parts of iran tabriz and kermanshah stations are located in northwest of iran with annual precipitation 283 and 443 mm respectively fig 2 indicates the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in western iran earlier researches revealed that the precipitation over northwest of iran is not significantly affected by the sst of the persian gulf and the caspian sea which may be mostly due to the obstacle made by alborz and zagros mountain ranges nourani et al 2017 raziei et al 2008 and therefore their sst data were not considered in the current modeling water bodies temperatures influence precipitation patterns also droughts throughout the world so when ssts of oceans or seas change precipitation patterns tend to change as well in addition sst is the main factor almost in all of the above mentioned indices e g amo pdo enso etc even the nao and soi indices are strongly correlated with large scale changes in ssts of the atlantic and pacific oceans travasso et al 2009 wang et al 2004 consequently in this study in addition to nao and soi indices ssts of surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas as sources of moisture of iran western were used for prediction of tabriz and kermanshah drought wet and normal episodes via spi 2 3 the standard precipitation index spi the spi is calculated using only precipitation data making it relatively easy for application and evaluation the standard drought index is independent of the geographical location because the desired index is calculated according to the average precipitation of the same place cacciamani et al 2007 the spi index is computed based on precipitation data at least 30 years cumulated over a chosen time scale belayneh et al 2014 as spi can be calculated over different precipitation accumulation periods typically varying from 1 to 48 months the resulting different spi indices allow for estimating different potential impacts of meteorological drought or flood as spi could be determined over different precipitation accumulation periods typically varying from 1 to 48 months the result of different spi index could be used to estimate possible consequences of meteorological drought or flood in this study for each station spi 1 one month was computed to predict dry wet and normal episodes as presented in table 2 the monthly spi values of the stations were classified into seven classes 2 4 proposed methodology the schematic procedure of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in fig 3 the proposed methodology in the current study contains 4 distinct steps i e data pre processing extraction of the association rules modeling by z number and conventional fuzzy tools and finally comparing and evaluating the obtained results using sst soi and nao monthly time series to predict the occurrence of different drought wet and normal episodes according spi values at the first step as presented in table 3 the monthly ssts and nao data were classified into five classes of very high vh high h medium m low l and very low vl within bounds of µ iσ where µ and σ are respectively average and standard division of time series and for ssts i 1 1 5 and for nao i 2 3 the monthly soi data were classified into seven classes of extremely high eh vh h m l vl and extremely low el within bounds of µ iσ where i 0 5 1 and 1 5 on the other hand the monthly spi values of the stations were classified into seven classes see table 2 at the second step the association rule data mining method was used to discover the patterns among the ssts nao and soi and spi datasets to construct if then rules in addition the confidence measure of each association rule was calculated to evaluate the degrees of the reliability of rules at the third step conventional fuzzy modeling and z number based modeling were applied by the means of the patterns found in the second step therefore if then rules were constructed and then the modeling was conducted it is notable that in z number rules the reliability part of z number was created with the help of the confidence criterion of association rule and the frequency of occurrence of the sst nao and soi classifications i e vl l etc then the rules were weighted using the z numbers distance concept and the best rules were selected and aggregated so at the training phase the possible teleconnections could be found between the monthly spi t sst t i nao t i and soi t i time series ssts nao and soi at different lags as 1 spi t f s s t t i j nao t i soi t i where i represents the number of lag time and j 1 2 and 3 stands for the sst of the black mediterranean and res seas finally at the fourth step the results of both methods classic fuzzy and z number were evaluated and compared with each other based on the used efficiency criteria in the following the main components of the proposed methodology i e association rules z numbers and evaluation criteria are briefly reviewed 2 5 association rule the dominant patterns of large databases can be extracted by association rule mining the association rule a b represents whenever a as antecedent occurs b as consequent also occurs with a certain probability the validity of such rules is determined by support and confidence criteria the support criterion eq 2 shows the ratio of simultaneous events of a and b to all events the confidence criterion eq 3 shows the ratio of simultaneous events of a and b to the total events of a han et al 2011 2 support a b p a b 3 confidence a b p a b support a b support a for more details about association rule mining the readers are referred to han et al 2011 2 6 description of z number concept zadeh 2011 presented a z number associated with the uncertain variable x as an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers a b where a is a restriction on the value of uncertain variable x and b is a measure of reliability for the uncertain variable x the concept of z numbers is used to perform calculations with data that is not entirely reliable in the following sub sections of the z number definitions are briefly described but for more details readers are referred to aliev et al 2015 and zadeh 2011 2 6 1 discrete z number briefly a discrete fuzzy number is a fuzzy number with convex membership function r 0 1 and with finite support of supp a x 1 x s in which x 1 x s r with x 1 x 2 x s a discrete z number is an ordered pair z a b of discrete fuzzy numbers a and b a plays the role of a fuzzy constraint on values that a random variable x may take b is a discrete fuzzy number with a membership function μb b 1 b s 0 1 b 1 b s 0 1 playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on the probability measure of a p a i 1 s μ a x i p x i p a supp b a concept of a discrete z number is closely related to the concept of a discrete z number given a discrete z number z a b z number is a pair consisting of a fuzzy number a and a random number r z a r where a plays the same role as it does in a discrete z number and r plays the role of the probability distribution for b aliev et al 2015 2 6 2 z valued if then rules based reasoning a problem of interpolation of z rules termed as z interpolation was addressed by zadeh 2011 this problem is the generalization of the interpolation of fuzzy rules kóczy and hirota 1991 the problem of z interpolation is given below given the following n z rules if x 1 is zx 1 1 a x 1 1 b x 1 1 and and xm is zx m 1 a x m 1 b x m 1 then y is zy ay 1 by 1 if x 1 is zx 1 2 a x 1 2 b x 1 2 and and xm is zx m 2 a x m 2 b x m 2 then y is zy ay 2 by 2 if x 1 is zx 1 n a x 1 n b x 1 n and and xm is zx m n a x m n b x m n then y is zy ay n by n and a current observation as x 1 is ź x 1 á x 1 b x 1 and and xm is z x m á x m b x m it is interesting to find the z value of y z y for the observation here m is the number of z valued input variables and n is the number of rules the idea underlying the suggested interpolation approach is that the ratio of distances between the resulting output and the consequent parts is equal to one between the current input and the antecedent parts kóczy and hirota 1991 this implies for z rules that the resulting output z y is computed as 4 z â y j 1 nn w â j z y j j 1 nn w â j a y j b y j where 5 w â j w j j 1 nn w j w h e r e n n i s t h e n u m b e r o f s e l e c t e d r u l e s h i g h w e i g h t r u l e s 6 w j 1 ρ j j 1 n 1 ρ j j 1 n 7 ρ j i 1 m d z xi z xi j 8 d z 1 z 1 d a 1 a 2 d b 1 b 2 where 9 d a 1 a 2 sup d h a 1 α a 2 α 0 α 1 where d h is fuzzy hausdorff distance 10 d h a 1 a 2 α 0 1 α d h α a 1 a 2 w h e r e u i n d i c a t e s t h e u n i o n s o f c l a s s i c s e t s where zy is the z number valued consequent of the jth rule wj j 1 n are coefficients of linear interpolation and n is the number of z rules d is the distance between current ith z number valued input and the ith z number valued antecedent of the jth rule thus ρ computes the distance between a current input vector and the vector of the antecedents of the jth rule the rules are weighted based on equations 6 10 and only the best rules are applied to equation 4 it is notable that to comply with the superposition principle w 1 w 2 w nn 1 the selected rules should be re weighted based on eq 5 although a low weight rule has a little negative impact on output simultaneous combining several low weight rules can have significant negative impacts on output for this reason and for decreasing the computational cost only high weight rules rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight are chosen in the adopted method of this paper the selected rules weights should be multiplied to z numbers it is notable that zy λ zx ax bx is obtained as zy zx λ a x bx thus the bx reliability part of z number is not affected by multiplying by λ so a scalar multiplication of a discrete fuzzy number a by a real number λ r is the discrete fuzzy number a 1 λa whose α cut is defined as aliev et al 2016 aliev et al 2015 11 a 1 α x λ s u p p a m i n λ a α x m a x λ a α where 12 λ s u p p a λ x x s u p p a m i n λ a α m i n λ x x a α m a x λ a α m a x λ x x a α and the membership function is defined as 13 μ λ a x s u p α 0 1 x λ a α w h e r e s u p i n d i c a t e s t h e s u p r e m u m o r m a x the operation of the addition of discrete z numbers which is used in the current study to aggregate the consequents of the selected rules is briefly described below 2 6 3 addition of discrete z numbers let z1 a 1 b 1 and z2 a 2 b 2 be discrete z numbers describing imperfect information about values of variables x 1 and x 2 consider the problem of computation of addition z 12 z 1 z 2 the first stage is the addition computation of discrete fuzzy numbers a 12 a 1 a 2 based on following concept for discrete fuzzy numbers a 1 a 2 their addition a 12 a 1 a 2 is the discrete fuzzy number whose α cut is defined as aliev et al 2015 14 a 12 α x s u p p a 1 s u p p a 2 m i n a 1 α a 2 α x m a x a 1 α a 2 α where supp a1 supp a2 x1 x2 xj supp aj j 1 2 min a 1 α a 2 α min x1 x2 xj a j α j 1 2 max a 1 α a 2 α max x1 x2 xj a j α j 1 2 and the membership function is defined as 15 μ a 1 a 2 x s u p α 0 1 x a 1 α a 2 α the second stage involves the stage by stage construction of b 12 which is related to the propagation of probabilistic restrictions to this end first the z numbers should be determined based on z numbers of z 1 a 1 b 1 and z 2 a 2 b 2 but the true probability distributions p1 for z1 and p2 for z2 are not exactly known conversely the data are expressed by the fuzzy constraints as aliev et al 2015 zadeh 2011 16 k 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k i s b 1 k 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k i s b 2 where s1 is the number of supp a1 and s2 is the number of supp a2 expressed in terms of the membership functions as follows 17 i 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k i 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k thus the fuzzy sets of probability distributions of p 1 and p 2 will have the membership functions of 18 μ p 1 p 1 μ b 1 i 1 s 1 μ a 1 x 1 k p x 1 k μ p 2 p 2 μ b 2 i 1 s 2 μ a 2 x 2 k p x 2 k these fuzzy sets should be constructed bj j 1 2 is a discrete fuzzy number that plays the role of a soft constraint on a value of a probability measure of aj therefore basic values bjl supp bj l 1 s of a discrete fuzzy number bj are values of a probability measure of aj bjl p aj thus given bjl such probability distribution which satisfies the following condition has to be found 19 b jl μ aj x j 1 p j l x j 1 μ aj x j 2 x j 2 μ aj x js x js at the same time pjl has to satisfy 20 k 1 s p jl x jk 1 p jl x jk 0 consequently the above goal of programming problem eq 19 must be solved to compute pj l subject to eq 20 aliev et al 2015 zadeh 2011 it is notable that generally the answers of equations 19 and 20 are not unique to guarantee a unique answer the compatibility condition is defined as 21 k 1 s x jk p jl x jk k 1 s x jk μ aj x jk k 1 s μ aj x jk this points out that the centroid of aj is to coincide with that of pjl probability distributions xjk k 1 s naturally induce probabilistic uncertainty over the result x x 1 x 2 this implies that given any possible pair p 1 l p 2 l of the extracted distributions the convolution p 12q p 1 l p 2 l q 1 s2 is to be computed as 22 p 12 x x x 1 x 2 p 1 x 1 p 2 x 2 x x 12 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 the fuzzy sets of probability distributions p 1 l and p 2 l induce the fuzzy set of convolutions p 12q with the membership function defined as μp 12 p 12 max μp 1 p 1 μp 2 p 2 23 where is min operation as a result the fuzziness of information on p 12q described by μp 12 induces fuzziness of the value of probability measure a 12 as a discrete fuzzy number b 12 the membership function μ b 12 is defined as μ b 12 b 12q sup μp 12q p 12q 24 subject to 25 b 12 q k 1 t p 12 q x 12 k μ a 12 x 12 k where t is the number of supp a12 overall z 12 z 1 z 2 is obtained as z 12 a 12 b 12 where a 12 a1 a2 is obtained through eqs 14 15 in order to obtain b12 fuzzy sets of probability distributions of z1 and z2 i e pjl are obtained through eqs 19 21 in other words z1 and z2 are converted to z numbers after that the z 12 a 12 p12 x is obtained through eqs 22 23 finally the b 12 is obtained through eqs 24 25 in other words z 12 is converted to z number the described algorithm for two z numbers was used to develop a matlab code to perform the addition operation of several z numbers for outputs of several possible rules 2 7 efficiency criteria in this study seven types of output i e ed sd md n mw sw and ew could be achieved as dry wet or normal periods so the conventional evaluation criteria such as root mean square error or determination coefficient cannot be used in classification issues due to their need for numerical results or crisp numbers e g see sharghi et al 2018 to this end the total accuracy ta and heidke skill score hss might be appropriate options danandeh mehr et al 2017 moreira 2016 richman and leslie 2014 ta criterion as the ratio of true predicts tp to the total number of predicts was applied in this research as danandeh mehr et al 2017 26 ta tp n 100 the ta varies from 0 to 100 and the best model receives ta 100 in addition the hss criterion was used in this research where the proportion correct measure is scaled with the reference value from correct forecasts due to chance for modeling with i possible forecasts and events the hss is defined as wilks 2011 27 h s s i 1 i p y i o i i 1 i p y i o i 1 i 1 i p y i o i the p yi oi indicates the joint distribution of forecasts and observations the p yi indicates the marginal distributions of the forecasts and the p oi indicates the marginal distributions of the observations the hss criterion is similar to the determination coefficient and varies from to 1 the best model receives hss 1 zero score means no skill and the negative value indicates that the predicts are worse than reference predicts wilks 2011 3 results and discussion in this research a new approach for modeling teleconnections between hydro climatic indices sst nao and soi and wet normal and dry episodes based on spi index through the z number concept is introduced see fig 4 the z number based model consists of the restraint and reliability of variables and allows uncertainty measures to quantify the ambiguity related to the prediction of hydro climatic parameters to this aim as it is seen in tables 2 and 3 after categorizing the hydro climatic indices and monthly spi values the association rule was used to discover the teleconnection patterns between the sst and monthly spi training datasets to construct if then rules also z rules then by considering the categorized sets interval sets the codebook or fuzzy sets was constructed by expert opinion see fig 5 in other words the intervals by rigid bounds were converted to fuzzy sets in order to consider the uncertainty after constructing the rules conventional fuzzy and z number based modeling were applied to the data set finally the performances of the proposed models were investigated and the results were compared with each other fuzzy logic methods including z number require defining linguistic variables and construction of the if then rules the required pattern to construct if then rules was extracted by association rules for association rule mining the data should be first classified into some classes see dadaser celik et al 2013 dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a 2009b tadesse et al 2004 in this way input variables as antecedents the ssts of red mediterranean and black seas nao and soi indices were partitioned into five to seven linguistic ranges see table 3 while the degree of reliability was partitioned into seven ranges vl l low medium lm high medium hm h vh and eh also output variables as consequent spi index were partitioned into seven ranges see table 2 the extracted rules by association mining are sensitive to these classifications and with poor classification and good rules in terms of confidence and support criteria may not be extracted this categorization was done based on expert opinion also trial and error and previous works but the number of categorized parts in inputs and output could be less or more for recognizing the best thresholds and class numbers for categorizing ssts also nao and soi and extracting rules via association mining different states were tested and examined according to the literature danandeh mehr et al 2017a glukhoded and smetanin 2016 tadesse et al 2004 the monthly ssts nao and soi data were classified into some classes within bounds of µ iσ for i and different values were tested such as i 1 1 5 5 classes i 0 5 1 5 5 classes i 0 5 1 1 5 7 classes and i 2 3 five classes also the decision tree algorithm with c4 5 scheme quinlan 1992 was used for categorizing ssts nevertheless the best rules with high confidence and support were obtained using the method that defines µ iσ i 1 1 5 as thresholds for the ssts classes µ iσ i 0 5 1 1 5 as thresholds for the soi classes and µ iσ i 2 3 as thresholds for the nao classes similarly to categorize the reliability according to the literature e g see aliev et al 2016 different states were tested the degree of reliability was classified into seven five and three classes but better results were obtained by increasing the number of classes so considering the computational cost the seven classes were used for categorizing the degree of reliability it is notable that the association rule method considers the mentioned linguistic variables as an interval but for fuzzy logic based modeling these interval sets should be converted to fuzzy sets to this end 2 and 2 were respectively applied to the beginning and end of each interval in addition min and max fuzzy numbers were considered as trapezoidal membership function but triangular membership function was considered for other fuzzy numbers the triangular fuzzy number with supports of a1 a2 and a3 can be defined by triplet 0 a 1 1 a 2 0 a 3 where a1 and a3 with value of 0 for memberships are the boundary points and a2 is a peak point or the most probable value with value of 1 for membership in addition the considered trapezoidal fuzzy number can be defined by triplet 1 a 1 1 a 2 0 a 3 for min fuzzy numbers or 0 a 1 1 a 2 1 a 3 for max fuzzy numbers the codebook containing linguistic terms of values of antecedents consequents and degrees of reliability is given in fig 5 for example according to above mentioned rigid bounds µ iσ for the black sea see table 3 the interval 4 33 19 42 could be considered as medium or m but by converting it into the fuzzy set the triangular fuzzy number of 0 4 24 1 11 87 0 19 80 should be considered as m see fig 5 at the second step the patterns among the sst nao and soi and monthly spi datasets were extracted by association rule and if then rules were constructed also confidence measure of association rules was calculated to evaluate degrees of reliability of rules for instance converting the extracted pattern to conventional fuzzy if then rule and z rule is as association rule black sea temperature m mediterranean sea temperature l red sea temperature l nao m soi m tabriz spi n confidence 1 conventional fuzzy if black sea temperature m mediterranean sea temperature l red sea temperature l nao m and soi m then tabriz spi n z number if black sea temperature m hm mediterranean sea temperature l l red sea temperature l l nao m eh and soi m lm then tabriz spi n eh in z rules the reliability parts of consequents spi values were created using the confidence criterion of association rules and for antecedents they were created using the frequency of occurrence of the classification of ssts nao and soi therefore the degrees of reliability for the classification of ssts nao and soi could be determined as presented in table 4 the current study is looking for the optimum lag of combined sst nao and soi series so to find the most dominant lags between inputs and output several input combinations with different lagged inputs were examined to train and test the models according to the literature in some studies the correlation coefficient has been used for finding optimum lag dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b to this end the cross correlation functions ccfs between monthly spi and sst nao and soi time series in both synoptic stations for different values of i lag were computed for example according to fig 6 a the sst t 1 for black sea sst t 1 for mediterranean sea sst t 1 for red sea nao t 7 and soi t 9 were dominant lags for prediction of tabriz spi t one month in advance because of complexity of teleconnection between spi and hydro climatic indices the correlations between spi and ssts were about 0 1 for tabriz spi and averagely up to 0 4 for kermanshah spi in addition the correlations between spi and nao and soi were about 0 1 for tabriz and kermanshah however due to the linear nature of ccf there is no guarantee that the afore mentioned lags are the best choices for accounting the possible non linear relationships so different combinations of the ssts nao and soi lags were used and examined for the association mining and to extract the rules also seasonal differencing e g sst t sst t 12 was applied to remove trends of sst nao and soi series and different combinations of the de trended sst nao and soi lags were also examined in the modeling nevertheless the comparative analysis indicated that the performances of the models for sst nao and soi with no pre processing and using the selected lags by ccf would lead to better performance in terms of the results of modeling by the de trended data this may be due to the nonlinear filters of z number based model e g membership functions that guarantee no need for applying other data pre processing e g de trending techniques as mentioned in the section 2 7 in this study the ta and hss criterion were used as evaluation criteria thus 1 at the first step the possibility of extracting appropriate patterns with the help of association mining to construct z rules was investigated in this way if the extracted patterns were acceptable in terms of confidence and support criteria e g existing the many patterns with confidence 0 6 the required rules z rules for modeling with z numbers were constructed it is notable that the threshold for confidence criterion could be selected based on the expert opinion 2 at the second step modeling was performed by the z number model and its performance was evaluated by ta and hss evaluation criteria this process was performed for different combinations of inputs trial and error and the best input combination was selected in terms of evaluation criteria ta and hss for each time step and station therefore by using ccf different lags of antecedents were determined as optimal lags and were used for modeling the drought wet and normal episodes of tabriz and kermanshah stations up to 5 months in advance see table 5 as it can be seen in table 5 for both stations and all time steps the ssts end up with lag 1 this may be due to short spatial distances between seas and synoptic stations however the selected lags for nao and soi were different for each time step of spi nao t 7 and soi t 9 were selected for prediction of tabriz spi t also nao t 7 and soi t 12 were selected for the prediction of kermanshah spi t also by increasing the time step of spi the appropriate lags for nao and soi decreased according to the long spatial distances between synoptic stations and atlantic and pacific oceans the large lags for nao and soi are reasonable the z rules could be constructed based on the linguistic variables defined earlier see fig 5 as codebook examples of examined rules are given in table 6 it is notable that one of the important advantages of z number based method over conventional methods is that unlike the previous studies that selected the rules by introducing thresholds for confidence support or j measures e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b 2009a tadesse et al 2004 all of the possible rules were used in this study and the quality reliability of rules were determined by reliability part of z numbers the rules list is completed when all possible scenarios are considered and there exists at least one rule whose antecedent part participates in the current antecedent valuation at least partially generally in the conventional fuzzy logic methods for n inputs with m categories for each input the number of rules could be up to mn for the current modeling up to 54 7 4375 the increase of the rules leads to complication of the formulization which is called curse of dimensionality jayawardena et al 2014 however in this research for each station and lag time different rule list 5 2 10 lists for z rules was considered and only 133 to 138 rules were considered and examined for each model due to the association rule mining e g see table 6 as an example in the case of lack of rules the classical reasoning methods based on the compositional rule of inference reasoning approach e g mamdani 1976 takagi and sugeno 1985 zadeh 1973 are not efficient enough to generate an output for the sample covered by no rules aliev et al 2015 so the inference techniques weighting the rules based on the concept of distance were used in this research which for the lack of matching rules could perform approximately reasonable namely z interpolated method also in this research only the high weight rules rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight were considered to compute the outputs furthermore the z number based model output as a z number pair of fuzzy numbers must be converted to single value for verifying and comparing purposes to this end the output z number could be converted to an interval value based on its reliability so according to the codebook the outputs with reliability eh were considered for comparing purposes for instance if the output 0 0 48 1 1 0 1 52 mw 0 0 88 1 0 95 0 1 e h then tabriz spi will be mw with eh reliability and the first part of z number mw is approved but if the output 0 0 48 1 1 0 1 52 mw 0 0 1 0 05 0 12 v l then tabriz spi will be vl with vl reliability and according to its low reliability its output could be every seven classes of spi consequently for comparing purposes the outputs with reliability eh were considered for computing the hss and ta criteria for conventional fuzzy modeling after the construction of if then rules for each lag through the association rule mining and expert judgment the rules with confidence greater than 0 5 were selected and mamdani fuzzy inference system fis with the minimum implication maximum for aggregation and centroid method for de fuzzification were used in this study similar to other studies e g jayawardena et al 2014 the z number modeling procedure is explained here with an example after the construction of z number valued if then rules for each lag e g see table 6 the output of the z number model is computed via the following steps for example consider the computation of the tabriz spi at time t june 2018 based on the values of ssts at time t 1 nao at time t 7 and soi at time t 9 black sea 17 557 mediterranean sea 19 481 red sea 30 159 nao 2 12 and soi 0 4 i the quantitative inputs are converted to fuzzy numbers based on ssts nao and soi classification see tables 2 and 3 and fig 5 so 17 557 19 481 30 159 2 12 0 4 are converted to m m h h m ii the degree of reliability of these fuzzy numbers is determined based on table 4 so the m m h h m is converted to m hm m hm h l h vl m lm as z numbers iii in this step the rules are weighted based on equations 4 10 and the best rules are selected rules that are not less than 0 9 of maximum weight this threshold for selecting rules 0 9 or any other number must be selected based on expert opinion the number of rules and quality of the rules in terms of confidence criterion also support criterion could affect this threshold in this example rules 94 111 and 121 are selected see table 6 iv now the consequents of the selected rules as z numbers considering their computed weights are aggregated based on the method described in section 2 6 as seen in table 6 the consequents of rules 94 111 and 121 are tabriz spi md reliability lm tabriz spi md reliability lm and tabriz spi mw reliability lm that by applying computed weights and aggregating them the output is computed as 0 0 87 1 0 44 0 0 17 0 0 68 1 0 70 0 0 73 according to the codebook fig 5 this output indicates that the tabriz spi in june 2018 will be normal with the reliability to be high to understand the procedure of computation with z numbers better an example has been presented in appendix a as mentioned before for comparing purposes only the z numbers outputs with the reliability of eh were considered considering the obtained results shown in table 7 the hss values and ta percentages of the z number and conventional fuzzy as a benchmark model models could be evaluated for each synoptic station it is notable that the ta criterion may not represent the performance of the model individually considering the seven classes of spi see table 2 the numbers of n class for tabriz about 45 of the total data are more than other classes such as ed about 2 of total data as a result the ta criterion may be affected by biased predictions for instance it is usually expected to obtain better performance for n events as major class versus poor performance for ew or ed events as the minority class consequently the hss criterion was also applied to investigate the performance of the proposed z number based model versus the conventional fuzzy model for this purpose confusion matrices for lag 1 of tabriz spi were provided as an example see table 8 as it can be seen in table 8 n class is the most frequent occurrence due to the majority of n class this confirms the possibility of biased results of ta so the ta criterion along with hss could properly investigate the performance of the applied models as it is seen in table 8 seven possible results of spi formed the confusion matrix which helps to compute the hss criterion sokolova and lapalme 2009 its rows indicate predicted values and columns indicate observed values for instance the number of observed n class with eh reliability is 1 6 37 12 1 57 in which 37 numbers are predicted correctly and 6 12 18 numbers are close to n class for all classes most of the predictions are correct and incorrect predictions are close to the observed class due to the performance results hss values of the applied methods table 7 z number based model performed better than the conventional fuzzy approach averagely up to 146 and 590 for the kermanshah and tabriz stations respectively this means that the z number based output provides the reliability of the prediction e g if output 0 0 47 1 0 04 0 0 47 0 0 88 1 0 95 0 1 according to the codebook fig 5 this output demonstrates the normal condition with an extremely high probability of occurrence besides it performs better than the conventional fuzzy model even by converting it to an interval value e g ed or sw value therefore from a practical point of view the z number based model can be a reliable option for prediction due to its ability to considering the reliability of the information the highest value of the hss criterion was obtained as 0 503 for tabriz lag 1 and 0 643 lag 1 for kermanshah stations in addition for these lags as best z number models the values of ta criterion were obtained as 64 8 for tabriz and 83 6 for kermanshah stations consequently with over 65 confidence in both stations the z number based model represented the wet dry and normal episodes of tabriz and kermanshah stations by the simultaneous use of ssts of black mediterranean and red seas nao and soi as predictors by comparing the values of hss with different lag times the most dominant lag of combined sst nao and soi time series for the z number teleconnection model could be identified for instance table 7 depicts that the z number based teleconnection model could be found at lag 1 for both tabriz and kermanshah stations this may be because the average total distances of the surrounding seas black mediterranean and red seas from the stations are approximately equal 5200 km consequently the obtained results not only illustrate the dynamic teleconnections between monthly spi events and ssts of surrounding seas nao and soi but also affirm the prediction of the selected lags i e 1 to 5 lags in advance according to the results in table 9 the ability of z number based model and conventional fuzzy in the prediction of dry spi 0 5 wet spi 0 5 and normal 0 5 spi 0 5 periods could be compared and they were investigated for tabriz and kermanshah stations as it is seen in table 9 in all lags for both tabriz and kermanshah stations spis conventional fuzzy model outputs indicate biased performance and the results of normal periods are much better than dry and wet periods showing poor performance especially in the prediction of dry periods nevertheless z number based model outputs indicate better and almost similar performance and reliable for all different dry wet and normal periods since for both stations the best teleconnection models were found at lag 1 in the following the extracted rules for this lag lag 1 were analyzed the ed sd sw and ew events were rare events compared to the md mw and n events consequently the rules with high reliability for md mw and n events were much more than ed sd sw and ew events for both stations according to the extracted rules for lag 1 with reliability eh extreme events of ed and sd occurred with combinations of m l and vl classes of ssts and h or vh class of ssts did not appear at extracted rules according to the watershed physics of tabriz and kermanshah station usually there is no precipitation in summer but even with low precipitation the wet condition occurs in the summer therefore with summer approaching and occurring h and vh ssts for both stations the ed and sd events do not occur see table 10 and practically no rule with sst of h or vh class was extracted in addition extreme events of sw and ew occurred with combinations of m l and vl classes of ssts for tabriz station and with combinations of all classes of ssts for kermanshah station since the ew or sw could happen in each season see table 10 no regular pattern was observed in the combination of soi and noi classes this may be due to the fact that positive and negative values of noi and soi are more effective in winter precipitation in iran e g dehghani et al 2020 ghasemi and khalili 2008 but in this study drought events i e ed ew and etc for all seasons have been investigated some of the antecedents of rules for each station are common between the two stations but their consequences are not necessarily the same and even caused the different events with different degrees of reliability at another station consequently to predict the drought events of each station an engineering judgment is required and it is necessary to define distinct rules for each station which originate from the physics of that station or watershed although both tabriz and kermanshah synoptic stations are located in northwestern of iran and anomalies in the ssts of the surrounding seas nao and soi affect their drought events there is a clear deviation in the discrete classes taken by antecedents therefore for practical applications the use of the same rules may not be suitable for large regions this is because large scale teleconnection processes are highly uncertain and if the study area is large uncertainty will be increased dramatically therefore although some previous studies e g dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009a vathsala and koolagudi 2017 divided continental regions with diverse precipitation regimes into sub continental areas with relatively homogenous precipitation patterns in this study ground based data in regional scale station were used for the modeling to make the results more practical for designing and management purposes the results of this study showed that for each station or watershed where fuzzy modeling has been used regarding the physics of the watershed and the judgment or patterns could be extracted by data mining to construct if then rules the z number based model could enhance the modeling performance by defining reliability for each variable and increasing use of the watershed physics as well as the judgment of the operator from the aspect of spatial assessment as stated in table 7 for all considered lag times z number based model for kermanshah station spi performed better than that for the tabriz station spi as it is clear in table 1 the coefficient of variation for tabriz station data is higher than that for the kermanshah station spi data which denotes more irregularity and nonlinearity of tabriz station data which led to a bit poor modeling performance in addition it is obvious that from table 7 by employing the z number model improvement of the modeling performance for tabriz station spi by z number regarding classic fuzzy averagely up to 590 is higher than that for the kermanshah spi up to 146 this may be due to the fact that the linear correlation between ssts and monthly spi at kermanshah station averagely up to 0 4 is higher than that for the tabriz station averagely up to 0 1 therefore the behavior of the tabriz station spi data is more complex and nonlinear compared to kermanshah station spi data the z number based model with defining reliability for each variable high degree of freedom and employing the z interpolated method as inference technique contributes to the enhancement of the performance for the tabriz station more than that for the kermanshah station the z number reasoning methodology in this paper is an improved version for example in terms of mathematics zadeh 2011 suggested the method of the zadeh extension principle for the addition of discrete fuzzy numbers but in this paper the alpha cut method was used in z numbers to satisfy the convexity of fuzzy numbers for z interpolation and obtaining output based on current observation the use of distance concept with defining a dynamic threshold for weights of rules selecting best rules was proposed also in terms of application for classes of ssts nao and soi as antecedents the reliability part of z numbers were created by frequency of occurrence of the sst nao and soi classifications i e vl l etc for the extraction of rules association mining was used also for classes of drought events as consequences the reliability parts of z numbers were created by confidence criterion that obtained using the association mining tool in fact the linkage of z number and association mining was proposed in this study 4 conclusions the uncertainties and ambiguities of real world problems in general and hydro climatic processes in particular have led to the use of fuzzy logic in modeling analyzing and decision making of such processes as suggested by previous studies e g see dhanya and nagesh kumar 2009b gadgil et al 2005 introducing nonlinearity and uncertainty in the classes taken by the indices such as ssts will enhance the long distance teleconnection modeling however conventional fuzzy logic does not discuss the reliability of data and information on the other hand the z numbers consist of the restraint and reliability of data and have significant potential to describe the uncertainty of human knowledge the use of z numbers can overcome ambiguity and enhance the objectivity of the decisions predicting drought as a complex natural hazard is associated with uncertainty and it is necessary to develop models to handle such uncertainty especially in regions such as iran which is categorized as arid to semi arid as discussed in sub section 2 2 due to the importance of teleconnections in the hydro climatic system of iran the main aim of this research was to design a system to predict the future state of the drought wet and normal episodes according to spi of tabriz and kermanshah stations based on the ssts of surrounding seas nao and soi due to the complexity of the large scale teleconnection processes and weak performance of point prediction tools in such situations using the concept of z numbers a system was designed to perform class prediction of the drought events the proposed method is a mathematical model which is based on the fuzzy logic method so for any regions or watershed where fuzzy modeling has been used or patterns could be extracted the proposed z number based model could enhance the modeling performance by defining reliability for each variable and increasing use of the watershed physics so that to predict the drought events of each station hydrological and engineering judgment will be incorpraite into the rules for each station the z number based model not only could provide reliability of the predictions but also performed better than the conventional fuzzy model even by converting its output from an ordered pair of fuzzy numbers to a single value or interval value the results indicated that the z number based model could present more comprehensive and accurate results averagely up to 146 and 590 for the kermanshah and tabriz station spis respectively because of its ability to consider uncertainty and reliability of the information and allocating appropriate weights to the rules overall the z number concept as a new generation of fuzzy logic concept can be applied to different fields of water resources engineering where considering the reliability of the events is possible and can improve the overall performance of the modeling credit authorship contribution statement vahid nourani conceptualization supervision

4501,a new analytical solution for nonlinear storage routing with a general power law storage function is presented the resulting implicit solution expressed in terms of the incomplete beta function is valid for inflow hydrographs that may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths the new solution thus extends the existing analytical solutions reported in the literature which are valid only for specific exponents in the power law storage function an explicit solution expressed in terms of the lambert w function is also presented for reservoirs for reservoirs with linear storage elevation relationship and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet to support practical design applications and to demonstrate the utility of the new solution we provide approximate explicit solutions and four simple applications the results show that being exact the new solution is not subject to numerical errors or instabilities and may hence be used in a variety of modeling design optimization forecasting and control applications involving nonlinear routing with power law storage functions keywords nonlinear storage routing power law storage 1 introduction hydraulic routing involves solving the governing equations of conservation of mass and momentum widely known as the saint venant s v equations chanson 2004 whereas hydraulic routing models represent the most accurate method for flood routing in theory kim and georgakakos 2014 they require large amounts of data to prescribe the fixed boundary conditions of channel geometry and elaborate numerical integration to ensure stability and accuracy szymkiewicz 2010 hydrologic routing models on the other hand are significantly simpler and easier to use but can only provide predictions at a limited number of locations due to their lumped nature kim and georgakakos 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 mccuen 2004 noh et al 2018 depending on the flow type accuracy requirement data availability and computing power different hydrologic routing models may be used kim and georgakakos 2014 provided a historical review of hydrologic routing models including the reservoir routing goodrich 1931 muskingum mccarthy 1938 lag and k linsley et al 1949 and muskingum cunge cunge 1969 and introduced a new conceptual river routing method based on nonlinear cascade of reservoirs storage based routing models are among the oldest and most widely used in hydrology including engineering hydrology and operational flood forecasting fread and hsu 1993 nourani et al 2009 the recently launched national water model nws 2021a also uses muskingum cunge as one of the channel routing methods and level pool routing for reservoirs and lakes as such advancing hydrologic routing continues to be a significant topic of research the purpose of this paper is to present new analytical exact and semi analytical approximate solutions and their applications for nonlinear reservoir routing with general power law storage where the underlying level pool assumption is justified see ayalew et al 2014 bentura and michel 1997 chi et al 2015 gupta 2004 gupta and waymire 1998 mandapaka venkata 2009 mantilla et al 2006 mantilla and gupta 2005 menabde and sivapalan 2001 reggiani et al 2001 small et al 2013 just to name several the concept of nonlinear storage in routing is well known though the wide channel simplification of the manning s equation orlandini and rosso 1998 yu and lim 2003 and the level pool assumption remain controversial fread et al 1978 goodell and wahlin 2009 nonlinear hydrologic routing has been used extensively in hydrologic modeling and prediction ranging from routing flow through a channel or a storage structure to simulating flow through networks of channels as in cuencas mantilla and gupta 2005 and topkapi todini and ciarapica 2001 in what follows a brief background on nonlinear routing with power law storage as it pertains to the development of this paper is presented the continuity equation for storage routing is given by carter and godfrey 1960 1 ds dt i q where i q and s denote the inflow outflow and storage at time t respectively in most real world applications the storage and outflow are not known jointly and hence an additional equation is needed to solve eq 1 this closing equation relates storage with discharge and is referred to as the storage outflow relationship or storage function chow et al 1988 sugiyama et al 1997 numerous studies basha 2000 1995 1994 boyd et al 1979 sugiyama et al 1997 tallaksen 1995 to name a few have postulated that the storage outflow relationship may be expressed as the following power law function 2 s κ q ε where κ and ε denote the storage coefficient and exponent respectively in eq 2 the assumptions that the storage function is time invariant or uniformly nonlinear dooge 2005 and that s is a proper function of q are implicitly considered in eq 2 the coefficient κ measures the ratio between the capacity of the reservoir and that of the discharge from the reservoir the coefficient κ is larger for a large storage capacity with small outflow and smaller for a small reservoir with large outflow if an outlet is so large that it is not restricting flow at all κ is effectively zero mitchell 1962 for ε 1 eq 1 becomes nonlinear reservoir routing the value of ε determines the relative shape of the outflow hydrograph and generally ranges between 0 and 1 with an average of 0 5 for unconfined aquifers hammond and han 2006 mitchell 1962 suggested that the lower bound of ε is about 0 67 which corresponds to the critical depth of a reservoir with vertical side walls however the mathematical lower bound of ε is 0 in general reservoirs with flatter side slopes have larger ε mitchell 1962 sugiyama et al 1997 studied dozens of flood events in catchments of varying sizes and concluded that ε varies between 0 3 and 1 with an average of 0 6 smaller ε corresponds to concave recession curves whereas ε larger than 1 corresponds to convex curves hammond and han 2006 note that ε is dimensionless and the dimension of parameter κ depends on ε and equals l 3 3 ε t ε where l and t are length and time dimensions respectively many previous works have similarly analyzed the physical interpretation of the exponent ε with a focus on the recession curves of nonlinear routing with no inflow botter et al 2009 boyd et al 1979 with inflow the effect of ε on the shape of the outflow hydrograph is more complex if ε 1 eq 2 becomes linear and hence eq 1 refers to linear reservoir routing most real world hydrological systems however do not behave as linear storages dooge 2005 kim and georgakakos 2014 to address this limitation many authors presented a variety of modeling approaches such the cascading linear reservoirs chow et al 1988 nash 1957 multilinear methods camacho and lees 1999 perumal 1992 sahoo 2013 and piecewise linear approximation of the nonlinear storage processes ostrowski 2010 basha 1995 offered an approximate solution via perturbation expansion around nominal ε glynn and glynn 1996 presented a diffusion approximation for a network of nonlinear reservoirs with power law release rules to the best of the authors knowledge however no exact general solutions have been reported to date for eqs 1 and 2 with ε 1 a number of studies including hughes and murrell 1986 basha 1995 david 2009 and del giudice et al 2014 suggested that no analytical solution exists for non zero inflows unless ε equals 1 2 or 1 they presented several numerical solution methods and postulated that the accuracy of the solutions depends on the time interval used in the numerical integration in this paper we present an exact implicit solution for nonlinear routing of eq 1 with the general power law storage function of eq 2 for constant inflow the solution may be parametrized either by using statistical methods similarly to the muskingum method linsley et al 1949 or by using hydraulic properties of the channels similarly to the muskingum cunge method chow et al 1988 in this work we expressed the power law storage function parameters in terms of the hydraulic properties of the channels and the geometry of the storage structure because any real world inflow hydrograph may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths the exact solution is completely general the proposed solution may therefore be used in a wide range of applications including modeling design forecasting and control of flow through single or cascades of reservoirs and networks of channels this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the exact implicit solution of eqs 1 and 2 section 3 presents the general expressions for the parameters of the power law storage functions commonly encountered in reservoir and channel routing in the real world sections 4 and 5 present approximate explicit solutions and simple applications of the proposed solutions for different types of routing respectively section 6 provides discussion section 7 presents the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 exact solution for nonlinear routing with power law storage function using the chain rule we may rewrite eq 1 as 3 dq dt i q ds d q if the storage function is of the power law type of eq 2 there exist real valued parameters a and b such that 4 1 ds d q a q b where a 1 κ ε and b 1 ε combining eqs 3 and 4 we have the following nonhomogeneous nonlinear ordinary differential equation 5 dq dt a q b i q where the parameter b is the dimensionless and the parameter a has a dimension l 3 b t b 1 where l and t are length and time dimensions respectively note that eq 5 is identical to the horton izzard model dooge 1973 ponce 2014 commonly used to model nonlinear overland flow moore and bell 2001 described the application of eq 5 in operational flood forecasting in the united kingdom and show the analogy between the nonlinear power law storage function and the horton izzard equation they also postulated that such nonlinear storages commonly occur in many physical elements in the rainfall runoff processes and that it is reasonable to extend the nonlinear storage model to a wide range of input storage output system such as a soil column aquifer storage or surface storage at catchment scale various modeling efforts reported in the literature using the horton izzard equation may be replicated with eq 5 following simple mathematical manipulations for example moore and bell 2001 used an inverse definition of q k s m to describe specific discharge on a sloping plane following dooge 1973 and ponce et al 1997 they also discussed how horton introduced the index of turbulence 3 3 m 4 3 2 3 b 4 1 b which ranges from 0 to 1 by combining the power law storage function with the manning s equation of sheet flow under the wide channel assumption an index of turbulence of 0 results from m 3 b 2 3 and corresponds to laminar flow whereas an index of 1 results from m 5 3 b 2 5 and indicates turbulent flow the analytical solution for the horton izzard model exists only for rational values of m and closed form solutions existed only for specific values of m gill 1977 1976 jolley and wheater 1997 moore et al 2005 moore and bell 2002 2001 for this reason researchers and practitioners have frequently been forced to approximate m and optimize k for instance the thames catchment model young 1997 uses the analytical solution to the quadratic storage model ε 1 2 the pdm model young 1997 uses an approximate recursive solution based on a piecewise linear difference equation to solve the cubic storage function ε 2 3 meert et al 2016 also used a piecewise linearization approach the general solution removes such approximations and complications the subsections below provide the exact solutions for eq 5 and by extension the horton izzard nonlinear storage equation 2 1 outflow smaller than non zero inflow introducing q q i and using separation of variables we may rewrite eq 5 as follows for a sufficiently short time interval over which the inflow i may be assumed constant 6 dq q b 1 q a i b d t to integrate the left hand side lhs of eq 6 we note that the denominator therein is the integrand of the incomplete beta function ibf dutka 1981 7 β x u w 0 x ϕ u 1 1 ϕ w 1 d ϕ 0 x 1 where u and v are either positive real numbers or negative integers al sirehy and fisher 2013 assigning u 1 b and w 0 in eq 7 substituting q i for q in the lhs of eq 6 and prescribing q t 0 q 0 as the initial condition ic of eq 5 we obtain the following exact implicit solution for q 8 β q i 1 b 0 β q 0 i 1 b 0 a i b t t 0 q 0 i with b 1 ε the above solution may be expressed in terms of the exponent ε in the storage discharge relation note that the real world domain of ε 0 matches the mathematical domain of b 1 as required by the ibf eq 8 may be used to obtain the outflow q due to an arbitrary inflow hydrograph i discretized into a series of constant pulses i t i solving for q in eq 8 amounts to nonlinear root finding for which one may use a combination of look up tables for evaluation of the ibfs and iterative numerical algorithms al sirehy and fisher 2013 once the calculation for a pulse of inflow is complete one may continue to the next pulse i t i 1 with q 0 and t 0 in eq 8 reinitialized because β x u w is real valued for 0 x 1 only eq 8 is applicable only if q 0 i t i if the outflow exceeds the constant inflow it is necessary to use a second solution which is described below 2 2 outflow larger than non zero inflow when the initial value of outflow q 0 is larger than the constant inflow i a change of variable of q i q may be used to rewrite eq 5 in terms of q as follows 9 d q q 1 b 1 q a i b d t assigning u b and w 0 in eq 7 substituting i q for q in the lhs of eq 9 and prescribing q t 0 q 0 as the ic one arrives at the following exact implicit solution for q i 10 β i q b 0 β i q 0 b 0 a i b t t 0 q i 2 3 zero inflow when there is no inflow i e i 0 the analytic solutions above are no longer applicable instead one may simplify eq 5 to 11 dq dt a q b 1 eq 11 may be integrated via separation of variables to yield the following exact solution for q which represents the recession curve for nonlinear reservoir with a general power law storage function 12 q t 1 q 0 b a b t t 0 1 b once q is

conventional ibf özçaḡ et al 2008 14 β x η 0 ln 1 x i 1 n 1 x i i 15 β x η 0 l n x 1 x i 1 n x i i where η 1 2 when b is an integer eqs 14 and 15 may be used to replace the lhs of eqs 8 and 10 the right hand side of eqs 14 and 15 are a generalization of the previously known analytical solutions of moore and bell 2002 a commonly encountered but particularly interesting case is when b 1 as in reservoirs with linear storage elevation relationships and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet using eq 15 one may show that the nonlinear routing with power law storage function has a compact explicit analytical solution expressed in terms of the lambert w function w corless et al 1996 16 q t i 1 w q 0 i e q 0 a t t 0 i i i known also as the lambert euler omega function pudasaini 2011 the lambert w function appears in the solution of many real world problems corless et al 1996 p et al 2000 scott et al 2006 it is worth noting that the lambert w function has also been used in the similarity solution of the richards equation explicit expressions for green ampt infiltration rate barry et al 1993 li et al 2015 parlange et al 2002 to name a few exact solutions for debris and avalanche flows pudasaini 2011 and shallow flow in sloping unconfined aquifers barnes 2018 3 storage function parameters to use the above solution it is necessary to specify the parameters a and b except when simple geometries are involved the best approach in most practical applications is to calibrate them using observed inflow and outflow see wittenberg 1994 for those cases with known simple geometries or where calibration is not possible theoretical expressions may be used this section presents the theoretical parameters for widely used reservoir and channel routing applications 3 1 for reservoir routing the storage elevation relationship is assumed to follow the power law function below 17 s s b σ h τ h 0 where s b m3 denotes the reservoir volume below the outlet h m denotes the elevation above the outlet and σ and τ denote the power law parameters approximating the volume of the reservoir above the outlet in the following s b is assumed zero for the sake of simplicity the width of the reservoir above the outlet structure b m is also assumed to follow a power law function 18 b ω 0 h ω 1 ω 0 0 a n d ω 1 0 the reservoir s cross sectional area a y m2 may be obtained by integrating b over h 19 a y ω 0 1 ω 1 h 1 ω 1 h 0 the storage elevation relationship of eq 17 may now be written as 20 s a y l x l x ω 0 1 ω 1 h 1 ω 1 h 0 where l x m denotes the longitudinal dimension of the reservoir to describe the outflow as a function of flow depth a power law rating curve is used 21 q r 0 h r 1 h 0 if the reservoir has an overflow spillway its outflow follows the weir equation chanson 2004 with r 0 2 3 c d l s 2 g and r 1 1 5 where c d denotes the coefficient of discharge l s m denotes the length of spillway perpendicular to direction of flow and g denotes the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 if the reservoir has an orifice spillway its outflow follows the orifice equation chanson 2004 with r 0 c d a 0 2 g and r 1 0 5 where a 0 m2 denotes the area of the orifice substituting eq 21 in eq 4 differentiating the lhs with respect to q and equating with the rhs one has for the storage function parameters a and b 22 a r 1 r 0 ω 1 1 r 1 l x ω 0 and b 1 ω 1 1 r 1 notice that the combination of ω 1 0 i e linear storage elevation relationship and r 1 0 5 e g orifices or submerged openings in sluice gates results in b 1 for which the nonlinear routing problem with power law function admits the explicit solution of eq 16 in terms of the lambert w function 3 2 for channel routing the horton izzard equation has been widely used to model overland flows moore and bell 2001 if the simplifying assumption of level pool routing is justified see e g fread and hsu 1993 for criteria the power law storage function may be derived for channel routing using the hydraulic properties of channels as described below the flow resistance equation for wide channels combines the geometric properties of the channel cross section and flow properties menabde and sivapalan 2001 yen 2002 23 v c 0 y c 1 s 0 c 2 where v m s denotes the mean velocity y m denotes the depth and s 0 m m denotes the slope in the above c 0 c 1 and c 2 are the flow resistance equation coefficients given by c 0 1 n c 1 2 3 and c 2 1 2 for the manning s equation c 0 c c 1 1 2 and c 2 1 2 for the chezy equation and c 0 8 g f c 1 1 2 and c 2 1 2 for the darcy weisbach equation where n s m1 3 c m1 2 s and f dimensionless denote the respective roughness coefficient the cross sectional area of the channel a m2 is approximated by a power law function 24 a a 0 y a 1 where a 0 and a 1 are the parameters of the power law cross section for example for a rectangular channel a 0 is the width of the channel and a 1 is unity the discharge is given by the continuity equation 25 q a v a 0 c 0 y a 1 c 1 s 0 c 2 solving eq 25 for the depth y gives 26 y q a 0 c 0 s 0 c 2 1 a 1 c 1 assuming that the change in depth over the channel is not very large and the unsteadiness of flood wave has a wavelength larger than the channel length l m the storage s m3 in the channel is given by mccuen 2004 27 s a l a 0 l y a 1 substituting eq 26 in eq 27 and rearranging one has for s 28 s l c 0 a 1 a 1 c 1 a 0 c 1 a 1 c 1 s 0 a 1 c 2 a 1 c 1 q a 1 a 1 c 1 using eq 28 one may write the parameters a and b in eq 4 as 29 a a 1 c 1 a 1 l c 0 a 1 a 1 c 1 a 0 c 1 a 1 c 1 s 0 a 1 c 2 a 1 c 1 b c 1 a 1 c 1 in the above development the parameters a and b are determined by the flow resistance equation of choice in practice they may be prescribed empirically based on actual observations for hillslope flow there may not exist the necessary physiographic information to prescribe the parameters in such cases one may use the fractal relationships if self similarity holds for the hillslope networks menabde and sivapalan 2001 4 approximate explicit solutions the exact solution eq 8 is in an implicit form for practical applications an explicit solution which requires inversion of the ibf is highly desirable to the best of authors knowledge a compact explicit approximation does not exist for the inverse of the ibf in this section we offer symbolic approximations instead the above inverse problem is equivalent to finding the function y ψ x b such that 30 β y 1 b 0 x the nonlinear routing problem is thus transformed into evaluating the ψ function in the following expression 31 q t i ψ β q 0 i 1 b 0 a i b t t 0 b below we approximate ψ to solve nonlinear routing with power law storage explicitly 4 1 compact expression for rising limb to the best of our knowledge approximations of the inverse of the ibf have not been reported in the literature in this work we use the following approximate inverse function developed via symbolic regression analysis when the initial outflow is smaller than the inflow i e 0 x q t i 1 we may approximate ψ r x b with 32 ψ r x b erf 1 p 0 p 1 x p 2 0 x q t i 1 where erf denotes the error function and p o p 1 and p 2 denote the coefficients to be prescribed for 4 b 0 01 eq 32 may be evaluated with a maximum error of 0 004 using the following symbolic solutions for p 0 to p 2 33 p 0 0 00330406 b 3 0 0385704 b 2 0 246985 b 0 261149 34 p 1 0 00363074 b 6 0

error of 0 007 when p 0 to p 2 are given by 36 p 0 0 101487 b 2 0 251458 b 0 264601 37 p 1 exp 38 27 b 4 35 5156 b 3 14 4538 b 2 0 665017 b 0 313546 38 p 2 exp 1 60103 b 3 0 372287 b 2 1 15131 b 0 0738377 because the level pool assumption puts the peak outflow on the inflow hydrograph eq 32 may be used to approximate the peak outflow due to a constant inflow i d m3 s with duration t d s for example if the reservoir is initially empty the peak outflow of q p m3 s satisfies 39 q p i d erf 1 p 0 p 1 a i d b t d p 2 the peak storage s p m3 may be approximated using eq 13 as 40 s p s 0 erf 1 p 0 p 1 a i d b t d p 2 i d 1 b q 0 1 b a 1 b 4 2 series expansions for rising and falling limbs following dominici 2005 an approximate expression for the inverse of the ibf may be obtained by a series expansion in the neighborhood of valid x 0 this approach utilizes the nested derivative operator defined as 41 d z f x d dx f x d z 1 f x with d 0 f x 1 accordingly the inverse function values for the rising and falling portions of the solution ψ r and ψ f respectively are given by 42 ψ r x b x 0 f r x 0 z 1 d z 1 f r x 0 x β x 0 1 b 0 z z f r x 0 1 x 0 x 0 b 43 ψ f x b x 0 f p x 0 z 1 d z 1 f p x 0 x β x 0 b 0 z z f p x 0 1 x 0 x 0 1 b care should be taken in choosing x 0 to ensure f r and f p have non zero real values at that point a faster but less accurate method is to choose a fixed x 0 throughout the entire simulation a generally more accurate approach is to update x 0 at each time step with the latest known value from the previous time step another important factor in applying eqs 42 and 43 is the number of terms summed in the partial series fig 1 shows the difference between the exact and approximated values of the inverse of the ibf for ψ r x b with x 0 0 75 the figure indicates that even a small number of terms in the series sum yields accurate results if the time increments are chosen for x to remain relatively close to x 0 5 applications this section presents four simple applications of the above solutions to different types of routing problems the first and second show the ability of the proposed solution in simulating laboratory observed flows in reservoir and channel respectively the third uses the proposed solution for real world river flood routing and compares with the observed flow and the s v solution the last application uses the approximate explicit solution for detention pond design 5 1 reservoir routing with orifice spillway the laboratory data from kilduff 2002 are used to validate the proposed solution in this application a constant inflow of 12 3 ml s is applied to a cylindrical reservoir with a base area of 71 cm2 the inflow is kept constant for a duration of 300 s and then shut off completely the water surface elevation is observed above a 0 4 cm orifice with h q 2 19 131 where h denotes the elevation above the outlet in cm and q denotes the discharge in cm 3 s using eqs 21 and 22 one has a 0 13473 c m 3 s 2 and b 1 solving eq 8 for h with a time step of 5 s we have the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 993 with the observed water surface elevation see fig 2 in the figure there exists an outlying observed water level given that this case study is a simple laboratory experiment with well known behavior the outlier is likely to be an observational error since b 1 eq 16 is applicable in this example and the routed hydrograph can be obtained implicitly in terms of the lambert w function as q t 12 3 w 0 36788 e 0 01095 t 1 for t 300 after the inflow is shut off eq 12 gives q t 52 54739 0 13473 t for 300 t 390 note that in this application the explicit analytical solution of eq 16 results in peak water level of 74 86 cm which is very close to the observed value of 75 03 cm for comparison the compact approximate solution of eq 32 yields a peak water level of 76 32 cm 5 2 level pool channel routing with significant floodplain storage de martino et al 2012 assessed the assumption of level pool routing in an experimental channel they confirmed via extensive experimental investigations that the level pool assumption may be reliably applied for floodplain storage and concluded that vegetation and channel bottom irregularities are larger sources of uncertainties in flood modeling than the level pool assumption they also deduce that simple storage based methods such as the ones presented in this paper are preferred for preliminary sizing of floodplain storages in flat areas in the following we validate the proposed solutions using the data from the out of bank portion of one of their experiments where the power low equations hold true in this test the flow is out of bank during the period of 52 to 350 s with the floodplain storage area of a 29 12 m 2 the storage elevation relationship is linear with s 29 12 h the outlet is a sluice gate with a 0 05 m opening using eqs 18 through 22 one arrives at a 6 98 10 5 m 3 s 2 and b 1 based on these values the explicit solution of eq 16 is used with a time step of 10 s to predict the observed flows with r 2 0 951 as shown in fig 3 note that from 52 to 212 s the inflow is effectively constant for which the average value is 0 066 m3 s given the initial outflow of 0 035 m3 s the lambert w function based explicit solution of eq 16 is able to predict the peak observed outflow of 0 043 m3 s with only one calculation step 5 3 channel routing in this example a flash flooding event in a natural waterway was chosen from akbari and barati 2012 the channel has width of 10 m slope of 0 0012 length of 25 km and manning s roughness of 0 035 s m1 3 for this event the observed inflow and outflow hydrographs are available as well as the s v solution which is used here for additional comparison fig 4 shows that the proposed solution with calibrated parameters of a 4 25 10 4 m 0 5982 s 0 8006 and b 0 1994 and a time step of 1 min is able to simulate the observed flows extremely closely r 2 0 997 overall the nonlinear storage routing compares well with the s v solution not surprisingly however the shape of the hydrograph and the peak flow are less accurate than the s v solution due to the level pool assumption which forces the peak outflow on the inflow hydrograph 5 4 detention pond design in this application the approximate explicit solution of eq 39 is used to design a detention pond the pond has a 10 m by 5 m rectangular base it is desired to size an orifice outlet to reduce peak outflow for a 0 25 m3 s inflow the approximate solution of eq 39 may be used to estimate the reduction in peak outflow the peak storage curves see fig 5 obtained from eq 40 may be used to verify that the maximum available physical storage is not exceeded alternatively given the dimensions of the pond and the orifice outlet one may approximate the combined effect of changes in the magnitude and duration of inflow on the peak outflow fig 6 shows the results with a 0 5 m diameter outflow orifice 6 discussion the main purpose of this study is to provide new analytical solutions for level pool routing with general power law storage discharge relationship and to advance the theory of nonlinear hydrologic routing a number of examples are presented to demonstrate the utility of the analytical solutions in a wide range of practical applications if accuracy is of primary concern the analytical solutions of eqs 8 10 and 16 should be favored over numerical solutions the choice of the routing method however depends on many other factors such as the validity of the underlying assumptions nonlinearity of flow availability of both real time and historical data parsimony desired ease of implementation and computational requirements and resources available the relative importance of these factors is very often application specific and hence the choice of the solution approach may vary significantly below we elaborate on the assumptions and limitations for the proposed solutions and offer computational considerations for implementation to aid such decision making for comparisons among different numerical flood routing methods the reader is referred to strelkoff 1980 ponce et al 1997 and ponce 2014 power law storage function is a fundamental assumption for the presented solutions as described in section 3 these parameters represent the geometry and hydraulics in the storage discharge relationship in applying the solutions presented in this work it is important that the power law definitions are consistent with the formulations in section 3 as alternative formulations are also possible note also that the solution presented is limited to the elevations above spillway i e the surcharge storage viessman and lewis 2008 power law storage function is generally not consistent with multiple types of outlet structures but may still provide acceptable approximation if the power law storage discharge relationship is not sufficiently well modeled by a single set of coefficients it may be necessary to employ multiple sets of the parameter estimates for local approximation such approaches are routinely practiced in operational river routing in the form of layered coefficient routing fread 1985 nws 2021b as such the power law assumption is not as large a limiting factor as it may first appear as is often the case in practice one may improve the accuracy by calibrating the two coefficients or adjusting the a priori estimates obtained from the geometric and hydraulic considerations based on observed hydrographs when and where available it is also noted here that the ibf solution offers a potentially significant advantage in gradient based parameter optimization over other numerical routing techniques because the derivatives can be evaluated very accurately the proposed solutions assume a level pool reservoir it is widely accepted that level pool routing is more appropriate for smaller reservoirs with rounder shape where backwater effects are not significant chow et al 1988 ionescu and nistoran 2019 level pool routing is also widely used for channel routing for which a reach is subdivided into a series of level pools with prescribed storage discharge relationships usace 2021 the degree of attenuation in the routed flood wave may vary depending on the number of sub reaches chosen which is often treated as a calibration parameter bonner 1990 usace 1994 level pool routing and hence the proposed solutions are not recommended for streams with gradients less than 0 0004 to 0006 reaches with time varying boundary conditions such as tides or rapidly rising flood hydrographs bonner 1990 usace 1994 the assumption of constant inflow is of little practical significance because the observed and simulated inflow hydrographs are already discretized according to the sampling interval of the instrument and the time step of the simulation respectively if the hydrograph is over sampled such that the discharge varies very little over a short time period one may coarsen the discretization to reduce the number of ibf evaluations in such a case the level of discretization should be chosen such that the sampling frequency captures the variations and peakedness in the inflow hydrograph the analytical solution requires evaluation of the ibf if the ibf is not available as a built in or intrinsic function in the user s computing environment one may use external mathematical libraries see for example http www meta numerics net and https www boost org the main computing requirement for the analytical solution comes from solving for q in the implicit expressions of eqs 8 and 10 the above nonlinear root finding problem may be solved using a number of readily available techniques faires and burden 2012 a potential difficulty in the above solution is slow convergence near the poles of the ibf but may be avoided by using derivative free techniques for example with the bisection method faires and burden 2012 a conservative estimate for the number of iterations required to determine q is l o g 2 i q 0 tol 1 where tol is the desired tolerance faires and burden 2012 though there may exist more efficient methods the bisection method is very attractive for the ibf a strictly monotonically increasing function owing to its simplicity and the availability of the a priori estimate for convergence because the proposed solution is analytical one does not have to be concerned about numerical errors or diffusion and may hence expect to obtain extremely accurate solutions to illustrate below we offer a comparison of the proposed solution with a number of numerical integration schemes for an inflow hydrograph shown as a series of pulses in fig 7 the example hydrograph is based on fenton 2010 in which a small reservoir with square base of 100 m by 100 m and a weir outlet with a width of 4 m is subjected to an inflow hydrograph of the following general form 44 i t i 0 i p i 0 t t p e 1 t t p 5 where i 0 is the initial inflow of 1 m3 s i p is the peak inflow of 20 m3 s and t p is the time to peak of 30 min it follows from section 3 1 that a is 0 000554 m3s 2 and b is 0 31927 the above hydrograph is resampled at an interval of 300 s to emulate a discrete observed hydrograph in the real world an accurate method of lines numerical solution with high resolution adaptive mesh hamdi et al 2007 wolfram 2021 is used to obtain the reference true outflow hydrograph see fig 7 we then used the different solution methods shown in table 1 to route the inflow hydrograph at time steps of 10 30 and 60 s the small time steps were chosen to ensure that the variations in the inflow hydrograph are captured for all solution techniques considered fig 7 shows the results for the analytical solution with δ t 60 s vs the reference truth as expected they are indistinguishably close table 1 shows the maximum errors in percent in the proposed and numerical solutions for the duration of the hydrograph because all three time steps are smaller than the sampling interval of the inflow hydrograph i e 300 s the analytical solution results are effectively the same for all time steps the maximum errors in the numerical solutions on the other hand show significant sensitivity to the time step and vary significantly among themselves it is seen that the higher order solutions tend to be more accurate among the

4501,a new analytical solution for nonlinear storage routing with a general power law storage function is presented the resulting implicit solution expressed in terms of the incomplete beta function is valid for inflow hydrographs that may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths the new solution thus extends the existing analytical solutions reported in the literature which are valid only for specific exponents in the power law storage function an explicit solution expressed in terms of the lambert w function is also presented for reservoirs for reservoirs with linear storage elevation relationship and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet to support practical design applications and to demonstrate the utility of the new solution we provide approximate explicit solutions and four simple applications the results show that being exact the new solution is not subject to numerical errors or instabilities and may hence be used in a variety of modeling design optimization forecasting and control applications involving nonlinear routing with power law storage functions keywords nonlinear storage routing power law storage 1 introduction hydraulic routing involves solving the governing equations of conservation of mass and momentum widely known as the saint venant s v equations chanson 2004 whereas hydraulic routing models represent the most accurate method for flood routing in theory kim and georgakakos 2014 they require large amounts of data to prescribe the fixed boundary conditions of channel geometry and elaborate numerical integration to ensure stability and accuracy szymkiewicz 2010 hydrologic routing models on the other hand are significantly simpler and easier to use but can only provide predictions at a limited number of locations due to their lumped nature kim and georgakakos 2014 mazzoleni et al 2018 mccuen 2004 noh et al 2018 depending on the flow type accuracy requirement data availability and computing power different hydrologic routing models may be used kim and georgakakos 2014 provided a historical review of hydrologic routing models including the reservoir routing goodrich 1931 muskingum mccarthy 1938 lag and k linsley et al 1949 and muskingum cunge cunge 1969 and introduced a new conceptual river routing method based on nonlinear cascade of reservoirs storage based routing models are among the oldest and most widely used in hydrology including engineering hydrology and operational flood forecasting fread and hsu 1993 nourani et al 2009 the recently launched national water model nws 2021a also uses muskingum cunge as one of the channel routing methods and level pool routing for reservoirs and lakes as such advancing hydrologic routing continues to be a significant topic of research the purpose of this paper is to present new analytical exact and semi analytical approximate solutions and their applications for nonlinear reservoir routing with general power law storage where the underlying level pool assumption is justified see ayalew et al 2014 bentura and michel 1997 chi et al 2015 gupta 2004 gupta and waymire 1998 mandapaka venkata 2009 mantilla et al 2006 mantilla and gupta 2005 menabde and sivapalan 2001 reggiani et al 2001 small et al 2013 just to name several the concept of nonlinear storage in routing is well known though the wide channel simplification of the manning s equation orlandini and rosso 1998 yu and lim 2003 and the level pool assumption remain controversial fread et al 1978 goodell and wahlin 2009 nonlinear hydrologic routing has been used extensively in hydrologic modeling and prediction ranging from routing flow through a channel or a storage structure to simulating flow through networks of channels as in cuencas mantilla and gupta 2005 and topkapi todini and ciarapica 2001 in what follows a brief background on nonlinear routing with power law storage as it pertains to the development of this paper is presented the continuity equation for storage routing is given by carter and godfrey 1960 1 ds dt i q where i q and s denote the inflow outflow and storage at time t respectively in most real world applications the storage and outflow are not known jointly and hence an additional equation is needed to solve eq 1 this closing equation relates storage with discharge and is referred to as the storage outflow relationship or storage function chow et al 1988 sugiyama et al 1997 numerous studies basha 2000 1995 1994 boyd et al 1979 sugiyama et al 1997 tallaksen 1995 to name a few have postulated that the storage outflow relationship may be expressed as the following power law function 2 s κ q ε where κ and ε denote the storage coefficient and exponent respectively in eq 2 the assumptions that the storage function is time invariant or uniformly nonlinear dooge 2005 and that s is a proper function of q are implicitly considered in eq 2 the coefficient κ measures the ratio between the capacity of the reservoir and that of the discharge from the reservoir the coefficient κ is larger for a large storage capacity with small outflow and smaller for a small reservoir with large outflow if an outlet is so large that it is not restricting flow at all κ is effectively zero mitchell 1962 for ε 1 eq 1 becomes nonlinear reservoir routing the value of ε determines the relative shape of the outflow hydrograph and generally ranges between 0 and 1 with an average of 0 5 for unconfined aquifers hammond and han 2006 mitchell 1962 suggested that the lower bound of ε is about 0 67 which corresponds to the critical depth of a reservoir with vertical side walls however the mathematical lower bound of ε is 0 in general reservoirs with flatter side slopes have larger ε mitchell 1962 sugiyama et al 1997 studied dozens of flood events in catchments of varying sizes and concluded that ε varies between 0 3 and 1 with an average of 0 6 smaller ε corresponds to concave recession curves whereas ε larger than 1 corresponds to convex curves hammond and han 2006 note that ε is dimensionless and the dimension of parameter κ depends on ε and equals l 3 3 ε t ε where l and t are length and time dimensions respectively many previous works have similarly analyzed the physical interpretation of the exponent ε with a focus on the recession curves of nonlinear routing with no inflow botter et al 2009 boyd et al 1979 with inflow the effect of ε on the shape of the outflow hydrograph is more complex if ε 1 eq 2 becomes linear and hence eq 1 refers to linear reservoir routing most real world hydrological systems however do not behave as linear storages dooge 2005 kim and georgakakos 2014 to address this limitation many authors presented a variety of modeling approaches such the cascading linear reservoirs chow et al 1988 nash 1957 multilinear methods camacho and lees 1999 perumal 1992 sahoo 2013 and piecewise linear approximation of the nonlinear storage processes ostrowski 2010 basha 1995 offered an approximate solution via perturbation expansion around nominal ε glynn and glynn 1996 presented a diffusion approximation for a network of nonlinear reservoirs with power law release rules to the best of the authors knowledge however no exact general solutions have been reported to date for eqs 1 and 2 with ε 1 a number of studies including hughes and murrell 1986 basha 1995 david 2009 and del giudice et al 2014 suggested that no analytical solution exists for non zero inflows unless ε equals 1 2 or 1 they presented several numerical solution methods and postulated that the accuracy of the solutions depends on the time interval used in the numerical integration in this paper we present an exact implicit solution for nonlinear routing of eq 1 with the general power law storage function of eq 2 for constant inflow the solution may be parametrized either by using statistical methods similarly to the muskingum method linsley et al 1949 or by using hydraulic properties of the channels similarly to the muskingum cunge method chow et al 1988 in this work we expressed the power law storage function parameters in terms of the hydraulic properties of the channels and the geometry of the storage structure because any real world inflow hydrograph may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths the exact solution is completely general the proposed solution may therefore be used in a wide range of applications including modeling design forecasting and control of flow through single or cascades of reservoirs and networks of channels this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the exact implicit solution of eqs 1 and 2 section 3 presents the general expressions for the parameters of the power law storage functions commonly encountered in reservoir and channel routing in the real world sections 4 and 5 present approximate explicit solutions and simple applications of the proposed solutions for different types of routing respectively section 6 provides discussion section 7 presents the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 exact solution for nonlinear routing with power law storage function using the chain rule we may rewrite eq 1 as 3 dq dt i q ds d q if the storage function is of the power law type of eq 2 there exist real valued parameters a and b such that 4 1 ds d q a q b where a 1 κ ε and b 1 ε combining eqs 3 and 4 we have the following nonhomogeneous nonlinear ordinary differential equation 5 dq dt a q b i q where the parameter b is the dimensionless and the parameter a has a dimension l 3 b t b 1 where l and t are length and time dimensions respectively note that eq 5 is identical to the horton izzard model dooge 1973 ponce 2014 commonly used to model nonlinear overland flow moore and bell 2001 described the application of eq 5 in operational flood forecasting in the united kingdom and show the analogy between the nonlinear power law storage function and the horton izzard equation they also postulated that such nonlinear storages commonly occur in many physical elements in the rainfall runoff processes and that it is reasonable to extend the nonlinear storage model to a wide range of input storage output system such as a soil column aquifer storage or surface storage at catchment scale various modeling efforts reported in the literature using the horton izzard equation may be replicated with eq 5 following simple mathematical manipulations for example moore and bell 2001 used an inverse definition of q k s m to describe specific discharge on a sloping plane following dooge 1973 and ponce et al 1997 they also discussed how horton introduced the index of turbulence 3 3 m 4 3 2 3 b 4 1 b which ranges from 0 to 1 by combining the power law storage function with the manning s equation of sheet flow under the wide channel assumption an index of turbulence of 0 results from m 3 b 2 3 and corresponds to laminar flow whereas an index of 1 results from m 5 3 b 2 5 and indicates turbulent flow the analytical solution for the horton izzard model exists only for rational values of m and closed form solutions existed only for specific values of m gill 1977 1976 jolley and wheater 1997 moore et al 2005 moore and bell 2002 2001 for this reason researchers and practitioners have frequently been forced to approximate m and optimize k for instance the thames catchment model young 1997 uses the analytical solution to the quadratic storage model ε 1 2 the pdm model young 1997 uses an approximate recursive solution based on a piecewise linear difference equation to solve the cubic storage function ε 2 3 meert et al 2016 also used a piecewise linearization approach the general solution removes such approximations and complications the subsections below provide the exact solutions for eq 5 and by extension the horton izzard nonlinear storage equation 2 1 outflow smaller than non zero inflow introducing q q i and using separation of variables we may rewrite eq 5 as follows for a sufficiently short time interval over which the inflow i may be assumed constant 6 dq q b 1 q a i b d t to integrate the left hand side lhs of eq 6 we note that the denominator therein is the integrand of the incomplete beta function ibf dutka 1981 7 β x u w 0 x ϕ u 1 1 ϕ w 1 d ϕ 0 x 1 where u and v are either positive real numbers or negative integers al sirehy and fisher 2013 assigning u 1 b and w 0 in eq 7 substituting q i for q in the lhs of eq 6 and prescribing q t 0 q 0 as the initial condition ic of eq 5 we obtain the following exact implicit solution for q 8 β q i 1 b 0 β q 0 i 1 b 0 a i b t t 0 q 0 i with b 1 ε the above solution may be expressed in terms of the exponent ε in the storage discharge relation note that the real world domain of ε 0 matches the mathematical domain of b 1 as required by the ibf eq 8 may be used to obtain the outflow q due to an arbitrary inflow hydrograph i discretized into a series of constant pulses i t i solving for q in eq 8 amounts to nonlinear root finding for which one may use a combination of look up tables for evaluation of the ibfs and iterative numerical algorithms al sirehy and fisher 2013 once the calculation for a pulse of inflow is complete one may continue to the next pulse i t i 1 with q 0 and t 0 in eq 8 reinitialized because β x u w is real valued for 0 x 1 only eq 8 is applicable only if q 0 i t i if the outflow exceeds the constant inflow it is necessary to use a second solution which is described below 2 2 outflow larger than non zero inflow when the initial value of outflow q 0 is larger than the constant inflow i a change of variable of q i q may be used to rewrite eq 5 in terms of q as follows 9 d q q 1 b 1 q a i b d t assigning u b and w 0 in eq 7 substituting i q for q in the lhs of eq 9 and prescribing q t 0 q 0 as the ic one arrives at the following exact implicit solution for q i 10 β i q b 0 β i q 0 b 0 a i b t t 0 q i 2 3 zero inflow when there is no inflow i e i 0 the analytic solutions above are no longer applicable instead one may simplify eq 5 to 11 dq dt a q b 1 eq 11 may be integrated via separation of variables to yield the following exact solution for q which represents the recession curve for nonlinear reservoir with a general power law storage function 12 q t 1 q 0 b a b t t 0 1 b once q is determined the associated storage may also be evaluated by integrating eq 4 13 s q s 0 q 1 b q 0 1 b a 1 b where s 0 denotes the initial storage eq 13 is useful for checking for the full capacity condition when there exists an upper bound to the physical storage space 2 4 special case of integer b values for integer values of the exponent b simpler solutions exist via the extension of the conventional ibf özçaḡ et al 2008 14 β x η 0 ln 1 x i 1 n 1 x i i 15 β x η 0 l n x 1 x i 1 n x i i where η 1 2 when b is an integer eqs 14 and 15 may be used to replace the lhs of eqs 8 and 10 the right hand side of eqs 14 and 15 are a generalization of the previously known analytical solutions of moore and bell 2002 a commonly encountered but particularly interesting case is when b 1 as in reservoirs with linear storage elevation relationships and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet using eq 15 one may show that the nonlinear routing with power law storage function has a compact explicit analytical solution expressed in terms of the lambert w function w corless et al 1996 16 q t i 1 w q 0 i e q 0 a t t 0 i i i known also as the lambert euler omega function pudasaini 2011 the lambert w function appears in the solution of many real world problems corless et al 1996 p et al 2000 scott et al 2006 it is worth noting that the lambert w function has also been used in the similarity solution of the richards equation explicit expressions for green ampt infiltration rate barry et al 1993 li et al 2015 parlange et al 2002 to name a few exact solutions for debris and avalanche flows pudasaini 2011 and shallow flow in sloping unconfined aquifers barnes 2018 3 storage function parameters to use the above solution it is necessary to specify the parameters a and b except when simple geometries are involved the best approach in most practical applications is to calibrate them using observed inflow and outflow see wittenberg 1994 for those cases with known simple geometries or where calibration is not possible theoretical expressions may be used this section presents the theoretical parameters for widely used reservoir and channel routing applications 3 1 for reservoir routing the storage elevation relationship is assumed to follow the power law function below 17 s s b σ h τ h 0 where s b m3 denotes the reservoir volume below the outlet h m denotes the elevation above the outlet and σ and τ denote the power law parameters approximating the volume of the reservoir above the outlet in the following s b is assumed zero for the sake of simplicity the width of the reservoir above the outlet structure b m is also assumed to follow a power law function 18 b ω 0 h ω 1 ω 0 0 a n d ω 1 0 the reservoir s cross sectional area a y m2 may be obtained by integrating b over h 19 a y ω 0 1 ω 1 h 1 ω 1 h 0 the storage elevation relationship of eq 17 may now be written as 20 s a y l x l x ω 0 1 ω 1 h 1 ω 1 h 0 where l x m denotes the longitudinal dimension of the reservoir to describe the outflow as a function of flow depth a power law rating curve is used 21 q r 0 h r 1 h 0 if the reservoir has an overflow spillway its outflow follows the weir equation chanson 2004 with r 0 2 3 c d l s 2 g and r 1 1 5 where c d denotes the coefficient of discharge l s m denotes the length of spillway perpendicular to direction of flow and g denotes the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 if the reservoir has an orifice spillway its outflow follows the orifice equation chanson 2004 with r 0 c d a 0 2 g and r 1 0 5 where a 0 m2 denotes the area of the orifice substituting eq 21 in eq 4 differentiating the lhs with respect to q and equating with the rhs one has for the storage function parameters a and b 22 a r 1 r 0 ω 1 1 r 1 l x ω 0 and b 1 ω 1 1 r 1 notice that the combination of ω 1 0 i e linear storage elevation relationship and r 1 0 5 e g orifices or submerged openings in sluice gates results in b 1 for which the nonlinear routing problem with power law function admits the explicit solution of eq 16 in terms of the lambert w function 3 2 for channel routing the horton izzard equation has been widely used to model overland flows moore and bell 2001 if the simplifying assumption of level pool routing is justified see e g fread and hsu 1993 for criteria the power law storage function may be derived for channel routing using the hydraulic properties of channels as described below the flow resistance equation for wide channels combines the geometric properties of the channel cross section and flow properties menabde and sivapalan 2001 yen 2002 23 v c 0 y c 1 s 0 c 2 where v m s denotes the mean velocity y m denotes the depth and s 0 m m denotes the slope in the above c 0 c 1 and c 2 are the flow resistance equation coefficients given by c 0 1 n c 1 2 3 and c 2 1 2 for the manning s equation c 0 c c 1 1 2 and c 2 1 2 for the chezy equation and c 0 8 g f c 1 1 2 and c 2 1 2 for the darcy weisbach equation where n s m1 3 c m1 2 s and f dimensionless denote the respective roughness coefficient the cross sectional area of the channel a m2 is approximated by a power law function 24 a a 0 y a 1 where a 0 and a 1 are the parameters of the power law cross section for example for a rectangular channel a 0 is the width of the channel and a 1 is unity the discharge is given by the continuity equation 25 q a v a 0 c 0 y a 1 c 1 s 0 c 2 solving eq 25 for the depth y gives 26 y q a 0 c 0 s 0 c 2 1 a 1 c 1 assuming that the change in depth over the channel is not very large and the unsteadiness of flood wave has a wavelength larger than the channel length l m the storage s m3 in the channel is given by mccuen 2004 27 s a l a 0 l y a 1 substituting eq 26 in eq 27 and rearranging one has for s 28 s l c 0 a 1 a 1 c 1 a 0 c 1 a 1 c 1 s 0 a 1 c 2 a 1 c 1 q a 1 a 1 c 1 using eq 28 one may write the parameters a and b in eq 4 as 29 a a 1 c 1 a 1 l c 0 a 1 a 1 c 1 a 0 c 1 a 1 c 1 s 0 a 1 c 2 a 1 c 1 b c 1 a 1 c 1 in the above development the parameters a and b are determined by the flow resistance equation of choice in practice they may be prescribed empirically based on actual observations for hillslope flow there may not exist the necessary physiographic information to prescribe the parameters in such cases one may use the fractal relationships if self similarity holds for the hillslope networks menabde and sivapalan 2001 4 approximate explicit solutions the exact solution eq 8 is in an implicit form for practical applications an explicit solution which requires inversion of the ibf is highly desirable to the best of authors knowledge a compact explicit approximation does not exist for the inverse of the ibf in this section we offer symbolic approximations instead the above inverse problem is equivalent to finding the function y ψ x b such that 30 β y 1 b 0 x the nonlinear routing problem is thus transformed into evaluating the ψ function in the following expression 31 q t i ψ β q 0 i 1 b 0 a i b t t 0 b below we approximate ψ to solve nonlinear routing with power law storage explicitly 4 1 compact expression for rising limb to the best of our knowledge approximations of the inverse of the ibf have not been reported in the literature in this work we use the following approximate inverse function developed via symbolic regression analysis when the initial outflow is smaller than the inflow i e 0 x q t i 1 we may approximate ψ r x b with 32 ψ r x b erf 1 p 0 p 1 x p 2 0 x q t i 1 where erf denotes the error function and p o p 1 and p 2 denote the coefficients to be prescribed for 4 b 0 01 eq 32 may be evaluated with a maximum error of 0 004 using the following symbolic solutions for p 0 to p 2 33 p 0 0 00330406 b 3 0 0385704 b 2 0 246985 b 0 261149 34 p 1 0 00363074 b 6 0

error of 0 007 when p 0 to p 2 are given by 36 p 0 0 101487 b 2 0 251458 b 0 264601 37 p 1 exp 38 27 b 4 35 5156 b 3 14 4538 b 2 0 665017 b 0 313546 38 p 2 exp 1 60103 b 3 0 372287 b 2 1 15131 b 0 0738377 because the level pool assumption puts the peak outflow on the inflow hydrograph eq 32 may be used to approximate the peak outflow due to a constant inflow i d m3 s with duration t d s for example if the reservoir is initially empty the peak outflow of q p m3 s satisfies 39 q p i d erf 1 p 0 p 1 a i d b t d p 2 the peak storage s p m3 may be approximated using eq 13 as 40 s p s 0 erf 1 p 0 p 1 a i d b t d p 2 i d 1 b q 0 1 b a 1 b 4 2 series expansions for rising and falling limbs following dominici 2005 an approximate expression for the inverse of the ibf may be obtained by a series expansion in the neighborhood of valid x 0 this approach utilizes the nested derivative operator defined as 41 d z f x d dx f x d z 1 f x with d 0 f x 1 accordingly the inverse function values for the rising and falling portions of the solution ψ r and ψ f respectively are given by 42 ψ r x b x 0 f r x 0 z 1 d z 1 f r x 0 x β x 0 1 b 0 z z f r x 0 1 x 0 x 0 b 43 ψ f x b x 0 f p x 0 z 1 d z 1 f p x 0 x β x 0 b 0 z z f p x 0 1 x 0 x 0 1 b care should be taken in choosing x 0 to ensure f r and f p have non zero real values at that point a faster but less accurate method is to choose a fixed x 0 throughout the entire simulation a generally more accurate approach is to update x 0 at each time step with the latest known value from the previous time step another important factor in applying eqs 42 and 43 is the number of terms summed in the partial series fig 1 shows the difference between the exact and approximated values of the inverse of the ibf for ψ r x b with x 0 0 75 the figure indicates that even a small number of terms in the series sum yields accurate results if the time increments are chosen for x to remain relatively close to x 0 5 applications this section presents four simple applications of the above solutions to different types of routing problems the first and second show the ability of the proposed solution in simulating laboratory observed flows in reservoir and channel respectively the third uses the proposed solution for real world river flood routing and compares with the observed flow and the s v solution the last application uses the approximate explicit solution for detention pond design 5 1 reservoir routing with orifice spillway the laboratory data from kilduff 2002 are used to validate the proposed solution in this application a constant inflow of 12 3 ml s is applied to a cylindrical reservoir with a base area of 71 cm2 the inflow is kept constant for a duration of 300 s and then shut off completely the water surface elevation is observed above a 0 4 cm orifice with h q 2 19 131 where h denotes the elevation above the outlet in cm and q denotes the discharge in cm 3 s using eqs 21 and 22 one has a 0 13473 c m 3 s 2 and b 1 solving eq 8 for h with a time step of 5 s we have the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 993 with the observed water surface elevation see fig 2 in the figure there exists an outlying observed water level given that this case study is a simple laboratory experiment with well known behavior the outlier is likely to be an observational error since b 1 eq 16 is applicable in this example and the routed hydrograph can be obtained implicitly in terms of the lambert w function as q t 12 3 w 0 36788 e 0 01095 t 1 for t 300 after the inflow is shut off eq 12 gives q t 52 54739 0 13473 t for 300 t 390 note that in this application the explicit analytical solution of eq 16 results in peak water level of 74 86 cm which is very close to the observed value of 75 03 cm for comparison the compact approximate solution of eq 32 yields a peak water level of 76 32 cm 5 2 level pool channel routing with significant floodplain storage de martino et al 2012 assessed the assumption of level pool routing in an experimental channel they confirmed via extensive experimental investigations that the level pool assumption may be reliably applied for floodplain storage and concluded that vegetation and channel bottom irregularities are larger sources of uncertainties in flood modeling than the level pool assumption they also deduce that simple storage based methods such as the ones presented in this paper are preferred for preliminary sizing of floodplain storages in flat areas in the following we validate the proposed solutions using the data from the out of bank portion of one of their experiments where the power low equations hold true in this test the flow is out of bank during the period of 52 to 350 s with the floodplain storage area of a 29 12 m 2 the storage elevation relationship is linear with s 29 12 h the outlet is a sluice gate with a 0 05 m opening using eqs 18 through 22 one arrives at a 6 98 10 5 m 3 s 2 and b 1 based on these values the explicit solution of eq 16 is used with a time step of 10 s to predict the observed flows with r 2 0 951 as shown in fig 3 note that from 52 to 212 s the inflow is effectively constant for which the average value is 0 066 m3 s given the initial outflow of 0 035 m3 s the lambert w function based explicit solution of eq 16 is able to predict the peak observed outflow of 0 043 m3 s with only one calculation step 5 3 channel routing in this example a flash flooding event in a natural waterway was chosen from akbari and barati 2012 the channel has width of 10 m slope of 0 0012 length of 25 km and manning s roughness of 0 035 s m1 3 for this event the observed inflow and outflow hydrographs are available as well as the s v solution which is used here for additional comparison fig 4 shows that the proposed solution with calibrated parameters of a 4 25 10 4 m 0 5982 s 0 8006 and b 0 1994 and a time step of 1 min is able to simulate the observed flows extremely closely r 2 0 997 overall the nonlinear storage routing compares well with the s v solution not surprisingly however the shape of the hydrograph and the peak flow are less accurate than the s v solution due to the level pool assumption which forces the peak outflow on the inflow hydrograph 5 4 detention pond design in this application the approximate explicit solution of eq 39 is used to design a detention pond the pond has a 10 m by 5 m rectangular base it is desired to size an orifice outlet to reduce peak outflow for a 0 25 m3 s inflow the approximate solution of eq 39 may be used to estimate the reduction in peak outflow the peak storage curves see fig 5 obtained from eq 40 may be used to verify that the maximum available physical storage is not exceeded alternatively given the dimensions of the pond and the orifice outlet one may approximate the combined effect of changes in the magnitude and duration of inflow on the peak outflow fig 6 shows the results with a 0 5 m diameter outflow orifice 6 discussion the main purpose of this study is to provide new analytical solutions for level pool routing with general power law storage discharge relationship and to advance the theory of nonlinear hydrologic routing a number of examples are presented to demonstrate the utility of the analytical solutions in a wide range of practical applications if accuracy is of primary concern the analytical solutions of eqs 8 10 and 16 should be favored over numerical solutions the choice of the routing method however depends on many other factors such as the validity of the underlying assumptions nonlinearity of flow availability of both real time and historical data parsimony desired ease of implementation and computational requirements and resources available the relative importance of these factors is very often application specific and hence the choice of the solution approach may vary significantly below we elaborate on the assumptions and limitations for the proposed solutions and offer computational considerations for implementation to aid such decision making for comparisons among different numerical flood routing methods the reader is referred to strelkoff 1980 ponce et al 1997 and ponce 2014 power law storage function is a fundamental assumption for the presented solutions as described in section 3 these parameters represent the geometry and hydraulics in the storage discharge relationship in applying the solutions presented in this work it is important that the power law definitions are consistent with the formulations in section 3 as alternative formulations are also possible note also that the solution presented is limited to the elevations above spillway i e the surcharge storage viessman and lewis 2008 power law storage function is generally not consistent with multiple types of outlet structures but may still provide acceptable approximation if the power law storage discharge relationship is not sufficiently well modeled by a single set of coefficients it may be necessary to employ multiple sets of the parameter estimates for local approximation such approaches are routinely practiced in operational river routing in the form of layered coefficient routing fread 1985 nws 2021b as such the power law assumption is not as large a limiting factor as it may first appear as is often the case in practice one may improve the accuracy by calibrating the two coefficients or adjusting the a priori estimates obtained from the geometric and hydraulic considerations based on observed hydrographs when and where available it is also noted here that the ibf solution offers a potentially significant advantage in gradient based parameter optimization over other numerical routing techniques because the derivatives can be evaluated very accurately the proposed solutions assume a level pool reservoir it is widely accepted that level pool routing is more appropriate for smaller reservoirs with rounder shape where backwater effects are not significant chow et al 1988 ionescu and nistoran 2019 level pool routing is also widely used for channel routing for which a reach is subdivided into a series of level pools with prescribed storage discharge relationships usace 2021 the degree of attenuation in the routed flood wave may vary depending on the number of sub reaches chosen which is often treated as a calibration parameter bonner 1990 usace 1994 level pool routing and hence the proposed solutions are not recommended for streams with gradients less than 0 0004 to 0006 reaches with time varying boundary conditions such as tides or rapidly rising flood hydrographs bonner 1990 usace 1994 the assumption of constant inflow is of little practical significance because the observed and simulated inflow hydrographs are already discretized according to the sampling interval of the instrument and the time step of the simulation respectively if the hydrograph is over sampled such that the discharge varies very little over a short time period one may coarsen the discretization to reduce the number of ibf evaluations in such a case the level of discretization should be chosen such that the sampling frequency captures the variations and peakedness in the inflow hydrograph the analytical solution requires evaluation of the ibf if the ibf is not available as a built in or intrinsic function in the user s computing environment one may use external mathematical libraries see for example http www meta numerics net and https www boost org the main computing requirement for the analytical solution comes from solving for q in the implicit expressions of eqs 8 and 10 the above nonlinear root finding problem may be solved using a number of readily available techniques faires and burden 2012 a potential difficulty in the above solution is slow convergence near the poles of the ibf but may be avoided by using derivative free techniques for example with the bisection method faires and burden 2012 a conservative estimate for the number of iterations required to determine q is l o g 2 i q 0 tol 1 where tol is the desired tolerance faires and burden 2012 though there may exist more efficient methods the bisection method is very attractive for the ibf a strictly monotonically increasing function owing to its simplicity and the availability of the a priori estimate for convergence because the proposed solution is analytical one does not have to be concerned about numerical errors or diffusion and may hence expect to obtain extremely accurate solutions to illustrate below we offer a comparison of the proposed solution with a number of numerical integration schemes for an inflow hydrograph shown as a series of pulses in fig 7 the example hydrograph is based on fenton 2010 in which a small reservoir with square base of 100 m by 100 m and a weir outlet with a width of 4 m is subjected to an inflow hydrograph of the following general form 44 i t i 0 i p i 0 t t p e 1 t t p 5 where i 0 is the initial inflow of 1 m3 s i p is the peak inflow of 20 m3 s and t p is the time to peak of 30 min it follows from section 3 1 that a is 0 000554 m3s 2 and b is 0 31927 the above hydrograph is resampled at an interval of 300 s to emulate a discrete observed hydrograph in the real world an accurate method of lines numerical solution with high resolution adaptive mesh hamdi et al 2007 wolfram 2021 is used to obtain the reference true outflow hydrograph see fig 7 we then used the different solution methods shown in table 1 to route the inflow hydrograph at time steps of 10 30 and 60 s the small time steps were chosen to ensure that the variations in the inflow hydrograph are captured for all solution techniques considered fig 7 shows the results for the analytical solution with δ t 60 s vs the reference truth as expected they are indistinguishably close table 1 shows the maximum errors in percent in the proposed and numerical solutions for the duration of the hydrograph because all three time steps are smaller than the sampling interval of the inflow hydrograph i e 300 s the analytical solution results are effectively the same for all time steps the maximum errors in the numerical solutions on the other hand show significant sensitivity to the time step and vary significantly among themselves it is seen that the higher order solutions tend to be more accurate among the numerical solutions and that the proposed solution is far more accurate than any of the numerical solutions even at the smallest time step of 10 s 7 conclusions and future research recommendations an exact implicit solution for nonlinear reservoir routing with a general power law storage function is presented expressed in terms of the incomplete beta function ibf the solution is valid for inflow hydrographs that may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths the solution thus extends the existing analytical solutions reported in the literature which are valid only for specific exponents in the power law storage function for reservoirs with linear storage elevation relationship and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet an explicit compact solution expressed in terms of the lambert w function is presented to facilitate the application of the new solution to reservoir and channel routing the two power law storage function parameters are expressed in terms of the geometry of the reservoir rating curve and flow resistance the exact solution applies only for constant inflow and is in an implicit form for the general case for practical applications several highly accurate approximate explicit solutions are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and utility of the new solutions four simple applications are presented for reservoir routing channel routing and detention pond design being exact the new solution is not subject to numerical errors or instabilities it is therefore particularly useful in nonlinear routing applications when accuracy is of particular importance the solution may also be useful in network or system optimization as well as design analysis that requires derivatives funding this work was supported by the national

4502,dam removal has been widely used as a river restoration approach however the effectiveness of removing low head dams in tributaries for fish habitat compensation in a dammed river is still poorly understood one major impediment to examining the ecological effectiveness of low head dams is the short length of post dam hydrologic geomorphic and ecological observations to circumvent this challenge we used a one dimensional hydro morphodynamic model to simulate the changes in hydrodynamic features and riverbed elevation the modeled outputs were then incorporated into a fish habitat model to assess the changes of habitat suitability after dam removal one open question in dam removal is the effect that extreme hydrological events have on the trajectory of the post removal hydraulic geomorphic and habitat change here we studied the changes of habitat suitability to a fish species jinshaia sinensis j sinensis in a tributary where a low head dam was recently removed of the jinsha river in china three scenarios of interannual hydrological variations based on observed flow records were simulated the post removal simulations showed that the flow sequence influenced the erosion and deposition rate of sediments but had little effect on net changes in bed elevation after dam removal upstream incision eroded the deposition sediments and reconnected the riverbed at the dam location within the first post removal year stream hydraulics became more diverse with an increasing of riffles following the morphological response to the dam removal the continuous changes in stream hydraulics improved the habitat suitability for j sinensis as the percentage of suitable spawning habitat increased from 17 to approximately 68 before and 10 years after dam removal the study demonstrated that removing a low head dam can not only reconnect the passage for a migratory fish to migrate upstream tributaries for spawning but also improve habitat suitability due to the morphological and stream hydrological responses following dam removal keywords tributary fish habitat compensation dam removal river morphology eco morphodynamic model 1 introduction river impoundment disrupts the longitudinal connectivity of flow and often causes the changes in natural hydrological dynamics barbarossa et al 2020 mcmanamay et al 2012 which blocks migratory routes and alters the pristine flow regimes that have provided habitat for fish reproduction both habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats that can ultimately result in the extinction of fish species nunes et al 2015 reynalte tataje et al 2013 in recent decades some attempts have been made to mitigate these impacts including artificial breeding and release ecological reservoir operation and the construction of structures that facilitate fish passage chen et al 2013 2018 li et al 2015 however all these measures so far have shown some limitations and have failed to fully serve their expected conservation goals due to the highly diverse behavior and ecological properties of native fish li et al 2020 shi et al 2015 in this sense maintaining some near natural free flowing reaches would benefit the heterogeneous habitats needed for fish spawning and early development thus this is considered to be essential for the conservation of fish species which are impacted by damming lopes et al 2019 fish population recruitment is highly dependent on the availability and quality of spawning habitat melcher and schmutz 2010 the spawning migrations of most migratory fish are seasonal phenomena during the reproductive periods some species will travel long distance towards the upstream reaches or their tributaries in search of suitable habitats for spawning zhang et al 2018a therefore tributaries that flow directly into reservoirs can partly compensate the habitat loss in impounded mainstream which positively impacts the fish population recruitment boavida et al 2018 makrakis et al 2012 marques et al 2018 the elements of natural flow fluctuations and the availability of food resources and shelter areas could be maintained in theses tributaries moreover diverse hydraulic conditions occur in the upper middle and lower tributary reaches giving the migratory or rheophilic fish species more chances to colonize new habitats garcia et al 2019 if fish species have to move in the direction of headwater streams the avoidance of barriers that prevent them from accessing their ideal habitats becomes necessary however low head dams 10 m in height or small hydropower projects which are widely distributed in tributary reaches decrease the river connectivity and limit fish movement 45 000 weirs and low head dams have been built in china approximately 15 of them are being abandoned or degraded ding et al 2019 as these structures are gradually taken out of service or become functionally deficient dam removal has now become an increasingly common way to restore the integrity of river systems foley et al 2017 o connor et al 2015 this highlights the need to better understand the potential role of low head dam removals in habitat compensation and restoration efforts dam removals affect fluvial morphology significantly with uncontrolled sediment releases which is of crucial importance for determining post dam flow patterns as well as the availability of fish habitats doyle et al 2003 magilligan et al 2016 tomsic et al 2007 most of the 1300 known removed dams in the world about 94 are small standing 10 m high and impounding 10 000 m3 of sediments major et al 2017 despite the limited dam height and reservoir size the physical effects i e geomorphic response sediment regime and flow patterns of removing these small dams are substantial in both the reservoir and downstream region the transportation of sediments from the former reservoir can result in a steep channel slope and a supercritical flow condition in the river reach near the dam location ding and langendoen 2018 on the other hand the downstream reach of a removed dam will experience excessive deposition which may fill pools and form channel bars poeppl et al 2019 ritchie et al 2018 the development of channel morphology after dam removal directly affects the quality of fish habitat due to changes of river hydraulics stanley and doyle 2003 for instance a new spawning site of chinook salmon formed in the white salmon river washington usa after the breaching of the condit dam because of increasing flow velocity hatten et al 2016 some migratory fish were found to move into the newly formed riffles reach following a two meter high dam removal in lower manatawny creek southeastern pennsylvania usa hart et al 2002 the rate and timing of geomorphic responses after dam removal vary considerably depending on the water regime and sediment characteristics cui et al 2014 grant and lewis 2015 after dam removal large amounts of deposited reservoir sediments will be washed off swiftly at the beginning but the erosion of the reservoir sediments may continue for a long time months to years perhaps decades before the establishment of an equilibrium state in the riverbed major et al 2017 pizzuto 2002 in gravel rich rivers high flows may be needed to erode coarse sediment especially after the channel has incised through the impounded reservoir sediments hence the effects on fish habitat may continue over a longer period until the channel reaches a new equilibrium however most studies on ecological effects of dam removal were relatively short in time duration i e less than four years post dam removal table s1 in particular knowledge of the effects of removing a tributary dam for habitat compensation to produce habitat for native fish residing in a heavily dammed mainstream section is largely lacking foley et al 2017 in addition a modelling approach can comprehensively assess the physical response following dam removal ding and langendoen 2018 poeppl et al 2019 but little study available uses it to predict the impacts of post removal flow sequence variability on geomorphic and ecological outcomes the objectives of this study were to 1 predict the long term morphological changes after the removal of low head dams under various hydrologic scenarios 2 quantify the effectiveness of post removal fluvial process in terms of the tributary habitat compensation for mainstream native fish we studied the removal of a 7 m high run of river dam named laomuhe dam lmd on the heishui river hsr a major tributary of the lower jinsha river jsr the jsr consists of the upper reach of the yangtze river with a total length of 3481 km the river reach has a rich diversity of freshwater fish with as many as 177 endemic fish species zhang et al 2018a yet the jsr basin also has great potential as a source of hydropower four cascade hydropower stations wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba have been built in the mainstream of lower jsr fig 1 these hydropower stations have a total installed capacity of 42 100 mw with an annual power generation of 184 3 billion kwh wu et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and target fish hsr is about 170 km long and has an annual average discharge of 80 m3 s which is based on the recent 20 year discharge record from the ningnan hydrological station fig 1 the annual maximum daily flow at hsr were fit to a pearson iii distribution which is the commonly used distribution in china fig s1 gao et al 2017 the river originates from maguo mountain and flows into jsr at hulukou town located at 30 km upstream from the baihetan dam bhtd hsr has four small dams in cascade namely sujiawan dam sjd gongdefang dam gdd songxin dam sxd and lmd fig 1 these four dams were all built as run of river structures which have no regulating reservoirs according to the sediment monitoring data after dam constructions there was no obvious difference in suspended sediment concentration at the four dam sites table s2 the concrete rock filled lmd was constructed in 1988 this low head dam was 7 m high and 56 m wide forming a 2 km long reservoir at the upstream of dam site hsr can function as an alternative habitat for rheophilic and migratory species that currently inhabit the mainstream of bhtd reservoir after the impoundment of bhtd 20 km of the lower hsr will be submerged a previously lotic reach will transform into lentic one which may modify the flow conditions necessary for reproduction of many native fish in order to increase the availability of lotic reaches for fish species the three gorges corporation removed the lmd in december 2018 the study reach i e computational domain is 18 km long extending from 3 0 km upstream the dam site to the tributary mouth after impoundment of bhtd the regional geomorphic characteristics varied considerably along the river s longitudinal profile we thus have delineated five sub reaches within the upstream and downstream reach based on their distinct combinations of variability in channel width slope and substrate size table 1 jinshaia sinensis j sinensis was selected as the target fish for investigation as it is a typical migratory and endemic fish in the lower jsr and some of the tributaries including hsr the j sinensis spawning grounds were mainly distributed in the lower jsr between wudongde dam and xiangjiaba dam wang et al 2017 many years of field sampling identified that the most upstream range of spawning habitat extends to the river reach near wudongde dam which is about 180 km upstream of bhtd zhang et al 2018b spawning season of this species usually start at the end of may when the discharge of the river begins to increase they always migrate from lower to upper reach and prefer a suitable flow environment for spawning their spawning actions always take place at the river reaches where flow velocity is mainly from 0 6 to 2 5 m s and water depth is from 0 9 to 2 4 m liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b however impoundments of xiluodu and xiangjiaba dam fig 1 have blocked the migration routes and endangered the j sinensis species below the bhtd most of adult fish and recruitments are now inhabiting in river reaches between hsr tributary and the bhtd these fish populations will move upstream on both mainstream and its tributaries in search of suitable spawning habitats during their annual reproductive period tang et al 2014 however the impoundment of bhtd will transform the previously lotic reaches above the dam into lentic ones which can lead to spawning habitat loss for j sinensis in hsr the spawning individuals of j sinensis species can be detected in the river reach downstream of sjd the seasonal variability in discharge of hsr may also support the population of other fish species by providing a variety of habitats for their reproduction and early developments yang et al 2017 2 2 field surveys the stream survey was conducted on may 2018 prior to the dam removal and was repeated at six months after dam removal fig s2 channel topography was measured at the cross section using a real time kinetic rtk gps v60 hi target navigation tech co ltd china measuring intervals between cross sections varied from 72 m to 765 m with smaller intervals near the dam site fig s3 we also measured the hydrodynamic characteristics including water levels and flow velocities within the study reach pebble counts wolman 1954 was conducted to determine the streambed substrate compositions we sampled 100 streambed sediment particles randomly along the cross section and measured the intermediate axis width of each sample the cumulative frequency of sediment particles of different sizes and the median substrate size d 50 were determined for each cross section fish surveys were performed in hsr from 2017 to 2019 we used an electrofishing backpack to collect fish samples during the spawning seasons the collected fish were measured length and weight and identified by species before being released back to the stream fig s4 the pace of sampling was standardized for a total time of 60 min per sampling site within the study area we sampled one site upstream of the dam and three sites downstream of the dam in order to increase the sample size we also sampled six sites within the hsr but outside the study reach fig s5 the flow velocity water depth and median substrate size were also measured at specific locations where the spawning individuals of j sinensis were captured 2 3 development of eco morphodynamic model the governing equations of the one dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic model for open channel flow are the st venant equations 1 q x a t q 2 q t β x α q 2 a g a h x g q q c 2 a r 0 where x denotes the spatial axes m t is temporal axes s a is flow area m2 q is the discharge m3 s q is the lateral discharge per unit channel length m2 s α is the momentum distribution coefficient g represents the gravitational acceleration m s2 h is the water surface elevation m c is the chezy resistance coefficient m1 2 s r is the hydraulic radius m to calculate the transition from subcritical flow to supercritical a modified factor β for suppression of convective momentum was introduced into the momentum equation eq 2 the calculation of β was given by 3 β 1 f r 2 0 for f r 1 for f r 1 where fr is the local froude number this approach ensures accuracy for supercritical flow conditions when the froude number is above one the implicit four point partial node finite difference scheme was used to discretize the governing equations in the computational domain yi et al 2017 flows movements above the dam structure were calculated based on the flow formula of broad crested weirs hou et al 2013 next the governing equation for the transport of non uniform sediments can be written as 4 a s k t q s k x b l s q t k q t k q lk where s k is the section averaged sediment concentration of size class k kg m3 b is the channel width in a cross section m l s is the non equilibrium adaptation length of sediment transport m and q lk is the lateral inflow or outflow sediment discharge kg ms the variables q t k and q t k represent the actual sediment transport rate per unit width and equilibrium transport rate for sediment class k kg ms respectively the value of q t k can be calculated from the semi empirical ackers white method meyer et al 2009 the riverbed deformation due to size class k was written as 5 1 ε z k t q t k x 0 where ε is the sediment porosity z k is the thickness of sediment deformation for class k m once the riverbed deformation for a single sediment class is known the total erosion or deposition in the riverbed and the composition of substrates are updated the volumes of sediment deposition and erosion between successive cross sections was estimated using the morphological approach shen et al 2006 which is shown as 6 δ v s i 1 2 a s i a s i 1 δ l i where δ v s i is the volume of sediment deposition or erosion between the cross section i and cross section i 1 m3 a s i is the change of cross section area for cross section i m2 δ l i is the distance between successive cross section i and i 1 m the sediment model communicated with the hydrodynamic model through a time stepping mechanism this pattern divided the unsteady flow into a stepwise steady flow process in each time step the sediment transport and riverbed elevation changes were computed assuming steady flow the hydraulic roughness and bed level were updated and fed back into the hydrodynamic model after each step of calculation fang et al 2008 habitat changes of j sinensis due to the hydro morphological development were investigated using the habitat suitability index hsi model li et al 2015 the spawning life stage was studied because it is a fundamental process to sustain stable populations considering the bottom living characteristics of j sinensis the flow velocity water depth and substrate were selected as the variables to qualify the suitability of the spawning habitat liu et al 2013 the hsi model combines the univariate suitability index as follows 7 hsi i w i v i s 1 3 in which i w i v and i s indicate the water depth suitability index flow velocity suitability index and substrate suitability index each of these variables were quantified using suitability curves ranging from 0 to 1 with 0 for the lowest suitability and 1 for the optimal suitability the relevant suitability curves from zhang et al 2018b are shown in fig 2 2 4 boundary conditions and model parameters in the hydrodynamic model the daily average discharge and water level were set as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively the recorded flow releases at sxd were used as upstream boundary conditions the water level at the downstream boundary was directly calculated using the bed slope and the daily water level data from the ningnan hydrological station fig 1 for sediment transport calculation the daily sediment concentrations were given at the upstream inlet node for all size fractions the transport rate of suspended sediment d 0 5 mm was obtained by the survey data downstream of sxd which is located about 11 5 km upstream of the lmd meanwhile the bedload d 0 5 mm yin et al 2015 transport rate was directly calculated by the equilibrium sediment transport capacity formula wu et al 2004 the riverbed was assumed to be non erodible at the outlet of the sediment model since here the riverbed was heavily covered with cobbles and boulders that are difficult to scour the results of the hydro morphodynamic model were then used as inputs for the fish habitat model initial manning s n roughness values were assigned to each cross section based on the median size of substrates and using guidelines set forth by zhao and he 2010 a 0 5 min time step was used for the hydrodynamic simulation the time step in sediment model was 300 min which was defined as 600 times the time step in the hydrodynamic simulation huang et al 2012 graded substrates were divided into six classes varying from 4 mm to 256 mm a non scouring surface was set up lower than the riverbed with a range of 1 5 m to 8 m upstream of dam site in the downstream reach the non scouring level was empirically set to 1 5 m lower than the bed level expect for the downstream outlet ma et al 2010 the numerical model included 35 cross sections spanning over the 18 km study reach a sensitivity analysis was firstly performed to evaluate the potential effect on flow calculations resulting from changes of manning s n the sensitivity was assessed in terms of the water level simulations at cs3 1 5 km upstream of dam site as expected simulation results were sensitive to changes in manning s n with water level increasing directly with manning s n as expected fig s6 2 5 model simulation scenarios the removal of lmd caused a short term abrupt increase in suspended sediment transportation according to the daily recorded data at the ningnan hydrological station the sediment concentration peaked the day after dam removal december 29 2018 it increased by 78 compared to the previous day and gradually returned to normal four days after dam removal fig s7 the long term scenarios were run to simulate the morphological response over a 10 year period after dam removal 10 year long sets of flow and sediment concentration data were applied to perform the simulation scenarios numerical simulations were run for three different hydrological scenarios to evaluate the impacts of various flow regimes on sediment transport following dam removal scenarios for dry to wet scenario 1 alternating dry and wet scenario 2 and wet to dry scenario 3 were developed to represent various flow sequences fig 3 the hydrologic scenarios were defined according to the historical streamflow time series from january 2010 to december 2019 a previous study has shown that wet periods have historically alternated with dry periods within the lower jsr basin the wet periods have generally lasted 1 5 years while the dry periods lasted 1 6 years zhang et al 2013 thus scenario 1 dry to wet had relatively low annual flow during the first six years average annual flow with exceedance probabilities 37 5 followed by four relatively wet years average annual flow with exceedance probabilities 37 5 scenario 2 actual flow sequence represented a hydrological time series with alternating dry and wet years 2019 was the first year of simulation period in scenario 2 and then 2010 2018 scenario 3 wet to dry had relatively high annual flow during the first four years and low annual flow in the following years water year series and hydrologic attributes for the three scenarios are shown in table s3 moreover the extremely wet seasons in 2020 xia and chen 2021 were not included in the simulation scenarios due to limitation of the monitoring data to assess the hydraulic impacts of dam removal for fish habitat we performed a steady flow simulation based on the annual bed elevation the hydraulic simulation was carried out with the median monthly flow for the primary period june of j sinensis spawning yang et al 2017 selecting the median monthly flow for simulation was based on an assumption that it could be sufficient to protect instream habitat in jsr basin liu et al 2014 the simulated eco hydraulic factors were used to evaluate the j sinensis habitat suitability based on bed substrates flow velocities and water depths 3 results 3 1 verification of the eco morphodynamic model the hydrodynamic model was calibrated for the period of may 1 to june 30 of the year 2018 the manning s n value and the computation time step were determined using the measured daily water levels it was assumed that the status of riverbed was at equilibrium during the calibration period cui et al 2014 the equilibrium assumption was reasonable for the hsr this is because the construction of the four low head dams were the only major disturbance to the river the riverbed was relatively stable after modification of sediment transport for several decades since the four dams were built the mean absolute errors mae was 0 13 m while the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was 0 93 these errors demonstrated that the hydrodynamic model was established well to simulate the river flows vozinaki et al 2017 fig s8 but the model had a largest mae 0 38 m at the highest flow q 177 m3 s occurring on may 28 2018 this was mainly because the surface rain runoff flowed into the river along the reach raising the water level however there were not any opportunities to calibrate the model to high flow events exceedance probability 50 due to the short period of records the model performance for high flow events could be verified through continuous field monitoring which remains as a future work of this study after calibration manning s n values ranged from 0 025 to 0 035 for cross sections with medium gravels 4 16 mm from 0 038 to 0 048 for cross sections with coarse gravels 16 64 mm from 0 05 to 0 06 for cross sections with cobbles 64 256 mm the calibration of the sediment transport and morphological models fig s9 was carried out by simulating the riverbed changes starting at the moment of dam removal the sediment simulation time step was calibrated the values of mae and nse for riverbed changes were 0 66 m and 0 98 indicating similarity between observations and simulations fig s10 however the model underestimated bed incision by approximately 40 at the cross sections immediately upstream of the dam site this should be the result of post removal dredging work that had been undertaken to prevent the demolished dam materials from moving downstream fig s11 the final calibrated parameters for the hydro morphodynamic model are presented in table s4 the modeled habitat suitability and the abundance of spawning fish were analyzed jointly there was a highly statistically significant and linear correlation between spawning fish abundance and hsi p 0 0001 implying that the hsi model was reliable for prediction fig 4 a in addition the froude number thresholds riffle fr 0 41 pool fr 0 18 with glides occupying the intermediate range between these two thresholds jowett 1993 indicated that the target species preferred to spawn in riffles but can also spawn in glides fig 4b 3 2 river morphological development following dam removal sequences of interannual flow variability can influence the erosion and deposition rate but will have little long term effect on total volume of eroded and deposited sediments providing that long term properties of flow series are similar fig s12 at the end of year 10 the spatial distributions of aggraded and degraded reaches show little difference among the different hydrological scenarios the difference between the magnitudes of degradation and aggradation under different scenarios were also slight fig 5 a aggraded river reaches accounted for approximately 55 of the study reach and degraded reaches accounted for 45 the aggraded reaches were primarily the wide downstream reach 3 2 7 9 km downstream from dam and some portions of the far downstream reach 12 0 15 0 km downstream from dam on the other hand net erosion occurred primarily in the dam reservoir reach with a maximum erosion of 7 8 m at the dam site fig 5b the simulation result for scenario 2 was used as an example to demonstrate the annual morphological response fig 6 rapid degradation occurred primarily in the dam reservoir reach following dam removal at the end of year 1 the river channel incised 0 9 m to 3 3 m in the 0 5 km long reach immediately upstream of the dam leaving a knickpoint an abrupt increase in slope at the bed surface the riverbed was reconnected at the end of year 1 because the bed slope at the dam site decreased to 0 39 which is close to the pre dammed condition li 1960 sediment aggradation predominated in the downstream reach riverbed aggradation was greatest in the near downstream reach but was observed to decrease along the flow path there were hardly any morphological changes in the wide downstream and far downstream reach at the end of year 1 during the subsequent years the magnitude of the channel erosion attenuated gradually in the dam reservoir reach with headcut scouring in the downstream the deposited sediments transported towards further downstream which resulted in a maximum aggradation of about 0 6 m to 1 1 m the riverbed appeared to become increasingly stable at the end of year 5 however dynamic geomorphic processes became evident again during year 7 when a 30 year flood occurred the substrate compositions in the hsr showed considerable longitudinal variations after dam removal fig 7 substrates became coarser in the upstream reach but were generally finer in the downstream reach during the first five post removal years the long term variations in bed substrates was independent of the annual maximum flow as high flow events generally caused more transient changes in the substrate size distribution fig s13 3 3 changes in hydraulics and their effects on habitat compensation a drastic difference in suitability of water depth velocity and substrates occurred as a result of channel development following dam removal fig 8 prior to dam removal the flow velocity provided low suitability iv 0 4 tomsic et al 2007 for spawning of j sinensis in dam reservoir reach while the water depth indicated fairly good suitability iw 0 8 fig 8a after dam removal the suitability of flow velocity and substrates increased in impoundment reaching a suitable range for spawning at the end of year 10 sediment deposition in downstream reach caused a general improvement of suitability in flow velocity and substrates after dam removal fig 8b c the habitat suitability for j sinensis was gradually improved with the change in river morphology and hydraulics fig 8d before dam removal approximately 42 of the river reach 7 5 km long was unsuitable for spawning hsi 0 4 and 17 of the river reach 3 0 km provided fairly suitable spawning habitats hsi 0 8 yi et al 2010 at the end of year 1 the percentage of the study river reach with suitable spawning habitat exceeded 45 8 1 km while the percentage with unsuitable habitat was reduced to 25 4 5 km in the last five years of the simulation the percentage of unsuitable river reach showed a further decrease from 13 2 4 km to 9 1 7 km while the percentage of suitable reach increased from 40 7 2 km to 68 12 2 km all river reaches with suitable spawning habitats were covered by glides and riffles moreover the ratio of riffles with suitable habitat increased from 16 to 90 the length of riffles has increased from 0 km before dam removal to 6 3 km at year 10 q 110 m3 s accounting for 35 of the total river length meanwhile glides and pools decreased 4 and 76 respectively fig 8e the substrates were in a good state in riffle and glide reaches where target species preferred to spawn over 78 of the riffles and glides provided suitable substrates for spawning before and after dam removal different flow sequences produced annual variability in habitat available following dam removal the scenario 3 wet to dry had the highest rate in expansion of suitable habitat for j sinensis during the years immediately following dam removal nonetheless the percentages of the study reach with unsuitable equaled 68 under all three scenarios fig 8f moreover the overall habitat suitability showed declines under scenarios 1 and 2 between year 2 and year 5 the reason was that the water depth suitability got a bit worse at this period fig s14 4 discussion a free flowing tributary can provide important alternative habitat for long distance migratory fish whose lotic mainstream habitat is converted to lentic habitat due to dams da silva et al 2019 annual and seasonal flow variations attract and support a diverse mix of rheophilic species which are endangered or threatened by river damming however habitat compensation in tributaries is restricted by low head dams and some small hydropower projects da silva et al 2015 we found that access to tributary habitats could be improved substantially after the removal of lmd with the mobilization of reservoir sediment the bed slope became close to the pre dam condition at the dam site fig 5 the restored river continuity enables migratory fish to normally utilize habitat upstream of the former dam site the 11 5 km long free flowing reach between sxd and lmd could provide additional habitat compensation for migratory species such as j sinensis which prefer lotic reaches for spawning yet this strategy may have limited success in restoring migration because sxd will still limit the range of the fish in addition impoundment of bhtd will submerge approximately 20 km of the lower hsr leading to a forty five percent reduction in the length of free flowing reach below sxd thus it is recommended to remove the upstream dams or build fishways to facilitate fish passage above them in next stage of this restoration effort in addition to improving the river connectivity and upstream access dam removal brought profound changes in stream channel morphology with the release of sediments from the formerly impounded area a knickpoint formed in the dam reservoir reach and began to migrate upstream before disappearing altogether substrate sediments became coarser in the dam reservoir reach due to its higher capacity for sediment transport the degraded reaches were restricted to the dam reservoir reach under the three scenarios meanwhile fine sediments were transported to the downstream reach and formed dunes as well as ripples which covered up the previously coarsened substrates and aggraded the riverbed whiting and king 2003 have concluded that in general increasing the finer particle supply is not likely to cause aggradation because river tend to have the capacity to transport materials of these sizes however the simulation results in this study showed a substantial aggradation in the downstream with the supply of fine sediments from the impounded area the reason was that the river reach could experience bed aggradation when large quantities of sediments were released yet this aggradation might be transient as the fine substrates would be transported further downstream in the future lane et al 2003 model results indicated that the reservoir sediments moved downstream in the first year after dam removal creating a substantial deposition with a maximum of about 3 4 m in the near downstream reach in subsequent years the depositions moved through the wide downstream reach with aggradation increasing at the end of wide downstream reach at the year 5 after the year 5 deposition thickness gradually decreased in the wide downstream reach as sediments were transported downstream fig 6 sediment aggradation primarily occurred in the wide downstream reach over the 10 year simulation period this was mainly because of the weakened transport capacity due to the lower gradient and widened cross sections table 1 the various flow sequences could influence the trajectories in annual changes of bed elevation fig s15 and s16 but it had little effect on the ultimate distribution of sediment erosion and deposition at the end of year 10 thus studies of dam removal aiming to characterize long term impacts should mainly focus more on the geomorphic and ecological responses for multi year time scale not for a relatively short period of time high flows will scour additional sediments regardless of prior riverbed conditions simulation results for scenario 2 showed that river morphology was gradually stabilized in entire river reach over time but an episodic change in riverbed composition took place in year 7 fig 6 studies on previous dam removal have indicated that erosion of non cohesive sediments from a de watered reservoir exhibit a two phase response collins et al 2017 in the first phase the transport of impoundment sediments is driven by increases in the energy gradient caused by higher water slope later after the river channel reaches a temporal equilibrium high flow events may be necessary to trigger additional sediment movements from the riverbed major et al 2017 pearson et al 2011 has defined the early phase as process driven and the later as event driven at year 7 of the simulation period erosion of sediment shifted from the process driven phase to the event driven phase due to the occurrence of a 30 year return period flood flow q 799 m3 s fig s1 the high magnitude flood scoured substantially coarser sediments which cannot be removed during relatively modest flows causing changes in bed elevation and particle size distributions significant increase of substrate size was observed at year 7 due to the higher transport capacity of the high flood flow fig 7 however the relatively modest flow at year 10 resulted in little decrease of substrate size it was because the gradually stable riverbed diminished the mobility of bed materials we found that following dam removal stream hydraulics become more diverse with the addition of many riffles before dam removal the river reach had high percentages of pools 43 and glides 57 and had no riffles in the first year after dam removal approximately 4 6 km riffles formed in the dam reservoir reach and near downstream reach the length of riffles increased by 37 by the end of the year 10 while glides and pools decreased 4 and 76 respectively fig 8e the large increase in riffles should be beneficial in providing suitable habitats to j sinensis as well as many other species inhabiting hsr that prefer lotic area for spawning overall the proportions of suitable spawning habitat increased from 17 to approximately 68 for the three flow scenarios during the 10 year simulation period under all three scenarios but the scenario 3 wet to dry had the highest rate in expansion of suitable habitat for j sinensis indicating that removing a dam prior to a wet period lasting multiple years can expedite habitat restoration notably there was no clear trend in habitat improvement within the lowest 5 km long reach the most likely reason was that the river morphology was not significantly reformed following dam removal in this river reach bed materials were composed mainly of cobbles with a median grain size of 77 83 mm prior to dam removal these relatively coarse grains protected the riverbed from excessive erosion in addition the wide downstream reach has the lowest sediment transport capacity due to its greater width and low gradient table 1 downstream depositions were restricted and negligible aggradation would occur further downstream fig 5 therefore other restoration measures e g placement of submerged weirs artificial ripraps were suggested to enrich morphological diversity which remains a future topic of study although our study focused on the lower jsr in western china these results are relevant for other gravel bed river systems throughout the world moreover the hydraulic and habitat model were run only using the june median flow not taking into account the interannual variability of flows during spawning seasons such as the median june flow in the driest and wettest year or even the extremely low and high flows during spawning period thus in order to estimate the overall habitat quality more comprehensively a few other representative flow scenarios should be considered during the follow up research the one dimensional numerical model we developed accurately predicted the sediment transport and hydraulic processes following dam removal a review of studies to date indicates that one dimensional models are more commonly used in the dam removal projects rather than more complex two or three dimensional models because of limitations in topographic data cui et al 2019 pizzuto 2002 however one dimensional models can predict only flow fields sediment transport and bed elevation changes in the downstream direction as all these results were averaged over the entire width of cross section thus the prediction of multi dimensional features such as lateral bar deposition and bank erosion cannot be obtained by the one dimensional model this weakness underestimated the spatially pattern of channel widening within the formerly impounded reach in which bank erosion or bar deposition could occur poeppl et al 2019 in addition there was no clear difference in suspended sediment concentrations at the four dam sites table s2 as the suspended sediment transport was barely affected by these dams yet we could not exclude the possibility that the three dams upstream of the lmd may influence the transport route for bedload materials the bedload transport was estimated to be about 6 25 percent of the total sediment transport from the recent 20 year monitoring data in ningnan hydrological station it is recommended to monitor the bedload transport rate to further investigate the impact of upstream dams on post removal fluvial and geomorphic processes especially in high gradient watersheds such as hsr 5 conclusion in this study we developed an eco morphodynamic model to investigate the impacts of the removal of a low head dam on fish habitat compensation in a tributary of the upstream of yangtze river the results showed that persistent erosion occurred in the upstream reach of the dam site over a 10 year period with the erosion of sediments in the former impoundment reach the riverbed slope closely approached the pre dammed conditions at the dam site which would enable migratory fish to migrate further upstream sediment deposition aggraded the streambed in the downstream reach improving the habitat suitability for spawning of j sinensis flow sequence variation had little effect on long term bed elevation or fish habitat suitability however our simulations are also revealed that removing a dam prior to wet years or a wet multi year period can expedite the rate at which habitat compensation can be achieved overall this study highlighted that removing dams and other barriers to fish passage in tributaries can be an effective approach for compensating dam induced habitat

4502,dam removal has been widely used as a river restoration approach however the effectiveness of removing low head dams in tributaries for fish habitat compensation in a dammed river is still poorly understood one major impediment to examining the ecological effectiveness of low head dams is the short length of post dam hydrologic geomorphic and ecological observations to circumvent this challenge we used a one dimensional hydro morphodynamic model to simulate the changes in hydrodynamic features and riverbed elevation the modeled outputs were then incorporated into a fish habitat model to assess the changes of habitat suitability after dam removal one open question in dam removal is the effect that extreme hydrological events have on the trajectory of the post removal hydraulic geomorphic and habitat change here we studied the changes of habitat suitability to a fish species jinshaia sinensis j sinensis in a tributary where a low head dam was recently removed of the jinsha river in china three scenarios of interannual hydrological variations based on observed flow records were simulated the post removal simulations showed that the flow sequence influenced the erosion and deposition rate of sediments but had little effect on net changes in bed elevation after dam removal upstream incision eroded the deposition sediments and reconnected the riverbed at the dam location within the first post removal year stream hydraulics became more diverse with an increasing of riffles following the morphological response to the dam removal the continuous changes in stream hydraulics improved the habitat suitability for j sinensis as the percentage of suitable spawning habitat increased from 17 to approximately 68 before and 10 years after dam removal the study demonstrated that removing a low head dam can not only reconnect the passage for a migratory fish to migrate upstream tributaries for spawning but also improve habitat suitability due to the morphological and stream hydrological responses following dam removal keywords tributary fish habitat compensation dam removal river morphology eco morphodynamic model 1 introduction river impoundment disrupts the longitudinal connectivity of flow and often causes the changes in natural hydrological dynamics barbarossa et al 2020 mcmanamay et al 2012 which blocks migratory routes and alters the pristine flow regimes that have provided habitat for fish reproduction both habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats that can ultimately result in the extinction of fish species nunes et al 2015 reynalte tataje et al 2013 in recent decades some attempts have been made to mitigate these impacts including artificial breeding and release ecological reservoir operation and the construction of structures that facilitate fish passage chen et al 2013 2018 li et al 2015 however all these measures so far have shown some limitations and have failed to fully serve their expected conservation goals due to the highly diverse behavior and ecological properties of native fish li et al 2020 shi et al 2015 in this sense maintaining some near natural free flowing reaches would benefit the heterogeneous habitats needed for fish spawning and early development thus this is considered to be essential for the conservation of fish species which are impacted by damming lopes et al 2019 fish population recruitment is highly dependent on the availability and quality of spawning habitat melcher and schmutz 2010 the spawning migrations of most migratory fish are seasonal phenomena during the reproductive periods some species will travel long distance towards the upstream reaches or their tributaries in search of suitable habitats for spawning zhang et al 2018a therefore tributaries that flow directly into reservoirs can partly compensate the habitat loss in impounded mainstream which positively impacts the fish population recruitment boavida et al 2018 makrakis et al 2012 marques et al 2018 the elements of natural flow fluctuations and the availability of food resources and shelter areas could be maintained in theses tributaries moreover diverse hydraulic conditions occur in the upper middle and lower tributary reaches giving the migratory or rheophilic fish species more chances to colonize new habitats garcia et al 2019 if fish species have to move in the direction of headwater streams the avoidance of barriers that prevent them from accessing their ideal habitats becomes necessary however low head dams 10 m in height or small hydropower projects which are widely distributed in tributary reaches decrease the river connectivity and limit fish movement 45 000 weirs and low head dams have been built in china approximately 15 of them are being abandoned or degraded ding et al 2019 as these structures are gradually taken out of service or become functionally deficient dam removal has now become an increasingly common way to restore the integrity of river systems foley et al 2017 o connor et al 2015 this highlights the need to better understand the potential role of low head dam removals in habitat compensation and restoration efforts dam removals affect fluvial morphology significantly with uncontrolled sediment releases which is of crucial importance for determining post dam flow patterns as well as the availability of fish habitats doyle et al 2003 magilligan et al 2016 tomsic et al 2007 most of the 1300 known removed dams in the world about 94 are small standing 10 m high and impounding 10 000 m3 of sediments major et al 2017 despite the limited dam height and reservoir size the physical effects i e geomorphic response sediment regime and flow patterns of removing these small dams are substantial in both the reservoir and downstream region the transportation of sediments from the former reservoir can result in a steep channel slope and a supercritical flow condition in the river reach near the dam location ding and langendoen 2018 on the other hand the downstream reach of a removed dam will experience excessive deposition which may fill pools and form channel bars poeppl et al 2019 ritchie et al 2018 the development of channel morphology after dam removal directly affects the quality of fish habitat due to changes of river hydraulics stanley and doyle 2003 for instance a new spawning site of chinook salmon formed in the white salmon river washington usa after the breaching of the condit dam because of increasing flow velocity hatten et al 2016 some migratory fish were found to move into the newly formed riffles reach following a two meter high dam removal in lower manatawny creek southeastern pennsylvania usa hart et al 2002 the rate and timing of geomorphic responses after dam removal vary considerably depending on the water regime and sediment characteristics cui et al 2014 grant and lewis 2015 after dam removal large amounts of deposited reservoir sediments will be washed off swiftly at the beginning but the erosion of the reservoir sediments may continue for a long time months to years perhaps decades before the establishment of an equilibrium state in the riverbed major et al 2017 pizzuto 2002 in gravel rich rivers high flows may be needed to erode coarse sediment especially after the channel has incised through the impounded reservoir sediments hence the effects on fish habitat may continue over a longer period until the channel reaches a new equilibrium however most studies on ecological effects of dam removal were relatively short in time duration i e less than four years post dam removal table s1 in particular knowledge of the effects of removing a tributary dam for habitat compensation to produce habitat for native fish residing in a heavily dammed mainstream section is largely lacking foley et al 2017 in addition a modelling approach can comprehensively assess the physical response following dam removal ding and langendoen 2018 poeppl et al 2019 but little study available uses it to predict the impacts of post removal flow sequence variability on geomorphic and ecological outcomes the objectives of this study were to 1 predict the long term morphological changes after the removal of low head dams under various hydrologic scenarios 2 quantify the effectiveness of post removal fluvial process in terms of the tributary habitat compensation for mainstream native fish we studied the removal of a 7 m high run of river dam named laomuhe dam lmd on the heishui river hsr a major tributary of the lower jinsha river jsr the jsr consists of the upper reach of the yangtze river with a total length of 3481 km the river reach has a rich diversity of freshwater fish with as many as 177 endemic fish species zhang et al 2018a yet the jsr basin also has great potential as a source of hydropower four cascade hydropower stations wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba have been built in the mainstream of lower jsr fig 1 these hydropower stations have a total installed capacity of 42 100 mw with an annual power generation of 184 3 billion kwh wu et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and target fish hsr is about 170 km long and has an annual average discharge of 80 m3 s which is based on the recent 20 year discharge record from the ningnan hydrological station fig 1 the annual maximum daily flow at hsr were fit to a pearson iii distribution which is the commonly used distribution in china fig s1 gao et al 2017 the river originates from maguo mountain and flows into jsr at hulukou town located at 30 km upstream from the baihetan dam bhtd hsr has four small dams in cascade namely sujiawan dam sjd gongdefang dam gdd songxin dam sxd and lmd fig 1 these four dams were all built as run of river structures which have no regulating reservoirs according to the sediment monitoring data after dam constructions there was no obvious difference in suspended sediment concentration at the four dam sites table s2 the concrete rock filled lmd was constructed in 1988 this low head dam was 7 m high and 56 m wide forming a 2 km long reservoir at the upstream of dam site hsr can function as an alternative habitat for rheophilic and migratory species that currently inhabit the mainstream of bhtd reservoir after the impoundment of bhtd 20 km of the lower hsr will be submerged a previously lotic reach will transform into lentic one which may modify the flow conditions necessary for reproduction of many native fish in order to increase the availability of lotic reaches for fish species the three gorges corporation removed the lmd in december 2018 the study reach i e computational domain is 18 km long extending from 3 0 km upstream the dam site to the tributary mouth after impoundment of bhtd the regional geomorphic characteristics varied considerably along the river s longitudinal profile we thus have delineated five sub reaches within the upstream and downstream reach based on their distinct combinations of variability in channel width slope and substrate size table 1 jinshaia sinensis j sinensis was selected as the target fish for investigation as it is a typical migratory and endemic fish in the lower jsr and some of the tributaries including hsr the j sinensis spawning grounds were mainly distributed in the lower jsr between wudongde dam and xiangjiaba dam wang et al 2017 many years of field sampling identified that the most upstream range of spawning habitat extends to the river reach near wudongde dam which is about 180 km upstream of bhtd zhang et al 2018b spawning season of this species usually start at the end of may when the discharge of the river begins to increase they always migrate from lower to upper reach and prefer a suitable flow environment for spawning their spawning actions always take place at the river reaches where flow velocity is mainly from 0 6 to 2 5 m s and water depth is from 0 9 to 2 4 m liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018b however impoundments of xiluodu and xiangjiaba dam fig 1 have blocked the migration routes and endangered the j sinensis species below the bhtd most of adult fish and recruitments are now inhabiting in river reaches between hsr tributary and the bhtd these fish populations will move upstream on both mainstream and its tributaries in search of suitable spawning habitats during their annual reproductive period tang et al 2014 however the impoundment of bhtd will transform the previously lotic reaches above the dam into lentic ones which can lead to spawning habitat loss for j sinensis in hsr the spawning individuals of j sinensis species can be detected in the river reach downstream of sjd the seasonal variability in discharge of hsr may also support the population of other fish species by providing a variety of habitats for their reproduction and early developments yang et al 2017 2 2 field surveys the stream survey was conducted on may 2018 prior to the dam removal and was repeated at six months after dam removal fig s2 channel topography was measured at the cross section using a real time kinetic rtk gps v60 hi target navigation tech co ltd china measuring intervals between cross sections varied from 72 m to 765 m with smaller intervals near the dam site fig s3 we also measured the hydrodynamic characteristics including water levels and flow velocities within the study reach pebble counts wolman 1954 was conducted to determine the streambed substrate compositions we sampled 100 streambed sediment particles randomly along the cross section and measured the intermediate axis width of each sample the cumulative frequency of sediment particles of different sizes and the median substrate size d 50 were determined for each cross section fish surveys were performed in hsr from 2017 to 2019 we used an electrofishing backpack to collect fish samples during the spawning seasons the collected fish were measured length and weight and identified by species before being released back to the stream fig s4 the pace of sampling was standardized for a total time of 60 min per sampling site within the study area we sampled one site upstream of the dam and three sites downstream of the dam in order to increase the sample size we also sampled six sites within the hsr but outside the study reach fig s5 the flow velocity water depth and median substrate size were also measured at specific locations where the spawning individuals of j sinensis were captured 2 3 development of eco morphodynamic model the governing equations of the one dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic model for open channel flow are the st venant equations 1 q x a t q 2 q t β x α q 2 a g a h x g q q c 2 a r 0 where x denotes the spatial axes m t is temporal axes s a is flow area m2 q is the discharge m3 s q is the lateral discharge per unit channel length m2 s α is the momentum distribution coefficient g represents the gravitational acceleration m s2 h is the water surface elevation m c is the chezy resistance coefficient m1 2 s r is the hydraulic radius m to calculate the transition from subcritical flow to supercritical a modified factor β for suppression of convective momentum was introduced into the momentum equation eq 2 the calculation of β was given by 3 β 1 f r 2 0 for f r 1 for f r 1 where fr is the local froude number this approach ensures accuracy for supercritical flow conditions when the froude number is above one the implicit four point partial node finite difference scheme was used to discretize the governing equations in the computational domain yi et al 2017 flows movements above the dam structure were calculated based on the flow formula of broad crested weirs hou et al 2013 next the governing equation for the transport of non uniform sediments can be written as 4 a s k t q s k x b l s q t k q t k q lk where s k is the section averaged sediment concentration of size class k kg m3 b is the channel width in a cross section m l s is the non equilibrium adaptation length of sediment transport m and q lk is the lateral inflow or outflow sediment discharge kg ms the variables q t k and q t k represent the actual sediment transport rate per unit width and equilibrium transport rate for sediment class k kg ms respectively the value of q t k can be calculated from the semi empirical ackers white method meyer et al 2009 the riverbed deformation due to size class k was written as 5 1 ε z k t q t k x 0 where ε is the sediment porosity z k is the thickness of sediment deformation for class k m once the riverbed deformation for a single sediment class is known the total erosion or deposition in the riverbed and the composition of substrates are updated the volumes of sediment deposition and erosion between successive cross sections was estimated using the morphological approach shen et al 2006 which is shown as 6 δ v s i 1 2 a s i a s i 1 δ l i where δ v s i is the volume of sediment deposition or erosion between the cross section i and cross section i 1 m3 a s i is the change of cross section area for cross section i m2 δ l i is the distance between successive cross section i and i 1 m the sediment model communicated with the hydrodynamic model through a time stepping mechanism this pattern divided the unsteady flow into a stepwise steady flow process in each time step the sediment transport and riverbed elevation changes were computed assuming steady flow the hydraulic roughness and bed level were updated and fed back into the hydrodynamic model after each step of calculation fang et al 2008 habitat changes of j sinensis due to the hydro morphological development were investigated using the habitat suitability index hsi model li et al 2015 the spawning life stage was studied because it is a fundamental process to sustain stable populations considering the bottom living characteristics of j sinensis the flow velocity water depth and substrate were selected as the variables to qualify the suitability of the spawning habitat liu et al 2013 the hsi model combines the univariate suitability index as follows 7 hsi i w i v i s 1 3 in which i w i v and i s indicate the water depth suitability index flow velocity suitability index and substrate suitability index each of these variables were quantified using suitability curves ranging from 0 to 1 with 0 for the lowest suitability and 1 for the optimal suitability the relevant suitability curves from zhang et al 2018b are shown in fig 2 2 4 boundary conditions and model parameters in the hydrodynamic model the daily average discharge and water level were set as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively the recorded flow releases at sxd were used as upstream boundary conditions the water level at the downstream boundary was directly calculated using the bed slope and the daily water level data from the ningnan hydrological station fig 1 for sediment transport calculation the daily sediment concentrations were given at the upstream inlet node for all size fractions the transport rate of suspended sediment d 0 5 mm was obtained by the survey data downstream of sxd which is located about 11 5 km upstream of the lmd meanwhile the bedload d 0 5 mm yin et al 2015 transport rate was directly calculated by the equilibrium sediment transport capacity formula wu et al 2004 the riverbed was assumed to be non erodible at the outlet of the sediment model since here the riverbed was heavily covered with cobbles and boulders that are difficult to scour the results of the hydro morphodynamic model were then used as inputs for the fish habitat model initial manning s n roughness values were assigned to each cross section based on the median size of substrates and using guidelines set forth by zhao and he 2010 a 0 5 min time step was used for the hydrodynamic simulation the time step in sediment model was 300 min which was defined as 600 times the time step in the hydrodynamic simulation huang et al 2012 graded substrates were divided into six classes varying from 4 mm to 256 mm a non scouring surface was set up lower than the riverbed with a range of 1 5 m to 8 m upstream of dam site in the downstream reach the non scouring level was empirically set to 1 5 m lower than the bed level expect for the downstream outlet ma et al 2010 the numerical model included 35 cross sections spanning over the 18 km study reach a sensitivity analysis was firstly performed to evaluate the potential effect on flow calculations resulting from changes of manning s n the sensitivity was assessed in terms of the water level simulations at cs3 1 5 km upstream of dam site as expected simulation results were sensitive to changes in manning s n with water level increasing directly with manning s n as expected fig s6 2 5 model simulation scenarios the removal of lmd caused a short term abrupt increase in suspended sediment transportation according to the daily recorded data at the ningnan hydrological station the sediment concentration peaked the day after dam removal december 29 2018 it increased by 78 compared to the previous day and gradually returned to normal four days after dam removal fig s7 the long term scenarios were run to simulate the morphological response over a 10 year period after dam removal 10 year long sets of flow and sediment concentration data were applied to perform the simulation scenarios numerical simulations were run for three different hydrological scenarios to evaluate the impacts of various flow regimes on sediment transport following dam removal scenarios for dry to wet scenario 1 alternating dry and wet scenario 2 and wet to dry scenario 3 were developed to represent various flow sequences fig 3 the hydrologic scenarios were defined according to the historical streamflow time series from january 2010 to december 2019 a previous study has shown that wet periods have historically alternated with dry periods within the lower jsr basin the wet periods have generally lasted 1 5 years while the dry periods lasted 1 6 years zhang et al 2013 thus scenario 1 dry to wet had relatively low annual flow during the first six years average annual flow with exceedance probabilities 37 5 followed by four relatively wet years average annual flow with exceedance probabilities 37 5 scenario 2 actual flow sequence represented a hydrological time series with alternating dry and wet years 2019 was the first year of simulation period in scenario 2 and then 2010 2018 scenario 3 wet to dry had relatively high annual flow during the first four years and low annual flow in the following years water year series and hydrologic attributes for the three scenarios are shown in table s3 moreover the extremely wet seasons in 2020 xia and chen 2021 were not included in the simulation scenarios due to limitation of the monitoring data to assess the hydraulic impacts of dam removal for fish habitat we performed a steady flow simulation based on the annual bed elevation the hydraulic simulation was carried out with the median monthly flow for the primary period june of j sinensis spawning yang et al 2017 selecting the median monthly flow for simulation was based on an assumption that it could be sufficient to protect instream habitat in jsr basin liu et al 2014 the simulated eco hydraulic factors were used to evaluate the j sinensis habitat suitability based on bed substrates flow velocities and water depths 3 results 3 1 verification of the eco morphodynamic model the hydrodynamic model was calibrated for the period of may 1 to june 30 of the year 2018 the manning s n value and the computation time step were determined using the measured daily water levels it was assumed that the status of riverbed was at equilibrium during the calibration period cui et al 2014 the equilibrium assumption was reasonable for the hsr this is because the construction of the four low head dams were the only major disturbance to the river the riverbed was relatively stable after modification of sediment transport for several decades since the four dams were built the mean absolute errors mae was 0 13 m while the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was 0 93 these errors demonstrated that the hydrodynamic model was established well to simulate the river flows vozinaki et al 2017 fig s8 but the model had a largest mae 0 38 m at the highest flow q 177 m3 s occurring on may 28 2018 this was mainly because the surface rain runoff flowed into the river along the reach raising the water level however there were not any opportunities to calibrate the model to high flow events exceedance probability 50 due to the short period of records the model performance for high flow events could be verified through continuous field monitoring which remains as a future work of this study after calibration manning s n values ranged from 0 025 to 0 035 for cross sections with medium gravels 4 16 mm from 0 038 to 0 048 for cross sections with coarse gravels 16 64 mm from 0 05 to 0 06 for cross sections with cobbles 64 256 mm the calibration of the sediment transport and morphological models fig s9 was carried out by simulating the riverbed changes starting at the moment of dam removal the sediment simulation time step was calibrated the values of mae and nse for riverbed changes were 0 66 m and 0 98 indicating similarity between observations and simulations fig s10 however the model underestimated bed incision by approximately 40 at the cross sections immediately upstream of the dam site this should be the result of post removal dredging work that had been undertaken to prevent the demolished dam materials from moving downstream fig s11 the final calibrated parameters for the hydro morphodynamic model are presented in table s4 the modeled habitat suitability and the abundance of spawning fish were analyzed jointly there was a highly statistically significant and linear correlation between spawning fish abundance and hsi p 0 0001 implying that the hsi model was reliable for prediction fig 4 a in addition the froude number thresholds riffle fr 0 41 pool fr 0 18 with glides occupying the intermediate range between these two thresholds jowett 1993 indicated that the target species preferred to spawn in riffles but can also spawn in glides fig 4b 3 2 river morphological development following dam removal sequences of interannual flow variability can influence the erosion and deposition rate but will have little long term effect on total volume of eroded and deposited sediments providing that long term properties of flow series are similar fig s12 at the end of year 10 the spatial distributions of aggraded and degraded reaches show little difference among the different hydrological scenarios the difference between the magnitudes of degradation and aggradation under different scenarios were also slight fig 5 a aggraded river reaches accounted for approximately 55 of the study reach and degraded reaches accounted for 45 the aggraded reaches were primarily the wide downstream reach 3 2 7 9 km downstream from dam and some portions of the far downstream reach 12 0 15 0 km downstream from dam on the other hand net erosion occurred primarily in the dam reservoir reach with a maximum erosion of 7 8 m at the dam site fig 5b the simulation result for scenario 2 was used as an example to demonstrate the annual morphological response fig 6 rapid degradation occurred primarily in the dam reservoir reach following dam removal at the end of year 1 the river channel incised 0 9 m to 3 3 m in the 0 5 km long reach immediately upstream of the dam leaving a knickpoint an abrupt increase in slope at the bed surface the riverbed was reconnected at the end of year 1 because the bed slope at the dam site decreased to 0 39 which is close to the pre dammed condition li 1960 sediment aggradation predominated in the downstream reach riverbed aggradation was greatest in the near downstream reach but was observed to decrease along the flow path there were hardly any morphological changes in the wide downstream and far downstream reach at the end of year 1 during the subsequent years the magnitude of the channel erosion attenuated gradually in the dam reservoir reach with headcut scouring in the downstream the deposited sediments transported towards further downstream which resulted in a maximum aggradation of about 0 6 m to 1 1 m the riverbed appeared to become increasingly stable at the end of year 5 however dynamic geomorphic processes became evident again during year 7 when a 30 year flood occurred the substrate compositions in the hsr showed considerable longitudinal variations after dam removal fig 7 substrates became coarser in the upstream reach but were generally finer in the downstream reach during the first five post removal years the long term variations in bed substrates was independent of the annual maximum flow as high flow events generally caused more transient changes in the substrate size distribution fig s13 3 3 changes in hydraulics and their effects on habitat compensation a drastic difference in suitability of water depth velocity and substrates occurred as a result of channel development following dam removal fig 8 prior to dam removal the flow velocity provided low suitability iv 0 4 tomsic et al 2007 for spawning of j sinensis in dam reservoir reach while the water depth indicated fairly good suitability iw 0 8 fig 8a after dam removal the suitability of flow velocity and substrates increased in impoundment reaching a suitable range for spawning at the end of year 10 sediment deposition in downstream reach caused a general improvement of suitability in flow velocity and substrates after dam removal fig 8b c the habitat suitability for j sinensis was gradually improved with the change in river morphology and hydraulics fig 8d before dam removal approximately 42 of the river reach 7 5 km long was unsuitable for spawning hsi 0 4 and 17 of the river reach 3 0 km provided fairly suitable spawning habitats hsi 0 8 yi et al 2010 at the end of year 1 the percentage of the study river reach with suitable spawning habitat exceeded 45 8 1 km while the percentage with unsuitable habitat was reduced to 25 4 5 km in the last five years of the simulation the percentage of unsuitable river reach showed a further decrease from 13 2 4 km to 9 1 7 km while the percentage of suitable reach increased from 40 7 2 km to 68 12 2 km all river reaches with suitable spawning habitats were covered by glides and riffles moreover the ratio of riffles with suitable habitat increased from 16 to 90 the length of riffles has increased from 0 km before dam removal to 6 3 km at year 10 q 110 m3 s accounting for 35 of the total river length meanwhile glides and pools decreased 4 and 76 respectively fig 8e the substrates were in a good state in riffle and glide reaches where target species preferred to spawn over 78 of the riffles and glides provided suitable substrates for spawning before and after dam removal different flow sequences produced annual variability in habitat available following dam removal the scenario 3 wet to dry had the highest rate in expansion of suitable habitat for j sinensis during the years immediately following dam removal nonetheless the percentages of the study reach with unsuitable equaled 68 under all three scenarios fig 8f moreover the overall habitat suitability showed declines under scenarios 1 and 2 between year 2 and year 5 the reason was that the water depth suitability got a bit worse at this period fig s14 4 discussion a free flowing tributary can provide important alternative habitat for long distance migratory fish whose lotic mainstream habitat is converted to lentic habitat due to dams da silva et al 2019 annual and seasonal flow variations attract and support a diverse mix of rheophilic species which are endangered or threatened by river damming however habitat compensation in tributaries is restricted by low head dams and some small hydropower projects da silva et al 2015 we found that access to tributary habitats could be improved substantially after the removal of lmd with the mobilization of reservoir sediment the bed slope became close to the pre dam condition at the dam site fig 5 the restored river continuity enables migratory fish to normally utilize habitat upstream of the former dam site the 11 5 km long free flowing reach between sxd and lmd could provide additional habitat compensation for migratory species such as j sinensis which prefer lotic reaches for spawning yet this strategy may have limited success in restoring migration because sxd will still limit the range of the fish in addition impoundment of bhtd will submerge approximately 20 km of the lower hsr leading to a forty five percent reduction in the length of free flowing reach below sxd thus it is recommended to remove the upstream dams or build fishways to facilitate fish passage above them in next stage of this restoration effort in addition to improving the river connectivity and upstream access dam removal brought profound changes in stream channel morphology with the release of sediments from the formerly impounded area a knickpoint formed in the dam reservoir reach and began to migrate upstream before disappearing altogether substrate sediments became coarser in the dam reservoir reach due to its higher capacity for sediment transport the degraded reaches were restricted to the dam reservoir reach under the three scenarios meanwhile fine sediments were transported to the downstream reach and formed dunes as well as ripples which covered up the previously coarsened substrates and aggraded the riverbed whiting and king 2003 have concluded that in general increasing the finer particle supply is not likely to cause aggradation because river tend to have the capacity to transport materials of these sizes however the simulation results in this study showed a substantial aggradation in the downstream with the supply of fine sediments from the impounded area the reason was that the river reach could experience bed aggradation when large quantities of sediments were released yet this aggradation might be transient as the fine substrates would be transported further downstream in the future lane et al 2003 model results indicated that the reservoir sediments moved downstream in the first year after dam removal creating a substantial deposition with a maximum of about 3 4 m in the near downstream reach in subsequent years the depositions moved through the wide downstream reach with aggradation increasing at the end of wide downstream reach at the year 5 after the year 5 deposition thickness gradually decreased in the wide downstream reach as sediments were transported downstream fig 6 sediment aggradation primarily occurred in the wide downstream reach over the 10 year simulation period this was mainly because of the weakened transport capacity due to the lower gradient and widened cross sections table 1 the various flow sequences could influence the trajectories in annual changes of bed elevation fig s15 and s16 but it had little effect on the ultimate distribution of sediment erosion and deposition at the end of year 10 thus studies of dam removal aiming to characterize long term impacts should mainly focus more on the geomorphic and ecological responses for multi year time scale not for a relatively short period of time high flows will scour additional sediments regardless of prior riverbed conditions simulation results for scenario 2 showed that river morphology was gradually stabilized in entire river reach over time but an episodic change in riverbed composition took place in year 7 fig 6 studies on previous dam removal have indicated that erosion of non cohesive sediments from a de watered reservoir exhibit a two phase response collins et al 2017 in the first phase the transport of impoundment sediments is driven by increases in the energy gradient caused by higher water slope later after the river channel reaches a temporal equilibrium high flow events may be necessary to trigger additional sediment movements from the riverbed major et al 2017 pearson et al 2011 has defined the early phase as process driven and the later as event driven at year 7 of the simulation period erosion of sediment shifted from the process driven phase to the event driven phase due to the occurrence of a 30 year return period flood flow q 799 m3 s fig s1 the high magnitude flood scoured substantially coarser sediments which cannot be removed during relatively modest flows causing changes in bed elevation and particle size distributions significant increase of substrate size was observed at year 7 due to the higher transport capacity of the high flood flow fig 7 however the relatively modest flow at year 10 resulted in little decrease of substrate size it was because the gradually stable riverbed diminished the mobility of bed materials we found that following dam removal stream hydraulics become more diverse with the addition of many riffles before dam removal the river reach had high percentages of pools 43 and glides 57 and had no riffles in the first year after dam removal approximately 4 6 km riffles formed in the dam reservoir reach and near downstream reach the length of riffles increased by 37 by the end of the year 10 while glides and pools decreased 4 and 76 respectively fig 8e the large increase in riffles should be beneficial in providing suitable habitats to j sinensis as well as many other species inhabiting hsr that prefer lotic area for spawning overall the proportions of suitable spawning habitat increased from 17 to approximately 68 for the three flow scenarios during the 10 year simulation period under all three scenarios but the scenario 3 wet to dry had the highest rate in expansion of suitable habitat for j sinensis indicating that removing a dam prior to a wet period lasting multiple years can expedite habitat restoration notably there was no clear trend in habitat improvement within the lowest 5 km long reach the most likely reason was that the river morphology was not significantly reformed following dam removal in this river reach bed materials were composed mainly of cobbles with a median grain size of 77 83 mm prior to dam removal these relatively coarse grains protected the riverbed from excessive erosion in addition the wide downstream reach has the lowest sediment transport capacity due to its greater width and low gradient table 1 downstream depositions were restricted and negligible aggradation would occur further downstream fig 5 therefore other restoration measures e g placement of submerged weirs artificial ripraps were suggested to enrich morphological diversity which remains a future topic of study although our study focused on the lower jsr in western china these results are relevant for other gravel bed river systems throughout the world moreover the hydraulic and habitat model were run only using the june median flow not taking into account the interannual variability of flows during spawning seasons such as the median june flow in the driest and wettest year or even the extremely low and high flows during spawning period thus in order to estimate the overall habitat quality more comprehensively a few other representative flow scenarios should be considered during the follow up research the one dimensional numerical model we developed accurately predicted the sediment transport and hydraulic processes following dam removal a review of studies to date indicates that one dimensional models are more commonly used in the dam removal projects rather than more complex two or three dimensional models because of limitations in topographic data cui et al 2019 pizzuto 2002 however one dimensional models can predict only flow fields sediment transport and bed elevation changes in the downstream direction as all these results were averaged over the entire width of cross section thus the prediction of multi dimensional features such as lateral bar deposition and bank erosion cannot be obtained by the one dimensional model this weakness underestimated the spatially pattern of channel widening within the formerly impounded reach in which bank erosion or bar deposition could occur poeppl et al 2019 in addition there was no clear difference in suspended sediment concentrations at the four dam sites table s2 as the suspended sediment transport was barely affected by these dams yet we could not exclude the possibility that the three dams upstream of the lmd may influence the transport route for bedload materials the bedload transport was estimated to be about 6 25 percent of the total sediment transport from the recent 20 year monitoring data in ningnan hydrological station it is recommended to monitor the bedload transport rate to further investigate the impact of upstream dams on post removal fluvial and geomorphic processes especially in high gradient watersheds such as hsr 5 conclusion in this study we developed an eco morphodynamic model to investigate the impacts of the removal of a low head dam on fish habitat compensation in a tributary of the upstream of yangtze river the results showed that persistent erosion occurred in the upstream reach of the dam site over a 10 year period with the erosion of sediments in the former impoundment reach the riverbed slope closely approached the pre dammed conditions at the dam site which would enable migratory fish to migrate further upstream sediment deposition aggraded the streambed in the downstream reach improving the habitat suitability for spawning of j sinensis flow sequence variation had little effect on long term bed elevation or fish habitat suitability however our simulations are also revealed that removing a dam prior to wet years or a wet multi year period can expedite the rate at which habitat compensation can be achieved overall this study highlighted that removing dams and other barriers to fish passage in tributaries can be an effective approach for compensating dam induced habitat

4503,the interaction between hydrology terrain and vegetation is an essential element in understanding complex landscapes and in forecasting their evolution under climate change in mediterranean europe few studies have been performed on the interrelation between them in this study soil moisture vegetation and water table dynamics were measured on opposing hillslopes of a semi arid mediterranean catchment in southern spain to quantify the aspect influence on ecohydrological dynamics of an oak woodland savanna or dehesa observations of a network of 32 soil moisture sensors on two opposing hillslopes a north facing slope nfs and a south facing one sfs detected a similar moisture dynamics although the influence of the vegetation induces a lagged response where the nfs dries out earlier compared to the sfs analysis of successive soil water profiles after storm events suggests that the water moves downwards as an unsaturated preferential flow along the walls of the fractured granite material with residence times between 16 3 and 36 7 days our results show that there is a direct coupling between the hillslope hydrology the depth of the weathered bedrock much higher on the nfs and the vegetation dynamics vegetation is much denser on nfs as lidar derived biomass estimates were 29 higher than on the sfs the evolution of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained from the sentinel 2 time series also shows completely opposing trends with a minimum value at the end of winter for the nfs whereas the sfs reaches minimum values in summer a significant correlation between ndvi and soil moisture was found for the sfs pearson s r of 0 81 however this correlation is very poor on the nfs but a good correlation with water table was found r 0 46 this shows how the deep weathering on the nfs allows for an additional water source contained in the rock moisture and saturated zone that represents an important source for the vegetation whereas on the sfs only soil moisture supports the vegetation these vegetation differences in turn directly impact surface soil moisture leading to the observed relatively similar trends on both hillslopes keywords soil moisture slope aspect mediterranean environments shallow aquifer recharge 1 introduction soil moisture plants and their inter relations are the base of ecohydrological studies eagleson 2002 especially in water limited arid and semi arid systems d odorico et al 2010 different works have shown the impact of topography soil properties radiation e g bennie et al 2008 and vegetation cover on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in dry environments cantón et al 2004 and in wetter colder landscapes kim 2009 solar radiation also exerts a significant control over the spatial organization of ecohydrological processes such as rainfall interception evapotranspiration root uptake runoff generation and vegetation canopy dynamics yetemen et al 2015 different studies have addressed the effect of aspect on ecohydrological dynamics gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 observed that the energy input was more important than the vegetation in the control of the surface water transfer processes in the sevilleta national wildlife refuge in new mexico usa as being a major cause of the valleys slope asymmetry in this area the north facing slopes nfs were wetter and colder than the analogous south facing slopes sfs in a similar study in the jemez watershed in northern new mexico zapata rios et al 2016 detected a reduction in the incoming radiation by nfs which resulted in a smaller vegetation cover than the analogous east facing slopes efs consequently these authors found that the water partitioning between vaporization and soil wetting in the watershed whose ratio is defined as the horton index was lesser in the nfs than in the efs it is well known that slope aspect is also related to asymmetry in hillslope geomorphology istanbulluoglu et al 2008 but only recently critical zone research has linked aspect to even deeper changes in soil properties and the architecture of the critical zone geroy et al 2011 found that the nfs soils formed on the idaho batholith not far from boise usa have a greater porosity more organic matter and a higher silt content than those on the sfs they did not explicitly study vegetation differences and while there is clearly a higher vegetation cover on nfs compared to sfs in their study site they attribute these differences in soil properties to complex interactions between microclimate vegetation lithology material resource source and erosion in view of such complex interactions poulos et al 2012 propose a hillslope asymmetry index ha to homogenize the asymmetry comparison caused by different drivers tectonic climate and hydrological in any case the observations of geroy et al 2011 agree with the measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity in asymmetric slopes in gabilan mesa in california usa made by richardson et al 2020 which were greater in nfs than in sfs concluding that surface runoff was the main reason for that asymmetry a recent review of pelletier et al 2018 summarizes most of the research done on slope aspect controls on critical zone processes and reviews the causes for the hillslope asymmetry that is observed at different latitudes they introduce a model separating the water limited and temperature limited soil mantle cases and distinguishing a temperature threshold in both earth hemispheres they also propose the terminology pole and equator facing hillslopes instead of nfs and sfs to generalize in both earth hemispheres otherwise the results of the studies would be only valid for the corresponding hemisphere in which the study area is located as is the case with the aforementioned works whose results are valid only for the northern hemisphere kumari et al 2020 adopting this pole and equatorial facing slopes terminology highlight the importance of seasonal variations in the aspect effects of the valley asymmetry a relatively unknown component of the hydrological cycle whose importance was recently brought to light is rock moisture which is the water stored in the vadose zone of the fractured bedrock it is well known that vegetation in areas with thin soils extracts water from fractured bedrock exploiting either groundwater or rock moisture lubczynski 2009 eliades et al 2018 measured with sap flow sensors that this contributed over 70 of the transpiration of mediterranean pine trees in cyprus however rempe and dietrich 2018 were among the first to specifically quantify the contribution of rock moisture as a significant source of water containing up to 27 of the annual rainfall in their study site in the northern california coast ranges usa schmidt and rempe 2020 were the first to quantify water dynamics of rock moisture by nuclear magnetic resonance hahm et al 2020 corroborated the importance of rock moisture for vegetation dynamics with isotope tracers they showed how oak transpiration during the summer dry season in california was drawn from the fractured bedrock they found that the depth of dynamic storage reaches up to 9 m and claim that this would reflect the depth of root water uptake which will need to be confirmed by further studies hahm et al 2019 found that regional plant composition along the northern california coastal ranges was controlled by the thickness of the subsurface critical zone and therefore by the size of this rock moisture reservoir i e the moisture content within the vadose zone that is not properly soil e g meinzer 1923 hahm et al 2019 analyze vegetation differences between seven catchments from the northern california coast range they found important differences in plant productivity and mortality and relate these differences to the size of the rock moisture storage capacity counterintuitively they conclude that catchments with a low subsurface water storage capacity would be less sensitive to rainfall variations it is clear that the coupling between vegetation dynamics on the one hand and soil and subsurface water dynamics on the other remains poorly understood the impact of aspect on the interaction of these factors has not yet been analyzed if the conclusion of hahm et al 2019 hold differences between plant productivity could also be expected as a function of topography as critical zone architecture and soil properties differ as function of aspect also while some studies have analyzed the effect of aspect or topographic position on soil moisture or the effect of aspect on vegetation dynamics very few studies have analyzed the interrelations between them in any case it is also not clear what happens in other regions and landscapes and this requires further study in mediterranean europe few studies have been performed on the interrelation between landscape position soil moisture and vegetation e g nadal romero et al 2014 and no studies on rock moisture have been done in this region there is a common semi natural land use system called dehesa or montado in spain and portugal respectively which is ideally suited for such further study this land management system is also called a mediterranean savanna eagleson and segarra 1985 scholes and archer 1997 as it consists of a homogeneous grassland with woody plants on the local scale the influence of tree canopies mainly quercus ilex l quercus suber l and quercus pyrenaica willd is detected by the increase in actual evapotranspiration and the reduction in the water yield in the analogical processes occurring in the open space between trees as evaluated by joffre and rambal 1993 the main objective of this work is to explore the valley asymmetry characteristics of a dehesa system by considering the soil moisture evolution and its controlling factors the specific objectives are i to analyze soil moisture dynamics in different landscape positions ii to determine the specific aspect influence on the soil moisture dynamics and hillslope hydrology iii to quantify vegetation response through the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on two opposite slopes in a dehesa watershed and analyze its relation to soil moisture and water table evolution 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a semi natural area of oak woodland savanna or dehesa located in sierra morena in the north of the region of córdoba fig 1 a southern spain 38 2 n 4 17 w 700 m a m s l the sierra morena ecosystem is included in the natura 2000 network protected by the habitat directive 92 43 eec the zone has a continental mediterranean climate bsk in the köppen geiger diagram peel et al 2007 with an average annual rainfall of 878 mm from 1981 to 2010 cold winters and dry long summers the mean annual air temperature is 15 3 c with the coldest month being january with a mean monthly temperature of 7 c and the hottest july with a mean monthly temperature of 25 4 c carpintero et al 2020 the study site fig 1c is within the so called santa clotilde critical zone observatory czo and is named after the privately owned santa clotilde farm where it is located this czo is situated within the 48 3 km2 catchment draining into the martin gonzalo reservoir there is a vegetation difference which could be attributed to the aspect with the purpose of exploring this potential asymmetry opposing north and south facing slopes were selected to install soil moisture monitoring equipment to simplify the analysis we will henceforth refer to these as

cambisols under the fao unesco world reference base iuss working group wrb 2015 their texture class is mainly sandy to sandy loam with a depth generally ranging between 0 5 m along the south aspect part of the transect and 1 0 m along the northern part of the transect román sánchez et al 2018 the climatic seasonality comprising a long dry summer and the low fertility of the soil make agriculture unsustainable in this area all year round as joffre et al 1999 explained the old transhumance system was abandoned and sheep were replaced locally and almost all over this environment by beef cattle and the iberian pig the largest direct product of this dehesa the cattle graze equally throughout the area though avoiding steep parts with a diet based on natural grasses and other supplementary feeding the iberian pig is fed on acorns and grass from october to january the livestock contributes to the dispersion of the natural pasture seeds and their fertility vegetation in a dehesa consists of as anticipated at the beginning of this subsection sparse trees holm quercus ilex l cork oaks quercus suber portuguese oak or valencian oak quercus faginea and other species with no or a scant capacity for natural regeneration and a tree senescence of 150 years for quercus suber and 250 300 years for other species olea san miguel ayanz 2006 bushes retama retama sphaerocarpa l and annual grasses such as lolium sp bromus sp and trifolium sp with a maximum production in spring and a non vegetative period in summer are common in the watershed 2 2 experimental set up a total of seven soil moisture monitoring sites were chosen fig 1b and fig 2 along a toposequence including two opposite hillslopes to install soil moisture monitoring stations the nfs ranges in height from 655 to 725 m a m s l and the sfs from 655 to 705 m a m s l fig 2 four monitoring sites sc10 sc7 were set up along the nfs and three monitoring sites sc4 sc6 along the sfs to record soil volumetric moisture content bulk electrical conductivity and temperature the sensors were set out along different landscape positions on each of the opposing slopes including hilltop slope and valley bottom as shown in table 1 the exact positions were determined by the accessibility of the excavator due to the difficult terrain conditions with high slopes trees and rocks the difficult accessibility of the area also determined that the line of monitoring sites on the nfs was not perfectly convergent with that on the sfs fig 1b each monitoring site consisted of five soil moisture sensors campbell scientific cs655 at depths of 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 m except sc4 and sc5 in which the two deepest and the deepest sensor respectively could not be installed because of the shallower depth to bedrock on the sfs it was observed that hard bedrock directly underlying the soil profile while on the nfs we observed the presence of highly weathered saprolite as the excavator could easily dig through this material and it could be broken manually after the sensor installation the profile pits were covered with soil again five dataloggerscr200 campbell sci inc one cr800 and one cr1000 campbell sci inc were used to monitor all the sensors located along the north south transect the clocks on the dataloggers were synchronized and periodically checked to ensure that the measurement timing throughout the site was always consistent measurements were recorded at half hourly intervals from november 2016 to early january 2018 and at 10 min intervals from january 2018 to november 2019 providing a precise timing of the arrival of the wetting front with the depth the system is powered by solar cells with a maximum power of 15 w and 12 v that supply the necessary energy for data maintenance and storage to the dataloggers topographic factors and soil properties at each of the measuring locations are shown in table 1 on average the sand fraction dominated the particle size distribution 74 3 the average proportion of coarse gravel was high i e 32 table 1 also shows that the organic matter content om was scant 1 06 which is consistent with the mediterranean climate and topographic conditions the annual global solar radiation radannual and the topographic wetness index twi were calculated using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis software from a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 5 m etrs89 utm zone 30 the twi was derived according to the following relation beven and kirkby 1979 where a is the upstream contributing area and tan β is the tangent of the slope angle

1998 was obtained by a weather station installed by the regional ministry of agriculture fishing and environment consejería de agricultura pesca y medio ambiente 2020 close to the study area fig 1c 2 3 soil moisture analysis soil moisture content θ was determined by converting the dielectric permittivity measurement into volumetric moisture content using the topp equation topp et al 1980 which has shown itself to be accurate within a few percent for a wide variety of soils dalton 1992 skierucha et al 2012 and has eliminated the necessity of soil specific calibrations for most routine applications ghezzehei 2008 persico et al 2019 the third degree polynomial topp equation eq 2 described the relationship between dielectric permittivity and volumetric moisture content in mineral soils sensors measure electromagnetic wave propagation time by knowing the length of the probe waveguides the velocity of wave propagation is dependent on the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding media kirkham 2014 including both the fine soil and the stones the equation presented by topp et al 1980 was 2 θ v 5 3 10 2 2 92 10 2 k a 5 5 10 4 k a 2 4 3 10 6 k a 3 being θ v the volumetric moisture content and ka the bulk dielectric permittivity of the soil θ of the complete 0 0 50 m profile was calculated by averaging the soil moisture of all the depths and was normalized as an effective saturation ratio e g brutsaert 2005 where θmin and θmax are the minimum and maximum θ measured respectively thereafter we refer to the effective saturation ratio as soil moisture s according to equation 3 3 s θ θ min θ max θ min 2 3 1 evolution of depth averaged soil moisture in order to obtain a simple measurement of overall synchrony between the different locations along the toposequence profile average soil moisture was calculated for each soil profile and a pairwise correlation was assessed through the pearson correlation coefficient pearson s r the statistical analysis and data management were performed with the rstudio software r core team 2018 and the hmisc package v4 3 0 harrell 2019 to avoid spurious correlations due to underlying trends in the dataset the pearson correlation coefficient is reported for daily soil moisture increments or first differences i e s s t s t 1 with s t being the normalized value at time t note that s represents the daily

different sites its general behaviour was described by means of the analysis of the probability density function pdf to further inspect the influence of seasonality on soil moisture two different weibull pdf s were fitted one for the dry state and another one for the wet state for the dry period data were gathered from april 16 to november 15 and for the wet one from november 16 to april 15 dry state data corresponded to the long periods between rain events while wet state data were collected in the rainy periods nevertheless to avoid spurious data due to sudden warm days between rain events a threshold value of soil moisture was selected for the wet state s 0 2 no limit value was established for the dry state fittings were made with the maximum likelihood estimation method e g bury 1999 17 12 the pdf of a weibull random variable is bury 1999 17 1 4 f x κ λ κ λ x λ κ 1 e x p x λ κ x 0 κ λ 0 being x the effective saturation ratio s κ the shape parameter and λ the scale parameter 2 3 3 evaluating the aspect influence in order to assess the influence of aspect on soil moisture the dynamics of two sensor sites located on opposing hillslopes in a similar landscape position on the mid slope were evaluated in detail sc5 and sc8 these sites were selected because they are expected to best represent the effect of aspect on sfs and nfs respectively fig 1b the wilcoxon signed rank test was performed with a significance level of α 0 05 every two months to compare the two independent groups of samples then we evaluated the underlying causes of the differences observed between soil moisture patterns on nfs and sfs thus we compared the difference in daily soil moisture storage changes between sfs and nfs concerning rainfall p and reference evapotranspiration et0 differences were calculated as that between the daily soil moisture storage change on sfs and that of the nfs i e δs sfs δs nfs s i 1 s i sfs si 1 si nfs with si being the normalized value at time i 2 3 4 residence time the water transmitting properties of the soil were estimated with the time scales of the surface soil moisture depletion method after a rain pulse of kurc and small 2004 and adapted as well by gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 in the sevilleta watershed field study τ based on a linear relationship eq 5 between the moisture loss and the moisture content normalized with the initial value θ1 the final of the drydown θf and the time t similar to the t model of alley 1984 as 5 θ θ f θ 1 θ f e t τ τ was calculated following the guidelines of the above authors a rain event 8 mm and the surface θ in the first 10 cm during the days following the rainfall until the next rain 2 mm was considered then we made an exponential fit to data and obtained the exponential time constants 2 4 water table monitoring the water table fluctuations could only be observed on the nfs because no water table was detected on the sfs whose shallow soil is directly underlain by hard bedrock a piezometric well was drilled and tubed with pvc pipes on the nfs in 2016 in the mid slope position with a diameter of 0 076 m and 9 50 m in depth a pressure transducer hobo u20l 02 water level 30 6 m data logger was installed in the well for the monitoring of the water table level at 15 min intervals from november 2016 to november 2019 2 5 vegetation dynamics the vegetation indices most used resort to the information contained in the red and near infrared nir canopy reflectances different studies have employed the ndvi derived from remote sensing data to couple vegetation changes with hydrology zapata rios et al 2016 ndvi is equal to nir minus visible radiation divided by nir plus visible radiation this index defines values ranging from 1 0 to 1 0 the google earth engine has been employed to obtain the ndvi from images from the copernicus sentinel 2 a european wide swath high resolution multi spectral mission sentinel 2 2020 with 10 m of spatial resolution ndvi is one of the best known and most used vegetation indices for quantifying the greenness of vegetation which was measured in an area with a 21 m radius covering a grid of approximately 3 3 pixels with 10 m of spatial resolution around the sc8 and sc5 location from november 2016 to november 2019 in addition lidar data were used to estimate the biomass these data originate from the spanish national plan for aerial orthophotography lidar project starting in 2009 whose objective was to cover the whole spanish national territory with point clouds with x y z coordinates and other attributes obtained by airborne lidar sensors the study area being covered between march and may 2014 the point density is 0 5 points m 2 and they were geo referenced in the european terrestrial reference system 1989 etrs89 the altimetric accuracy and precision have a root mean square error rmsez 0 2 m the ellipsoidal heights obtained were transformed into orthometric heights we work with two common products derivated from lidar the digital terrain model dtm and the digital surface model dsm available at the download center of the spanish national geographic institute cnig 2020 the dtm product represents the elevation of the ground and dsm represents the tallest point at that location ground vegetation and buildings filtering algorithms were used by cnig 2020 to create both layers the difference between the dsm and dtm operation in arcgis gives us the height of the biomass then we estimated the volume of biomass considering the 2 m of raster resolution to get rid of 0 values we set a strict limit of height difference at 1 m 2 6 correlation analysis between ndvi soil moisture and water table level a correlation analysis by means of the pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the ndvi values the profile average soil moisture and the groundwater level at nfs and sfs in the latter the correlation analysis does not include groundwater level due to its absence in sfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture dynamics 3 1 1 evolution of depth averaged soil moisture soil moisture content responds to the rainfall pulses and the more prolonged spring summer increasing period of reference evapotranspiration as observed by other works e g or et al 2013 in the study period from november 2016 to november 2019 as shown in fig 3 in general the soil dries quite fast to minimum values after the rain pulses the seasonal influence on soil moisture patterns is evident in the data of fig 3 soils are generally wetter during winter and drier during summer as can be expected in a mediterranean climate fig 3 also depicts the high variability of daily rainfall the annual precipitation was much smaller in 2017 and 2019 respectively 477 5 mm and 286 6 mm until 2019 10 31 compared to 902 3 mm in 2018 moreover three rainfall events of over 40 mm occurred in march 2018 the correlation between the soil moisture content of the different sites for the whole measuring period is summarized in table 2 values shown in bold represent a high positive correlation with pearson s r values of over 0 60 on the nfs the moisture content of each sample point is well correlated with that of the closest location this points out that the locations are wetting and drying out in a similar way however there are very important disconnections especially between sc10 and sc7 locations this suggests lateral redistribution of soil moisture from hilltop to valley bottom fan et al 2019 e g rainfall event of may 20 2018 fig 3 on the contrary on the sfs there is a strong correlation between sc4 and sc6 locations which seems to indicate that lateral redistribution is not important on this slope because of the shallow soil the correlation between the sc5 and sc6 locations is moderate just below the subjective limit that we define as high correlation set a 0 60 possibly due to the greater clay content at sc6 location than that of the sc5 the soil moisture content of site sc10 the profile at the top of the nfs is not well correlated with that of site sc4 despite sc4 being in a very similar landscape position at the top of the opposing sfs probably due to the differences mentioned above with presence of highly weathered saprolite on the nfs and hard bedrock directly underlying the soil profile on the sfs while on the nfs the water can move to and from the underground aquifer on the sfs the water cannot percolate from the soil profile however the mid slope profile on the nfs sc8 has a high correlation with the mid slope profile on the sfs sc5 and the valley bottom profile just below on the nfs sc7 has a high correlation with the corresponding position on the sfs the presence of coarse particles and the different structure patterns caused by the partial weathering of the granitic rock induced an appreciable variability in the results 3 1 2 soil moisture probabilistic description the amount of data of effective saturation ratio s allows the estimation of a pdf at each depth and at the depth averaged profile rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the adjusted pdf showed a bimodal shape with distinct dry and wet states due to the high seasonality of the mediterranean climate d odorico et al 2000 espejo et al 2016 two different weibull pdf s eq 4 were fitted one for the dry state and another one for the wet state and are illustrated in fig 4 for the nfs hilltop site sc10 the parameters of the fitted pdf s for all monitoring sites are presented in table 3 for detailed information of the goodness of the fits and the relationship between mean and standard deviation of soil moisture at each location at dry and wet states see the supplementary figs s1 and s2 respectively for a deeper understanding of the factors affecting the soil moisture we correlated the fitted pdf means for all sites sc10 sc4 for the wet and dry states with environmental covariates shown in table 1 the pearson correlation coefficients are in table 4 where the highest values have been highlighted for dry conditions the only significant correlation was found with twi this correlation with a coefficient of 0 85 might indicate the predominance of the topography the gravity component of the water flow equation on the spatial distribution of soil moisture content in absence of other factors like the rainfall as observed in the many mediterranean landscapes under dry conditions the importance of twis confirms observations by other authors which are widely used to approximate soil moisture patterns e g beven and kirkby 1979 nyberg 1996 identified macro topography as being the cause of a large part of the variability in soil moisture by finding that there was a correlation between soil moisture content and twi although penna et al 2009 reported that the terrain indices were poor predictors of soil moisture spatial variability the twis with a positive pearson correlation coefficient with soil moisture together with the slope were found to be the best predictors of soil moisture explaining up to 42 of its time averaged spatial variability from data collected at 3 depths on different measurement points over 3 experimental hillslopes in the central eastern italian alps in a review study buchanan et al 2014 observed widely differing correlation strengths with r2 values ranging between 0 and 0 89 under wet conditions the correlation with twi was not significant however a significant correlation was found between soil moisture content and bulk density with a pearson coefficient of 0 79 under wet conditions an increase in soil moisture was correlated with decreasing bulk density and consequently with the increase of porosity this relationship coincides with that observed in samples of weathered granitic rocks obtained in san bernardino and san jacinto mountains california usa by jones and graham 1993 3 2 aspect influences on soil moisture profiles recharge and residence time examining the daily moisture profiles of both sc8 location with a local slope of 27 and sc5 location with a local slope of 20 after the first autumn winter rain pulses fig 5 a clear distinction appears between them on the sfs profile water accumulates at the bottom while on the nfs the moisture content at the bottom remains roughly constant the small change observed in the moisture content at the bottom of the profile sc8 suggests that the water moves downward as an unsaturated preferential flow nimmo 2012 demonstrated that preferential flow in soil fissures cracks or macropores does not need saturated conditions in their studies in coastal mendocino county in northern california salve et al 2012 and rempe and dietrich 2018 detected aquifer recharge without a perceptible moisture change in the unsaturated weathered zone the soil moisture residence times of the soil computed as kurc and small 2004 indicated are displayed in table 5 the residence time for the soil moisture in the first 10 cm of the sc8 is about 16 days smaller than in the analogous sc5 profile about 37 days possibly due to the faster transit of water both upwards and downwards in the sc8 profile as compared to the upward flow only in the sc5 the values are greater than those reported by gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 possibly due to the smaller evapotranspiration rate estimated in the santa clotilde site in autumn and spring 3 3 relation between soil moisture water table and vegetation dynamics in order to analyze the influence of aspect on the interaction between hydrology and vegetation of the opposing north and south facing hillslopes soil moisture water table and vegetation dynamics were analyzed jointly in fig 6 soil moisture content measurements from sites sc5 and sc8 were used fig 6a shows the precipitation fig 6b the vegetation greenness fig 6 c d and e give information on the soil moisture status on both opposing hillslopes fig 6e shows s for the sfs and the nfs during the study period and the daily difference between both δs s sfs snfs in fig 6c the wilcoxon signed rank test performed every two months fig 6d allowed us to detect the periods in which the differences between nfs and sfs were significant green bar or not red bar fig 6d data gaps indicate a period with problems in the measuring instruments the water table evolution on the nfs is shown in fig 6f it shows a clear link between the maximum values measured in both the water table and in the soil moisture fig 6e and f similar results were obtained on an nfs and sfs of gordon gulch colorado usa by langston et al 2015 they reported a soil moisture series of 2 years and attributed this to infiltration events due to snowmelt our case without snow but with a high saturation of the root zone soil moisture after heavy rainfall events corresponds well with the recharge of the water table the depletion period of the aquifer goes on beyond the summer season indeed minimum water levels are not reached in summer but rather during winter fig 6f the baseflow draining the aquifer is very slow and the recharge of small rainfall events is inappreciable only when long rainfall events occur is a recharge observed for example in february 2018 the differences between soil moisture on the sfs and the nfs revealed an appreciable seasonal pattern with an average of 0 003 and a standard deviation of 0 094 the smallest δs occurred during summer as both locations dried out to their minimum value the maximum δs was observed during transition periods illustrating a different or lagged response with one hillslope drying faster than the other one positive differences were found in the drying phases of 2017 and 2018 when the soil on the nfs started drying earlier with respect to that on the sfs only two drying periods were found to not be significantly different spring summer from may 29 to july 29 2017 and spring from march 29 to may 29 2019 both were similar in that the profiles on both nfs and sfs were rewetted after a late rain event in may and april respectively those dried out very fast due to the high reference evapotranspiration rates during this period fig 3 negative differences were found during rewetting phases by the first autumn rains the nfs slope captures more efficiently the rainwater than the sfs increasing their soil moisture content as it can be appreciated in the case of the autumn winter of 2017 fig 6e this pattern is not observed the other two years due to the abundance of rain events which recharged the soils of both slopes similarly therefore both nfs and sfs follow a similar seasonal trend although small significant differences between nfs and sfs do exist due to a time lag in their drying response caused by the distinct composition of the vegetation cover the nfs in spite of receiving lower radiation starts to dry earlier due to a denser tree cover causing a higher transpirative demand this attenuation of the differences between nfs and sfs contrasts strongly with the results of gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 whose differences on opposing slopes of a semiarid catchment in central new mexico usa were remarkable they concluded that the water balance on nfs and sfs followed opposing trajectories and that evapotranspirative demands were met from distinct soil water pools in the present case soil moisture does not show any opposing trend the difference between both studies could be attributed to a combination of factors such as the annual rainfall the soil texture but most importantly to the different vegetation cover gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 report a vegetation cover between 27 4 and 41 on sfs and nfs respectively under these circumstances it is clear that vegetation has a more limited effect with respect to radiation on soil water balance in this study however vegetation cover is between 80 and 100 with a significantly higher tree density on the nfs as will be analyzed below to understand better the underlying reasons for these differences we compared daily soil moisture storage change differences δssfs δsnfs to rainfall in wetting periods and to reference evapotranspiration in drying periods the result is shown in fig 7 a and b positive values indicated that soil moisture increased more on sfs in wetting periods and decreased less on sfs in drying periods the results show a higher number of negative values fig 7a negative differences indicate a higher infiltration on nfs which can be attributed to higher infiltration rates a comparison could be established between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values measured on the mid slope positions sc8 and sc5 of both opposing hillslopes table 1 the value of ks is higher on the nfs 1 75 10 2 cms 1 compared to that on the sfs 2 33 10 3 cms 1 this was similarly observed by richardson et al 2020 who found significantly higher infiltration rates on a nfs in new mexico due to its deeper soils and higher organic matter content this is also the case here with the om content on the nfs being double that on the sfs because of the denser vegetation cover the soil depths are similar but on the sfs the profile overlies hard bedrock whereas on the nfs there is a deeply weathered saprolite this is counterintuitive we would expect positive values due to the interception of denser vegetation on the nfs however we only observe positive values for high daily rainfall values of over 30 mm when it is very unlikely that vegetation interception will play a significant role indicating that a greater fraction of the rainfall infiltrates and remains in the profile on sfs compared to on nfs these increments follow 3 dry down sequences in february and october 2018 fig 5b and c respectively and april 2017 the relationship between daily soil moisture storage change differences δssfs δsnfs and et0 for drying periods is shown in fig 7b no clear relation exists between the difference in the drying of the opposing hillslopes with et0 the differences were not significant except for et0 1 mm where positive values indicated faster nfs drying due to water uptake by a denser vegetation cover for higher values of et0 no clear trend exists this means that as soon as both hillslopes start to dry the drying rates are similar as observed in fig 6e as both nfs and sfs have a similar slope during the drying phases so that no differences between nfs and sfs are found here the differences between the two soil moisture time series in fig 6e are principally due to a short time lag between both opposing hillslopes with the nfs slopes starting to dry out earlier the time lag was calculated for different drying events resulting in an average value of 4 days this is consistent with ng and miller 1980 who attributed the lower soil moisture on the nfs to greater vegetation cover and greater transpiration losses in their study in southern california chaparral however very opposing trends between sfs and nfs can be observed in ndvi fig 6b in the three years the same pattern is repeated from june to october the value of ndvi on both hillslopes has the same shape being higher in nfs the ndvi values on the nfs slope showed a clear decline at the end of the summer followed by recovery after the end of the year in the sfs the ndvi decreased from the end of the spring with a slow recovery initiated at the last part of the summer the average value of ndvi for the study period was 0 49 on the nfs with a standard deviation of 0 062 while on the sfs it was 0 47 with a standard deviation of 0 061 this difference can be explained by the density of trees which is higher on the nfs aforementioned whereas the sfs has a greater grass cover significant differences have been observed in vegetation cover based on lidar derived vegetation volumes between the opposite hillslopes fig 8 the average vegetation volume on the nfs is 6 7 m3 m2 with a standard deviation of 2 1 whereas on the sfs it is 5 2 m3 m2 with a standard deviation of 1 8 so it appears that nfs can maintain denser and greener vegetation compared to sfs these trends are similar to those reported by liu et al 2017 in a mediterranean type oak grass savanna in california however as ndvi values remain high during the dry season on the nfs this indicates that the vegetation must be supported by water coming from a different pool than that of the soil pores as the latter was depleted fig 6d the water that percolates from the soil moves along the complex networks of fractures and cracks in the underlying fractured saprolite during this movement the water can be retained in some of these fractures accessible to the tree roots before reaching the saturated zone this water pool was denominated rock moisture by rempe and dietrich 2018 to distinguish it from soil moisture the relevance of this water pool for the survival of trees oak trees of many semiarid areas has been discussed by david et al 2004 in a montado system in portugal not far from the study site balugani et al 2017 in western spain in another dehesa ecosystem and hahm et al 2019 in the northern california coastal range in our case this additional water pool occurs only on the nfs where below the soil profile a deep layer of up to 9 50 m of weathered fractured saprolite lies this is not the situation on the sfs where hard bedrock hardly weathered and without any appreciable fractures directly underlies the soil profile to explore the relation between ndvi and soil moisture and water table level in more detail they were correlated directly in fig 9 a significant correlation of ndvi and soil moisture for the sfs was found with a coefficient of 0 81 fig 9a with a parabolic relationship with indicates that as the soil moisture content increases the ndvi increases as well this suggests that the soil water pool is the sole source of water for the vegetation however the analog correlation analysis on the nfs slope is very poor which confirms that vegetation here is not supported by soil moisture but rather by a different water pool fig 9b fig 9c shows a significant connection of the water table with the ndvi as was discussed earlier our data suggests that the rock moisture or non soil vadose zone water pool is key for the sustenance of the vegetation the water table itself is probably too deep to provide a significant water source for the trees as no roots were observed below 3 m during the fieldwork while some authors have reported roots up to 16 m hahm et al 2019 in similar environments according to fan et al 2017 the importance of such accidental deep roots is probably low as the mean rooting depth for quercus spp is 5 23 m fan et al 2017 we propose that the good correlation between ndvi and water table depth is rather due to a good correlation of water table and rock moisture content although we have no direct measurements of rock moisture recharge and depletion of groundwater are related to this pool throughout a complex interrelation as described by salve et al 2012 the conceptual model of fig 10 illustrates the santa clotilde czo representing the north south aspect gradient and summarizes the interplay between the subsurface structure of the critical zone the vegetation and the hydrological processes along the toposequence the difference in soil moisture content depends on the vegetation and the critical zone structure the thickness of the critical zone varies from the sfs where the unweathered bedrock is just below the soil profile i e 0 60 m depth to the nfs where a deep layer of highly weathered bedrock lies between the soil and the unweathered bedrock with a total depth of 9 50 m at the mid slope location field observations have shown that the thickness of this unweathered bedrock layer increases towards the top of the transect therefore while on the sfs the vegetation composition is a wooded grassland on the nfs the subsurface critical zone structure sustains a closed canopy of evergreen oaks and roots were observed to 3 m depth during fieldwork on the nfs the rainfall flows vertically through the soil and the thick highly weathered bedrock vadose zone replenishing the rock moisture reservoir the existence of layers with high hydraulic conductivity in a direction parallel to the slope enhances the lateral subsurface movement of vadose zone water simultaneously through fractures in the weathered bedrock vadose zone rainwater can flow deeper recharging the underlying aquifer which was only detected on this slope the presence of underlying unweathered bedrock with low conductivity allows seasonal groundwater development and lateral downslope redistribution of groundwater especially at the bottom part of the nfs runoff may be generated through subsurface flow of vadose zone water and or groundwater seep or exfiltration which may flow back across the land surface conversely on the sfs hard bedrock directly underlying the soil causing the hydrological processes are dominated by vertical infiltration of rainwater here the shallow thickness of the soil profile hampers lateral hydrological connectivity guang rong et al 2020 also pointed out in their study in the qinghai lake basin alpine czo that the thickness of the critical zone on the nfs is larger than on the sfs being their main findings that the hydrological processes on the sfs are dominated by surface flow and strong vertical infiltration process while on the nfs are dominated by the subsurface flow 4 conclusions in a mediterranean oak woodland savanna o dehesa of southern spain soil moisture evolution reflects the influence of the strong seasonality characterized by two different weibull probability distribution functions one for the wet season with a mode at a degree of saturation of about 0 63 and another one with no evident mode as a consequence of the weibull pdf equation when the shape parameter κ is close to unity in the dry state the factors that determine the average soil moisture in dry conditions are topographical features such as twi while in wet conditions it is soil bulk density this indicates the predominance of the topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture content during dry periods and soil properties during wet ones a detailed analysis of the soil moisture profiles shows a fast response of the water table to the intense rain pulses this as well as the shape of the soil water profiles suggests the existence of unsaturated preferential moisture flow in the vadose zone hillslope aspect exerts a hydrological control through the vegetation and the structure of the critical zone soil profiles on the sfs are shallow while on the nfs slope the soils are underlain by a 9 50 m deep layer of highly weathered bedrock this expands the water holding capacity on nfs that can hold soil moisture rock moisture and a seasonal water table this allows a greater vegetation density on the nfs slope compared to the sfs that is highly water limited even though sfs receives more solar radiation the estimation of biomass volumes on both opposing hillslopes confirms the more favourable growth conditions of the nfs than those of the sfs the relation between soil moisture water table and ndvi pattern clearly illustrate these feedback effects between vegetation bedrock weathering and hillslope hydrology in contrast with other studies that found clear differences between opposing slopes here the soil moisture trends between nfs and sfs are very similar albeit slightly lagged with the nfs drying out earlier due to the denser vegetation however both hillslopes exhibit clearly opposing ndvi trends with a minimum value in winter to nfs and in summer for sfs ndvi was well related to soil moisture on sfs but not on nfs however a good correlation was found between water table level and ndvi on the nfs this allows us to conclude that there is a different water pool on nfs which corresponds to the rock moisture and the saturated zone credit authorship contribution statement

4503,the interaction between hydrology terrain and vegetation is an essential element in understanding complex landscapes and in forecasting their evolution under climate change in mediterranean europe few studies have been performed on the interrelation between them in this study soil moisture vegetation and water table dynamics were measured on opposing hillslopes of a semi arid mediterranean catchment in southern spain to quantify the aspect influence on ecohydrological dynamics of an oak woodland savanna or dehesa observations of a network of 32 soil moisture sensors on two opposing hillslopes a north facing slope nfs and a south facing one sfs detected a similar moisture dynamics although the influence of the vegetation induces a lagged response where the nfs dries out earlier compared to the sfs analysis of successive soil water profiles after storm events suggests that the water moves downwards as an unsaturated preferential flow along the walls of the fractured granite material with residence times between 16 3 and 36 7 days our results show that there is a direct coupling between the hillslope hydrology the depth of the weathered bedrock much higher on the nfs and the vegetation dynamics vegetation is much denser on nfs as lidar derived biomass estimates were 29 higher than on the sfs the evolution of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained from the sentinel 2 time series also shows completely opposing trends with a minimum value at the end of winter for the nfs whereas the sfs reaches minimum values in summer a significant correlation between ndvi and soil moisture was found for the sfs pearson s r of 0 81 however this correlation is very poor on the nfs but a good correlation with water table was found r 0 46 this shows how the deep weathering on the nfs allows for an additional water source contained in the rock moisture and saturated zone that represents an important source for the vegetation whereas on the sfs only soil moisture supports the vegetation these vegetation differences in turn directly impact surface soil moisture leading to the observed relatively similar trends on both hillslopes keywords soil moisture slope aspect mediterranean environments shallow aquifer recharge 1 introduction soil moisture plants and their inter relations are the base of ecohydrological studies eagleson 2002 especially in water limited arid and semi arid systems d odorico et al 2010 different works have shown the impact of topography soil properties radiation e g bennie et al 2008 and vegetation cover on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in dry environments cantón et al 2004 and in wetter colder landscapes kim 2009 solar radiation also exerts a significant control over the spatial organization of ecohydrological processes such as rainfall interception evapotranspiration root uptake runoff generation and vegetation canopy dynamics yetemen et al 2015 different studies have addressed the effect of aspect on ecohydrological dynamics gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 observed that the energy input was more important than the vegetation in the control of the surface water transfer processes in the sevilleta national wildlife refuge in new mexico usa as being a major cause of the valleys slope asymmetry in this area the north facing slopes nfs were wetter and colder than the analogous south facing slopes sfs in a similar study in the jemez watershed in northern new mexico zapata rios et al 2016 detected a reduction in the incoming radiation by nfs which resulted in a smaller vegetation cover than the analogous east facing slopes efs consequently these authors found that the water partitioning between vaporization and soil wetting in the watershed whose ratio is defined as the horton index was lesser in the nfs than in the efs it is well known that slope aspect is also related to asymmetry in hillslope geomorphology istanbulluoglu et al 2008 but only recently critical zone research has linked aspect to even deeper changes in soil properties and the architecture of the critical zone geroy et al 2011 found that the nfs soils formed on the idaho batholith not far from boise usa have a greater porosity more organic matter and a higher silt content than those on the sfs they did not explicitly study vegetation differences and while there is clearly a higher vegetation cover on nfs compared to sfs in their study site they attribute these differences in soil properties to complex interactions between microclimate vegetation lithology material resource source and erosion in view of such complex interactions poulos et al 2012 propose a hillslope asymmetry index ha to homogenize the asymmetry comparison caused by different drivers tectonic climate and hydrological in any case the observations of geroy et al 2011 agree with the measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity in asymmetric slopes in gabilan mesa in california usa made by richardson et al 2020 which were greater in nfs than in sfs concluding that surface runoff was the main reason for that asymmetry a recent review of pelletier et al 2018 summarizes most of the research done on slope aspect controls on critical zone processes and reviews the causes for the hillslope asymmetry that is observed at different latitudes they introduce a model separating the water limited and temperature limited soil mantle cases and distinguishing a temperature threshold in both earth hemispheres they also propose the terminology pole and equator facing hillslopes instead of nfs and sfs to generalize in both earth hemispheres otherwise the results of the studies would be only valid for the corresponding hemisphere in which the study area is located as is the case with the aforementioned works whose results are valid only for the northern hemisphere kumari et al 2020 adopting this pole and equatorial facing slopes terminology highlight the importance of seasonal variations in the aspect effects of the valley asymmetry a relatively unknown component of the hydrological cycle whose importance was recently brought to light is rock moisture which is the water stored in the vadose zone of the fractured bedrock it is well known that vegetation in areas with thin soils extracts water from fractured bedrock exploiting either groundwater or rock moisture lubczynski 2009 eliades et al 2018 measured with sap flow sensors that this contributed over 70 of the transpiration of mediterranean pine trees in cyprus however rempe and dietrich 2018 were among the first to specifically quantify the contribution of rock moisture as a significant source of water containing up to 27 of the annual rainfall in their study site in the northern california coast ranges usa schmidt and rempe 2020 were the first to quantify water dynamics of rock moisture by nuclear magnetic resonance hahm et al 2020 corroborated the importance of rock moisture for vegetation dynamics with isotope tracers they showed how oak transpiration during the summer dry season in california was drawn from the fractured bedrock they found that the depth of dynamic storage reaches up to 9 m and claim that this would reflect the depth of root water uptake which will need to be confirmed by further studies hahm et al 2019 found that regional plant composition along the northern california coastal ranges was controlled by the thickness of the subsurface critical zone and therefore by the size of this rock moisture reservoir i e the moisture content within the vadose zone that is not properly soil e g meinzer 1923 hahm et al 2019 analyze vegetation differences between seven catchments from the northern california coast range they found important differences in plant productivity and mortality and relate these differences to the size of the rock moisture storage capacity counterintuitively they conclude that catchments with a low subsurface water storage capacity would be less sensitive to rainfall variations it is clear that the coupling between vegetation dynamics on the one hand and soil and subsurface water dynamics on the other remains poorly understood the impact of aspect on the interaction of these factors has not yet been analyzed if the conclusion of hahm et al 2019 hold differences between plant productivity could also be expected as a function of topography as critical zone architecture and soil properties differ as function of aspect also while some studies have analyzed the effect of aspect or topographic position on soil moisture or the effect of aspect on vegetation dynamics very few studies have analyzed the interrelations between them in any case it is also not clear what happens in other regions and landscapes and this requires further study in mediterranean europe few studies have been performed on the interrelation between landscape position soil moisture and vegetation e g nadal romero et al 2014 and no studies on rock moisture have been done in this region there is a common semi natural land use system called dehesa or montado in spain and portugal respectively which is ideally suited for such further study this land management system is also called a mediterranean savanna eagleson and segarra 1985 scholes and archer 1997 as it consists of a homogeneous grassland with woody plants on the local scale the influence of tree canopies mainly quercus ilex l quercus suber l and quercus pyrenaica willd is detected by the increase in actual evapotranspiration and the reduction in the water yield in the analogical processes occurring in the open space between trees as evaluated by joffre and rambal 1993 the main objective of this work is to explore the valley asymmetry characteristics of a dehesa system by considering the soil moisture evolution and its controlling factors the specific objectives are i to analyze soil moisture dynamics in different landscape positions ii to determine the specific aspect influence on the soil moisture dynamics and hillslope hydrology iii to quantify vegetation response through the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on two opposite slopes in a dehesa watershed and analyze its relation to soil moisture and water table evolution 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a semi natural area of oak woodland savanna or dehesa located in sierra morena in the north of the region of córdoba fig 1 a southern spain 38 2 n 4 17 w 700 m a m s l the sierra morena ecosystem is included in the natura 2000 network protected by the habitat directive 92 43 eec the zone has a continental mediterranean climate bsk in the köppen geiger diagram peel et al 2007 with an average annual rainfall of 878 mm from 1981 to 2010 cold winters and dry long summers the mean annual air temperature is 15 3 c with the coldest month being january with a mean monthly temperature of 7 c and the hottest july with a mean monthly temperature of 25 4 c carpintero et al 2020 the study site fig 1c is within the so called santa clotilde critical zone observatory czo and is named after the privately owned santa clotilde farm where it is located this czo is situated within the 48 3 km2 catchment draining into the martin gonzalo reservoir there is a vegetation difference which could be attributed to the aspect with the purpose of exploring this potential asymmetry opposing north and south facing slopes were selected to install soil moisture monitoring equipment to simplify the analysis we will henceforth refer to these as respectively nfs and sfs in this study area vegetation composition in the nfs is dominated by a closed canopy of evergreen oaks quercus spp 95 of trees and bushes cover in association with 5 of annual grasses cover while the sfs is a wooded grassland with sparse oaks 60 of trees and bushes cover 20 of annual grasses and 20 bare soil soils in the catchment are derived from los pedroches batholith parent material composed of a main granodioritic unit several granite plutons and an important acid to basic dyke complex carracedo et al 2009 these soils belong to the orders regosols leptosols and cambisols under the fao unesco world reference base iuss working group wrb 2015 their texture class is mainly sandy to sandy loam with a depth generally ranging between 0 5 m along the south aspect part of the transect and 1 0 m along the northern part of the transect román sánchez et al 2018 the climatic seasonality comprising a long dry summer and the low fertility of the soil make agriculture unsustainable in this area all year round as joffre et al 1999 explained the old transhumance system was abandoned and sheep were replaced locally and almost all over this environment by beef cattle and the iberian pig the largest direct product of this dehesa the cattle graze equally throughout the area though avoiding steep parts with a diet based on natural grasses and other supplementary feeding the iberian pig is fed on acorns and grass from october to january the livestock contributes to the dispersion of the natural pasture seeds and their fertility vegetation in a dehesa consists of as anticipated at the beginning of this subsection sparse trees holm quercus ilex l cork oaks quercus suber portuguese oak or valencian oak quercus faginea and other species with no or a scant capacity for natural regeneration and a tree senescence of 150 years for quercus suber and 250 300 years for other species olea san miguel ayanz 2006 bushes retama retama sphaerocarpa l and annual grasses such as lolium sp bromus sp and trifolium sp with a maximum production in spring and a non vegetative period in summer are common in the watershed 2 2 experimental set up a total of seven soil moisture monitoring sites were chosen fig 1b and fig 2 along a toposequence including two opposite hillslopes to install soil moisture monitoring stations the nfs ranges in height from 655 to 725 m a m s l and the sfs from 655 to 705 m a m s l fig 2 four monitoring sites sc10 sc7 were set up along the nfs and three monitoring sites sc4 sc6 along the sfs to record soil volumetric moisture content bulk electrical conductivity and temperature the sensors were set out along different landscape positions on each of the opposing slopes including hilltop slope and valley bottom as shown in table 1 the exact positions were determined by the accessibility of the excavator due to the difficult terrain conditions with high slopes trees and rocks the difficult accessibility of the area also determined that the line of monitoring sites on the nfs was not perfectly convergent with that on the sfs fig 1b each monitoring site consisted of five soil moisture sensors campbell scientific cs655 at depths of 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 m except sc4 and sc5 in which the two deepest and the deepest sensor respectively could not be installed because of the shallower depth to bedrock on the sfs it was observed that hard bedrock directly underlying the soil profile while on the nfs we observed the presence of highly weathered saprolite as the excavator could easily dig through this material and it could be broken manually after the sensor installation the profile pits were covered with soil again five dataloggerscr200 campbell sci inc one cr800 and one cr1000 campbell sci inc were used to monitor all the sensors located along the north south transect the clocks on the dataloggers were synchronized and periodically checked to ensure that the measurement timing throughout the site was always consistent measurements were recorded at half hourly intervals from november 2016 to early january 2018 and at 10 min intervals from january 2018 to november 2019 providing a precise timing of the arrival of the wetting front with the depth the system is powered by solar cells with a maximum power of 15 w and 12 v that supply the necessary energy for data maintenance and storage to the dataloggers topographic factors and soil properties at each of the measuring locations are shown in table 1 on average the sand fraction dominated the particle size distribution 74 3 the average proportion of coarse gravel was high i e 32 table 1 also shows that the organic matter content om was scant 1 06 which is consistent with the mediterranean climate and topographic conditions the annual global solar radiation radannual and the topographic wetness index twi were calculated using the spatial analysis tools in arcgis software from a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 5 m etrs89 utm zone 30 the twi was derived according to the following relation beven and kirkby 1979 where a is the upstream contributing area and tan β is the tangent of the slope angle in eq 1 1 twi in a tan β regarding climate data rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge measurements were recorded at half hourly intervals by a nearby automated weather station installed by the andalusian institute of agricultural research and training ifapa ifapa 2020 in the zone fig 1c also reference evapotranspiration computed with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was obtained by a weather station installed by the regional ministry of agriculture fishing and environment consejería de agricultura pesca y medio ambiente 2020 close to the study area fig 1c 2 3 soil moisture analysis soil moisture content θ was determined by converting the dielectric permittivity measurement into volumetric moisture content using the topp equation topp et al 1980 which has shown itself to be accurate within a few percent for a wide variety of soils dalton 1992 skierucha et al 2012 and has eliminated the necessity of soil specific calibrations for most routine applications ghezzehei 2008 persico et al 2019 the third degree polynomial topp equation eq 2 described the relationship between dielectric permittivity and volumetric moisture content in mineral soils sensors measure electromagnetic wave propagation time by knowing the length of the probe waveguides the velocity of wave propagation is dependent on the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding media kirkham 2014 including both the fine soil and the stones the equation presented by topp et al 1980 was 2 θ v 5 3 10 2 2 92 10 2 k a 5 5 10 4 k a 2 4 3 10 6 k a 3 being θ v the volumetric moisture content and ka the bulk dielectric permittivity of the soil θ of the complete 0 0 50 m profile was calculated by averaging the soil moisture of all the depths and was normalized as an effective saturation ratio e g brutsaert 2005 where θmin and θmax are the minimum and maximum θ measured respectively thereafter we refer to the effective saturation ratio as soil moisture s according to equation 3 3 s θ θ min θ max θ min 2 3 1 evolution of depth averaged soil moisture in order to obtain a simple measurement of overall synchrony between the different locations along the toposequence profile average soil moisture was calculated for each soil profile and a pairwise correlation was assessed through the pearson correlation coefficient pearson s r the statistical analysis and data management were performed with the rstudio software r core team 2018 and the hmisc package v4 3 0 harrell 2019 to avoid spurious correlations due to underlying trends in the dataset the pearson correlation coefficient is reported for daily soil moisture increments or first differences i e s s t s t 1 with s t being the normalized value at time t note that s represents the daily change of storage in the soil due to the evaporation infiltration and percolation flow 2 3 2 soil moisture probabilistic description after evaluating the overall correlations of s between the different sites its general behaviour was described by means of the analysis of the probability density function pdf to further inspect the influence of seasonality on soil moisture two different weibull pdf s were fitted one for the dry state and another one for the wet state for the dry period data were gathered from april 16 to november 15 and for the wet one from november 16 to april 15 dry state data corresponded to the long periods between rain events while wet state data were collected in the rainy periods nevertheless to avoid spurious data due to sudden warm days between rain events a threshold value of soil moisture was selected for the wet state s 0 2 no limit value was established for the dry state fittings were made with the maximum likelihood estimation method e g bury 1999 17 12 the pdf of a weibull random variable is bury 1999 17 1 4 f x κ λ κ λ x λ κ 1 e x p x λ κ x 0 κ λ 0 being x the effective saturation ratio s κ the shape parameter and λ the scale parameter 2 3 3 evaluating the aspect influence in order to assess the influence of aspect on soil moisture the dynamics of two sensor sites located on opposing hillslopes in a similar landscape position on the mid slope were evaluated in detail sc5 and sc8 these sites were selected because they are expected to best represent the effect of aspect on sfs and nfs respectively fig 1b the wilcoxon signed rank test was performed with a significance level of α 0 05 every two months to compare the two independent groups of samples then we evaluated the underlying causes of the differences observed between soil moisture patterns on nfs and sfs thus we compared the difference in daily soil moisture storage changes between sfs and nfs concerning rainfall p and reference evapotranspiration et0 differences were calculated as that between the daily soil moisture storage change on sfs and that of the nfs i e δs sfs δs nfs s i 1 s i sfs si 1 si nfs with si being the normalized value at time i 2 3 4 residence time the water transmitting properties of the soil were estimated with the time scales of the surface soil moisture depletion method after a rain pulse of kurc and small 2004 and adapted as well by gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 in the sevilleta watershed field study τ based on a linear relationship eq 5 between the moisture loss and the moisture content normalized with the initial value θ1 the final of the drydown θf and the time t similar to the t model of alley 1984 as 5 θ θ f θ 1 θ f e t τ τ was calculated following the guidelines of the above authors a rain event 8 mm and the surface θ in the first 10 cm during the days following the rainfall until the next rain 2 mm was considered then we made an exponential fit to data and obtained the exponential time constants 2 4 water table monitoring the water table fluctuations could only be observed on the nfs because no water table was detected on the sfs whose shallow soil is directly underlain by hard bedrock a piezometric well was drilled and tubed with pvc pipes on the nfs in 2016 in the mid slope position with a diameter of 0 076 m and 9 50 m in depth a pressure transducer hobo u20l 02 water level 30 6 m data logger was installed in the well for the monitoring of the water table level at 15 min intervals from november 2016 to november 2019 2 5 vegetation dynamics the vegetation indices most used resort to the information contained in the red and near infrared nir canopy reflectances different studies have employed the ndvi derived from remote sensing data to couple vegetation changes with hydrology zapata rios et al 2016 ndvi is equal to nir minus visible radiation divided by nir plus visible radiation this index defines values ranging from 1 0 to 1 0 the google earth engine has been employed to obtain the ndvi from images from the copernicus sentinel 2 a european wide swath high resolution multi spectral mission sentinel 2 2020 with 10 m of spatial resolution ndvi is one of the best known and most used vegetation indices for quantifying the greenness of vegetation which was measured in an area with a 21 m radius covering a grid of approximately 3 3 pixels with 10 m of spatial resolution around the sc8 and sc5 location from november 2016 to november 2019 in addition lidar data were used to estimate the biomass these data originate from the spanish national plan for aerial orthophotography lidar project starting in 2009 whose objective was to cover the whole spanish national territory with point clouds with x y z coordinates and other attributes obtained by airborne lidar sensors the study area being covered between march and may 2014 the point density is 0 5 points m 2 and they were geo referenced in the european terrestrial reference system 1989 etrs89 the altimetric accuracy and precision have a root mean square error rmsez 0 2 m the ellipsoidal heights obtained were transformed into orthometric heights we work with two common products derivated from lidar the digital terrain model dtm and the digital surface model dsm available at the download center of the spanish national geographic institute cnig 2020 the dtm product represents the elevation of the ground and dsm represents the tallest point at that location ground vegetation and buildings filtering algorithms were used by cnig 2020 to create both layers the difference between the dsm and dtm operation in arcgis gives us the height of the biomass then we estimated the volume of biomass considering the 2 m of raster resolution to get rid of 0 values we set a strict limit of height difference at 1 m 2 6 correlation analysis between ndvi soil moisture and water table level a correlation analysis by means of the pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the ndvi values the profile average soil moisture and the groundwater level at nfs and sfs in the latter the correlation analysis does not include groundwater level due to its absence in sfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture dynamics 3 1 1 evolution of depth averaged soil moisture soil moisture content responds to the rainfall pulses and the more prolonged spring summer increasing period of reference evapotranspiration as observed by other works e g or et al 2013 in the study period from november 2016 to november 2019 as shown in fig 3 in general the soil dries quite fast to minimum values after the rain pulses the seasonal influence on soil moisture patterns is evident in the data of fig 3 soils are generally wetter during winter and drier during summer as can be expected in a mediterranean climate fig 3 also depicts the high variability of daily rainfall the annual precipitation was much smaller in 2017 and 2019 respectively 477 5 mm and 286 6 mm until 2019 10 31 compared to 902 3 mm in 2018 moreover three rainfall events of over 40 mm occurred in march 2018 the correlation between the soil moisture content of the different sites for the whole measuring period is summarized in table 2 values shown in bold represent a high positive correlation with pearson s r values of over 0 60 on the nfs the moisture content of each sample point is well correlated with that of the closest location this points out that the locations are wetting and drying out in a similar way however there are very important disconnections especially between sc10 and sc7 locations this suggests lateral redistribution of soil moisture from hilltop to valley bottom fan et al 2019 e g rainfall event of may 20 2018 fig 3 on the contrary on the sfs there is a strong correlation between sc4 and sc6 locations which seems to indicate that lateral redistribution is not important on this slope because of the shallow soil the correlation between the sc5 and sc6 locations is moderate just below the subjective limit that we define as high correlation set a 0 60 possibly due to the greater clay content at sc6 location than that of the sc5 the soil moisture content of site sc10 the profile at the top of the nfs is not well correlated with that of site sc4 despite sc4 being in a very similar landscape position at the top of the opposing sfs probably due to the differences mentioned above with presence of highly weathered saprolite on the nfs and hard bedrock directly underlying the soil profile on the sfs while on the nfs the water can move to and from the underground aquifer on the sfs the water cannot percolate from the soil profile however the mid slope profile on the nfs sc8 has a high correlation with the mid slope profile on the sfs sc5 and the valley bottom profile just below on the nfs sc7 has a high correlation with the corresponding position on the sfs the presence of coarse particles and the different structure patterns caused by the partial weathering of the granitic rock induced an appreciable variability in the results 3 1 2 soil moisture probabilistic description the amount of data of effective saturation ratio s allows the estimation of a pdf at each depth and at the depth averaged profile rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the adjusted pdf showed a bimodal shape with distinct dry and wet states due to the high seasonality of the mediterranean climate d odorico et al 2000 espejo et al 2016 two different weibull pdf s eq 4 were fitted one for the dry state and another one for the wet state and are illustrated in fig 4 for the nfs hilltop site sc10 the parameters of the fitted pdf s for all monitoring sites are presented in table 3 for detailed information of the goodness of the fits and the relationship between mean and standard deviation of soil moisture at each location at dry and wet states see the supplementary figs s1 and s2 respectively for a deeper understanding of the factors affecting the soil moisture we correlated the fitted pdf means for all sites sc10 sc4 for the wet and dry states with environmental covariates shown in table 1 the pearson correlation coefficients are in table 4 where the highest values have been highlighted for dry conditions the only significant correlation was found with twi this correlation with a coefficient of 0 85 might indicate the predominance of the topography the gravity component of the water flow equation on the spatial distribution of soil moisture content in absence of other factors like the rainfall as observed in the many mediterranean landscapes under dry conditions the importance of twis confirms observations by other authors which are widely used to approximate soil moisture patterns e g beven and kirkby 1979 nyberg 1996 identified macro topography as being the cause of a large part of the variability in soil moisture by finding that there was a correlation between soil moisture content and twi although penna et al 2009 reported that the terrain indices were poor predictors of soil moisture spatial variability the twis with a positive pearson correlation coefficient with soil moisture together with the slope were found to be the best predictors of soil moisture explaining up to 42 of its time averaged spatial variability from data collected at 3 depths on different measurement points over 3 experimental hillslopes in the central eastern italian alps in a review study buchanan et al 2014 observed widely differing correlation strengths with r2 values ranging between 0 and 0 89 under wet conditions the correlation with twi was not significant however a significant correlation was found between soil moisture content and bulk density with a pearson coefficient of 0 79 under wet conditions an increase in soil moisture was correlated with decreasing bulk density and consequently with the increase of porosity this relationship coincides with that observed in samples of weathered granitic rocks obtained in san bernardino and san jacinto mountains california usa by jones and graham 1993 3 2 aspect influences on soil moisture profiles recharge and residence time examining the daily moisture profiles of both sc8 location with a local slope of 27 and sc5 location with a local slope of 20 after the first autumn winter rain pulses fig 5 a clear distinction appears between them on the sfs profile water accumulates at the bottom while on the nfs the moisture content at the bottom remains roughly constant the small change observed in the moisture content at the bottom of the profile sc8 suggests that the water moves downward as an unsaturated preferential flow nimmo 2012 demonstrated that preferential flow in soil fissures cracks or macropores does not need saturated conditions in their studies in coastal mendocino county in northern california salve et al 2012 and rempe and dietrich 2018 detected aquifer recharge without a perceptible moisture change in the unsaturated weathered zone the soil moisture residence times of the soil computed as kurc and small 2004 indicated are displayed in table 5 the residence time for the soil moisture in the first 10 cm of the sc8 is about 16 days smaller than in the analogous sc5 profile about 37 days possibly due to the faster transit of water both upwards and downwards in the sc8 profile as compared to the upward flow only in the sc5 the values are greater than those reported by gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 possibly due to the smaller evapotranspiration rate estimated in the santa clotilde site in autumn and spring 3 3 relation between soil moisture water table and vegetation dynamics in order to analyze the influence of aspect on the interaction between hydrology and vegetation of the opposing north and south facing hillslopes soil moisture water table and vegetation dynamics were analyzed jointly in fig 6 soil moisture content measurements from sites sc5 and sc8 were used fig 6a shows the precipitation fig 6b the vegetation greenness fig 6 c d and e give information on the soil moisture status on both opposing hillslopes fig 6e shows s for the sfs and the nfs during the study period and the daily difference between both δs s sfs snfs in fig 6c the wilcoxon signed rank test performed every two months fig 6d allowed us to detect the periods in which the differences between nfs and sfs were significant green bar or not red bar fig 6d data gaps indicate a period with problems in the measuring instruments the water table evolution on the nfs is shown in fig 6f it shows a clear link between the maximum values measured in both the water table and in the soil moisture fig 6e and f similar results were obtained on an nfs and sfs of gordon gulch colorado usa by langston et al 2015 they reported a soil moisture series of 2 years and attributed this to infiltration events due to snowmelt our case without snow but with a high saturation of the root zone soil moisture after heavy rainfall events corresponds well with the recharge of the water table the depletion period of the aquifer goes on beyond the summer season indeed minimum water levels are not reached in summer but rather during winter fig 6f the baseflow draining the aquifer is very slow and the recharge of small rainfall events is inappreciable only when long rainfall events occur is a recharge observed for example in february 2018 the differences between soil moisture on the sfs and the nfs revealed an appreciable seasonal pattern with an average of 0 003 and a standard deviation of 0 094 the smallest δs occurred during summer as both locations dried out to their minimum value the maximum δs was observed during transition periods illustrating a different or lagged response with one hillslope drying faster than the other one positive differences were found in the drying phases of 2017 and 2018 when the soil on the nfs started drying earlier with respect to that on the sfs only two drying periods were found to not be significantly different spring summer from may 29 to july 29 2017 and spring from march 29 to may 29 2019 both were similar in that the profiles on both nfs and sfs were rewetted after a late rain event in may and april respectively those dried out very fast due to the high reference evapotranspiration rates during this period fig 3 negative differences were found during rewetting phases by the first autumn rains the nfs slope captures more efficiently the rainwater than the sfs increasing their soil moisture content as it can be appreciated in the case of the autumn winter of 2017 fig 6e this pattern is not observed the other two years due to the abundance of rain events which recharged the soils of both slopes similarly therefore both nfs and sfs follow a similar seasonal trend although small significant differences between nfs and sfs do exist due to a time lag in their drying response caused by the distinct composition of the vegetation cover the nfs in spite of receiving lower radiation starts to dry earlier due to a denser tree cover causing a higher transpirative demand this attenuation of the differences between nfs and sfs contrasts strongly with the results of gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 whose differences on opposing slopes of a semiarid catchment in central new mexico usa were remarkable they concluded that the water balance on nfs and sfs followed opposing trajectories and that evapotranspirative demands were met from distinct soil water pools in the present case soil moisture does not show any opposing trend the difference between both studies could be attributed to a combination of factors such as the annual rainfall the soil texture but most importantly to the different vegetation cover gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 report a vegetation cover between 27 4 and 41 on sfs and nfs respectively under these circumstances it is clear that vegetation has a more limited effect with respect to radiation on soil water balance in this study however vegetation cover is between 80 and 100 with a significantly higher tree density on the nfs as will be analyzed below to understand better the underlying reasons for these differences we compared daily soil moisture storage change differences δssfs δsnfs to rainfall in wetting periods and to reference evapotranspiration in drying periods the result is shown in fig 7 a and b positive values indicated that soil moisture increased more on sfs in wetting periods and decreased less on sfs in drying periods the results show a higher number of negative values fig 7a negative differences indicate a higher infiltration on nfs which can be attributed to higher infiltration rates a comparison could be established between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values measured on the mid slope positions sc8 and sc5 of both opposing hillslopes table 1 the value of ks is higher on the nfs 1 75 10 2 cms 1 compared to that on the sfs 2 33 10 3 cms 1 this was similarly observed by richardson et al 2020 who found significantly higher infiltration rates on a nfs in new mexico due to its deeper soils and higher organic matter content this is also the case here with the om content on the nfs being double that on the sfs because of the denser vegetation cover the soil depths are similar but on the sfs the profile overlies hard bedrock whereas on the nfs there is a deeply weathered saprolite this is counterintuitive we would expect positive values due to the interception of denser vegetation on the nfs however we only observe positive values for high daily rainfall values of over 30 mm when it is very unlikely that vegetation interception will play a significant role indicating that a greater fraction of the rainfall infiltrates and remains in the profile on sfs compared to on nfs these increments follow 3 dry down sequences in february and october 2018 fig 5b and c respectively and april 2017 the relationship between daily soil moisture storage change differences δssfs δsnfs and et0 for drying periods is shown in fig 7b no clear relation exists between the difference in the drying of the opposing hillslopes with et0 the differences were not significant except for et0 1 mm where positive values indicated faster nfs drying due to water uptake by a denser vegetation cover for higher values of et0 no clear trend exists this means that as soon as both hillslopes start to dry the drying rates are similar as observed in fig 6e as both nfs and sfs have a similar slope during the drying phases so that no differences between nfs and sfs are found here the differences between the two soil moisture time series in fig 6e are principally due to a short time lag between both opposing hillslopes with the nfs slopes starting to dry out earlier the time lag was calculated for different drying events resulting in an average value of 4 days this is consistent with ng and miller 1980 who attributed the lower soil moisture on the nfs to greater vegetation cover and greater transpiration losses in their study in southern california chaparral however very opposing trends between sfs and nfs can be observed in ndvi fig 6b in the three years the same pattern is repeated from june to october the value of ndvi on both hillslopes has the same shape being higher in nfs the ndvi values on the nfs slope showed a clear decline at the end of the summer followed by recovery after the end of the year in the sfs the ndvi decreased from the end of the spring with a slow recovery initiated at the last part of the summer the average value of ndvi for the study period was 0 49 on the nfs with a standard deviation of 0 062 while on the sfs it was 0 47 with a standard deviation of 0 061 this difference can be explained by the density of trees which is higher on the nfs aforementioned whereas the sfs has a greater grass cover significant differences have been observed in vegetation cover based on lidar derived vegetation volumes between the opposite hillslopes fig 8 the average vegetation volume on the nfs is 6 7 m3 m2 with a standard deviation of 2 1 whereas on the sfs it is 5 2 m3 m2 with a standard deviation of 1 8 so it appears that nfs can maintain denser and greener vegetation compared to sfs these trends are similar to those reported by liu et al 2017 in a mediterranean type oak grass savanna in california however as ndvi values remain high during the dry season on the nfs this indicates that the vegetation must be supported by water coming from a different pool than that of the soil pores as the latter was depleted fig 6d the water that percolates from the soil moves along the complex networks of fractures and cracks in the underlying fractured saprolite during this movement the water can be retained in some of these fractures accessible to the tree roots before reaching the saturated zone this water pool was denominated rock moisture by rempe and dietrich 2018 to distinguish it from soil moisture the relevance of this water pool for the survival of trees oak trees of many semiarid areas has been discussed by david et al 2004 in a montado system in portugal not far from the study site balugani et al 2017 in western spain in another dehesa ecosystem and hahm et al 2019 in the northern california coastal range in our case this additional water pool occurs only on the nfs where below the soil profile a deep layer of up to 9 50 m of weathered fractured saprolite lies this is not the situation on the sfs where hard bedrock hardly weathered and without any appreciable fractures directly underlies the soil profile to explore the relation between ndvi and soil moisture and water table level in more detail they were correlated directly in fig 9 a significant correlation of ndvi and soil moisture for the sfs was found with a coefficient of 0 81 fig 9a with a parabolic relationship with indicates that as the soil moisture content increases the ndvi increases as well this suggests that the soil water pool is the sole source of water for the vegetation however the analog correlation analysis on the nfs slope is very poor which confirms that vegetation here is not supported by soil moisture but rather by a different water pool fig 9b fig 9c shows a significant connection of the water table with the ndvi as was discussed earlier our data suggests that the rock moisture or non soil vadose zone water pool is key for the sustenance of the vegetation the water table itself is probably too deep to provide a significant water source for the trees as no roots were observed below 3 m during the fieldwork while some authors have reported roots up to 16 m hahm et al 2019 in similar environments according to fan et al 2017 the importance of such accidental deep roots is probably low as the mean rooting depth for quercus spp is 5 23 m fan et al 2017 we propose that the good correlation between ndvi and water table depth is rather due to a good correlation of water table and rock moisture content although we have no direct measurements of rock moisture recharge and depletion of groundwater are related to this pool throughout a complex interrelation as described by salve et al 2012 the conceptual model of fig 10 illustrates the santa clotilde czo representing the north south aspect gradient and summarizes the interplay between the subsurface structure of the critical zone the vegetation and the hydrological processes along the toposequence the difference in soil moisture content depends on the vegetation and the critical zone structure the thickness of the critical zone varies from the sfs where the unweathered bedrock is just below the soil profile i e 0 60 m depth to the nfs where a deep layer of highly weathered bedrock lies between the soil and the unweathered bedrock with a total depth of 9 50 m at the mid slope location field observations have shown that the thickness of this unweathered bedrock layer increases towards the top of the transect therefore while on the sfs the vegetation composition is a wooded grassland on the nfs the subsurface critical zone structure sustains a closed canopy of evergreen oaks and roots were observed to 3 m depth during fieldwork on the nfs the rainfall flows vertically through the soil and the thick highly weathered bedrock vadose zone replenishing the rock moisture reservoir the existence of layers with high hydraulic conductivity in a direction parallel to the slope enhances the lateral subsurface movement of vadose zone water simultaneously through fractures in the weathered bedrock vadose zone rainwater can flow deeper recharging the underlying aquifer which was only detected on this slope the presence of underlying unweathered bedrock with low conductivity allows seasonal groundwater development and lateral downslope redistribution of groundwater especially at the bottom part of the nfs runoff may be generated through subsurface flow of vadose zone water and or groundwater seep or exfiltration which may flow back across the land surface conversely on the sfs hard bedrock directly underlying the soil causing the hydrological processes are dominated by vertical infiltration of rainwater here the shallow thickness of the soil profile hampers lateral hydrological connectivity guang rong et al 2020 also pointed out in their study in the qinghai lake basin alpine czo that the thickness of the critical zone on the nfs is larger than on the sfs being their main findings that the hydrological processes on the sfs are dominated by surface flow and strong vertical infiltration process while on the nfs are dominated by the subsurface flow 4 conclusions in a mediterranean oak woodland savanna o dehesa of southern spain soil moisture evolution reflects the influence of the strong seasonality characterized by two different weibull probability distribution functions one for the wet season with a mode at a degree of saturation of about 0 63 and another one with no evident mode as a consequence of the weibull pdf equation when the shape parameter κ is close to unity in the dry state the factors that determine the average soil moisture in dry conditions are topographical features such as twi while in wet conditions it is soil bulk density this indicates the predominance of the topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture content during dry periods and soil properties during wet ones a detailed analysis of the soil moisture profiles shows a fast response of the water table to the intense rain pulses this as well as the shape of the soil water profiles suggests the existence of unsaturated preferential moisture flow in the vadose zone hillslope aspect exerts a hydrological control through the vegetation and the structure of the critical zone soil profiles on the sfs are shallow while on the nfs slope the soils are underlain by a 9 50 m deep layer of highly weathered bedrock this expands the water holding capacity on nfs that can hold soil moisture rock moisture and a seasonal water table this allows a greater vegetation density on the nfs slope compared to the sfs that is highly water limited even though sfs receives more solar radiation the estimation of biomass volumes on both opposing hillslopes confirms the more favourable growth conditions of the nfs than those of the sfs the relation between soil moisture water table and ndvi pattern clearly illustrate these feedback effects between vegetation bedrock weathering and hillslope hydrology in contrast with other studies that found clear differences between opposing slopes here the soil moisture trends between nfs and sfs are very similar albeit slightly lagged with the nfs drying out earlier due to the denser vegetation however both hillslopes exhibit clearly opposing ndvi trends with a minimum value in winter to nfs and in summer for sfs ndvi was well related to soil moisture on sfs but not on nfs however a good correlation was found between water table level and ndvi on the nfs this allows us to conclude that there is a different water pool on nfs which corresponds to the rock moisture and the saturated zone credit authorship contribution statement

4504,gully headcut erosion is recognized as the primary process of gully erosion and is the main contributor to sediment yield of gully erosion however the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow induced by headcut and its effects on soil loss and plunge pool morphology are still unclear a simulated flow scouring experiment was conducted to explore the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow and their contributions to soil loss and the effect of on wall flow erosion on plunge pool morphology under different flow discharge q 0 3 0 7 2 m3 h 1 and headwall height h 0 0 3 1 2 m conditions our results showed that jet flow and on wall flow accounted 15 7 22 6 and 77 4 84 3 of total flow volume upstream headcut respectively jet flow on wall flow and their interaction contributed 53 5 34 9 and 11 6 of total soil loss amount respectively furthermore h 0 exhibited greater effect on soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on wall flow but the soil loss caused by on wall was mainly controlled by q 0 the width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased with scouring time and the q 0 and h 0 significantly affected the development of plunge pool morphology on wall flow reduced plunge pool depth by 27 8 71 4 and it weakened plunge pool width by 24 3 57 3 only under h 0 of 0 3 0 9 m but for h 0 of 1 2 m and q 0 of 4 8 m3 h 1 it improved the plunge pool width by 7 5 the energy consumption of jet flow showed the closest relationship with plunge pool morphology the concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effect on plunge pool morphology than h 0 this study is helpful to deepen the understanding of gully erosion mechanism and provide scientific reference for the design of gully erosion prevention and control measures keywords gully erosion plunge pool erosion headcut retreat morphology evolution energy consumption 1 introduction soil erosion is a worldwide ecological environment problem and an important manifestation of land degradation gully erosion can contribute 10 94 of total sediment yield caused by water erosion poesen et al 2003 inevitably gully erosion also can cause lots of serious damages and adverse influences such as devouring the high quality fertile farmlands damaging infrastructures improving the hydrological and sediment connectivity of the basin and increasing the sediment transport ratio of the basin heckmann et al 2018 it is noteworthy that gully headcut erosion has been recognized as the primary process of gully erosion including headcut migration and plunge pool erosion and was usually the main contributor to sediment yield of gully erosion oostwoud wijdenes et al 2000 oostwoud wijdenes and bryan 2001 gómez gutiérrez et al 2014 some previous studies also suggested that gully headcut erosion is a critical scientific issue that needs to be strengthened in the field of soil erosion e g vanmaercke et al 2016 zhang 2020 gully headcut erosion involves a variety of sub processes of staggered superposition and interaction mainly including tension fissure development pore water pressure change on wall flow erosion plunge pool erosion and mass failure these sub processes play important roles in controlling the development of headcut erosion and contribute to soil loss and morphology at different degrees collison 2001 wells et al 2009a su et al 2014 vanmaercke et al 2016 however most of the studies on these sub processes are in the stage of theoretical analysis and statistical analysis of monitoring data and their influencing mechanism is still rarely explored gully headcut erosion is affected by many factors such as topography land use climate soil vegetation and so on with respect of topography most of studies focused on the relationship between slope s and catchment area a s a ab and some progress also has been made in the change in value of a and b with influencing factors wu cheng 2005 claudio et al 2006 cheng et al 2006 torri and poesen 2014 plant coverage is a common vegetation parameter that is used to evaluate the influence of vegetation on sheet soil erosion however in fact the influence of vegetation on headcut erosion mainly depends on root architecture and its density and distribution in soil layers vannoppen et al 2015 vanmaercke et al 2016 at present there is still some controversy about the influence of land use on gully erosion initiation vandekerckhove et al 2001 it is highly recommended that more attention should be paid to the role of root system in controlling headcut erosion when studying the influence of land use and vegetation on gully erosion vanmaercke et al 2016 guo et al 2019 soil properties such as soil physical and chemical properties vertical joints soluble mineral content geotechnical properties soil layer structures also have been proven to significantly affect gully head migration gully wall collapse and the topographic criticality of gully erosion initiation vanwalleghem et al 2003 sanchis et al 2008 torri and poesen 2014 climate is also an important factor affecting gully erosion previous studies mainly focused on the critical precipitation and runoff initiating gully erosion ionita 2006 rodzik et al 2009 moeyersons et al 2015 but the great difference in critical values under different erosion environment conditions especially in the high latitude cold cool area the gully headcut erosion is affected by the interaction of freeze thaw cycle snowmelt and rainfall wu et al 2008 liu et al 2013 li et al 2016 xu et al 2019 and thus the activation mechanism is more complex from the point view of gully erosion study method most of the current studies were conducted by remote sensing image interpretation real time monitoring and meta analysis based on published literature data to analyze the gully erosion changes during a given temporal spatial scales as a result we just obtained the changes in gully erosion amount and morphological parameters in a certain historical period and the change is the result of the interaction of various factors guo et al 2019 however the influencing mechanism of these factors during headcut erosion is not yet known and the gully erosion process under real ground conditions also involves a lot of influencing factors and is very complicated therefore it is urgent to carry out factors controlled experiments to clarify their influencing mechanism and contributions to gully erosion although soil erosion due to head cut migration can contribute the most of soil loss soil loss as a result of head cut migration and plunge pool erosion was not explicitly addressed in some frequently used soil erosion models since 1990s some researchers began to try to develop some empirical headcut erosion models considering soil properties jet flow energy jet shear stress and headwall collapse or some theoretical models based on mechanic principle mass conservation energy conservation laws e g de ploey 1989 robinson hanson 1994 temple and moore 1997 alonso et al 2002 prasad römkens 2003 rengers tucker 2014 whereas these models were not popularly applied in previous studies the main reasons are that 1 these models are available only under some limited conditions alonso et al 2002 and 2 these models highly generalized these complex sub processes of headcut erosion leading to the idealization of these real sub processes hanson et al 2001 as we know the formation of headcut is the main cause of the complicated erosion processes the concentrated flow would be separated into jet flow and on wall flow when it passes the edge of headwall and then the jet flow dominates the plunge pool erosion and the on wall flow causes the headwall erosion involving water erosion and mass failure zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the water erosion and headwall collapse induced by on wall flow would affect the plunge pool erosion process however the proportions of on wall flow and jet flow to total flow volume and their response to flow discharge and headwall height the contribution of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow to total soil loss and the influence of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool morphology were not clear more importantly the lack of solutions to these problems is detrimental to the revelation of the hydrodynamic mechanism of gully headcut erosion and the establishment of a process based gully erosion model therefore we hypothesized that the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow at the edge of headwall were affected by flow discharge upstream from drainage area and headwall height and further influence soil loss of gully heads and the development of plunge pool morphology therefore we designed three types of controlled experiments including jet flow experiment on wall flow was separated on wall flow experiment jet flow was separated and the mixed flow experiment the flow was not separated under different gully head height and flow discharge conditions to verify our hypothesis the three specific objectives of this study are 1 to clarify the proportions of on wall flow and jet flow and its response to flow discharge and headwall height during gully headcut erosion 2 to quantify the soil loss contributions of jet flow on wall flow and their interaction and 3 to elucidate the influence of on wall flow erosion and jet properties on the development of plunge pool morphology this study is helpful to reveal the dynamic mechanism of gully erosion establish gully erosion model and provide scientific basis for the design and application of gully erosion prevention measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental flume set up this study was conducted in the xifeng soil and water conservation experimental station that is located in the nanxiaohegou watershed 35 41 35 44 n 107 30 107 37 e a typical gully dominated watershed on the loess plateau china the experiment was conducted in a 6 5 m long and 1 5 m wide cement flume under simulated inflow scouring conditions fig 1 a all experiments were completed from may to september in 2019 and from may to september in 2020 the cement flume consists of flat upstream area vertical headwall and gully bed the preliminary investigation showed that the widths and heights of gully heads varied in ranges of 2 51 m and 3 37 m respectively and the range of breadth height ratio is 0 75 5 67 che 2012 given the fact that the natural and real gully heads of such a large dimension cannot be simulated in soil flumes we select to reduce the size but keep a reasonable breadth height ratio at last the length of upstream area and gully bed is designed as 5 0 m and 1 5 m respectively and their slope was designed as 3 the height of vertical gully headwall is set as 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m implying the breadth height ratio 1 25 5 0 is within the real situation therefore a total of four experimental flumes with four headwall heights were used in this study the flume boundary was constructed in strict accordance with designed plot dimension using cement and bricks a 0 6 m long and 0 5 m depth steady flow pool including the cobblestone 3 5 cm in diameter and water energy dissipation structure with two cement baffles 0 3 m and 0 4 m height guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 was set at the upstream top of the flume the energy dissipation structure can almost consume the water energy so that the water will gradually overflow from the steady flow pool and flow into the upstream area at almost zero energy when clear water was pumped into the steady flow pool fig 1a the flow discharge was controlled by two adjustable intake valves and monitored by an electromagnetic flowmeter to facilitate the experiments and avoid the effects of natural rain wind and sunshine on experimental schedule and operation a moveable tent length 8 0 m width 3 0 m and height 4 0 m was installed around the plot fig 1b the experiment was subjected to five upstream flow discharge q of 3 0 3 6 4 8 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 which was designed as according to the rain intensity drainage area upstream gully heads and rain duration in the loess plateau the specific design is as following the average rainfall intensity i with different recurrence intervals could be calculated by eq 1 which was proposed by zhang et al 1983 according to a statistical analysis of 1710 typical rainstorm events in the study area 1 i 5 09 n 0 379 t 1 4 0 74 where i is the average rainfall intensity during t minutes mm min 1 n is the recurrence interval of heavy rainfall yr and t is the rainfall duration min jiao et al 1999 concluded that the a type rainstorm with a rainfall duration of 30 to 180 minis the most common rainfall type on the loess plateau and can cause more serious soil erosion than other types of rainstorms thus we selected the extreme case 180 min rainfall duration and then the recurrence interval of rainstorms was selected as 1 10 years the flow discharge calculated by eq 2 ranged from 3 12 to 7 49 m3 h 1 and thus we selected the five levels 3 0 3 6 4 8 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 from the calculated range 2 q 60 λ a i d w where q is the flow discharge m3 h 1 a is the drainage area upstream of the gully head km2 and ranges from 0 15 km2 to 8 7 km2 in this study region w is the width of gully heads km d is the flume width 1 5 m and λ is the runoff coefficient and is equal to 0 167 in this study region based on standard runoff plots li et al 2006 2 2 soil bed preparation the soil used in this study was chosen to represent textural composition and are commonly found in the gully dominated watershed in the loess plateau before soil bed preparation several basic soil properties were measured as a reference for soil filling operation the mean clay silt and sand content are 26 8 31 5 and 41 7 respectively according to the usda standard the soil bulk density organic matter content and stable infiltration rate are 1 35 1 55 g cm 3 0 52 1 12 and 0 21 0 63 mm min 1 respectively to ensure uniform soil bed conditions all above ground grass biomass roots and debris were removed during the establishment of four soil flumes based on the investigated soil bulk density the bulk density was controlled at 1 35 g cm 3 in 0 10 cm 1 45 g cm 3 in 10 30 cm layer and 1 55 g cm 3 in 30 cm layers the soil was back filled in the plot in 10 cm thick layers in the course of filling the flumes each soil layer was tamped to ensure consistency and the soil surface was raked between layers to promote cohesion between layers guo et al 2019 the soil bulk density of gully bed was also controlled at 1 55 g cm 3 the mass soil moisture was kept approximately at 15 during soil filling process and thus the required soil amount in each 10 cm layer was calculated and weighted and then filled in the flume after packing the soil to a design depth 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m a watering pot was used to spray the soil surface until surface runoff was generated then the plot was covered with a plastic sheet to prevent soil moisture evaporation and allowed to stand for 24 h in this study it took 20 days from the completion of soil loading to the start of the experiment the same amount of sprayed water 10 l was carried out in each filled soil flume at a 5 days interval for a total of 4 times the sprayed operation can prevent the filled topsoil in the flume from drying out quickly produce better cohesion between the soil layers and also ensure the similar initial soil moisture among different soil flumes after 20 days of soil filling in flume the measured soil bulk density organic matter content and stable infiltration rate in the soil flume are 1 36 1 56 g cm 3 0 47 1 03 and 0 24 0 61 mm min 1 respectively which is basically close to that of the investigated undisturbed soil given the fact that approximately 63 of the total runoff volume is generated from upstream flat drainage area 0 5 and this runoff can initiate gully headcut erosion that contributes 86 3 of the total soil loss in the loess tableland and gully area of the loess plateau guo et al 2019 we can judge that the upstream area is the landscape position that mainly provides the most of runoff causing gully headcut erosion and only contributes little soil loss therefore we generalized the upstream area as a thin soil layer that was not eroded by water as a result a 0 01 m non erodible soil surface layer with 1 35 g cm 3 soil bulk density was designed and placed on the filling soil layers to ensure that the sediment concentrate of upstream flows passed the edge of headwall was close to zero and then transformed to jet flow and on wall flow this treatment also can ensure the separation of the flow upstream gully head is only controlled by experimental conditions flow discharges and headwall heights the non erodible layer consisted of a 5 2 mixture of soil and cement according to the method proposed by wells et al 2013 and qin et al 2018 the non erodible layer was subjected to a 15 mm h 1 rainfall until the surface runoff and little puddles occurred about 30 min and then a fan was employed to force air over surface for curing the non erodible layer 2 3 device installation for the separation and measurement of jet flow and on wall flow this study includes three sub experiments jet flow experiment jf on wall flow experiment of and the mixed flow experiment jet flow and on wall flow are not separated mf for completing our study objectives the jf means the on wall flow was separated from the flow at headwall position to study the effects of jet flow fig 2 a the of means the jet flow was separated from the flow at the edge of headwall to investigate the effects of on wall flow fig 2b for the jf a u shaped steel flume was embedded in the headwall soil to collect on wall flow fig 2a three fine steel needles were embedded in the headwall soil at the bottom of the u shaped flume to stabilize the flume the inside depth outside depth width of the flume and the width embedding into headwall are 5 cm 4 cm 3 cm and 2 cm respectively fig 2a the left and right ends of the flume are 2 cm and 10 cm away from the edge of headwall which can ensure the slope of 3 between the flume and horizontal level to drain away the separated on wall flow the area between flume and the edge of headwall was also set as the non erodible layer to prevent on wall flow from eroding headwall soil another flume with same size was installed along the plot boundary wall to drain the separated on wall flow into the sampling bucket fig 2a simultaneously the separated jet flow scoured the gully bed and then the runoff and sediment process at the bottom of gully bed was monitored and collected by using sampling buckets this treatment can ensure that the on wall flow can be completely collected without affecting the erosion process of jet flow so it is highly consistent with the real ground situation for the of a rectangular flow collected flume and its steel support frame were firstly installed in front of headwall the spacing between headwall and the flow collected flume kept at a short distance approximately 3 5 cm to ensure that the flow collected flume did not affect the on wall flow scouring headwall soils and also can collect all separated jet flow the dimension of the rectangular flow collected separated flume is 1 48 m width 0 5 m length 0 2 m depth and another rectangular flow drained flume with 10 cm 10 cm of width and depth was welded in the center of flow collected flume for draining the separated jet flow the height of steel support frame could be adjusted from 0 3 m to 0 9 m for the experiments of different headwall heights the sampling buckets were also placed under the bottom of gully bed and flow drained flume to monitor runoff and sediment process and the varied process of jet flow discharge respectively the mf means that no any device was installed to separate the flow from upstream area the implementation of mf under same experimental conditions with jf and of is to detect the effects of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow on soil loss and the effects of on wall flow on plunge pool morphology 2 4 experimental procedure before the formal experiments the flow discharge was firstly adjusted to the five designed flow discharge a water supply system consisting of a pump pipes valve groups an electromagnetic flowmeter and a pressure gauge was used to supply water for the flow steady pool of the experimental flume the designed flow discharges can be obtained by adjusting valve groups and monitoring with electromagnetic flowmeter in the water supply system the clear water after energy dissipation by the water drop structure in the flow steady pool overflowed gradually the flow steady pool and then entered the upstream area the flow velocity apparatus ls300 a relative error less than 1 5 was employed to measure the flow velocity at the edge of headwall v j and the flow velocity outside of the plunge pool v p with 5 8 times at 2 minute interval meanwhile the flow depth and width at upstream area and gully bed were measured by using a steel rule 1 mm accuracy during the jf and of experiments the on wall flow discharge and jet flow discharge were monitored by sampling buckets respectively and for the three sub experiments the runoff and sediment samples at the bottom of gully bed were collected by sampling buckets at 2 minute intervals the runoff and sediment samples were weighed and dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h then reweighed for calculating soil loss rate for jf and mf experiments the plunge pool developed at the gully bed due to jet flow erosion and the width w and depth d of plunge pool were measured using the steel rule with 1 mm accuracy at 2 minute intervals during experiments the water temperature was captured during experiments at 2 minute intervals to calculate water viscosity coefficient υ a total of 60 experiments 3 treatments 4 headwall heights 5 flow discharges were conducted in this study 2 5 parameter calculation the parameters describing jet flow properties include jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut v b flow velocity entry to plunge pool v e jet entry angle θe and jet shear stress τj and they are calculated according to previous studies as following alonso et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 the sketch for illustrating jet flow property parameters at

flow discharge m3 s 1 α is the proportion of jet flow during jf and of experiments and listed in table 1 2 6 data analysis and figure plotting the linear and non linear regression analysis was employed to determine the relationships among flow discharge gully head height jet flow properties soil loss amount and plunge pool morphology the pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations among plunge pool morphology and jet flow properties the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test extend fast was employed to calculate the sensitivity index si of flow discharge q 0 and headwall height h 0 by using the fast99 function in the r package sensitivity saltelli et al 1999 which can judge which factor flow discharge or gully head height is more sensitive to soil loss amount and plunge pool dimension by jet flow on wall flow and their interaction the data statistical analysis was carried out in spss software version 16 0 and r software version 3 6 3 the figure plotting was conducted by using origin software version 2020 adobe illustrator cc version 2018 and powerpoint software version 2016 3 results 3 1 proportion of jet flow and on wall flow table 1 shows the volume and proportion of jet flow and on wall flow under jf and of experiments with different flow discharge and gully head height conditions the volume and proportion of on wall flow under jf experiment condition were 0 9 10 9 and 0 07 10 1 times higher than those under of experiment condition respectively on average the differences in the volume and proportion between jf and of experiments was less 5 indicating the jf and of experiments were reliable in the study for separating jet flow and on wall flow under the same flow discharge condition the difference in jet flow or on wall flow volume was small among different gully head heights indicating the gully head height slightly affected the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow the on wall flow volume v o ranged from 330 to 563 l and linearly increased with the increasing flow discharge r 2 0 996 p 0 01 but the proportion of on wall flow p o 15 7 22 6 to the total flow volume decreased with the flow discharge as a power function r 2 0 996 p 0 01 the volume v j and proportion p j of jet flow were 1131 3014 l and 77 43 84 27 respectively which increased with the flow discharge as a linear and logarithmic function respectively r 2 0 992 0 999 p 0 01 3 2 contributions of jet flow and on wall flow to soil loss fig 4 illustrates the changes in soil loss amount caused by jet flow on wall flow and the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow with flow discharge under different gully head height conditions for the jf experiments fig 4a the soil loss amount caused by jet flow syj increased with flow discharge as two power functions for gully head height of 0 3 m and 1 2 m but it linearly increased with flow discharge increasing under 0 6 m and 0 9 m gully head heights table 2 furthermore the syj increased with gully head height as two power functions for the flow discharge of 3 0 and 3 6 m3 h 1 but it increased exponentially with gully head height for the other flow discharges table 3 consequently an empirical model eq 12 involving flow discharge q 0 and gully head height h 0 could estimate syj well with the high coefficient of determination 0 966 furthermore the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test extend fast showed the sensitivity index of q 0 and h 0 is 0 25 and 0 73 indicating that h 0 is the more sensitive factor affecting soil loss caused by jet flow than q 0 fig 4b similarly for the of experiments fig 4c the soil loss amount caused by on wall flow sy o increased by 0 82 1 76 times when gully head height increased from 0 3 m to 1 2 m and the power linear and exponential functions could express the relationship between syo and gully head height table 3 with the increase of flow discharge the on wall flow volume also increased table 1 and it also caused the increase of syo when the gully head height is 0 3 m and 1 2 m the syo logarithmically and linearly increased with flow discharge respectively but it increased with flow discharge as two power functions for 0 6 m and 0 9 m gully head heights table 2 like the syj the syo also could be expressed by the eq 13 with a same form of eq 12 the extend fast indicated that the q 0 had slightly larger effect on syo than h 0 fig 4d further by comparing the parameters in the two equations we found the sensitive of syo to flow discharge was higher than syj but the gully head height showed a higher effect on syj than syo fig 4e shows the change of soil loss amount caused by the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow syinter with flow discharge and gully head height regression analysis showed the syinter logarithmically increased with flow discharge except for 0 9 m gully head height r 2 0 946 0 985 under the same flow discharge condition the syinter increased by 1 09 1 93 times with the gully head height increasing from 0 3 m to 1 2 m however only when flow discharge is less than 6 0 m3 h 1 the syinter is a significant power or exponential function of gully head height furthermore the syinter can be estimated by a composite function of flow discharge and gully head height eq 14 however the extend fast found that the syinter showed a weak sensitivity to q 0 and was mainly affected by h 0 fig 4f 12 sy j 6 623 q 0 0 643 â exp 1 041 h 0 r 2 0 966 p 0 01 n 20 13 sy o 3 615 q 0 0 876 â exp 0 732 h 0 r 2 0 974 p 0 01 n 20 14 sy inter 0 865 1 554 l n q 0 2 283 â exp 0 982 h 0

head height conditions the proportion of soil loss by jet flow to total soil loss pj was 49 1 56 1 53 4 59 4 51 9 53 8 55 8 59 5 respectively under 0 3 m 0 6 m 0 9 m and 1 2 m gully head height condition the pj showed a relatively small change with flow discharge increasing and it also fluctuated with gully head height increasing the proportion of soil loss by on wall flow to total soil loss

pj po pinter ranged from 4 3 1 to 4 4 2 1 with the averaged ratio of 4 6 3 1 implying that the jet flow contributed the most of soil loss and the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow only caused the 11 6 of the total soil loss 3 3 plunge pool morphology 3 3 1 plunge pool width fig 6 shows the similar evolution process of plunge pool width wj by jet flow among different gully head height and flow discharge conditions overall the wj rapidly increased in the initial 8 min and then gradually increased to a stable state after 24 min several fluctuates occurred during the evolution of plunge pool which was mainly attributed to the situation that the headwall soil was eroded and then deposited around the plunge pool with the development of plunge pool the dynamic balance between soil detachment and sediment transport occurred implying that the morphology of plunge pool would keep a relatively stable state further analysis showed the temporal change in wj could be expressed by a series of logarithmic functions table 4 r2 0 889 0 994 however the temporal change of the plunge pool width by jet flow and on wall flow wm showed the stronger fluctuation than that by jet flow fig 6 especially for the experiment under 1 2 m gully head height the wm exhibited a drastic fluctuation during 10 20 min this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the eroded soil from gully headwall by on wall flow was imported into plunge pool and then affected jet flow erosion process especially the headwall failure would form a sudden effect on plunge pool after 24 min the width of plunge pool gradually stabilized in most cases the wm increased logarithmically with experimental time table 4 r2 0 379 0 962 in comparison the greater r 2 was found in wj than wm table 4 further indicating the on wall flow erosion process does affect the evolution process of plunge pool width after 30 min experiment concluded with the low flow discharge increasing from 3 0 to 7 2 m3 h 1 the wj gradually increased from low values of 23 4 24 7 27 0 and 31 0 cm to high values of 31 0 38 0 40 7 and 44 3 cm under gully head height of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively fig 7 for each gully head height the wj increased exponentially with the increase of flow discharge wj a exp b q 0 a 18 73 24 79 b 0 070 0 093 r 2 0 889 0 990 under the flow discharge of 3 0 3 6 and 4 8 m3 h 1 the wj increased exponentially with the increase of gully head height r 2 0 884 0 961 but it increased logarithmically with the increase of gully head height under 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 r 2 0 995 and 0 993 for the mf experiments the plunge pool width wm ranged from 10 0 to 46 0 cm and it exponentially increased with flow discharge wm a exp b q 0 a 7 91 17 79 b 0 099 0 16 r 2 0 919 0 991 as well as the gully head height wm a exp b h 0 a 6 79 11 44 b 0 94 1 14 r 2 0 926 0 992 non linear regression analysis showed that the wj and wm could be estimated by two composite functions of flow discharge and gully head height eqs 15 and 16 furthermore the extend fast showed that the si of q 0 and h 0 is 0 38 and 0 62 respectively under jf condition and it is 0 75 and 0 23 respectively under mf condition which indicating that h 0 had the greater effect on the plunge pool width but q 0 showed a greater effect under mf condition 15 w j 22 43 â h 0 0 212 â exp 0 084 q 0 r 2 0 954 p 0 01 16 w m 4 509 â exp 1 129 h 0 0 134 q 0 r 2 0 975 p 0 01 the difference in plunge pool width between jf and mf experiments was compared to clear the effect of on wall flow fig 7 the plunge pool width caused by the combination of jet flow and on wall flow were 48 0 57 3 32 3 51 4 and 24 3 44 4 less than those caused by jet flow under gully head height of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m respectively and the difference decreased with the increase of flow discharge indicating the effect of on wall flow on plunge pool width gradually decreased with the flow discharge increased notably when gully head height is 1 2 m and flow discharge is larger than 4 8 m3 h 1 the plunge pool width under mf was larger than that under jf indicating the presence of on wall flow promoted the development of plunge pool width and increased it by 7 5 on average 3 3 2 plunge pool depth the temporal change in the plunge pool depth d under jf and mf conditions is shown in the fig 8 for the jf experiments overall the depth by jet flow dj rapidly increased in the first 10 min and then trended to stable state however for the mf experiments under same conditions with jf the developed process of plunge pool depth dm showed the stronger fluctuation than jf experiments moreover the larger flow discharge and gully head height intensified the fluctuation of change process of plunge pool depth in fact without the effect of on wall flow erosion on plunge pool the dynamic change of plunge pool depth was mainly depended on the dynamic change in energy consumption of jet flow in plunge pool with the increase of plunge pool depth the energy consumption of jet flow also increased gradually and the depth would stabilize when the energy consumption reaches to the extremum however for the mf experiments the development of plunge pool was also affected by on wall flow erosion the soil loss of gully headwall caused by on wall flow and splashed water drops from plunge pool would enter into plunge pool and further change the energy consumption process of jet flow in plunge pool and the random soil failures of gully head also aggravated the fluctuation degree in the developmental process of plunge pool depth for the 90 of cases the temporal variation in dj and dm could be expressed by a series of logarithmic functions table 5 r2 0 345 0 970 and judged from the values of the coefficient of determination r 2 the dm showed the relatively weaker relationships with time than dj due to the effects of on wall flow erosion after 30 min jf experiment concluded with the flow discharge increased from 3 0 to 7 2 m3 h 1 the dj increased from the lowest values of 14 15 2 16 5 and 19 cm to the highest values of 20 22 3 26 and 28 cm when the gully headwall height is 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively fig 9 for each head height the relationship between dj and flow discharge can be expressed by an exponential function dj a exp b q 0 a 11 05 15 16 b 0 082 0 11 r 2 0 890 0 986 and similarly a series exponential functions also can reveal the relationship between d j and gully headwall height dj a exp b h 0 a 12 52 17 85 b 0 33 0 42 r 2 0 944 0 995 however for the mf experiments the existence of on wall flow erosion not only impeded the development of plunge pool depth 4 20 cm but also changed the relationships between d m and flow discharge to logarithmic functions dm a ln q 0 b a 7 06 12 31 b 4 58 3 57 r 2 0 959 0 995 and with the increase of gully headwall height the increment of dm gradually decreased for each flow discharge further analysis indicated that the dj and dm could be estimated by two composite functions of flow discharge and gully headwall height eqs 17 and 18 furthermore the greater si 0 54 of h 0 than that 0 46 of q 0 under jf condition indicated that the headwall height had the stronger impact on depth however the on wall flow erosion completely changed this situation and the si of q 0 and h 0 is 0 83 and 0 15 respectively fully indicating the q 0 mainly dominated the development of plunge pool depth under mf condition 17 d j 9 721 â exp 0 379 h 0 0 088 q 0 r 2 0 960 p 0 01 18 d m 1 535 q 0 0 688 â 1 085 l n h 0 3 184 r 2 0 943 p 0 01 the dm were reduced by 40 0 71 4 31 0 44 7 27 8 33 5 and 28 6 52 6 compared to dj when gully headwall height is 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively and the decrease in plunge pool depth decreased with the flow discharge increased indicating that larger flow discharge would weaken the effect of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool depth which was basically consistent with the effect of on wall flow on plunge pool width fig 7 in addition we found the ratio of width to depth ranged from 1 38 to 1 70 with the average value of 1 57 under jet flow condition but it increased to 1 33 2 89 with an average of 1 79 due to the presence of on wall flow erosion which also further indicated that the effect of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool depth was higher than the width 3 4 relationships plunge pool morphology and jet flow properties for the jf and mf experiments the plunge pool width and depth showed the significant correlation with jet properties except for jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut p 0 01 table 6 of which the energy consumption of jet flow showed the strongest correlation with plunge pool morphology followed by jet shear stress flow velocity entry to plunge pool and jet entry angle this also further indicated energy consumption of jet flow is a determined factor influencing the development of plunge pool morphology during headcut erosion regression analysis revealed that the w j and w m linearly increased with the increase of energy consumption fig 10 a p 0 01 notably the slope of fitted line 1 637 under mf was nearly 2 times that under jf and the w m would excess w j when energy consumption is larger than 21 90 j s 1 implying the presence of on wall accelerated the development of plunge pool width in addition the d j also linearly increased with the increase of energy consumption but d m increased with energy consumption by a power function fig 10b which indicated that the d j would always be greater than d m under same energy consumption and also cleared the fact that the on wall flow erosion could greatly weakened the effect of energy consumption of jet flow on the development of plunge pool depth 4 discussion our result showed that the on wall flow volume linearly increased with the increasing flow discharge and its proportion to the total flow volume 15 7 22 6 decreased with the flow discharge as a power function however the volume and proportion of jet flow increased with the flow discharge as a linear and logarithmic function respectively this was basically consistent with the conclusion of chen et al 2013 who studied the effect of jet flow and on wall flow on collapse of gully heads under real ground situations and found the p o also decreased with flow discharge increasing fully demonstrating that our experimental results are consistent with the changing law of the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow under real ground condition and so this result can be used for reference as a basis for the size design of gully head protection engineering measures furthermore we found that in their studies the p o can reach up to 56 8 when flow discharge was less than 0 25 m3 h 1 which is much larger than the results of this study however the p o decreased from 26 3 to 9 3 when flow discharge increased from 0 51 to 2 5 m3 h 1 portending that the lower flow discharge could cause similar p o with our study this difference was mainly related to the flow discharge and hydraulic properties dias and tuck 1991 wiryanto 1999 dias and vanden broeck 2011 peng et al 2012 concluded that the froude number fr is equal to 0 015 and the reynold number is equal to 9500 are the critical conditions initiating the transformation of on wall flow to jet flow however dias and tuck 1991 stated that the turbulent degree of the flow is the main factor influencing the formation of the jet flow and on wall flow the on wall flow is easy to form at the gully head when fr is less than 1 and the jet flow would become the main flow type when fr is larger than 1 in addition the soil properties also affect the water soil interface tension and the runoff hydraulic characteristics and thus were expected to change the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow wang 2002 peng et al 2012 the formation of headcut generally derived from the step change in underlying surface elevation and it divides the concentrated flow into on wall flow and jet flow poesen et al 2003 guo et al 2019 the occurrence and migration of headcuts and the change in concentrated flow properties commonly lead to the obvious increase in soil loss römkens et al 1997 alonso et al 2002 however the sediment contributions of on wall flow and jet flow are not clear and not explicitly addressed in some gully erosion models renard et al 1991 nearing et al 1989 stein et al 1993 alonso et al 2002 zhao et al 2013 our study distinguished firstly and preliminarily the soil loss amounts caused by jet flow on wall flow and their interaction from total soil loss and found that the soil loss amount increased significantly with the increase of q 0 and h 0 fig 3 which deepened the understanding of the role of jet flow and on wall flow in controlling gully erosion the further analysis showed that the soil loss by jet flow had the higher sensitivity to h 0 than q 0 and the soil loss of on wall flow showed the opposite result fully indicating that the two critical influencing factors exhibited different effects on different sub processes of gully headcut erosion vanmaercke et al 2016 furthermore on average the jet flow on wall flow and their interaction can contribute 53 5 34 9 and 11 6 of total soil loss amount respectively which demonstrated that jet flow erosion contributed more than half of soil loss amount this is mainly because more than 70 of the flow volume upstream gully head is converted into jet flow table 1 which means that more energy of jet flow is consumed in soil detachment and transportation from plunge pool erosion zhang et al 2018 in addition we found that the larger flow discharge significantly improved the sediment contributions of on wall flow and but decreased the contribution of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow this is mainly due to the situation that the larger flow discharge caused the developed position of plunge pool away from headwall and thus the water drops from plunge pool only caused little effect on headwall erosion by on wall flow these results fully reveals that the serious gully erosion is mainly attributed to the fact that the gully head separated the concentrated flow as the jet flow and on wall flow which not only dominated the different sub processes of gully erosion but also contributes more soil loss than concentrated flow erosion valentin et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to pay attention to how to deal with the jet flow and on wall flow reasonably in the process of gully erosion prevention and control our study revealed that the rapid growth in the depth and width of plunge pool occurred in the 10 min initial period and then the dimensions of plunge pool developed slowly similar results were also found in some published works on rill and bank gully headcut erosion e g stein et al 1993 bennett and casalí 2001 zhang et al 2016 for example stein et al 1993 stated a more detailed result that the rate of plunge pool scour depth increased rapidly when the scour depth was less than 95 of the equilibrium depth furthermore in most of cases it was found that the plunge pool morphology width and depth increased logarithmically with experimental duration tables 4 5 this result was supported by rouse 1940 who suggested that the sour depth increased linearly with the log of the time however blaisdell et al 1981 confirmed the hyperbolic function has a computable scour depth and gives the best fit but unfortunately the scour depth may be reached the equilibrium only after extremely long times as a result the semi log relationship between scour depth and time was popularly preferred by many researchers rajaratnam 1981 alonso et al 2002 wells et al 2009a 2010 campo bescós et al 2013 although it indicated that the scour depth increased infinitely with time in a physical sense notably the plunge pool morphology retained a steady constant at the end of experiments figs 5 7 which was consistent with previous studies on rill and bank gully headcut erosion e g bennett 1999 bennett et al 2000 wells et al 2009a 2009b zhang et al 2016 and also further indicated that the development of plunge pool morphology entered into an equilibrium phase when the scour hole eroded to the point that the maximum jet shear stress of the diffused jet equals the critical shear stress of the gully bed soil a balance between the jet eroding forces and soil resistances alonso et al 2002 however in some cases the obvious fluctuation was found during the development of plunge pool morphology under mf experiments figs 5 7 implying that the presence of on wall flow erosion altered the evolution process of plunge pool morphology this was mainly attributed to the random headwall soil failure induced by on wall flow suddenly filling into the pool zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the narrower and deeper plunge pool width 10 46 cm depth 4 28 cm was developed in this study than those width 64 2 80 1 cm depth 5 6 8 1 cm in the study of zhang et al 2016 although the flow discharge and headwall height condition is similar between the two studies the difference was mainly caused by the difference in gully bed material the higher soil bulk density 1 73 g cm 3 and clay content 27 in the study of zhang et al 2016 than this study signified the lower soil erodibility and higher erosion resistance to jet flow guo et al 2018 2020 and thus the quicker lateral development of plunge pool is found in their study than this study in addition the final plunge pool morphology increased significantly with the increase of q0 and h0 eq 4 7 which was agreed with some previous studies e g bennett et al 2000 alonso et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 this result was also supported by a realistic theory predictive model involving mainly the unit flow discharge gully head height flow velocity at the brink point and gully bed materials of which the q0 and h0 is the main factors controlling the plunge pool erosion alonso et al 2002 the initial flow discharge and headwall height determined the jet properties entering plunge pool our result showed that the jet property parameters except for the jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut significantly influenced the development of plunge pool morphology of which the energy consumption of jet flow had the strongest correlation with plunge pool morphology and could be considered as the critical factor predicting plunge pool erosion several studies on gully and bank gully headcut erosion also obtained a similar conclusion e g su et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the great difference in the relationships between plunge pool morphology and energy consumption between jf and mf conditions fig 9 indicated that the on wall flow erosion would weaken the effect of energy consumption on scour depth but improve the effect on plunge pool width moreover the on wall flow erosion changed the sensitivity of plunge pool evolution to h0 and q0 and under real ground situation the concentrated flow discharge upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effects on plunge pool morphology than headwall height therefore the future study should consider how to regulate the concentrated flow in drainage area upstream gully heads to weaken gully erosion 5 limitations and significance of this study despite nearly a century of gully erosion studies gully erosion remains a poorly understand processes and dynamic mechanism which is important for the modelling and prediction of gully erosion and its prevention and control our study separated the jet flow and on wall flow through a series of simulated flow experiments combined with a self made separated device and clarified their influences on soil loss of gully heads and the morphological evolution of plunge pool however there are two potential limitations 1 the experimental design of this study was idealized and generated due to the complex effects of lots of factors on gully erosion so it is not on the same scale as the actual situations 2 it has not been confirmed how well the experimental results are in line with the actual ground results therefore further studies need to optimize the experimental design and verify the experimental results with the actual situations so that the study results can be practiced and applied under actual conditions although the earlier noted imperfection represents the limitation of our study we still clearly demonstrated the ratio of jet flow and on wall flow volume to total flow volume upstream gully head and further clarified their influences on soil loss of gully heads and morphological development of plunge pool during gully erosion process which is of great significance for deepening the understanding of the gully process and mechanism moreover to a certain extent it can also provide scientific basis for the establishment of process based gully erosion model and the design of gully erosion prevention measures 6 conclusion this study explored the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow and their influences on soil loss and plunge pool morphology during headcut erosion the proportion of on wall flow and jet flow is 15 7 22 6 and 77 4 84 3 of total flow respectively the jet flow erosion contributed the highest proportion of total soil loss 53 5 followed by on wall flow 34 9 and their interaction 11 6 the soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on wall flow was dominated by h 0 but q 0 had the greater effect on soil loss caused by on wall flow than h 0 the width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased under jet flow and the combination of jet flow and on wall flow condition the dimension of plunge pool was significantly enhanced by flow discharge and headwall height the on wall flow erosion weakened the plunge pool depth by 27 8 71 4 similarly the width was reduced by 24 3 57 3 under headwall height of 0 3 0 9 m but the on wall flow promoted plunge pool width by 7 5 when h 0 is 1 2 m and q 0 is larger than 4 8 m3 h 1 the on wall flow erosion can change the sensitivity of plunge pool evolution to h0 and q0 and the concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effects on plunge pool morphology under real ground situation the energy consumption of jet flow showed the strongest effect on the evolution of plunge pool morphology this study elucidated the importance role of jet flow and on wall flow in controlling gully headcut erosion and deepened the understanding of gully erosion processes and mechanism credit authorship

4504,gully headcut erosion is recognized as the primary process of gully erosion and is the main contributor to sediment yield of gully erosion however the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow induced by headcut and its effects on soil loss and plunge pool morphology are still unclear a simulated flow scouring experiment was conducted to explore the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow and their contributions to soil loss and the effect of on wall flow erosion on plunge pool morphology under different flow discharge q 0 3 0 7 2 m3 h 1 and headwall height h 0 0 3 1 2 m conditions our results showed that jet flow and on wall flow accounted 15 7 22 6 and 77 4 84 3 of total flow volume upstream headcut respectively jet flow on wall flow and their interaction contributed 53 5 34 9 and 11 6 of total soil loss amount respectively furthermore h 0 exhibited greater effect on soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on wall flow but the soil loss caused by on wall was mainly controlled by q 0 the width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased with scouring time and the q 0 and h 0 significantly affected the development of plunge pool morphology on wall flow reduced plunge pool depth by 27 8 71 4 and it weakened plunge pool width by 24 3 57 3 only under h 0 of 0 3 0 9 m but for h 0 of 1 2 m and q 0 of 4 8 m3 h 1 it improved the plunge pool width by 7 5 the energy consumption of jet flow showed the closest relationship with plunge pool morphology the concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effect on plunge pool morphology than h 0 this study is helpful to deepen the understanding of gully erosion mechanism and provide scientific reference for the design of gully erosion prevention and control measures keywords gully erosion plunge pool erosion headcut retreat morphology evolution energy consumption 1 introduction soil erosion is a worldwide ecological environment problem and an important manifestation of land degradation gully erosion can contribute 10 94 of total sediment yield caused by water erosion poesen et al 2003 inevitably gully erosion also can cause lots of serious damages and adverse influences such as devouring the high quality fertile farmlands damaging infrastructures improving the hydrological and sediment connectivity of the basin and increasing the sediment transport ratio of the basin heckmann et al 2018 it is noteworthy that gully headcut erosion has been recognized as the primary process of gully erosion including headcut migration and plunge pool erosion and was usually the main contributor to sediment yield of gully erosion oostwoud wijdenes et al 2000 oostwoud wijdenes and bryan 2001 gómez gutiérrez et al 2014 some previous studies also suggested that gully headcut erosion is a critical scientific issue that needs to be strengthened in the field of soil erosion e g vanmaercke et al 2016 zhang 2020 gully headcut erosion involves a variety of sub processes of staggered superposition and interaction mainly including tension fissure development pore water pressure change on wall flow erosion plunge pool erosion and mass failure these sub processes play important roles in controlling the development of headcut erosion and contribute to soil loss and morphology at different degrees collison 2001 wells et al 2009a su et al 2014 vanmaercke et al 2016 however most of the studies on these sub processes are in the stage of theoretical analysis and statistical analysis of monitoring data and their influencing mechanism is still rarely explored gully headcut erosion is affected by many factors such as topography land use climate soil vegetation and so on with respect of topography most of studies focused on the relationship between slope s and catchment area a s a ab and some progress also has been made in the change in value of a and b with influencing factors wu cheng 2005 claudio et al 2006 cheng et al 2006 torri and poesen 2014 plant coverage is a common vegetation parameter that is used to evaluate the influence of vegetation on sheet soil erosion however in fact the influence of vegetation on headcut erosion mainly depends on root architecture and its density and distribution in soil layers vannoppen et al 2015 vanmaercke et al 2016 at present there is still some controversy about the influence of land use on gully erosion initiation vandekerckhove et al 2001 it is highly recommended that more attention should be paid to the role of root system in controlling headcut erosion when studying the influence of land use and vegetation on gully erosion vanmaercke et al 2016 guo et al 2019 soil properties such as soil physical and chemical properties vertical joints soluble mineral content geotechnical properties soil layer structures also have been proven to significantly affect gully head migration gully wall collapse and the topographic criticality of gully erosion initiation vanwalleghem et al 2003 sanchis et al 2008 torri and poesen 2014 climate is also an important factor affecting gully erosion previous studies mainly focused on the critical precipitation and runoff initiating gully erosion ionita 2006 rodzik et al 2009 moeyersons et al 2015 but the great difference in critical values under different erosion environment conditions especially in the high latitude cold cool area the gully headcut erosion is affected by the interaction of freeze thaw cycle snowmelt and rainfall wu et al 2008 liu et al 2013 li et al 2016 xu et al 2019 and thus the activation mechanism is more complex from the point view of gully erosion study method most of the current studies were conducted by remote sensing image interpretation real time monitoring and meta analysis based on published literature data to analyze the gully erosion changes during a given temporal spatial scales as a result we just obtained the changes in gully erosion amount and morphological parameters in a certain historical period and the change is the result of the interaction of various factors guo et al 2019 however the influencing mechanism of these factors during headcut erosion is not yet known and the gully erosion process under real ground conditions also involves a lot of influencing factors and is very complicated therefore it is urgent to carry out factors controlled experiments to clarify their influencing mechanism and contributions to gully erosion although soil erosion due to head cut migration can contribute the most of soil loss soil loss as a result of head cut migration and plunge pool erosion was not explicitly addressed in some frequently used soil erosion models since 1990s some researchers began to try to develop some empirical headcut erosion models considering soil properties jet flow energy jet shear stress and headwall collapse or some theoretical models based on mechanic principle mass conservation energy conservation laws e g de ploey 1989 robinson hanson 1994 temple and moore 1997 alonso et al 2002 prasad römkens 2003 rengers tucker 2014 whereas these models were not popularly applied in previous studies the main reasons are that 1 these models are available only under some limited conditions alonso et al 2002 and 2 these models highly generalized these complex sub processes of headcut erosion leading to the idealization of these real sub processes hanson et al 2001 as we know the formation of headcut is the main cause of the complicated erosion processes the concentrated flow would be separated into jet flow and on wall flow when it passes the edge of headwall and then the jet flow dominates the plunge pool erosion and the on wall flow causes the headwall erosion involving water erosion and mass failure zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the water erosion and headwall collapse induced by on wall flow would affect the plunge pool erosion process however the proportions of on wall flow and jet flow to total flow volume and their response to flow discharge and headwall height the contribution of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow to total soil loss and the influence of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool morphology were not clear more importantly the lack of solutions to these problems is detrimental to the revelation of the hydrodynamic mechanism of gully headcut erosion and the establishment of a process based gully erosion model therefore we hypothesized that the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow at the edge of headwall were affected by flow discharge upstream from drainage area and headwall height and further influence soil loss of gully heads and the development of plunge pool morphology therefore we designed three types of controlled experiments including jet flow experiment on wall flow was separated on wall flow experiment jet flow was separated and the mixed flow experiment the flow was not separated under different gully head height and flow discharge conditions to verify our hypothesis the three specific objectives of this study are 1 to clarify the proportions of on wall flow and jet flow and its response to flow discharge and headwall height during gully headcut erosion 2 to quantify the soil loss contributions of jet flow on wall flow and their interaction and 3 to elucidate the influence of on wall flow erosion and jet properties on the development of plunge pool morphology this study is helpful to reveal the dynamic mechanism of gully erosion establish gully erosion model and provide scientific basis for the design and application of gully erosion prevention measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental flume set up this study was conducted in the xifeng soil and water conservation experimental station that is located in the nanxiaohegou watershed 35 41 35 44 n 107 30 107 37 e a typical gully dominated watershed on the loess plateau china the experiment was conducted in a 6 5 m long and 1 5 m wide cement flume under simulated inflow scouring conditions fig 1 a all experiments were completed from may to september in 2019 and from may to september in 2020 the cement flume consists of flat upstream area vertical headwall and gully bed the preliminary investigation showed that the widths and heights of gully heads varied in ranges of 2 51 m and 3 37 m respectively and the range of breadth height ratio is 0 75 5 67 che 2012 given the fact that the natural and real gully heads of such a large dimension cannot be simulated in soil flumes we select to reduce the size but keep a reasonable breadth height ratio at last the length of upstream area and gully bed is designed as 5 0 m and 1 5 m respectively and their slope was designed as 3 the height of vertical gully headwall is set as 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m implying the breadth height ratio 1 25 5 0 is within the real situation therefore a total of four experimental flumes with four headwall heights were used in this study the flume boundary was constructed in strict accordance with designed plot dimension using cement and bricks a 0 6 m long and 0 5 m depth steady flow pool including the cobblestone 3 5 cm in diameter and water energy dissipation structure with two cement baffles 0 3 m and 0 4 m height guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 was set at the upstream top of the flume the energy dissipation structure can almost consume the water energy so that the water will gradually overflow from the steady flow pool and flow into the upstream area at almost zero energy when clear water was pumped into the steady flow pool fig 1a the flow discharge was controlled by two adjustable intake valves and monitored by an electromagnetic flowmeter to facilitate the experiments and avoid the effects of natural rain wind and sunshine on experimental schedule and operation a moveable tent length 8 0 m width 3 0 m and height 4 0 m was installed around the plot fig 1b the experiment was subjected to five upstream flow discharge q of 3 0 3 6 4 8 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 which was designed as according to the rain intensity drainage area upstream gully heads and rain duration in the loess plateau the specific design is as following the average rainfall intensity i with different recurrence intervals could be calculated by eq 1 which was proposed by zhang et al 1983 according to a statistical analysis of 1710 typical rainstorm events in the study area 1 i 5 09 n 0 379 t 1 4 0 74 where i is the average rainfall intensity during t minutes mm min 1 n is the recurrence interval of heavy rainfall yr and t is the rainfall duration min jiao et al 1999 concluded that the a type rainstorm with a rainfall duration of 30 to 180 minis the most common rainfall type on the loess plateau and can cause more serious soil erosion than other types of rainstorms thus we selected the extreme case 180 min rainfall duration and then the recurrence interval of rainstorms was selected as 1 10 years the flow discharge calculated by eq 2 ranged from 3 12 to 7 49 m3 h 1 and thus we selected the five levels 3 0 3 6 4 8 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 from the calculated range 2 q 60 λ a i d w where q is the flow discharge m3 h 1 a is the drainage area upstream of the gully head km2 and ranges from 0 15 km2 to 8 7 km2 in this study region w is the width of gully heads km d is the flume width 1 5 m and λ is the runoff coefficient and is equal to 0 167 in this study region based on standard runoff plots li et al 2006 2 2 soil bed preparation the soil used in this study was chosen to represent textural composition and are commonly found in the gully dominated watershed in the loess plateau before soil bed preparation several basic soil properties were measured as a reference for soil filling operation the mean clay silt and sand content are 26 8 31 5 and 41 7 respectively according to the usda standard the soil bulk density organic matter content and stable infiltration rate are 1 35 1 55 g cm 3 0 52 1 12 and 0 21 0 63 mm min 1 respectively to ensure uniform soil bed conditions all above ground grass biomass roots and debris were removed during the establishment of four soil flumes based on the investigated soil bulk density the bulk density was controlled at 1 35 g cm 3 in 0 10 cm 1 45 g cm 3 in 10 30 cm layer and 1 55 g cm 3 in 30 cm layers the soil was back filled in the plot in 10 cm thick layers in the course of filling the flumes each soil layer was tamped to ensure consistency and the soil surface was raked between layers to promote cohesion between layers guo et al 2019 the soil bulk density of gully bed was also controlled at 1 55 g cm 3 the mass soil moisture was kept approximately at 15 during soil filling process and thus the required soil amount in each 10 cm layer was calculated and weighted and then filled in the flume after packing the soil to a design depth 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m a watering pot was used to spray the soil surface until surface runoff was generated then the plot was covered with a plastic sheet to prevent soil moisture evaporation and allowed to stand for 24 h in this study it took 20 days from the completion of soil loading to the start of the experiment the same amount of sprayed water 10 l was carried out in each filled soil flume at a 5 days interval for a total of 4 times the sprayed operation can prevent the filled topsoil in the flume from drying out quickly produce better cohesion between the soil layers and also ensure the similar initial soil moisture among different soil flumes after 20 days of soil filling in flume the measured soil bulk density organic matter content and stable infiltration rate in the soil flume are 1 36 1 56 g cm 3 0 47 1 03 and 0 24 0 61 mm min 1 respectively which is basically close to that of the investigated undisturbed soil given the fact that approximately 63 of the total runoff volume is generated from upstream flat drainage area 0 5 and this runoff can initiate gully headcut erosion that contributes 86 3 of the total soil loss in the loess tableland and gully area of the loess plateau guo et al 2019 we can judge that the upstream area is the landscape position that mainly provides the most of runoff causing gully headcut erosion and only contributes little soil loss therefore we generalized the upstream area as a thin soil layer that was not eroded by water as a result a 0 01 m non erodible soil surface layer with 1 35 g cm 3 soil bulk density was designed and placed on the filling soil layers to ensure that the sediment concentrate of upstream flows passed the edge of headwall was close to zero and then transformed to jet flow and on wall flow this treatment also can ensure the separation of the flow upstream gully head is only controlled by experimental conditions flow discharges and headwall heights the non erodible layer consisted of a 5 2 mixture of soil and cement according to the method proposed by wells et al 2013 and qin et al 2018 the non erodible layer was subjected to a 15 mm h 1 rainfall until the surface runoff and little puddles occurred about 30 min and then a fan was employed to force air over surface for curing the non erodible layer 2 3 device installation for the separation and measurement of jet flow and on wall flow this study includes three sub experiments jet flow experiment jf on wall flow experiment of and the mixed flow experiment jet flow and on wall flow are not separated mf for completing our study objectives the jf means the on wall flow was separated from the flow at headwall position to study the effects of jet flow fig 2 a the of means the jet flow was separated from the flow at the edge of headwall to investigate the effects of on wall flow fig 2b for the jf a u shaped steel flume was embedded in the headwall soil to collect on wall flow fig 2a three fine steel needles were embedded in the headwall soil at the bottom of the u shaped flume to stabilize the flume the inside depth outside depth width of the flume and the width embedding into headwall are 5 cm 4 cm 3 cm and 2 cm respectively fig 2a the left and right ends of the flume are 2 cm and 10 cm away from the edge of headwall which can ensure the slope of 3 between the flume and horizontal level to drain away the separated on wall flow the area between flume and the edge of headwall was also set as the non erodible layer to prevent on wall flow from eroding headwall soil another flume with same size was installed along the plot boundary wall to drain the separated on wall flow into the sampling bucket fig 2a simultaneously the separated jet flow scoured the gully bed and then the runoff and sediment process at the bottom of gully bed was monitored and collected by using sampling buckets this treatment can ensure that the on wall flow can be completely collected without affecting the erosion process of jet flow so it is highly consistent with the real ground situation for the of a rectangular flow collected flume and its steel support frame were firstly installed in front of headwall the spacing between headwall and the flow collected flume kept at a short distance approximately 3 5 cm to ensure that the flow collected flume did not affect the on wall flow scouring headwall soils and also can collect all separated jet flow the dimension of the rectangular flow collected separated flume is 1 48 m width 0 5 m length 0 2 m depth and another rectangular flow drained flume with 10 cm 10 cm of width and depth was welded in the center of flow collected flume for draining the separated jet flow the height of steel support frame could be adjusted from 0 3 m to 0 9 m for the experiments of different headwall heights the sampling buckets were also placed under the bottom of gully bed and flow drained flume to monitor runoff and sediment process and the varied process of jet flow discharge respectively the mf means that no any device was installed to separate the flow from upstream area the implementation of mf under same experimental conditions with jf and of is to detect the effects of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow on soil loss and the effects of on wall flow on plunge pool morphology 2 4 experimental procedure before the formal experiments the flow discharge was firstly adjusted to the five designed flow discharge a water supply system consisting of a pump pipes valve groups an electromagnetic flowmeter and a pressure gauge was used to supply water for the flow steady pool of the experimental flume the designed flow discharges can be obtained by adjusting valve groups and monitoring with electromagnetic flowmeter in the water supply system the clear water after energy dissipation by the water drop structure in the flow steady pool overflowed gradually the flow steady pool and then entered the upstream area the flow velocity apparatus ls300 a relative error less than 1 5 was employed to measure the flow velocity at the edge of headwall v j and the flow velocity outside of the plunge pool v p with 5 8 times at 2 minute interval meanwhile the flow depth and width at upstream area and gully bed were measured by using a steel rule 1 mm accuracy during the jf and of experiments the on wall flow discharge and jet flow discharge were monitored by sampling buckets respectively and for the three sub experiments the runoff and sediment samples at the bottom of gully bed were collected by sampling buckets at 2 minute intervals the runoff and sediment samples were weighed and dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h then reweighed for calculating soil loss rate for jf and mf experiments the plunge pool developed at the gully bed due to jet flow erosion and the width w and depth d of plunge pool were measured using the steel rule with 1 mm accuracy at 2 minute intervals during experiments the water temperature was captured during experiments at 2 minute intervals to calculate water viscosity coefficient υ a total of 60 experiments 3 treatments 4 headwall heights 5 flow discharges were conducted in this study 2 5 parameter calculation the parameters describing jet flow properties include jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut v b flow velocity entry to plunge pool v e jet entry angle θe and jet shear stress τj and they are calculated according to previous studies as following alonso et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 the sketch for illustrating jet flow property parameters at

flow discharge m3 s 1 α is the proportion of jet flow during jf and of experiments and listed in table 1 2 6 data analysis and figure plotting the linear and non linear regression analysis was employed to determine the relationships among flow discharge gully head height jet flow properties soil loss amount and plunge pool morphology the pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations among plunge pool morphology and jet flow properties the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test extend fast was employed to calculate the sensitivity index si of flow discharge q 0 and headwall height h 0 by using the fast99 function in the r package sensitivity saltelli et al 1999 which can judge which factor flow discharge or gully head height is more sensitive to soil loss amount and plunge pool dimension by jet flow on wall flow and their interaction the data statistical analysis was carried out in spss software version 16 0 and r software version 3 6 3 the figure plotting was conducted by using origin software version 2020 adobe illustrator cc version 2018 and powerpoint software version 2016 3 results 3 1 proportion of jet flow and on wall flow table 1 shows the volume and proportion of jet flow and on wall flow under jf and of experiments with different flow discharge and gully head height conditions the volume and proportion of on wall flow under jf experiment condition were 0 9 10 9 and 0 07 10 1 times higher than those under of experiment condition respectively on average the differences in the volume and proportion between jf and of experiments was less 5 indicating the jf and of experiments were reliable in the study for separating jet flow and on wall flow under the same flow discharge condition the difference in jet flow or on wall flow volume was small among different gully head heights indicating the gully head height slightly affected the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow the on wall flow volume v o ranged from 330 to 563 l and linearly increased with the increasing flow discharge r 2 0 996 p 0 01 but the proportion of on wall flow p o 15 7 22 6 to the total flow volume decreased with the flow discharge as a power function r 2 0 996 p 0 01 the volume v j and proportion p j of jet flow were 1131 3014 l and 77 43 84 27 respectively which increased with the flow discharge as a linear and logarithmic function respectively r 2 0 992 0 999 p 0 01 3 2 contributions of jet flow and on wall flow to soil loss fig 4 illustrates the changes in soil loss amount caused by jet flow on wall flow and the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow with flow discharge under different gully head height conditions for the jf experiments fig 4a the soil loss amount caused by jet flow syj increased with flow discharge as two power functions for gully head height of 0 3 m and 1 2 m but it linearly increased with flow discharge increasing under 0 6 m and 0 9 m gully head heights table 2 furthermore the syj increased with gully head height as two power functions for the flow discharge of 3 0 and 3 6 m3 h 1 but it increased exponentially with gully head height for the other flow discharges table 3 consequently an empirical model eq 12 involving flow discharge q 0 and gully head height h 0 could estimate syj well with the high coefficient of determination 0 966 furthermore the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test extend fast showed the sensitivity index of q 0 and h 0 is 0 25 and 0 73 indicating that h 0 is the more sensitive factor affecting soil loss caused by jet flow than q 0 fig 4b similarly for the of experiments fig 4c the soil loss amount caused by on wall flow sy o increased by 0 82 1 76 times when gully head height increased from 0 3 m to 1 2 m and the power linear and exponential functions could express the relationship between syo and gully head height table 3 with the increase of flow discharge the on wall flow volume also increased table 1 and it also caused the increase of syo when the gully head height is 0 3 m and 1 2 m the syo logarithmically and linearly increased with flow discharge respectively but it increased with flow discharge as two power functions for 0 6 m and 0 9 m gully head heights table 2 like the syj the syo also could be expressed by the eq 13 with a same form of eq 12 the extend fast indicated that the q 0 had slightly larger effect on syo than h 0 fig 4d further by comparing the parameters in the two equations we found the sensitive of syo to flow discharge was higher than syj but the gully head height showed a higher effect on syj than syo fig 4e shows the change of soil loss amount caused by the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow syinter with flow discharge and gully head height regression analysis showed the syinter logarithmically increased with flow discharge except for 0 9 m gully head height r 2 0 946 0 985 under the same flow discharge condition the syinter increased by 1 09 1 93 times with the gully head height increasing from 0 3 m to 1 2 m however only when flow discharge is less than 6 0 m3 h 1 the syinter is a significant power or exponential function of gully head height furthermore the syinter can be estimated by a composite function of flow discharge and gully head height eq 14 however the extend fast found that the syinter showed a weak sensitivity to q 0 and was mainly affected by h 0 fig 4f 12 sy j 6 623 q 0 0 643 â exp 1 041 h 0 r 2 0 966 p 0 01 n 20 13 sy o 3 615 q 0 0 876 â exp 0 732 h 0 r 2 0 974 p 0 01 n 20 14 sy inter 0 865 1 554 l n q 0 2 283 â exp 0 982 h 0 r 2 0 926 p 0 01 n 20 fig 5 shows the change in the contributions of jet flow on wall flow and the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow to total soil loss under different flow discharge and gully head height conditions the proportion of soil loss by jet flow to total soil loss pj was 49 1 56 1 53 4 59 4 51 9 53 8 55 8 59 5 respectively under 0 3 m 0 6 m 0 9 m and 1 2 m gully head height condition the pj showed a relatively small change with flow discharge increasing and it also fluctuated with gully head height increasing the proportion of soil loss by on wall flow to total soil loss po ranged from 26 9 to 38 6 in this study similarly the po also fluctuated with the increase of gully head height but it logarithmically increased with flow discharge po a ln q0 b a 5 07 10 73 b 15 95 28 04 r 2 0 771 0 939 the proportion of soil loss by the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow to total soil loss p inter accounted for 9 9 14 2 of total soil loss the p inter logarithmically decreased with flow discharge pinter c ln q 0 d c 3 07 5 97 d 16 92 20 54 r 2 0 789 0 993 but showed a relatively small change among different gully head heights under our experimental conditions the pj po pinter ranged from 4 3 1 to 4 4 2 1 with the averaged ratio of 4 6 3 1 implying that the jet flow contributed the most of soil loss and the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow only caused the 11 6 of the total soil loss 3 3 plunge pool morphology 3 3 1 plunge pool width fig 6 shows the similar evolution process of plunge pool width wj by jet flow among different gully head height and flow discharge conditions overall the wj rapidly increased in the initial 8 min and then gradually increased to a stable state after 24 min several fluctuates occurred during the evolution of plunge pool which was mainly attributed to the situation that the headwall soil was eroded and then deposited around the plunge pool with the development of plunge pool the dynamic balance between soil detachment and sediment transport occurred implying that the morphology of plunge pool would keep a relatively stable state further analysis showed the temporal change in wj could be expressed by a series of logarithmic functions table 4 r2 0 889 0 994 however the temporal change of the plunge pool width by jet flow and on wall flow wm showed the stronger fluctuation than that by jet flow fig 6 especially for the experiment under 1 2 m gully head height the wm exhibited a drastic fluctuation during 10 20 min this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the eroded soil from gully headwall by on wall flow was imported into plunge pool and then affected jet flow erosion process especially the headwall failure would form a sudden effect on plunge pool after 24 min the width of plunge pool gradually stabilized in most cases the wm increased logarithmically with experimental time table 4 r2 0 379 0 962 in comparison the greater r 2 was found in wj than wm table 4 further indicating the on wall flow erosion process does affect the evolution process of plunge pool width after 30 min experiment concluded with the low flow discharge increasing from 3 0 to 7 2 m3 h 1 the wj gradually increased from low values of 23 4 24 7 27 0 and 31 0 cm to high values of 31 0 38 0 40 7 and 44 3 cm under gully head height of 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively fig 7 for each gully head height the wj increased exponentially with the increase of flow discharge wj a exp b q 0 a 18 73 24 79 b 0 070 0 093 r 2 0 889 0 990 under the flow discharge of 3 0 3 6 and 4 8 m3 h 1 the wj increased exponentially with the increase of gully head height r 2 0 884 0 961 but it increased logarithmically with the increase of gully head height under 6 0 and 7 2 m3 h 1 r 2 0 995 and 0 993 for the mf experiments the plunge pool width wm ranged from 10 0 to 46 0 cm and it exponentially increased with flow discharge wm a exp b q 0 a 7 91 17 79 b 0 099 0 16 r 2 0 919 0 991 as well as the gully head height wm a exp b h 0 a 6 79 11 44 b 0 94 1 14 r 2 0 926 0 992 non linear regression analysis showed that the wj and wm could be estimated by two composite functions of flow discharge and gully head height eqs 15 and 16 furthermore the extend fast showed that the si of q 0 and h 0 is 0 38 and 0 62 respectively under jf condition and it is 0 75 and 0 23 respectively under mf condition which indicating that h 0 had the greater effect on the plunge pool width but q 0 showed a greater effect under mf condition 15 w j 22 43 â h 0 0 212 â exp 0 084 q 0 r 2 0 954 p 0 01 16 w m 4 509 â exp 1 129 h 0 0 134 q 0 r 2 0 975 p 0 01 the difference in plunge pool width between jf and mf experiments was compared to clear the effect of on wall flow fig 7 the plunge pool width caused by the combination of jet flow and on wall flow were 48 0 57 3 32 3 51 4 and 24 3 44 4 less than those caused by jet flow under gully head height of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m respectively and the difference decreased with the increase of flow discharge indicating the effect of on wall flow on plunge pool width gradually decreased with the flow discharge increased notably when gully head height is 1 2 m and flow discharge is larger than 4 8 m3 h 1 the plunge pool width under mf was larger than that under jf indicating the presence of on wall flow promoted the development of plunge pool width and increased it by 7 5 on average 3 3 2 plunge pool depth the temporal change in the plunge pool depth d under jf and mf conditions is shown in the fig 8 for the jf experiments overall the depth by jet flow dj rapidly increased in the first 10 min and then trended to stable state however for the mf experiments under same conditions with jf the developed process of plunge pool depth dm showed the stronger fluctuation than jf experiments moreover the larger flow discharge and gully head height intensified the fluctuation of change process of plunge pool depth in fact without the effect of on wall flow erosion on plunge pool the dynamic change of plunge pool depth was mainly depended on the dynamic change in energy consumption of jet flow in plunge pool with the increase of plunge pool depth the energy consumption of jet flow also increased gradually and the depth would stabilize when the energy consumption reaches to the extremum however for the mf experiments the development of plunge pool was also affected by on wall flow erosion the soil loss of gully headwall caused by on wall flow and splashed water drops from plunge pool would enter into plunge pool and further change the energy consumption process of jet flow in plunge pool and the random soil failures of gully head also aggravated the fluctuation degree in the developmental process of plunge pool depth for the 90 of cases the temporal variation in dj and dm could be expressed by a series of logarithmic functions table 5 r2 0 345 0 970 and judged from the values of the coefficient of determination r 2 the dm showed the relatively weaker relationships with time than dj due to the effects of on wall flow erosion after 30 min jf experiment concluded with the flow discharge increased from 3 0 to 7 2 m3 h 1 the dj increased from the lowest values of 14 15 2 16 5 and 19 cm to the highest values of 20 22 3 26 and 28 cm when the gully headwall height is 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively fig 9 for each head height the relationship between dj and flow discharge can be expressed by an exponential function dj a exp b q 0 a 11 05 15 16 b 0 082 0 11 r 2 0 890 0 986 and similarly a series exponential functions also can reveal the relationship between d j and gully headwall height dj a exp b h 0 a 12 52 17 85 b 0 33 0 42 r 2 0 944 0 995 however for the mf experiments the existence of on wall flow erosion not only impeded the development of plunge pool depth 4 20 cm but also changed the relationships between d m and flow discharge to logarithmic functions dm a ln q 0 b a 7 06 12 31 b 4 58 3 57 r 2 0 959 0 995 and with the increase of gully headwall height the increment of dm gradually decreased for each flow discharge further analysis indicated that the dj and dm could be estimated by two composite functions of flow discharge and gully headwall height eqs 17 and 18 furthermore the greater si 0 54 of h 0 than that 0 46 of q 0 under jf condition indicated that the headwall height had the stronger impact on depth however the on wall flow erosion completely changed this situation and the si of q 0 and h 0 is 0 83 and 0 15 respectively fully indicating the q 0 mainly dominated the development of plunge pool depth under mf condition 17 d j 9 721 â exp 0 379 h 0 0 088 q 0 r 2 0 960 p 0 01 18 d m 1 535 q 0 0 688 â 1 085 l n h 0 3 184 r 2 0 943 p 0 01 the dm were reduced by 40 0 71 4 31 0 44 7 27 8 33 5 and 28 6 52 6 compared to dj when gully headwall height is 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m respectively and the decrease in plunge pool depth decreased with the flow discharge increased indicating that larger flow discharge would weaken the effect of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool depth which was basically consistent with the effect of on wall flow on plunge pool width fig 7 in addition we found the ratio of width to depth ranged from 1 38 to 1 70 with the average value of 1 57 under jet flow condition but it increased to 1 33 2 89 with an average of 1 79 due to the presence of on wall flow erosion which also further indicated that the effect of on wall flow erosion on the development of plunge pool depth was higher than the width 3 4 relationships plunge pool morphology and jet flow properties for the jf and mf experiments the plunge pool width and depth showed the significant correlation with jet properties except for jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut p 0 01 table 6 of which the energy consumption of jet flow showed the strongest correlation with plunge pool morphology followed by jet shear stress flow velocity entry to plunge pool and jet entry angle this also further indicated energy consumption of jet flow is a determined factor influencing the development of plunge pool morphology during headcut erosion regression analysis revealed that the w j and w m linearly increased with the increase of energy consumption fig 10 a p 0 01 notably the slope of fitted line 1 637 under mf was nearly 2 times that under jf and the w m would excess w j when energy consumption is larger than 21 90 j s 1 implying the presence of on wall accelerated the development of plunge pool width in addition the d j also linearly increased with the increase of energy consumption but d m increased with energy consumption by a power function fig 10b which indicated that the d j would always be greater than d m under same energy consumption and also cleared the fact that the on wall flow erosion could greatly weakened the effect of energy consumption of jet flow on the development of plunge pool depth 4 discussion our result showed that the on wall flow volume linearly increased with the increasing flow discharge and its proportion to the total flow volume 15 7 22 6 decreased with the flow discharge as a power function however the volume and proportion of jet flow increased with the flow discharge as a linear and logarithmic function respectively this was basically consistent with the conclusion of chen et al 2013 who studied the effect of jet flow and on wall flow on collapse of gully heads under real ground situations and found the p o also decreased with flow discharge increasing fully demonstrating that our experimental results are consistent with the changing law of the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow under real ground condition and so this result can be used for reference as a basis for the size design of gully head protection engineering measures furthermore we found that in their studies the p o can reach up to 56 8 when flow discharge was less than 0 25 m3 h 1 which is much larger than the results of this study however the p o decreased from 26 3 to 9 3 when flow discharge increased from 0 51 to 2 5 m3 h 1 portending that the lower flow discharge could cause similar p o with our study this difference was mainly related to the flow discharge and hydraulic properties dias and tuck 1991 wiryanto 1999 dias and vanden broeck 2011 peng et al 2012 concluded that the froude number fr is equal to 0 015 and the reynold number is equal to 9500 are the critical conditions initiating the transformation of on wall flow to jet flow however dias and tuck 1991 stated that the turbulent degree of the flow is the main factor influencing the formation of the jet flow and on wall flow the on wall flow is easy to form at the gully head when fr is less than 1 and the jet flow would become the main flow type when fr is larger than 1 in addition the soil properties also affect the water soil interface tension and the runoff hydraulic characteristics and thus were expected to change the proportions of jet flow and on wall flow wang 2002 peng et al 2012 the formation of headcut generally derived from the step change in underlying surface elevation and it divides the concentrated flow into on wall flow and jet flow poesen et al 2003 guo et al 2019 the occurrence and migration of headcuts and the change in concentrated flow properties commonly lead to the obvious increase in soil loss römkens et al 1997 alonso et al 2002 however the sediment contributions of on wall flow and jet flow are not clear and not explicitly addressed in some gully erosion models renard et al 1991 nearing et al 1989 stein et al 1993 alonso et al 2002 zhao et al 2013 our study distinguished firstly and preliminarily the soil loss amounts caused by jet flow on wall flow and their interaction from total soil loss and found that the soil loss amount increased significantly with the increase of q 0 and h 0 fig 3 which deepened the understanding of the role of jet flow and on wall flow in controlling gully erosion the further analysis showed that the soil loss by jet flow had the higher sensitivity to h 0 than q 0 and the soil loss of on wall flow showed the opposite result fully indicating that the two critical influencing factors exhibited different effects on different sub processes of gully headcut erosion vanmaercke et al 2016 furthermore on average the jet flow on wall flow and their interaction can contribute 53 5 34 9 and 11 6 of total soil loss amount respectively which demonstrated that jet flow erosion contributed more than half of soil loss amount this is mainly because more than 70 of the flow volume upstream gully head is converted into jet flow table 1 which means that more energy of jet flow is consumed in soil detachment and transportation from plunge pool erosion zhang et al 2018 in addition we found that the larger flow discharge significantly improved the sediment contributions of on wall flow and but decreased the contribution of the interaction of jet flow and on wall flow this is mainly due to the situation that the larger flow discharge caused the developed position of plunge pool away from headwall and thus the water drops from plunge pool only caused little effect on headwall erosion by on wall flow these results fully reveals that the serious gully erosion is mainly attributed to the fact that the gully head separated the concentrated flow as the jet flow and on wall flow which not only dominated the different sub processes of gully erosion but also contributes more soil loss than concentrated flow erosion valentin et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to pay attention to how to deal with the jet flow and on wall flow reasonably in the process of gully erosion prevention and control our study revealed that the rapid growth in the depth and width of plunge pool occurred in the 10 min initial period and then the dimensions of plunge pool developed slowly similar results were also found in some published works on rill and bank gully headcut erosion e g stein et al 1993 bennett and casalí 2001 zhang et al 2016 for example stein et al 1993 stated a more detailed result that the rate of plunge pool scour depth increased rapidly when the scour depth was less than 95 of the equilibrium depth furthermore in most of cases it was found that the plunge pool morphology width and depth increased logarithmically with experimental duration tables 4 5 this result was supported by rouse 1940 who suggested that the sour depth increased linearly with the log of the time however blaisdell et al 1981 confirmed the hyperbolic function has a computable scour depth and gives the best fit but unfortunately the scour depth may be reached the equilibrium only after extremely long times as a result the semi log relationship between scour depth and time was popularly preferred by many researchers rajaratnam 1981 alonso et al 2002 wells et al 2009a 2010 campo bescós et al 2013 although it indicated that the scour depth increased infinitely with time in a physical sense notably the plunge pool morphology retained a steady constant at the end of experiments figs 5 7 which was consistent with previous studies on rill and bank gully headcut erosion e g bennett 1999 bennett et al 2000 wells et al 2009a 2009b zhang et al 2016 and also further indicated that the development of plunge pool morphology entered into an equilibrium phase when the scour hole eroded to the point that the maximum jet shear stress of the diffused jet equals the critical shear stress of the gully bed soil a balance between the jet eroding forces and soil resistances alonso et al 2002 however in some cases the obvious fluctuation was found during the development of plunge pool morphology under mf experiments figs 5 7 implying that the presence of on wall flow erosion altered the evolution process of plunge pool morphology this was mainly attributed to the random headwall soil failure induced by on wall flow suddenly filling into the pool zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the narrower and deeper plunge pool width 10 46 cm depth 4 28 cm was developed in this study than those width 64 2 80 1 cm depth 5 6 8 1 cm in the study of zhang et al 2016 although the flow discharge and headwall height condition is similar between the two studies the difference was mainly caused by the difference in gully bed material the higher soil bulk density 1 73 g cm 3 and clay content 27 in the study of zhang et al 2016 than this study signified the lower soil erodibility and higher erosion resistance to jet flow guo et al 2018 2020 and thus the quicker lateral development of plunge pool is found in their study than this study in addition the final plunge pool morphology increased significantly with the increase of q0 and h0 eq 4 7 which was agreed with some previous studies e g bennett et al 2000 alonso et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 this result was also supported by a realistic theory predictive model involving mainly the unit flow discharge gully head height flow velocity at the brink point and gully bed materials of which the q0 and h0 is the main factors controlling the plunge pool erosion alonso et al 2002 the initial flow discharge and headwall height determined the jet properties entering plunge pool our result showed that the jet property parameters except for the jet flow velocity at the brink of headcut significantly influenced the development of plunge pool morphology of which the energy consumption of jet flow had the strongest correlation with plunge pool morphology and could be considered as the critical factor predicting plunge pool erosion several studies on gully and bank gully headcut erosion also obtained a similar conclusion e g su et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the great difference in the relationships between plunge pool morphology and energy consumption between jf and mf conditions fig 9 indicated that the on wall flow erosion would weaken the effect of energy consumption on scour depth but improve the effect on plunge pool width moreover the on wall flow erosion changed the sensitivity of plunge pool evolution to h0 and q0 and under real ground situation the concentrated flow discharge upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effects on plunge pool morphology than headwall height therefore the future study should consider how to regulate the concentrated flow in drainage area upstream gully heads to weaken gully erosion 5 limitations and significance of this study despite nearly a century of gully erosion studies gully erosion remains a poorly understand processes and dynamic mechanism which is important for the modelling and prediction of gully erosion and its prevention and control our study separated the jet flow and on wall flow through a series of simulated flow experiments combined with a self made separated device and clarified their influences on soil loss of gully heads and the morphological evolution of plunge pool however there are two potential limitations 1 the experimental design of this study was idealized and generated due to the complex effects of lots of factors on gully erosion so it is not on the same scale as the actual situations 2 it has not been confirmed how well the experimental results are in line with the actual ground results therefore further studies need to optimize the experimental design and verify the experimental results with the actual situations so that the study results can be practiced and applied under actual conditions although the earlier noted imperfection represents the limitation of our study we still clearly demonstrated the ratio of jet flow and on wall flow volume to total flow volume upstream gully head and further clarified their influences on soil loss of gully heads and morphological development of plunge pool during gully erosion process which is of great significance for deepening the understanding of the gully process and mechanism moreover to a certain extent it can also provide scientific basis for the establishment of process based gully erosion model and the design of gully erosion prevention measures 6 conclusion this study explored the proportion of jet flow and on wall flow and their influences on soil loss and plunge pool morphology during headcut erosion the proportion of on wall flow and jet flow is 15 7 22 6 and 77 4 84 3 of total flow respectively the jet flow erosion contributed the highest proportion of total soil loss 53 5 followed by on wall flow 34 9 and their interaction 11 6 the soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on wall flow was dominated by h 0 but q 0 had the greater effect on soil loss caused by on wall flow than h 0 the width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased under jet flow and the combination of jet flow and on wall flow condition the dimension of plunge pool was significantly enhanced by flow discharge and headwall height the on wall flow erosion weakened the plunge pool depth by 27 8 71 4 similarly the width was reduced by 24 3 57 3 under headwall height of 0 3 0 9 m but the on wall flow promoted plunge pool width by 7 5 when h 0 is 1 2 m and q 0 is larger than 4 8 m3 h 1 the on wall flow erosion can change the sensitivity of plunge pool evolution to h0 and q0 and the concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effects on plunge pool morphology under real ground situation the energy consumption of jet flow showed the strongest effect on the evolution of plunge pool morphology this study elucidated the importance role of jet flow and on wall flow in controlling gully headcut erosion and deepened the understanding of gully erosion processes and mechanism credit authorship
