13770,microplastics have become a global concern because of their adverse effects on ecosystems although wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered a potential source of microplastics in the environment the effect of polystyrene nanoparticles on activated sludge performance is not clear in this study the effect of short term exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps on activated sludge activity and sedimentation was investigated and the mechanism behind the effect was analysed at 5 g l the ps nps could be adsorbed completely by activated sludge 2 8 g vss l and could be transferred from the aqueous phase to the sludge phase in a short period at a low concentration 0 1 g l the ps nps significantly inhibited the endogenous respiration in the sludge by causing bacterial death and affecting the mass transfer in the sludge changes in the zeta potential of the sludge surface and in the components of extracellular polymeric substance eps resulted in low sludge aggregation ps nps also caused sludge disintegration so that when the ps np concentration reached 5 g l the sludge sedimentation decreased by approximately 50 short term ps np exposure has a significant effect on the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge which could affect the wwtp effluent quality the findings of this study provide new insight for evaluating the potential risks posed by nanoplastics in wwtps keywords nanoparticle activated sludge activity sedimentation 1 introduction plastic products are light durable and inexpensive and are widely used in production and daily life 1 due to the mass production and use of plastic products they inevitably enter the natural environment 2 where they are further broken down into microplastics with sizes of less than 5 mm and nanoplastics through biological photo and or mechanical degradation 3 4 to date microplastics and nanoplastics are found in almost all aquatic ecosystems and can cause growth inhibition reproductive dysfunction and reduced viability in marine organisms 5 7 therefore it is particularly urgent to improve the understanding of the environmental behaviour and ecotoxicological effects of microplastics and nanoplastics in aqueous systems topics that have also become growing global concerns in recent years wastewater treatment plants wwtps critical components of urban water systems are considered potential sources of microplastics and nanoplastics in the environment 8 9 numerous types of microplastics such as polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp materials 10 12 are found in wwtps primarily because of their effective capture by microbial aggregates studies have found that microplastics in wastewater biological treatment processes can reduce the abundances of nitrifying denitrifying and heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacteria and inhibit the biological conversion of ammonium 13 14 in addition microplastics affect the microbial community structure in the digestion process and inhibit hydrolysis acetic acid accumulation and hydrogen production 15 16 nanoplastics have large surface area to volume ratio and nano specific properties sun et al found that the effect of nanoplastics on the marine bacterium halomonas alkaliphila is greater than that of microplastics at the same concentration 14 in contrast with microplastics nanoplastics can penetrate biological membranes and can affect key enzymes and metabolic products 17 19 though the presence and concentrations of nanoplastics in the environment have yet to be confirmed because of the limitations of the current separation technologies assessments of nanoplastic toxicity still need a starting point which could provide basic data for assessing the potential risks posed by nanoplastics activated sludge process has been used for more than 100 years and is still the most widely used wastewater treatment process in the world 20 the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge jointly determine the quality of the effluent from wwtps activated sludge with stronger activity can remove a greater amount of pollutants and sludge sedimentation determines the extent of sludge water separation in the settling tank which greatly affects the effluent quality feng et al found that polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps can inhibit the endogenous respiration of activated sludge and that the degree of inhibition is related to the ps nps concentration 21 in addition ps nps can increase the content of c o n functional groups in extracellular polymeric substance eps enhancing the bioflocculation of sludge 21 unfortunately the effect of nanoplastics on the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge and related mechanisms is still poorly understood ps is one of the most widely used plastics worldwide 21 due to the use of ps they inevitably enter the natural environment and wwtp in order to better elucidate the influence mechanism of nanoplastics on activated sludge performance ps nps were used to investigate the effect of short term exposure to nanoplastics on activated sludge activity and sedimentation the surface characteristics size distribution ratio of live bacteria to dead bacteria zeta potential and eps components of sludge were investigated to understand the changes in sludge performance the findings of this study could provide new insight for evaluating the potential risks of nanoplastics in wwtps 2 material and methods 2 1 source of ps nps ps nps were synthesized in the laboratory through nitrogen protected emulsion polymerization with styrene as a monomer 22 the emulsifier and initiator were sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and ammonium persulfate aps respectively the synthesis procedure is detailed in the supplementary materials the average particle size of the ps nps used in this study was 110 nm 2 2 the effect of short term exposure to ps nps on the performance of activated sludge activated sludge was collected from the aeration tank of a wwtp in chongqing and the effect of short term ps np exposure on activated sludge performance was studied to evaluate the fate of ps nps in the activated sludge process the ps np concentration in the supernatant after different exposure times was investigated the details are presented in the supplementary materials to evaluate the effect of short term exposure to ps nps on the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge sludge with endogenous respiration was added to 4 conical flasks and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss in each conical flask was controlled at 2 8 g vss l 7 96 g mlss l ps nps were added to achieve ps np concentrations of 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 g l and 5 g l another conical flask containing the same concentration of sludge but no ps nps added served as a control the five conical flasks were simultaneously placed in a water bath shaker for the short term exposure test the water temperature was controlled at 25 and the rotation speed was 110 r min the short term exposure test was conducted for 10 h the effect of short term exposure to ps nps on the activity of activated sludge was studied by measuring the changes in the endogenous respiration rate ouren of the activated sludge in the five conical flasks after 10 h of exposure the measurement method for the endogenous respiration rate was as described in a previous study 21 by measuring the change in the 30 min settled sludge volume sv30 in the five conical flasks after 10 h of exposure the effect of short term ps np exposure on activated sludge sedimentation was studied the surface properties of the activated sludge were observed after 10 h of exposure the particle size distribution and surface potential of the sludge were determined images were collected and the ratio of live to dead bacteria in the activated sludge was calculated the eps was extracted and the changes in the eps components were determined all tests and determinations were repeated three times and the results are expressed as average values 2 3 characteristics of the ps nps and activated sludge the morphology of the activated sludge after ps np exposure was observed by optical microscopy saikedigital china scanning electron microscopy sem quattro s thermo usa was used to observe ps nps and the surface characteristics of activated sludge after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps the pretreatment was as follows the activated sludge was washed twice with deionized water and subsequently fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde the fixed sludge was washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffered saline pbs and placed in ethanol for dehydration the dehydrated sludge was placed in a freeze dryer for 8 h finally gold was sprayed on the sample surface and high quality images were captured the particle size of the ps nps was measured by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk and the particle size of the activated sludge was measured by a laser particle size analyser s3500 microtrac usa data were obtained by averaging three measurements the zeta potential at 25 c was measured using a zeta potential analyser zetasizer nano zs90 uk the samples were dispersed in 0 1 m nacl solution and the od546 was adjusted to 0 1 with a uv vis spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 china data were obtained as the average of three measurements 2 4 live dead bacteria test live bacteria have a complete cell wall while dead bacteria have an incomplete cell wall in this study the dyes syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto9 thermo fisher scientific usa and propidium iodide pi maokang biotechnology china were used to stain live bacteria and dead bacteria respectively the former dye can quickly penetrate any cell wall to bind dna while the latter cannot penetrate a complete cell wall but can penetrate an incomplete cell wall compared with syto9 pi has greater dna affinity and can replace syto9 to bind dna in dead bacteria 23 the specific dyeing procedure was as follows first activated sludge exposed to different concentrations of ps nps was collected and then washed with deionized water a dye mixture 60 μm pi and 10 μm syto9 was added to each sample in the dark after dyeing excess dye was washed away with phosphate buffer pb in the dark the above samples were placed under a laser confocal scanning microscope tcs sp8 csu leica germany and observed under the following conditions 488 nm single channel excitation 500 nm syto9 emission wavelength 635 nm pi emission wavelength 20 objective lens and 10 eyepiece in the images dead bacteria appear red while live bacteria appear green tomographic images of the activated sludge were processed by las x software and the fluorescence intensities of live and dead bacteria were counted the ratios of live bacteria to dead bacteria for the whole activated sludge floc and at varying depths from the outer to the inner layers of the sludge floc were determined to analyse the effect of ps np exposure on the activated sludge 2 5 aggregation of sludge the method to assess the aggregation degree was described in a previous study 24 the specific steps were as follows after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps activated sludge was collected and resuspended in 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 25 solution then the initial od600 0 was adjusted to 0 6 after which 2 ml of the suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube over time the cells aggregated and settled to the bottom of the tube the od600 t of the supernatant after settling for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h was measured the following equation was used to calculate the degree of microbial cell aggregation 1 a t od 600 0 od 600 t od 600 0 100 where at is the aggregation degree of activated sludge od600 0 is the initial od at time 0 and od600 t is the od at different aggregation times 2 6 eps extraction and analysis a heat treatment method was used to extract eps and the detailed extraction steps were described by ding 25 a bca kit and the h2so4 anthrone oxidation method were used to determine the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate respectively in the eps 26 27 a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet is50 thermo usa was used to measure the infrared spectra in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 of the eps in activated sludge after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps the obtained data were normalised 2 7 other analysis methods the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured using standard methods 28 the dissolved oxygen do concentration professional odo ysi usa was measured using a portable oxygen analyser 3 results 3 1 fate of nanoplastics in activated sludge fig s2b in the supplementary materials shows the concentration of ps nps in the supernatant which gradually decreased with increasing exposure time and dropped to 31 2 mg l after 10 h while there was no significant change in only ps nps added thus activated sludge played an important role in the migration of ps nps during the activated sludge process after 10 h of exposure the activated sludge changed from dark brown to light yellow supplementary material fig s2c which may have been due to the adsorption of the white ps nps by the activated sludge after 10 h the mlss of the activated sludge increased from 7 96 g mlss l to 10 92 g mlss l an increase of 2 96 g mlss l which was the same quantity as the reduction 2 96 g mlss l in the ps np concentration in the sludge supernatant fig s2b in the supplementary materials therefore at 5 g l the ps nps were almost completely adsorbed by the activated sludge 3 2 effect of nanoplastic exposure on sludge activity and sedimentation the endogenous respiration rate is an important indicator of activated sludge activity 21 and sludge activity is directly related to the efficiency of wastewater treatment the effect of ps np exposure on the ouren of activated sludge is shown in fig 1 a after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps the ouren of sludge was significantly reduced when the ps np concentration was 0 1 g l the average ouren decreased by 65 9 compared with that in the control group indicating that 0 1 g l ps nps could significantly inhibit the activity of sludge the average ouren of sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased at 5 g l ps np the average ouren of the sludge was 0 012 mg o2 l min only 16 7 of the value in the control group the sedimentation of sludge after 10 h of exposure to different concentrations of ps nps is shown in fig 1b the sv30 of sludge increased as the ps np concentration increased indicating that the ps nps significantly affected the sedimentation of the sludge 3 3 the effect of nanoplastic exposure on the morphology and floc size of activated sludge 3 3 1 morphological features optical microscopy revealed that when the concentration of ps nps was more than 1 g l many fine flocs appeared fig 2 a and the amount of small flocs in the sludge increased with increasing ps np concentration sem analysis revealed that a large number of ps nps were adsorbed on the activated sludge surface the amount adsorbed increased significantly with the ps np concentration fig 2b while the holes on the surface of the sludge became increasingly smaller studies have shown that holes on the surface of microbial aggregates are important channels for transporting nutrients inside 29 30 the shrinkage of the holes prevented the microorganisms inside the sludge from obtaining enough substrate which in turn led to the disintegration of the activated sludge flocs there are many holes on the surface of sludge flocs and whether there are many ps nps in sludge flocs remains to be further explored in addition different from the appearance of the eps in the control group the eps appeared scaly after adding the ps nps indicating that the eps were affected by the ps nps 3 3 2 size of activated sludge flocs after exposure to ps nps the average particle size of activated sludge flocs increased significantly fig 3 a at ps np concentrations of 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 g l and 5 g l the average particle size of the sludge increased by 6 5 7 2 9 4 and 11 2 respectively compared with the size in the control group from the particle size distribution diagram fig 3b as the ps np concentration gradually increased the proportion of the total volume of activated sludge with sizes between 176 μm and 296 μm gradually increased which may have been due to the large number of ps nps adsorbed by the sludge in addition the volume of sludge with a particle size of less than 18 5 μm increased as the ps np concentration increased this increase may have occurred because the ps nps killed a large number of microorganisms and disintegrated the sludge flocs these small sludge flocs affected the sedimentation performance of the sludge in addition a large number of ps nps adsorbed on the surface of sludge may affect the mass transfer in the sludge causing the death of internal microorganisms and disintegration of activated sludge flocs 3 4 changes in live dead bacteria in activated sludge studying the changes in live bacteria and dead bacteria in activated sludge flocs after ps np exposure fig 4 helped reveal the effect of ps np exposure on activated sludge activity when ps nps were not added the fluorescence intensity from live bacteria in activated sludge flocs was higher than that from dead bacteria indicating that live bacteria dominated in the sludge flocs and had higher activity after exposure to ps nps the relative proportion of dead bacteria in sludge flocs increased indicating that ps np exposure caused bacterial death the ratio of live to dead bacteria in the entire sludge floc in the outer layer of the sludge and inside the sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased table 1 indicating that the degree of inhibition of sludge activity by the ps nps was related to the ps np concentration when ps nps were not added the fluorescence intensity from live bacteria in most locations inside the activated sludge was higher than that from dead bacteria fig 5 a after exposure to ps nps the relative ratio of the fluorescence intensity from dead bacteria in the external sludge floc layer and the inner layer increased but that from dead bacteria in the inner sludge floc layer increased more than that in the external layer fig 5b e when the concentration of ps nps was 5 g l the fluorescence intensity from dead bacteria in the sludge was much greater than that from live bacteria potentially because the ps nps adsorbed on the surface of the sludge not only killed the bacteria in the outer layer of the floc but also affected the mass transfer in the sludge floc these effects eventually led to the death of a large number of microorganisms in the sludge because they could not obtain enough do which in turn affected the activity of the sludge the death of bacteria inside the sludge would lead to the disintegration of sludge flocs affecting the sedimentation performance of the sludge 3 5 the effect of ps np exposure on the activated sludge aggregation capacity 3 5 1 aggregation ability of the activated sludge the aggregation degree of sludge suspensions after ps np exposure is shown in fig 6 the aggregation degree of the sludge suspensions increased rapidly after 1 h and became stable after 4 h at a concentration of 0 1 g l ps nps there was no significant change in the aggregation degree compared with that in the control group when the concentration of ps nps was 0 5 g l or 1 g l the aggregation degree decreased 10 4 and 16 5 respectively compared with that in the control group when the concentration of ps nps was 5 g l the aggregation degree decreased almost 50 compared with that in the control group this result confirmed that ps np exposure decreased the aggregation ability of the sludge the adhesion of microbial aggregates in suspension is affected by electrostatic forces 31 hence it can be inferred that the change in sludge aggregation capacity may be related to the change in the zeta potential 3 5 2 zeta potential of the activated sludge as the ps np concentration increased the zeta potential on the surface of the activated sludge significantly increased fig 7 a because a large number of ps nps with a zeta potential of 20 1 0 2 mv were adsorbed by the sludge an increased zeta potential indicates increased electronegativity of the activated sludge and increased repulsive potential energy between flocs which makes it difficult for the flocs to contact and coagulate ultimately affecting the sedimentation performance of the sludge 3 5 3 eps content and spectral analysis activated sludge flocs have a loose structure and microbial flocs are formed by the eps generated by bacteria and various viscous substances eps are mainly composed of extracellular proteins and extracellular polysaccharides which play an important role in improving long term system efficiency 32 as the ps np concentration increased the extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide content of the activated sludge significantly decreased fig 7b in the control group the protein and polysaccharide contents in the activated sludge were 44 49 mg l and 8 57 mg l respectively in the activated sludge exposed to 5 g l ps nps the protein and polysaccharide contents were 23 58 mg l and 5 55 mg l respectively reflecting decreases of 47 9 and 35 2 respectively obviously the effect of ps nps on the protein content of eps was greater than that on the polysaccharide content feng et al also found that ps nps can destroy tryptophan protein like substances in eps resulting in a reduction in protein concentration 21 previous studies have shown that the ratio of extracellular proteins to extracellular polysaccharides is positively correlated with the sludge aggregation capacity 33 34 in this study the ratio of extracellular proteins to extracellular polysaccharides gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased fig 7b thereby reducing the sludge aggregation ability which in turn affected the sludge sedimentation performance in the ftir spectra of the eps fig 7c the positions and number of bands before and after ps np exposure are very similar indicating that the types of chemical groups are similar however careful observation of the peak intensities reveals that the relative contents of chemical groups are significantly different the peak at approximately 3343 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of hydrophilic oh groups 35 this phenomenon was obviously enhanced by the added ps nps the peak near 1630 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of c o groups in proteins 36 37 and its intensity was significantly stronger than that in the absence of ps nps the band at approximately 1080 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of c o c groups in polysaccharides 38 which increased significantly after exposure to ps nps the peak near 1413 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the hydrophobic functional group ch2 39 which decreased after adding ps nps compared with the peak intensities in the absence of ps nps the peaks at approximately 1452 cm 1 747 cm 1 and 695 cm 1 decreased in intensity after ps nps were added these results indicated that ps np exposure increased the content of hydrophilic functional groups such as oh and c o in eps and decreased that of hydrophobic functional groups these effects led to an increase in the zeta potential of the eps which in turn inhibited sludge aggregation these results further explained the effect of ps np exposure on sludge aggregation from the perspective of chemical structure 4 discussion in this study a wide range of ps np concentrations 0 1 5 g l were applied in short term exposure experiments to evaluate the potential impact of nanoplastics on activated sludge activity and sedimentation although the typical concentration of nanoplastics in the environment has yet to be confirmed owing to the limitations of the current separation technology a previous study reported that the microplastic concentration in wwtps is approximately 1 60 56 4 103 particles kg dry sludge 11 assuming that the microplastics in wwtps were all polystyrene beads 1 mm ρ 1 05 g cm3 and the mlvss was approximately 2 g l the microplastic concentration could be estimated to be approximately 0 01 0 5 g l microplastics and nanoplastics are gradually increasing in the environment everaert et al predicted that the microplastic concentration in the ocean would reach 48 8 particles m 3 in 2100 which is a 50 fold increase compared to the present concentrations 40 the concentration of ps nps in this study was the same as that in feng et al 21 fu et al applied nanoplastic concentrations of 0 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 g l to investigate the effect of nanoplastics on anaerobic digestion systems 17 the concentration range of ps nps evaluated in this study spanned from low to high concentrations low concentrations are similar to realistic environmental concentrations whereas high concentrations could view as a proof of concept and be used to predict risk therefore the investigated ps np concentration range has reference value nanoplastics have a very large specific surface area 41 which increases their contact with microbes this study found that ps nps at 5 g l could be completely adsorbed by activated sludge and transferred from the aqueous phase to the sludge phase in a short period activated sludge has a strong adsorption ability for ps nps the nanoplastics entering the activated sludge process can be quickly adsorbed by the activated sludge and the risk of entering the water environment with the effluent is small we found that after short term exposure to ps nps the activated sludge activity was reduced by analysing the ratio of live bacteria to dead bacteria in the sludge it was found that ps np exposure increased the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge potentially because the nanoplastics adsorbed on the surface of the bacteria stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species ros and caused lipid peroxidation destroying the cell membrane structure 18 42 interestingly with the increase in ps np concentration the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge centre decreased more than the ratio in the outer layer of sludge showing that ps nps can not only kill bacteria but also affect the mass transfer in sludge flocs the sem images confirmed this finding a large number of ps nps were adsorbed on the surface of the sludge blocking the pores on the sludge surface these pores are the channels for material exchange between the microbial aggregates and the outside 29 30 therefore blocking these pores affects the mass transfer in the sludge and the microorganisms inside the sludge die because they cannot obtain enough do an effect of ps nps on sludge mass transfer has not been proposed in previous studies the sedimentation of activated sludge is the key factor that determines the quality of effluent from wwtps however the effect of nanoplastics on the sedimentation of sludge is unknown after ps np exposure the sedimentation of sludge changed which may have been caused by the following 1 the surface pores of the activated sludge decreased after adsorbing a large amount of nanoplastics this process hindered the delivery of do to the activated sludge and affected the mass transfer of the activated sludge as a result the sludge disintegrated and had difficulty settling 2 the nanoplastics adsorbed on the surface of the flocs increased the hydrophilic functional groups and reduced the hydrophobic functional groups in the eps resulting in an increase in the zeta potential studies have shown that increasing the zeta potential can increase the repulsive potential energy making it difficult for sludge to accumulate well 43 44 sludge with a highly negatively charged structure is in an extended state forming a carpet like structure and inhibiting sludge settling 45 3 previous studies have shown that the protein polysaccharide ratio is positively correlated with hydrophobicity 46 the ratio between proteins and polysaccharides in eps gradually decreased as the concentration of nanoplastics increased indicating that nanoplastics impact extracellular proteins more than extracellular polysaccharides the decrease in the protein polysaccharide ratio can change the hydrophobicity and affect the sludge aggregation ability and sedimentation nanoplastics can affect the performance of activated sludge understanding the effect of short term nanoplastic exposure on activated sludge performance is critical to eliminating or reducing the influence of nanoplastics on biological wastewater treatment nanoplastics can be quickly adsorbed by activated sludge in large quantities by regulating the hydraulic retention time hrt the nanoplastics produced in the influent can be completely transferred into the sludge phase reducing the concentration of nanoplastics in the effluent and reducing the pollution of natural water bodies in addition the effect of nanoplastics on activated sludge is related to their concentration therefore the concentration of nanoplastics in sludge can be regulated to a certain extent by regulating the sludge retention time srt and sludge discharge reducing the impact of the nanoplastics on the sludge performance and ensuring the stability of the wwtp effluent 5 conclusion in this study the performance of activated sludge after short term exposure to nanoplastics was evaluated and ps nps at 5 g l could be adsorbed completely by activated sludge a low concentration of ps nps 0 1 g l significantly inhibited the endogenous respiration in the sludge because ps nps not only caused bacterial death but also inhibited the mass transfer in the sludge the sedimentation of activated sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased after short term exposure to ps nps because of the change in the zeta potential and eps components ps nps also caused sludge disintegration which decreased the sedimentation of the sludge short term ps np exposure had a significant effect on the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge which could provide new insight for evaluating the potential risks

uv vis spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 china data were obtained as the average of three measurements 2 4 live dead bacteria test live bacteria have a complete cell wall while dead bacteria have an incomplete cell wall in this study the dyes syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto9 thermo fisher scientific usa and propidium iodide pi maokang biotechnology china were used to stain live bacteria and dead bacteria respectively the former dye can quickly penetrate any cell wall to bind dna while the latter cannot penetrate a complete cell wall but can penetrate an incomplete cell wall compared with syto9 pi has greater dna affinity and can replace syto9 to bind dna in dead bacteria 23 the specific dyeing procedure was as follows first activated sludge exposed to different concentrations of ps nps was collected and then washed with deionized water a dye mixture 60 μm pi and 10 μm syto9 was added to each sample in the dark after dyeing excess dye was washed away with phosphate buffer pb in the dark the above samples were placed under a laser confocal scanning microscope tcs sp8 csu leica germany and observed under the following conditions 488 nm single channel excitation 500 nm syto9 emission wavelength 635 nm pi emission wavelength 20 objective lens and 10 eyepiece in the images dead bacteria appear red while live bacteria appear green tomographic images of the activated sludge were processed by las x software and the fluorescence intensities of live and dead bacteria were counted the ratios of live bacteria to dead bacteria for the whole activated sludge floc and at varying depths from the outer to the inner layers of the sludge floc were determined to analyse the effect of ps np exposure on the activated sludge 2 5 aggregation of sludge the method to assess the aggregation degree was described in a previous study 24 the specific steps were as follows after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps activated sludge was collected and resuspended in 0 9 nacl ph 7 0 25 solution then the initial od600 0 was adjusted to 0 6 after which 2 ml of the suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube over time the cells aggregated and settled to the bottom of the tube the od600 t of the supernatant after settling for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h was measured the following equation was used to calculate the degree of microbial cell aggregation 1 a t od 600 0 od 600 t od 600 0 100 where at is the aggregation degree of activated sludge od600 0 is the initial od at time 0 and od600 t is the od at different aggregation times 2 6 eps extraction and analysis a heat treatment method was used to extract eps and the detailed extraction steps were described by ding 25 a bca kit and the h2so4 anthrone oxidation method were used to determine the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate respectively in the eps 26 27 a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet is50 thermo usa was used to measure the infrared spectra in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 of the eps in activated sludge after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps the obtained data were normalised 2 7 other analysis methods the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured using standard methods 28 the dissolved oxygen do concentration professional odo ysi usa was measured using a portable oxygen analyser 3 results 3 1 fate of nanoplastics in activated sludge fig s2b in the supplementary materials shows the concentration of ps nps in the supernatant which gradually decreased with increasing exposure time and dropped to 31 2 mg l after 10 h while there was no significant change in only ps nps added thus activated sludge played an important role in the migration of ps nps during the activated sludge process after 10 h of exposure the activated sludge changed from dark brown to light yellow supplementary material fig s2c which may have been due to the adsorption of the white ps nps by the activated sludge after 10 h the mlss of the activated sludge increased from 7 96 g mlss l to 10 92 g mlss l an increase of 2 96 g mlss l which was the same quantity as the reduction 2 96 g mlss l in the ps np concentration in the sludge supernatant fig s2b in the supplementary materials therefore at 5 g l the ps nps were almost completely adsorbed by the activated sludge 3 2 effect of nanoplastic exposure on sludge activity and sedimentation the endogenous respiration rate is an important indicator of activated sludge activity 21 and sludge activity is directly related to the efficiency of wastewater treatment the effect of ps np exposure on the ouren of activated sludge is shown in fig 1 a after exposure to different concentrations of ps nps the ouren of sludge was significantly reduced when the ps np concentration was 0 1 g l the average ouren decreased by 65 9 compared with that in the control group indicating that 0 1 g l ps nps could significantly inhibit the activity of sludge the average ouren of sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased at 5 g l ps np the average ouren of the sludge was 0 012 mg o2 l min only 16 7 of the value in the control group the sedimentation of sludge after 10 h of exposure to different concentrations of ps nps is shown in fig 1b the sv30 of sludge increased as the ps np concentration increased indicating that the ps nps significantly affected the sedimentation of the sludge 3 3 the effect of nanoplastic exposure on the morphology and floc size of activated sludge 3 3 1 morphological features optical microscopy revealed that when the concentration of ps nps was more than 1 g l many fine flocs appeared fig 2 a and the amount of small flocs in the sludge increased with increasing ps np concentration sem analysis revealed that a large number of ps nps were adsorbed on the activated sludge surface the amount adsorbed increased significantly with the ps np concentration fig 2b while the holes on the surface of the sludge became increasingly smaller studies have shown that holes on the surface of microbial aggregates are important channels for transporting nutrients inside 29 30 the shrinkage of the holes prevented the microorganisms inside the sludge from obtaining enough substrate which in turn led to the disintegration of the activated sludge flocs there are many holes on the surface of sludge flocs and whether there are many ps nps in sludge flocs remains to be further explored in addition different from the appearance of the eps in the control group the eps appeared scaly after adding the ps nps indicating that the eps were affected by the ps nps 3 3 2 size of activated sludge flocs after exposure to ps nps the average particle size of activated sludge flocs increased significantly fig 3 a at ps np concentrations of 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 g l and 5 g l the average particle size of the sludge increased by 6 5 7 2 9 4 and 11 2 respectively compared with the size in the control group from the particle size distribution diagram fig 3b as the ps np concentration gradually increased the proportion of the total volume of activated sludge with sizes between 176 μm and 296 μm gradually increased which may have been due to the large number of ps nps adsorbed by the sludge in addition the volume of sludge with a particle size of less than 18 5 μm increased as the ps np concentration increased this increase may have occurred because the ps nps killed a large number of microorganisms and disintegrated the sludge flocs these small sludge flocs affected the sedimentation performance of the sludge in addition a large number of ps nps adsorbed on the surface of sludge may affect the mass transfer in the sludge causing the death of internal microorganisms and disintegration of activated sludge flocs 3 4 changes in live dead bacteria in activated sludge studying the changes in live bacteria and dead bacteria in activated sludge flocs after ps np exposure fig 4 helped reveal the effect of ps np exposure on activated sludge activity when ps nps were not added the fluorescence intensity from live bacteria in activated sludge flocs was higher than that from dead bacteria indicating that live bacteria dominated in the sludge flocs and had higher activity after exposure to ps nps the relative proportion of dead bacteria in sludge flocs increased indicating that ps np exposure caused bacterial death the ratio of live to dead bacteria in the entire sludge floc in the outer layer of the sludge and inside the sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased table 1 indicating that the degree of inhibition of sludge activity by the ps nps was related to the ps np concentration when ps nps were not added the fluorescence intensity from live bacteria in most locations inside the activated sludge was higher than that from dead bacteria fig 5 a after exposure to ps nps the relative ratio of the fluorescence intensity from dead bacteria in the external sludge floc layer and the inner layer increased but that from dead bacteria in the inner sludge floc layer increased more than that in the external layer fig 5b e when the concentration of ps nps was 5 g l the fluorescence intensity from dead bacteria in the sludge was much greater than that from live bacteria potentially because the ps nps adsorbed on the surface of the sludge not only killed the bacteria in the outer layer of the floc but also affected the mass transfer in the sludge floc these effects eventually led to the death of a large number of microorganisms in the sludge because they could not obtain enough do which in turn affected the activity of the sludge the death of bacteria inside the sludge would lead to the disintegration of sludge flocs affecting the sedimentation performance of the sludge 3 5 the effect of ps np exposure on the activated sludge aggregation capacity 3 5 1 aggregation ability of the activated sludge the aggregation degree of sludge suspensions after ps np exposure is shown in fig 6 the aggregation degree of the sludge suspensions increased rapidly after 1 h and became stable after 4 h at a concentration of 0 1 g l ps nps there was no significant change in the aggregation degree compared with that in the control group when the concentration of ps nps was 0 5 g l or 1 g l the aggregation degree decreased 10 4 and 16 5 respectively compared with that in the control group when the concentration of ps nps was 5 g l the aggregation degree decreased almost 50 compared with that in the control group this result confirmed that ps np exposure decreased the aggregation ability of the sludge the adhesion of microbial aggregates in suspension is affected by electrostatic forces 31 hence it can be inferred that the change in sludge aggregation capacity may be related to the change in the zeta potential 3 5 2 zeta potential of the activated sludge as the ps np concentration increased the zeta potential on the surface of the activated sludge significantly increased fig 7 a because a large number of ps nps with a zeta potential of 20 1 0 2 mv were adsorbed by the sludge an increased zeta potential indicates increased electronegativity of the activated sludge and increased repulsive potential energy between flocs which makes it difficult for the flocs to contact and coagulate ultimately affecting the sedimentation performance of the sludge 3 5 3 eps content and spectral analysis activated sludge flocs have a loose structure and microbial flocs are formed by the eps generated by bacteria and various viscous substances eps are mainly composed of extracellular proteins and extracellular polysaccharides which play an important role in improving long term system efficiency 32 as the ps np concentration increased the extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide content of the activated sludge significantly decreased fig 7b in the control group the protein and polysaccharide contents in the activated sludge were 44 49 mg l and 8 57 mg l respectively in the activated sludge exposed to 5 g l ps nps the protein and polysaccharide contents were 23 58 mg l and 5 55 mg l respectively reflecting decreases of 47 9 and 35 2 respectively obviously the effect of ps nps on the protein content of eps was greater than that on the polysaccharide content feng et al also found that ps nps can destroy tryptophan protein like substances in eps resulting in a reduction in protein concentration 21 previous studies have shown that the ratio of extracellular proteins to extracellular polysaccharides is positively correlated with the sludge aggregation capacity 33 34 in this study the ratio of extracellular proteins to extracellular polysaccharides gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased fig 7b thereby reducing the sludge aggregation ability which in turn affected the sludge sedimentation performance in the ftir spectra of the eps fig 7c the positions and number of bands before and after ps np exposure are very similar indicating that the types of chemical groups are similar however careful observation of the peak intensities reveals that the relative contents of chemical groups are significantly different the peak at approximately 3343 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of hydrophilic oh groups 35 this phenomenon was obviously enhanced by the added ps nps the peak near 1630 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of c o groups in proteins 36 37 and its intensity was significantly stronger than that in the absence of ps nps the band at approximately 1080 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of c o c groups in polysaccharides 38 which increased significantly after exposure to ps nps the peak near 1413 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the hydrophobic functional group ch2 39 which decreased after adding ps nps compared with the peak intensities in the absence of ps nps the peaks at approximately 1452 cm 1 747 cm 1 and 695 cm 1 decreased in intensity after ps nps were added these results indicated that ps np exposure increased the content of hydrophilic functional groups such as oh and c o in eps and decreased that of hydrophobic functional groups these effects led to an increase in the zeta potential of the eps which in turn inhibited sludge aggregation these results further explained the effect of ps np exposure on sludge aggregation from the perspective of chemical structure 4 discussion in this study a wide range of ps np concentrations 0 1 5 g l were applied in short term exposure experiments to evaluate the potential impact of nanoplastics on activated sludge activity and sedimentation although the typical concentration of nanoplastics in the environment has yet to be confirmed owing to the limitations of the current separation technology a previous study reported that the microplastic concentration in wwtps is approximately 1 60 56 4 103 particles kg dry sludge 11 assuming that the microplastics in wwtps were all polystyrene beads 1 mm ρ 1 05 g cm3 and the mlvss was approximately 2 g l the microplastic concentration could be estimated to be approximately 0 01 0 5 g l microplastics and nanoplastics are gradually increasing in the environment everaert et al predicted that the microplastic concentration in the ocean would reach 48 8 particles m 3 in 2100 which is a 50 fold increase compared to the present concentrations 40 the concentration of ps nps in this study was the same as that in feng et al 21 fu et al applied nanoplastic concentrations of 0 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 g l to investigate the effect of nanoplastics on anaerobic digestion systems 17 the concentration range of ps nps evaluated in this study spanned from low to high concentrations low concentrations are similar to realistic environmental concentrations whereas high concentrations could view as a proof of concept and be used to predict risk therefore the investigated ps np concentration range has reference value nanoplastics have a very large specific surface area 41 which increases their contact with microbes this study found that ps nps at 5 g l could be completely adsorbed by activated sludge and transferred from the aqueous phase to the sludge phase in a short period activated sludge has a strong adsorption ability for ps nps the nanoplastics entering the activated sludge process can be quickly adsorbed by the activated sludge and the risk of entering the water environment with the effluent is small we found that after short term exposure to ps nps the activated sludge activity was reduced by analysing the ratio of live bacteria to dead bacteria in the sludge it was found that ps np exposure increased the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge potentially because the nanoplastics adsorbed on the surface of the bacteria stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species ros and caused lipid peroxidation destroying the cell membrane structure 18 42 interestingly with the increase in ps np concentration the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge centre decreased more than the ratio in the outer layer of sludge showing that ps nps can not only kill bacteria but also affect the mass transfer in sludge flocs the sem images confirmed this finding a large number of ps nps were adsorbed on the surface of the sludge blocking the pores on the sludge surface these pores are the channels for material exchange between the microbial aggregates and the outside 29 30 therefore blocking these pores affects the mass transfer in the sludge and the microorganisms inside the sludge die because they cannot obtain enough do an effect of ps nps on sludge mass transfer has not been proposed in previous studies the sedimentation of activated sludge is the key factor that determines the quality of effluent from wwtps however the effect of nanoplastics on the sedimentation of sludge is unknown after ps np exposure the sedimentation of sludge changed which may have been caused by the following 1 the surface pores of the activated sludge decreased after adsorbing a large amount of nanoplastics this process hindered the delivery of do to the activated sludge and affected the mass transfer of the activated sludge as a result the sludge disintegrated and had difficulty settling 2 the nanoplastics adsorbed on the surface of the flocs increased the hydrophilic functional groups and reduced the hydrophobic functional groups in the eps resulting in an increase in the zeta potential studies have shown that increasing the zeta potential can increase the repulsive potential energy making it difficult for sludge to accumulate well 43 44 sludge with a highly negatively charged structure is in an extended state forming a carpet like structure and inhibiting sludge settling 45 3 previous studies have shown that the protein polysaccharide ratio is positively correlated with hydrophobicity 46 the ratio between proteins and polysaccharides in eps gradually decreased as the concentration of nanoplastics increased indicating that nanoplastics impact extracellular proteins more than extracellular polysaccharides the decrease in the protein polysaccharide ratio can change the hydrophobicity and affect the sludge aggregation ability and sedimentation nanoplastics can affect the performance of activated sludge understanding the effect of short term nanoplastic exposure on activated sludge performance is critical to eliminating or reducing the influence of nanoplastics on biological wastewater treatment nanoplastics can be quickly adsorbed by activated sludge in large quantities by regulating the hydraulic retention time hrt the nanoplastics produced in the influent can be completely transferred into the sludge phase reducing the concentration of nanoplastics in the effluent and reducing the pollution of natural water bodies in addition the effect of nanoplastics on activated sludge is related to their concentration therefore the concentration of nanoplastics in sludge can be regulated to a certain extent by regulating the sludge retention time srt and sludge discharge reducing the impact of the nanoplastics on the sludge performance and ensuring the stability of the wwtp effluent 5 conclusion in this study the performance of activated sludge after short term exposure to nanoplastics was evaluated and ps nps at 5 g l could be adsorbed completely by activated sludge a low concentration of ps nps 0 1 g l significantly inhibited the endogenous respiration in the sludge because ps nps not only caused bacterial death but also inhibited the mass transfer in the sludge the sedimentation of activated sludge gradually decreased as the ps np concentration increased after short term exposure to ps nps because of the change in the zeta potential and eps components ps nps also caused sludge disintegration which decreased the sedimentation of the sludge short term ps np exposure had a significant effect on the activity and sedimentation of activated sludge which could provide new insight for evaluating the potential risks

13771,this research investigated the effectiveness of bipolar membrane electrodialysis coupled with fluidized bed crystallization and coagulation flocculation with fecl3 for removing potential membrane foulants from reverse osmosis ro concentrate solutions produced during reclamation of municipally treated wastewater the goal of the treatment process was to produce water with low concentrations of potential foulants that could be subjected to a high recovery secondary ro process effluent from the secondary clarifier at a municipal wastewater treatment plant was treated by ultrafiltration and ro at a recovery of 60 65 the ro concentrate solution was then fed into a fluidized bed crystallization reactor operating at a ph value of 11 5 calcium magnesium silica and dissolved organic matter were removed from the ro concentrate via precipitation of mineral solids on 60 mesh garnet sand the acid and base utilized in the fluidized bed crystallization reactor was produced using bipolar membrane electrodialysis from the treated ro concentrate solution after polishing with coagulation flocculation with fecl3 the treatment system was able to remove 84 of ca2 93 of ba2 99 of mg2 80 of total organic carbon toc and 68 of dissolved silica from the ro concentrate solutions the product water produced by the system contained mostly na cl and so4 2 ions with 10 mg l ca2 and sio2 2 mg l toc and 1 mg l mg2 the electrical energy for operating the bipolar membrane electrodialysis cell amounted to 110 kw h per kmol of acid and base produced which translates to 3 5 kw h m3 of treated ro concentrate keywords ro concentrate water reclamation bipolar membrane electrodialysis eem spectra nom removal 1 introduction in recent years there has been considerable research on removing membrane foulants from reverse osmosis ro concentrate solutions prior to a second stage of ro 1 2 the types and concentrations of potential membrane foulants in the ro concentrate will dictate the most appropriate treatment methods for ro treatment of brackish waters scale forming mineral species are the dominant membrane foulants in ro concentrate methods used to remove mineral species such as ca2 mg2 ba2 and sio2 include lime softening 3 seeded slurry precipitation 4 7 pellet softening 8 11 electrodialysis 12 14 and electrocoagulation 15 16 in water reclamation operations the biggest challenge for ro treatment is removal of organic matter removal of organic matter from ro concentrates has been performed using a variety of advanced oxidation processes 14 17 22 14 coagulation flocculation with iron and aluminum salts 19 23 24 19 ultrafiltration 25 microfiltration 26 ion exchange 27 granular activated carbon 28 powder activated carbon 26 biologically activated carbon 14 and other microbial processes 29 reclamation of municipally treated wastewater is one of the more challenging applications of ro in many cases the water contains both high levels of mineral species and organic matter the organic matter in treated wastewater is particularly troublesome due to the presence of autochthonous organic matter produced during the activated sludge process this organic matter consists of microbially produced extracellular polysaccharides and proteinaceous material that have high membrane fouling potentials recently fluidized bed crystallization was found to remove 99 of autochthonous organic matter from secondary effluent wastewater 30 this organic matter was removed via adsorption onto and incorporation into precipitated mineral solids containing ca2 mg2 co3 2 and sio2 in comparison coagulation flocculation with ferric chloride and ultrafiltration were able to achieve less than 50 removal of this high fouling potential organic matter the main drawback to fluidized bed crystallization processes for water treatment is the need for continuous chemical addition for raising and lowering the ph during the treatment process in addition to being the most costly aspect of fluidized bed crystallization acid and base addition increases the total dissolved solids tds concentration of the water this aspect is particularly problematic in water reuse applications where the water already contains elevated tds levels bipolar membrane electrodialysis using ro concentrate solutions has been proposed as a method for producing acid and base needed in water treatment operations 31 32 in this process ro concentrate solutions are converted to acid base and deionized water streams the operating costs for producing acid and base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis have been found to be less than the cost of purchasing these chemicals in bulk quantities 33 and onsite production makes it an attractive alternative from a safety perspective the goal of this research was to determine the effectiveness of fluidized bed crystallization coupled with bipolar membrane electrodialysis for removing potential membrane foulants from ro concentrate generated from treatment of secondary effluent wastewater removal of membrane foulants will enable increased water recovery during a second stage ro process the ro concentrate used in this investigation was produced from secondary effluent wastewater treated by ultrafiltration followed by ro the ro concentrate was treated by fluidized bed crystallization coagulation flocculation with fecl3 and nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis was used to produce the acids and bases needed for the treatment system potential foulants for a second stage ro process were removed in the treatment system and the possibility of developing a near zero liquid discharge zld process was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 ro concentrate feed effluent water from the secondary clarifier at the agua nueva water reclamation facility in pima county arizona was piped to the co located water and energy sustainable technology west center where the water was treated using ultrafiltration two dow integraflux uxa 2680xp and a ro system 12 dow filmtec tw30 4040 elements operating at 60 65 recovery this water was used as the feed to the treatment system depicted in fig 1 the secondary effluent wastewater contained high levels of both inorganic and organic membrane foulants as listed in table 1 the high foulant load limited the maximum ro recovery to less than 65 and necessitated weekly cleaning with acid and caustic solutions the ro concentrate brine was used as the feed solution for this study as shown in fig 1 2 2 treatment system the treatment system consisted of a fluidized bed crystallization reactor fbcr bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed coagulation flocculation with fecl3 microfiltration and nanofiltration nf as illustrated in fig 1 acid and base for the process was generated via bmed using the nf permeate as the feed solution the nf concentrate solution was recycled to the feed for the fbcr thereby eliminating the generation of a waste stream the

pipe housing a 150 cm long bed of 60 garnet sand the brine solution was fed into the bottom of the reactor and the bmed generated base solution ph 12 20 12 65 was injected into the fbcr via four injection ports along the length of the bed with 50 cm spacing the effluent ph of the fbcr was maintained at 11 5 using a variable speed pump controlled by a signet model 8900 controller the feed water flowrate into the fbcr was 2 27 lpm which produced a 15 20 bed expansion effluent from the fbcr was passed through a 50 cm long polypropylene aquaboon 5 μm filter to remove any suspended precipitates the effluent from the microfilter was fed into a 200 l tank where it was mixed with a 1 ferric chloride solution to achieve an iron dose of 90 mg l effluent from the coagulation

feed was produced by the treatment system itself as indicated in fig 1 the flowrate for the electrode rinse acid base and diluate compartments was 1 1 lpm the electrode rinse solutions were recirculated to the feed tank after passing through a 50 cm block carbon filter to remove any anodically generated hypochlorite the bmed stack was operated galvanostatically at a current density of 22

water quality the diluate solution produced by the treatment system was used as the input for the simulation modeling the performance of a dow filmtec bw30 400 membrane for brackish water potential water recoveries in the simulations were limited by a calcite langlier saturation index lsi of 1 8 and or a sio2 supersaturation of 200 with the use of antiscalants these values are normally achievable without significant membrane fouling 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineral removal properties of the ro concentrate and feed tank solutions are shown in table 1 also shown in table 1 are the properties of the product water from the system after 5 and 24 h of operation the ro concentrate solution was supersaturated with respect to several mineral species saturation indices for potentially scale forming mineral species in the ro concentrate at its initial ph value of 8 3 and at ph 11 5 in the fbcr are shown in table 2 the base dose required to raise the ph of the ro concentrate to 11 5 was 31 6 meq per liter of ro concentrate treated the feed brine solution was supersaturated with respect to caco3 camg co3 2 baso4 and camg3 co3 4 at the ph of the fbcr the solution became additionally saturated with mg oh 2 except for barite the saturation index for all the supersaturated mineral species increased considerably due to the 3 2 unit increase in the solution ph value in the fbcr for barite which is a sulfate mineral the saturation index decreased slightly between the ro concentrate and the fbcr due to dilution by the base solution added to the fbcr the fbcr was most effective for removing divalent cations with removals ranging from 84 to 99 9 as shown in table 3 fig 2 shows ca2 mg2 ba2 and sio2 concentrations at different points in the treatment system after 24 h of operation and table 3 lists the fractional removal of these species by the fbcr and fecl3 the fbcr was most effective for removing mg2 with 99 9 removal there was no measurable mg2 removal by fecl3 and the diluate solution contained the remaining 0 1 of the mg2 entering the system in the ro concentrate the fbcr was also effective for removing ba2 from the solution with 93 removed there was no ba2 removal at other points in the system and diluate contained 7 of the ba2 entering the system from the ro concentrate the fbcr was able to remove 84 of the ca2 as shown in table 3 in addition fecl3 was able to remove 7 of the ca2 leaving 9 of the influent ca2 exiting the system via the diluate solution dissolved silica was less effectively removed by the fbcr compared to the divalent cations with 34 sio2 removal ferric chloride was also able to remove 34 of the influent sio2 resulting in 32 of the sio2 remaining in the diluate solution acid addition and coagulation with fecl3 reduced the ph of the solution from 11 5 to 5 6 6 0 the dissolved iron concentration after fecl3 treatment was 230 μg l which is a tolerable level for nf after both 5 and 24 h of operation the diluate solution was undersaturated with respect to all the possible scale forming mineral species as shown in table 2 as shown in fig 2 the permeate from the nf contained 0 3 mg l of mg2 and 15 mg l of ca2 these species may form precipitates at the high ph values present in the base compartment of the bmed cell to minimize this problem half of the acid produced by the bmed cell was fed back into the feed tank for the bmed cell as shown in fig 1 this resulted in the feed solution to the bmed cell having a ph value of 2 5 the low ph of the feed solution had two effects on minimizing mineral scale in the base compartment firstly it converted bicarbonate to dissolved co2 and strip it from solution secondly it lowered the maximum ph of the base produced by the cell to minimize mg oh 2 precipitation thermodynamic calculations using the phreeqc 39 modeling program and the solution parameters listed in table 1 of the supplementary material yield a saturation index si for caco3 of 1 1 at the effluent of the base compartment of the bmed cell this indicates that the solution was not saturated with respect to caco3 the si for mg oh 2 in the effluent base stream was 2 8 indicating supersaturation therefore precipitation of mg oh 2 on the cation exchange membrane may be a problem in long term operation however the low magnesium concentrations in the feed solution to the bmed cell would result in a slow build up of precipitates on the membrane previous research has found that mg oh 2 precipitates can be completely removed from cation exchange membranes in bmed cells using 60 s of ultrasound and a 1 hcl solution 42 3 2 organic matter removal concentrations of toc and doc at different points in the system are shown in fig 3 more than 90 of the toc in the ro concentrate was dissolved organic carbon defined as passing through a 0 45 μm filter the fbcr was able to remove 27 of the toc as shown in table 3 the type of toc removed in the fbcr consisted mostly of humic and fulvic acids as indicated by the eem spectra in fig 4 coagulation and flocculation with fecl3 was able to remove 53 of the toc entering the system combined with 27 toc removal in the fbcr table 3 shows that 80 of the toc entering the system was removed leaving 20 of the toc in the diluate solution excitation emission matrix eem was used to characterize the toc present in the water according to previous studies there are five common types of nom that are present in surface waters 1 tyrosine like aromatic proteins 2 tryptophan like aromatic proteins 3 fulvic acid like matter 4 soluble microbial byproduct like matter and 5 humic acid like matter 30 each of these matters are associated with a region in an eem spectra that are shown in table 4 36 to achieve a sustainable closed loop treatment system it is important that all types of nom are removed so that there is no buildup of any one type in the system fig 4 shows the eem spectra at different points in the treatment system and indicates that the fbcr was able to remove all types of nom with higher removals of tyrosine like aromatic protein and tryptophan like aromatic protein similar to the fbcr coagulation flocculation with ferric chloride was capable of removing all types of nom with higher removals for fulvic acid like matter and humic acid like matter thus nom removal by the fbcr and ferric chloride were complementary in the types of nom that are most effectively removed recycle of the nf concentrate resulted in changing concentrations in the feed tank with elapsed time of operation as shown in fig 5 the concentrations of na and cl in the feed tank increased over the first 13 h of operation due to the use of 0 25 m nacl as the initial feed solution to the bmed cell concentrations of ca2 mg2 and sio2 declined with elapsed time of operation due to recycle of the nf concentrate that had lower levels of these species as compared to the ro concentrate solution sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the feed tank increased with elapsed time since there was negligible removal of these species in the treatment system toc levels in the feed tank varied between 17 and 25 mg l over the course of operation this can be attributed to variable toc in the ro concentrate stream as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary material the declining concentrations of ca2 and sio2 in the feed tank over time resulted in decreased removal of these species in the fbcr as shown in table 5 this can be attributed to lower saturation indices and has been observed in previous studies of fbcr performance 43 44 for mg2 the removal at 5 h was 26 mg l and the removal at 24 h was very similar at 24 7 mg l this indicates that the amount of mg2 removal in the fbcr was less sensitive to its influent concentration this may result from more complex removal mechanisms for mg2 than for ca2 and sio2 previous studies of fluidized bed crystallization have shown that mg2 removal occurs via several mechanisms including formation of mgo sio2 x h2o x mg oh 2 camg co3 2 and insoluble precipitates with organic matter 45 as shown in fig 6 a the na and cl concentrations in the diluate decreased with elapsed time as the effects of the initial 0 25 m nacl bmed feed solution diminished over time after 24 h of operation the mg2 concentration in the diluate solution was below 0 7 mg l and was still gradually declining the toc concentration in the diluate was below 1 9 mg l and was also declining the ca2 and sio2 concentrations in the diluate had stabilized at 10 mg l after 24 h however the so4 2 concentrations in the diluate were still increasing but were significantly below the 800 mg l level in the ro concentrate solution given that there was no measurable removal of so4 2 in the treatment system the sulfate concentration in the system will increase until its concentration in the diluate is the same as that in the ro concentrate thus the potential membrane foulants in the steady state diluate solution will consist of 1 mg l of mg2 2 mg l toc and 10 mg l of ca2 and sio2 3 3 bmed operation the bmed cell was operated galvanostatically at a current density of 22 ma cm2 and a total current of 8 36 a the current was set to produce the amount of base needed to maintain the fbcr ph value at 11 5 the cell voltage for each of the 11 unit cells in the bmed stack was 3 0 1 v voltage variations resulted from varying salt concentrations in the feed tank to the bmed cell the current efficiency for acid and base production averaged 75 the feed solution flow rates through the acid and base compartments of the cell averaged 1 14 liters per minute but varied by 0 25 lpm to maintain constant fluid levels in the acid and base tanks the effect of salt concentration salt type current density flow rate bipolar membrane type and produced acid and base concentrations on the efficiencies and energy requirements for producing acid and base by this cell have been previously reported 33 the energy required for producing 1 kmol of acid and base can be determined from the average operating voltage per cell 3 0 v and average current efficiency of 75

1 8 for caco3 precipitation and a sio2 supersaturation of 200 as shown in table 5 the expected recovery from the diluate solution by a second stage ro process exceeds 99 at this recovery the lsi is 1 01 which is only half the lsi that was achievable in the first stage ro the limiting factor for the second stage ro is predicted to be sio2 precipitation which had a saturation index of 182 although the saturation index for baso4 was 163 in the hypothetical second stage concentrate solution this is not likely to be problematic given that the first stage ro was able to operate at a baso4 saturation index of 2740 4 conclusions this research showed that fluidized bed crystallization combined with coagulation flocculation with fecl3 was able to treat ro concentrate to an extent where a second stage ro process could achieve very high recovery this process may be able to achieve near zero liquid discharge for water reclamation process sustainability was enhanced by the use of bipolar membrane electrodialysis for producing the acid and base needed to operate the system the electrical energy required for operating the bmed stack was 110 kw h per kmol of acid and base produced this translates to 3 5 kw h per m3 of treated ro concentrate this amount of energy compares favorably to other methods for concentrate treatment prior to secondary ro such as electrodialysis reversal 7 8 kw h m3 1 and uv h2o2 10 12 kw h m3 46 a second stage ro process operating similarly to the first stage ro would consume approximately 2 kw h per m3 of ro permeate 1 thus converting first stage ro concentrate into the permeate of a second stage process would consume approximately 5 5 kw h m3 this also compares favorably to other methods of brine disposal such as membrane distillation 10 13 kw h

13771,this research investigated the effectiveness of bipolar membrane electrodialysis coupled with fluidized bed crystallization and coagulation flocculation with fecl3 for removing potential membrane foulants from reverse osmosis ro concentrate solutions produced during reclamation of municipally treated wastewater the goal of the treatment process was to produce water with low concentrations of potential foulants that could be subjected to a high recovery secondary ro process effluent from the secondary clarifier at a municipal wastewater treatment plant was treated by ultrafiltration and ro at a recovery of 60 65 the ro concentrate solution was then fed into a fluidized bed crystallization reactor operating at a ph value of 11 5 calcium magnesium silica and dissolved organic matter were removed from the ro concentrate via precipitation of mineral solids on 60 mesh garnet sand the acid and base utilized in the fluidized bed crystallization reactor was produced using bipolar membrane electrodialysis from the treated ro concentrate solution after polishing with coagulation flocculation with fecl3 the treatment system was able to remove 84 of ca2 93 of ba2 99 of mg2 80 of total organic carbon toc and 68 of dissolved silica from the ro concentrate solutions the product water produced by the system contained mostly na cl and so4 2 ions with 10 mg l ca2 and sio2 2 mg l toc and 1 mg l mg2 the electrical energy for operating the bipolar membrane electrodialysis cell amounted to 110 kw h per kmol of acid and base produced which translates to 3 5 kw h m3 of treated ro concentrate keywords ro concentrate water reclamation bipolar membrane electrodialysis eem spectra nom removal 1 introduction in recent years there has been considerable research on removing membrane foulants from reverse osmosis ro concentrate solutions prior to a second stage of ro 1 2 the types and concentrations of potential membrane foulants in the ro concentrate will dictate the most appropriate treatment methods for ro treatment of brackish waters scale forming mineral species are the dominant membrane foulants in ro concentrate methods used to remove mineral species such as ca2 mg2 ba2 and sio2 include lime softening 3 seeded slurry precipitation 4 7 pellet softening 8 11 electrodialysis 12 14 and electrocoagulation 15 16 in water reclamation operations the biggest challenge for ro treatment is removal of organic matter removal of organic matter from ro concentrates has been performed using a variety of advanced oxidation processes 14 17 22 14 coagulation flocculation with iron and aluminum salts 19 23 24 19 ultrafiltration 25 microfiltration 26 ion exchange 27 granular activated carbon 28 powder activated carbon 26 biologically activated carbon 14 and other microbial processes 29 reclamation of municipally treated wastewater is one of the more challenging applications of ro in many cases the water contains both high levels of mineral species and organic matter the organic matter in treated wastewater is particularly troublesome due to the presence of autochthonous organic matter produced during the activated sludge process this organic matter consists of microbially produced extracellular polysaccharides and proteinaceous material that have high membrane fouling potentials recently fluidized bed crystallization was found to remove 99 of autochthonous organic matter from secondary effluent wastewater 30 this organic matter was removed via adsorption onto and incorporation into precipitated mineral solids containing ca2 mg2 co3 2 and sio2 in comparison coagulation flocculation with ferric chloride and ultrafiltration were able to achieve less than 50 removal of this high fouling potential organic matter the main drawback to fluidized bed crystallization processes for water treatment is the need for continuous chemical addition for raising and lowering the ph during the treatment process in addition to being the most costly aspect of fluidized bed crystallization acid and base addition increases the total dissolved solids tds concentration of the water this aspect is particularly problematic in water reuse applications where the water already contains elevated tds levels bipolar membrane electrodialysis using ro concentrate solutions has been proposed as a method for producing acid and base needed in water treatment operations 31 32 in this process ro concentrate solutions are converted to acid base and deionized water streams the operating costs for producing acid and base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis have been found to be less than the cost of purchasing these chemicals in bulk quantities 33 and onsite production makes it an attractive alternative from a safety perspective the goal of this research was to determine the effectiveness of fluidized bed crystallization coupled with bipolar membrane electrodialysis for removing potential membrane foulants from ro concentrate generated from treatment of secondary effluent wastewater removal of membrane foulants will enable increased water recovery during a second stage ro process the ro concentrate used in this investigation was produced from secondary effluent wastewater treated by ultrafiltration followed by ro the ro concentrate was treated by fluidized bed crystallization coagulation flocculation with fecl3 and nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis was used to produce the acids and bases needed for the treatment system potential foulants for a second stage ro process were removed in the treatment system and the possibility of developing a near zero liquid discharge zld process was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 ro concentrate feed effluent water from the secondary clarifier at the agua nueva water reclamation facility in pima county arizona was piped to the co located water and energy sustainable technology west center where the water was treated using ultrafiltration two dow integraflux uxa 2680xp and a ro system 12 dow filmtec tw30 4040 elements operating at 60 65 recovery this water was used as the feed to the treatment system depicted in fig 1 the secondary effluent wastewater contained high levels of both inorganic and organic membrane foulants as listed in table 1 the high foulant load limited the maximum ro recovery to less than 65 and necessitated weekly cleaning with acid and caustic solutions the ro concentrate brine was used as the feed solution for this study as shown in fig 1 2 2 treatment system the treatment system consisted of a fluidized bed crystallization reactor fbcr bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed coagulation flocculation with fecl3 microfiltration and nanofiltration nf as illustrated in fig 1 acid and base for the process was generated via bmed using the nf permeate as the feed solution the nf concentrate solution was recycled to the feed for the fbcr thereby eliminating the generation of a waste stream the product water from this system is the bmed diluate solution which can then be subjected to a second stage ro process the fbcr reactor consisted of a 280 cm tall by 15 25 cm internal diameter clear pvc pipe housing a 150 cm long bed of 60 garnet sand the brine solution was fed into the bottom of the reactor and the bmed generated base solution ph 12 20 12 65 was injected into the fbcr via four injection ports along the length of the bed with 50 cm spacing the effluent ph of the fbcr was maintained at 11 5 using a variable speed pump controlled by a signet model 8900 controller the feed water flowrate into the fbcr was 2 27 lpm which produced a 15 20 bed expansion effluent from the fbcr was passed through a 50 cm long polypropylene aquaboon 5 μm filter to remove any suspended precipitates the effluent from the microfilter was fed into a 200 l tank where it was mixed with a 1 ferric chloride solution to achieve an iron dose of 90 mg l effluent from the coagulation flocculation process was passed through a 50 cm long polypropylene aquaboon 5 μm filter contained in standard filter housing the best fecl3 dose was determined using jar tests as described in the supplementary materials effluent from the post coagulation filter was fed into a loose nf membrane econopure epws nf1a that had high removal 85 for divalent ions and low removal 15 for monovalent ions the purpose of the nf membrane was to remove organic matter and divalent ions that may foul the ion exchange membranes in the bmed stack the nf permeate containing mostly monovalent ions was fed to the bmed cell to generate the acid and base needed at different stages of treatment process a pccell edq380 electrodialysis unit pc cell gmbh heusweiler germany was used for the bmed process the cell housing was made of polypropylene and had 380 cm2 of active area per membrane the stack contained 11 unit cells as illustrated in figure s3 in the supplementary material membrane spacers made of epdm rubber and polypropylene mesh were placed between each membrane pair forming 195 mm 195 mm 0 66 mm flow channels the spacing between the electrodes and the cation exchange membranes terminating each end of the stack was approximately 2 2 mm the cathode was made of an expanded stainless steel mesh and the anode was made of expanded titanium mesh with a platinum iridium oxide coating the anion exchange membrane neosepta acm was 0 17 mm thick and had an exchange capacity of 1 4 1 7 meq g the cation exchange membrane neosepta cmx was 0 18 mm thick and had an exchange capacity of 1 5 1 8 meq g the bipolar membrane was a 0 22 mm thick neosepta bp 1 bipolar membrane the treatment system was started using 500 liters of a 0 25 m nacl solution as the feed to the bmed stack thereafter the bmed feed was produced by the treatment system itself as indicated in fig 1 the flowrate for the electrode rinse acid base and diluate compartments was 1 1 lpm the electrode rinse solutions were recirculated to the feed tank after passing through a 50 cm block carbon filter to remove any anodically generated hypochlorite the bmed stack was operated galvanostatically at a current density of 22 ma cm2 which resulted in voltage differentials of 3 0 v unit cell the ph of grab samples was measured using an aquapro 9156apwp epoxy body ph probe and a symphony sb90m5 multimeter 2 3 analytical

water recoveries in the simulations were limited by a calcite langlier saturation index lsi of 1 8 and or a sio2 supersaturation of 200 with the use of antiscalants these values are normally achievable without significant membrane fouling 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineral removal properties of the ro concentrate and feed tank solutions are shown in table 1 also shown in table 1 are the properties of the product water from the system after 5 and 24 h of operation the ro concentrate solution was supersaturated with respect to several mineral species saturation indices for potentially scale forming mineral species in the ro concentrate at its initial ph value of 8 3 and at ph 11 5 in the fbcr are shown in table 2 the base dose required to raise the ph of the ro concentrate to 11 5 was 31 6 meq per liter of ro concentrate treated the feed brine solution was supersaturated with respect to caco3 camg co3 2 baso4 and camg3 co3 4 at the ph of the fbcr the solution became additionally saturated with mg oh 2 except for barite the saturation index for all the supersaturated mineral species increased considerably due to the 3 2 unit increase in the solution ph value in the fbcr for barite which is a sulfate mineral the saturation index decreased slightly between the ro concentrate and the fbcr due to dilution by the base solution added to the fbcr the fbcr was most effective for removing divalent cations with removals ranging from 84 to 99 9 as shown in table 3 fig 2 shows ca2 mg2 ba2 and sio2 concentrations at different points in the treatment system after 24 h of operation and table 3 lists the fractional removal of these species by the fbcr and fecl3 the fbcr was most effective for removing mg2 with 99 9 removal there was no measurable mg2 removal by fecl3 and the diluate solution contained the remaining 0 1 of the mg2 entering the system in the ro concentrate the fbcr was also effective for removing ba2 from the solution

in table 3 in addition fecl3 was able to remove 7 of the ca2 leaving 9 of the influent ca2 exiting the system via the diluate solution dissolved silica was less effectively removed by the fbcr compared to the divalent cations with 34 sio2 removal ferric chloride was also able to remove 34 of the influent sio2 resulting in 32 of the sio2 remaining in the diluate solution acid addition and coagulation with fecl3 reduced the ph of the solution from 11 5 to 5 6 6 0 the dissolved iron concentration after fecl3 treatment was 230 μg l which is a tolerable level for nf after both 5 and 24 h of operation the diluate solution was undersaturated with respect to all the possible scale forming mineral species as shown in table 2 as shown in fig 2 the permeate from the nf contained 0 3 mg l of mg2 and 15 mg l of ca2 these species may form precipitates at the high ph values present in the base compartment of the bmed cell to minimize this problem half of the acid produced by the bmed cell was fed back into the feed tank for the bmed cell as shown in fig 1 this resulted in the feed solution to the bmed cell having a ph value of 2 5 the low ph of the feed solution had two effects on minimizing mineral scale in the base compartment firstly it converted bicarbonate to dissolved co2 and strip it from solution secondly it lowered the maximum ph of the base produced by the cell to minimize mg oh 2 precipitation thermodynamic calculations using the phreeqc 39 modeling program and the solution parameters listed in table 1 of the supplementary material yield a saturation index si for caco3 of 1 1 at the effluent of the base compartment of the bmed cell this indicates that the solution was not saturated with respect to caco3 the si for mg oh 2 in the effluent base stream was 2 8 indicating supersaturation therefore precipitation of mg oh 2 on the cation exchange membrane may be a problem in long term operation however the low magnesium concentrations in the feed solution to the bmed cell would result in a slow build up of precipitates on the membrane previous research has found that mg oh 2 precipitates can be completely removed from cation exchange membranes in bmed cells using 60 s of ultrasound and a 1 hcl solution 42 3 2 organic matter removal concentrations of toc and doc at different points in the system are shown in fig 3 more than 90 of the toc in the ro concentrate was dissolved organic carbon defined as passing through a 0 45 μm filter the fbcr was able to remove 27 of the toc as shown in table 3 the type of toc removed in the fbcr consisted mostly of humic and fulvic acids as indicated by the eem spectra in fig 4 coagulation and flocculation with fecl3 was able to remove 53 of the toc entering the system combined with 27 toc removal in the fbcr table 3 shows that 80 of the toc entering the system was removed leaving 20 of the toc in the diluate solution excitation emission matrix eem was used to characterize the toc present in the water according to previous studies there are five common types of nom that are present in surface waters 1 tyrosine like aromatic proteins 2 tryptophan like aromatic proteins 3 fulvic acid like matter 4 soluble microbial byproduct like matter and 5 humic acid like matter 30 each of these matters are associated with a region in an eem spectra that are shown in table 4 36 to achieve a sustainable

sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the feed tank increased with elapsed time since there was negligible removal of these species in the treatment system toc levels in the feed tank varied between 17 and 25 mg l over the course of operation this can be attributed to variable toc in the ro concentrate stream as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary material the declining concentrations of ca2 and sio2 in the feed tank over time resulted in decreased removal of these species in the fbcr as shown in table 5 this can be attributed to lower saturation indices and has been observed in previous studies of fbcr performance 43 44 for mg2 the removal at 5 h was 26 mg l and the removal at 24 h was very similar at 24 7 mg l this indicates that the amount of mg2 removal in the fbcr was less

occurs via several mechanisms including formation of mgo sio2 x h2o x mg oh 2 camg co3 2 and insoluble precipitates with organic matter 45 as shown in fig 6 a the na and cl concentrations in the diluate decreased with elapsed time as the effects of the initial 0 25 m nacl bmed feed solution diminished over time after 24 h of operation the mg2 concentration in the diluate solution was below 0 7 mg l and was still gradually declining the toc concentration in the diluate was below 1 9 mg l and was also declining the ca2 and sio2 concentrations in the diluate had stabilized at 10 mg l after 24 h however the so4 2 concentrations in the diluate were still increasing but were significantly below the 800 mg l level in the ro concentrate solution given that there was no measurable removal of so4 2 in the treatment system the sulfate concentration in the system will increase until its concentration in the diluate is the same as that in the ro concentrate thus the potential membrane

1 8 for caco3 precipitation and a sio2 supersaturation of 200 as shown in table 5 the expected recovery from the diluate solution by a second stage ro process exceeds 99 at this recovery the lsi is 1 01 which is only half the lsi that was achievable in the first stage ro the limiting factor for the second stage ro is predicted to be sio2 precipitation which had a saturation index of 182 although the saturation index for baso4 was 163 in the hypothetical second stage concentrate solution this is not likely to be problematic given that the first stage ro was able to operate at a baso4 saturation index of 2740 4 conclusions this research showed that fluidized bed crystallization combined with coagulation flocculation with fecl3 was able to treat ro concentrate to an extent where a second stage ro process could achieve very high recovery this process may be able to achieve near zero liquid discharge for water reclamation process sustainability was enhanced by the use of bipolar membrane electrodialysis for producing the acid and base needed to operate the system the electrical energy required for operating the bmed stack was 110 kw h per kmol of acid and base produced this translates to 3 5 kw h per m3 of treated ro concentrate this amount of energy compares favorably to other methods for concentrate treatment prior to secondary ro such as electrodialysis reversal 7 8 kw h m3 1 and uv h2o2 10 12 kw h m3 46 a second stage ro process operating similarly to the first stage ro would consume approximately 2 kw h per m3 of ro permeate 1 thus converting first stage ro concentrate into the permeate of a second stage process would consume approximately 5 5 kw h m3 this also compares favorably to other methods of brine disposal such as membrane distillation 10 13 kw h

13772,spectroscopic and morphological properties of different graphene oxide go lanthanide ln composites were analysed with the aim of preparing go membranes for preferential separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions these studies indicated that the extent of ln3 ion uptake on go sheets and consequent carboxylate hydroxide complex formation are strongly determined by interaction ability of ln3 ion relative proportions of go functional groups and ionization of composite ambience membrane filters prepared using fresh and aged go dispersions of varying go concentrations and ph have been evaluated for their individual and overall ln3 ion removal efficiencies among the studied lanthanide ions nd3 and ce3 ions are found to be preferentially separated by fresh go 8 and aged go 16 membranes respectively while eu3 ions are removed moderately under all the membrane preparation conditions preferential separation of these ln3 ions may be attributed to relatively stronger polarization effects and formation of strong chelation bonds during their interaction with functional groups the overall ln removal efficiency of go membranes was found to increase with aging of go 25 54 mass of go on membrane 54 154 and optimum in ph range of 3 5 32 36 which is attributed to availability of large surface area abundant functional groups sufficiently ionized ambience and ample porous go mass for the ln3 ion adsorption keywords graphene oxide lanthanides membrane functional groups filtration 1 introduction separation of lanthanides ln from various resources including ores and minerals mining industrial and reprocessed nuclear wastes has been a major concern in the past few decades owing to their global demand in production of phosphors catalysts ceramics magnets and development of sensors hybrid batteries 1 2 in particular nuclear industrial prerequisites such as fuel element fabrication and selective ion enrichment emerging biological applications including bio labelling bio imaging and bio molecule detection necessitate the production of high pure lanthanides 3 5 however chemical homogeneity and minuscule differences in the physio chemical behaviour of lanthanides have been the prime hurdles for the selective lanthanide recovery and enrichment processes variety of traditional extraction methods including liquid liquid extraction co precipitation fractional crystallization and ion exchange were investigated extensively for both large scale and selective separation of lanthanides from ores minerals and industrial waste 2 6 7 however most of these methods involve multiple extraction sequences reported to be expensive time consuming and leave out large amounts of toxic waste 6 on the other hand adsorption and filtration methods have been investigated as alternates to these traditional methods owing to the recent development of efficient lanthanide adsorbents cost effective and trouble free operation procedures and most importantly less sludge generation 3 8 10 most frequently studied lanthanide adsorbents include impregnated resins 11 mesoporous carbon silica 6 8 12 magnetite metal oxide nanoparticles 3 13 ion imprinted polymer films 14 and graphene oxide go based composites 15 18 for instance awul et al synthesized carboxamide functionalized mesoporous silica for selective adsorption of eu3 125 63 mg g and sm3 124 38 mg g ions from mixed cation solutions where the ion selectivity was attributed to strong affinity of eu3 and sm3 ions towards o and n donors of amide ligand 12 the solid phase lanthanide extraction studies conducted by perreault et al using diglycolamide modified mesoporous carbons demonstrated the necessity and importance of highly reactive anchoring functional groups and rigid ligand structure for the effective and selective sorption of ln3 ions 8 selective lanthanide adsorption and recovery studies carried out by ashour et al using citric acid l cysteine functionalized fe3o4 nanoparticles indicated that ln3 ions are largely captured at negatively charged carboxylate ions by formation of the surface complexes 3 on the other hand graphene oxide go sheets are known to possess most of the above described adsorbent characteristics owing to which go has been widely investigated in recent years as a prime lanthanide adsorbent and for enhancing the sorption efficiencies of other materials as well 19 23 in most of the previous works go functionalized go go composites were evaluated with the aim of obtaining physio chemical and thermodynamic parameters for optimal adsorption of selected ln3 ion sorption mainly through batch adsorption experiments 16 18 for instance hu et al examined the effect of contact time ph ionic strength temperature coexisting electrolyte ions and humic substances on eu iii sorption efficiency of go and reported optimum eu iii sorption 57 60 mg g at ph 7 5 and temperature 338 k 16 in another work chen et al employed colloidal go suspensions of different ph ionic strength and temperatures sealed in dialysis bags for sorption of gd iii ions and achieved maximum gd iii sorption capacity of 286 86 mg g at ph 5 9 and temperature 303 k 18 thiacalixarene functionalized go composite was found to exhibit optimal removal efficiency towards nd iii ions 337 84 mg g from aqueous solutions in the ph range of 6 7 21 furthermore go go composites have also been investigated for adsorption of multiple ln3 ions and table s1 summarizes various go based adsorbents their adsorption efficiency towards each ln3 ion and the optimum experimental conditions 15 22 24 28 in particular research group of xu et al synthesized diverse composites of go using corn zein 25 high gluten flour 26 egg white 27 and maize amylopectin 28 for adsorption of la3 nd3 y3 er3 and yb3 from aqueous solutions among which go egg white composite was found to exhibit the maximum sorption efficiencies towards all the studied ln3 ions table s1 despite frequent efforts on separation of multiple ln3 ions by different go adsorbents definitive information on preferential ln3 ion removal ability of these sorbents particularly in presence of competitive or co adsorbing ions is very limited moreover aggregation of composite go nanostructures has been the major impediment in most of these solution based separation procedures which apparently limits the optimal adsorption performance of go composites in recent years go membranes and laminates have been investigated as tunable transport nano channels for efficient ion or molecular adsorption separation and also to reduce the defective interface or aggregation effects in the go based composite studies 15 23 29 31 although such go membrane based studies were carried out widely for the separation of dyes heavy metal ions organic molecules solvents 30 31 there are only a few reports 13 29 on selective separation of ln3 ions from aqueous waste composite solutions in a recent work lu et al developed go based eu3 ion imprinted nanocomposite membranes for selective adsorption of eu3 ions from composite solution comprising competitive ions la3 gd3 and sm3 in which n iso propylacrylamide and acrylamide functional monomers were shown to act as temperature controlled recognition sites for eu3 ions 15 in another work polydopamine modified go was used to prepare gd iii imprinted membranes for selective permeation of gd3 ions permeation selectivity of 2 91 la gd and 2 49 eu gd from solution having multiple ln3 ions 29 although the traditionally imprinted membranes are known to exhibit unique efficiency towards the target ion selectivity they endure issues associated with site accessibility and low mass transfer present work describes the preparation of surface modified go membranes for preferential separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions with multiple competitive ions and analyses the underlying adsorption mechanism in this process chemical composition and morphology of go ln composite samples prepared under diverse ambient conditions were characterized to attain comprehensive understanding on oxygen functional group ln3 ion interactions at individual as well as composite scale based on those inferences ln3 ion interaction sites on go sheets have been identified and relative ratio of go functional groups were tuned further to bring out optimized conditions for selective ln3 ion separation membrane filters made up of such chemically tuned go sheets were evaluated for overall selective ln3 ion removal efficiency and distinct windows of parameters have been proposed for preferential separation of the studied ln3 ions 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of go go has been synthesized using modified hummer offeman s method 32 33 and all the chemicals sigma aldrich used in this procedure are of ar grade briefly 0 5 g graphite powder bay carbon sp 1 usa and nano3 0 5 g were stirred in an ice bath followed by addition of conc h2so4 23 ml and kmno4 3 g respectively the mixture was maintained at 35 5 c in an oil bath to which 40 ml ultra filtered deionised water millipore 18 2 mω cm was added followed by rise of temperature to 90 5 c further the solution was diluted with 100 ml deionised water and 3 ml h2o2 30 was added subsequently final solution containing exfoliated go particles sheets was filtered using teflon membrane of 0 45 μm porosity and washed thoroughly with deionised water the go particle sheet dispersion was centrifuged in the order of 1000 rpm 8000 rpm and 2500 rpm to separate monolayer go sheets into deionised water referred to as fresh go the concentration of go sheets in aqueous dispersion was standardized using absorbance measurements and maintained typically at 0 08 mg ml the aqueous go dispersion left idle for 60 days is referred to as aged go dispersion and that with go concentration of 0 5 mg ml is termed as thick go tgo dispersion the ph of fresh go dispersion was observed to be 3 5 and dilute hcl nahco3 was used to alter the ph of the go dispersions 2 2 preparation of go ln composites synthetic mixture of multiple ln3 ions mimicking the reprocessing solution referred as ln solution was prepared using salts of la3 ce3 nd3 eu3 and gd3 ions by maintaining their relative ratios as per the earlier report 34 precisely 1 ml of synthetic ln solution consists of la3 12 μg ce3 74 μg nd3 45 μg eu3 3 μg and gd3 1 μg ions and these relative ratios were maintained same throughout this work unless otherwise specified go composite dispersions were uniformly drop casted on znse substrate under infra red lamp radiation to prepare the samples for fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy analysis go composite sheets were transferred on to rca 1 treated silicon si substrate using dip coating method to study the surface morphology of samples 2 3 preparation of go membranes for the ln3 ion filtration studies go membranes were prepared by drop casting different volumes 3 15 ml of fresh aged thick go dispersions on mixed cellulose ester filter papers merk millipore make 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm porosity under vacuum and thus obtained membranes were dried for 72 h synthetic ln solutions 5 ml were percolated through the go membranes under vacuum and the collected filtrates were analysed for individual ln3 ion concentrations 2 4 characterization studies absorbance of aqueous go dispersions was measured using uv vis spectrometer avantes avaspec netherlands in the wavelength range of 215 600 nm the ft ir spectra of go composite samples were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000 650 cm 1 using vertex 70 ft ir spectrometer bruker optik gmbh germany operated at 4 cm 1 resolution equipped with la doped deuterated triglycine sulphate detector la dtgs surface morphology of go composite sheets deposited on si substrate was studied using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem supra 55 zeiss germany the filtrates collected after percolation through go membrane were analysed for individual ln3 ion concentrations using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes ametek spectro arcos germany 3 results 3 1 fresh go ln interaction and filtration studies with the aim of identifying the interaction sites of ln3 ions on fresh go sheets composite samples were prepared on znse and si substrates using varying volumes of ln solution ft ir spectroscopy and fe sem studies have been carried out on these samples to examine the extent of lanthanide uptake and the consequent changes in chemical composition and surface morphology of composite sheets the ft ir spectrum of fresh go sheets fig 1 a shows multiple vibrational bands ascribed to stretching of hydroxyls 2000 3800 cm 1 stretching of carbonyls associated with carboxylic acids 1730 cm 1 in plane vibrations of sp2 carbons 1586 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of epoxides 1100 1300 cm 1 stretching of ethers 1044 cm 1 and deformation vibrations of epoxides 868 cm 1 35 37 incorporation of ln3 ions enhances the intensity of broad vibrational band due to hydroxyls 2000 3800 cm 1 reduces the intensity of bands due to carboxylic acids 1730 cm 1 and sp2 carbons 1586 cm 1 while the relative intensities of vibrational bands associated with epoxides 1100 1300 cm 1 and 868 cm 1 remain nearly unaltered fig 1 b at higher concentrations of lanthanides evolution of new vibrational bands at 1628 cm 1 1424 cm 1 and 1336 cm 1 has been observed in the spectra of composite sheets fig 1 c d vibrational peaks emerged at 1628 cm 1 and 1424 cm 1 are attributed to asymmetric νas coo and symmetric νs coo stretching of lanthanide carboxylates 38 respectively and the peak seen at 1336 cm 1 is ascribed to formation of lanthanide hydroxides 23 however no further new changes are observed in the vibrational features of composite sheets beyond certain limit of lanthanide uptake 50 μl of ln soln which indicates much possible saturation in the interactions of oxygen functional groups and ln3 ions fig 1 c e interactions among the functional groups of go and ln3 ions were reported to be largely dominated by inner sphere complexation mechanism resulting in formation of mononuclear monodentate complexes at lower ph ph 5 and binuclear bidentate surface complexes at higher ph conditions 19 39 in the present work the large separation between asymmetric νas coo and symmetric νs coo stretching bands of carboxylates 217 cm 1 indicates strong polarization and asymmetry of coo groups which in turn suggests monodentate coordination of carboxylate groups 38 fig 2 shows the fe sem images of go as well as go ln composite 100 μl ln soln sheets deposited on si substrate in case of go uniformly distributed closely spaced and nearly monolayer sheet transfer has been observed while go ln composites exhibit overlapped sheet morphology possessing folds and wrinkles bonding of trivalent ln3 ions at multiple oxygen functional groups can induce the formation of such overlapping sheet morphology with multiple folds wrinkles 23 and indirectly evidences the go ln composite formation the fold and wrinkle morphology of composite sheets further suggests that edge based carboxylic acids and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane are the major interaction sites of ln3 ions supporting the inferences drawn from ft ir results a set of filter membranes prepared using fresh go dispersions fig 3 were used to examine the ln3 ion filtration ability of the as synthesized go sheets fig s1 shows the typical fe sem images of the completely dried 72 h go membrane filters which depicts rough surface morphology with random folds wrinkles and clusters such extremely rough surface morphology of membrane filters may be attributed to random stacking of multiple go layers under vacuum suction and consequent irregularities in the go layer packing the mass of go on each of these membrane filters is considered for the evaluation of ln3 ion adsorption efficiencies a fixed 5 ml volume of lanthanide composite solution ln solution was percolated through these go membrane filters and the collected filtrates were analysed using icp oes for individual ln3 ion concentrations fig 4 shows the consolidated picture of ln3 ion removal efficiency exhibited by fresh go membranes fig 4 a along with their efficiency towards each individual ln3 ion fig 4 b these results clearly evidence the efficiency of go membranes towards ln3 ion separation and indicate considerable increase in the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency 9 25 with increase in mass of go on membrane interestingly the filtration efficiency of fresh go membranes is not uniform for all the ln3 ions studied where the nd3 ions are found to get filtered to larger extent 8 and the removal efficiencies of other ln3 ions are limited to 2 5 the plateau regions of fig 4 b indicate quick saturation in the adsorption behaviour of fresh go membranes possibly due to the limited availability or fixed population of adsorption sites for further ln3 ion uptake from the earlier studies 19 20 electrostatic interactions were reported to play instrumental role in the competitive ln3 ion adsorption by various go based composites and the possibility of stable lanthanide complex formations is determined by a variety of factors including ln3 ion electronegativity ionic radius ln oxygen bond distance etc 3 nevertheless sorption efficiencies exhibited by the fresh go membranes do not follow any of the above said trends suggesting a large interference in multiple oxygen functional group ln3 ion interactions and limited role of electrostatic interactions in the adsorption process 3 2 aged go ln interaction and filtration studies go sheets are known to be metastable at room temperature both in dispersion as well as solid state film forms and the relative proportion of residing oxygen functional groups was reported to change significantly with aging 40 41 precisely go sheets were reported to undergo chemisorbed h species mediated modification with time typically 40 days which in turn reduce the fraction of energy costlier epoxides enrich that of hydroxyl groups fig s2 and cause consequent formation of water molecules 40 in order to examine the effect of such substantial reconstruction of functional groups on go ln3 ion interactions aged go composite samples were prepared at varying volumes of ln solution the vibrational features of aged 60 days old go sheets fig 5 a clearly indicate minimization of epoxides 1098 cm 1 enrichment of hydroxides and water molecules 2700 3800 cm 1 as compared to the features of fresh go sheets fig 1 a even with the modified proportions of oxygen functional groups aged go ln composite sheets show evolution of vibrational bands attributable to asymmetric νas coo 1641 cm 1 and symmetric νs coo 1400 cm 1 stretching of carboxylates and stretching of hydroxides 1345 cm 1 of ln3 ions however considerably larger enhancement in intensities of carboxylate and hydroxide vibrational features is see fig 5 d and fig 1 indicates substantial uptake of lanthanides on aged go sheets furthermore increased separation between asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks of carboxylates 242 cm 1 suggests much stronger polarization of carboxylate groups in the case of aged go composites 38 corroborating with the ft ir results filter membranes prepared using aged go sheets also exhibited appreciable enhancement in overall as well as individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies fig 6 the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency of aged go membranes enhances significantly with increase in mass of go on membrane 20 54 fig 6 a and their maximum removal efficiency towards individual ln3 ions is seen in the range of 9 12 enhanced filtration ability of aged go membranes is attributed to larger uptake of ln3 ions and consequent formation of lanthanide carboxylates and hydroxides fig 5 owing to the availability of surplus oxygen functional groups formed during the aging the trends of ln3 ion removal efficiencies fig 6 b indicate that aged go membranes can accommodate larger proportions of ln3 ions in contrast to the quick saturation behaviour exhibited by fresh go membranes fig 4 b in addition the filtration ability of aged membranes is nearly uniform towards all the tested ln3 ions particularly when the membrane filters are mounted with larger go mass in view of the superior performance exhibited by aged go sheets and membrane filters further studies on ln3 ion adsorption and separation were carried out using aged go dispersions 60 days old unless otherwise specified 3 3 effect of ph on aged go ln interaction and filtration in order to examine the effect of ph on composite formation and ln3 ion uptake aged go composite samples are prepared at different ph conditions and characterized using fe sem as well as ft ir spectroscopy from the earlier works most of the ln3 ions in particular la3 nd3 eu3 and gd3 ions are known to form insoluble hydroxides and precipitations at higher ph conditions ph 7 5 16 18 24 to avoid such precipitate formations ph range of the aged go dispersions is limited to 3 7 in the present work and fig s3 shows the fe sem images of the corresponding aged go ln composite sheets from fig s3 it may be observed that the composite samples prepared at ph 3 and ph 5 show mere overlapping of sheets without much wrinkles or folds while the composites prepared at ph 7 display relatively aggregated morphology corresponding ft ir spectra fig 7 a c also show significant differences in the vibrational features of composites with the change of ph conditions with increase of ph composite spectra exhibit monotonous reduction in the intensities of vibrational features associated with hydroxyls 2700 3800 cm 1 and epoxides 1135 cm 1 and substantial enhancement of the vibrational peak ascribed to lanthanide hydroxide formation 1345 cm 1 spectra of composites prepared at ph 3 or ph 5 indicate the formation of both carboxylates 1642 cm 1 as well as hydroxides 1345 cm 1 whereas the spectrum of composites prepared at ph 7 evidences the presence of a major proportion of hydroxides 1358 cm 1 alone further the peak observed at 838 cm 1 in fig 7 c may be attributed to out of plane wagging of hydrogen formed during the deprotonation of carboxylic acid groups of go at ph 7 42 the ln3 ion filtration efficiencies exhibited by the ph altered aged go membrane filters are shown in fig 7 d each of these membranes is prepared using 9 ml of aged go dispersion 0 08 mg ml of specific ph value in the range 3 7 insert of fig 7 d shows that the overall percentage of ln3 ion removal efficiency decreases substantially 36 to 12 with increase in the ph of aged go dispersion 3 7 aged go membranes prepared at ph 3 exhibited maximum ln3 ion removal efficiency 36 and were able to separate ce3 ions to large extent 16 among all the studied ln3 ions in contrast with usage of aged go membranes prepared at ph 5 almost all the five ln3 ions are separated moderately together contributing an overall ln removal efficiency of 32 fig 7 d also indicates that the aged go membranes prepared at ph 7 have poor ability towards ln3 ion separation except for eu3 ions which are seen to be separated by 6 9 irrespective of the ph conditions thus an optimized window of parameters comprising go dispersions aged for 60 days and maintained at ph 5 is chosen to prepare the filter membranes for further studies 3 4 thick go ln interaction and filtration studies all the above described filtration studies clearly evidence that the overall and individual ln3 ion filtration efficiency of go membranes is largely determined by the concentration of fresh aged go dispersions and subsequently mounted mass of go on membrane filters in view of these inferences thick go tgo filter membranes have been prepared by using aged go dispersions of 0 5 mg ml concentration and ph 5 instead of 0 08 mg ml ph 3 and their ln3 ion filtration abilities are examined fig 8 shows the ft ir spectra of tgo film as well as the composite films prepared using thick go dispersions the ft ir spectrum of tgo film primarily shows vibrational features associated with hydroxyls 2240 3800 cm 1 1380 cm 1 carboxylic acids 1731 cm 1 carbonyl adsorbed water molecules 1621 cm 1 and ether 1071 cm 1 groups as compared to the spectrum shown in fig 1 a fresh go 0 08 mg ml ph 3 the vibrational features associated with epoxides are largely suppressed or overlapped with the features of ethers 1071 cm 1 possibly due to the rigid stacking of go sheets that suppress symmetric or asymmetric stretching of out of plane epoxide groups in accordance with their precursor aged composites fig 5 tgo ln composites also show larger formation of carboxylates 1640 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 and hydroxides 1330 cm 1 of lanthanides interestingly spectra of these composites reveal the presence of a significant proportion of left over carboxylic acids 1731 cm 1 fig 9 shows the filtration efficiencies exhibited by tgo filter membranes of different go mass in contrast to the earlier results figs 4 and 6 filtration ability of tgo membranes towards all the studied ln3 ions is observed to be nearly uniform irrespective of the go mass on the membranes further the individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies are found to increase monotonously with the increase of go mass depicting uniform enhancement in overall ln3 ion removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of tgo membranes towards individual ln3 ions range from 15 to 32 and the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency is seen in the range of 81 154 substantial and uniform enhancement of ln3 ion removal efficiencies may be attributed to the availability of abundant oxygen functional groups 0 5 mg ml go dispersions sufficiently ionized ambience ph 5 and ample porous go mass 1 5 7 5 mg for the ln3 ion entrapment 4 discussion the typical adsorption efficiencies exhibited by variety of go membranes may be explained by understanding the interaction mechanism of individual ln3 ions with the functional groups go under diverse ambient conditions fig 10 a shows the ft ir spectra of composites prepared using fresh go sheets and individual ln3 ions which are shown in the wavenumber range of 650 1850 cm 1 all these composite spectra exhibit vibrational features associated with the formation of carboxylate 1634 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 and hydroxide 1312 cm 1 complexes which corroborate well with the ft ir results described earlier fig 1 from these spectra it may also be observed that few vibrational features associated with go composites of la3 and nd3 ions are significantly different from those of the rest of ln3 ions precisely composite spectra of la3 nd3 ions display signatures of a relatively larger proportion of left out epoxides 1120 cm 1 while those of ce3 eu3 gd3 composites exhibit vibrational features due to bending vibrations of carboxylate groups 750 cm 1 38 careful scan of these composite spectra further reveal that the relative ratios of the peaks associated with asymmetric 1634 cm 1 to symmetric stretching 1460 cm 1 vibrations of ce3 eu3 gd3 carboxylates is smaller compared to those seen for the la3 nd3 composites substantial increase in asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylates and consequent raise in the intensities of vibrational peaks at higher wavenumber region 1634 cm 1 indicate stronger polarization of carboxyl groups 43 furthermore composite spectra of ce3 eu3 gd3 ions alone exhibit doublet features in the vibrational peaks corresponding to symmetric stretching 1460 cm 1 and bending vibrations 750 cm 1 of carboxylates as well as hydroxides 1312 cm 1 presence of doublet features in wavenumber regions of 1460 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 indicates the existence of more than one type of coo ions in ce3 eu3 gd3 composites and formation of multiple carboxylate complexes possibly monodentate and bidentate forms 43 44 the separations between asymmetric including doublet features and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of ce3 eu3 gd3 carboxylates 174 cm 1 and 210 cm 1 also support the inference on presence of bidentate complexes along with the stable monodentate ones from all the above inputs it is inferred that the interactions among la3 nd3 ions and the oxygen functional groups of go are much straightforward without multiple complex formations large proportions of un interacted left out epoxides in the la3 nd3 composites indicate that go la3 nd3 ion interactions of do not necessitate these functional groups while the other ln3 ions ce3 eu3 gd3 ions consume these epoxides as well and form multiple complexes in the composites among the la3 nd3 ions nd3 ions appears to be the frontrunners in capturing the abundant adsorption sites available on go membranes owing to the relatively stronger polarization effects observed fig 10 a or following the sequence of electronegativity and ionic radii 3 24 furthermore nd3 ions are reported to form strong chelation bonds with oxygen functional groups even under heterogeneous surface conditions in particular with hydroxyl functional groups of go 14 17 21 which corroborate well with the superior adsorption efficiencies seen in the present work fig 10 b shows the ft ir spectra of aged go composites prepared using individual ln3 ions all these aged composite spectra also depict the vibrational peaks due to formation of lanthanide carboxylate and hydroxides but without any doublet like features except the case of eu 750 cm 1 further the separation between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching carboxylate peaks 208 233 cm 1 suggests the dominant formation of monodentate carboxylate complexes 38 45 the homogeneity in interaction behaviour of aged go sheets with all the studied ln3 ions is consistent with their lanthanide ion adsorption efficiencies both in thin 0 08 mg ml as well as thick 0 5 mg ml membrane forms ft ir studies figs 1 and 5 indicate that the relatively larger proportion of hydroxyl functional groups on aged go sheets facilitates the formation of more hydroxide complexes in the aged go composites furthermore the ionized ambience introduced by ph 7 can cause generation of additional hydroxide complexes in the aged go composites fig 7 c relative to those could form at lower ph conditions corresponding morphological studies fig s3 indicate that acidic ambience ph 3 or ph 5 prevents the aggregation wrinkling folding of aged go sheets in contrast to the largely overlapped aggregated sheet morphology seen at ph 7 thus the conditions favouring the availability of larger go surface area ph 3 or ph 5 along with abundant oxygen functional groups aged go appear to facilitate superior ln3 ion sorption by aged go membranes and cause significant enhancement in their overall lanthanide removal efficiencies under acidic ambience 32 36 fig 8 b in case of thick go tgo membranes either due to the availability of surplus oxygen functional groups or inaccessibility of edge based carboxylic acid functional groups for interaction with ln3 ions few carboxylic acids are always seen to be left out in tgo composites nevertheless the membrane structure of tgo sheets constantly impose constraints on accessibility of these surplus functional groups to ln3 ions hence a cap on the much anticipated ln3 ion removal efficiencies by the thick go membranes despite the limitations tgo membranes displayed substantial and uniform enhancement in overall individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies with increase of go mass on the membrane filter in a nutshell present work introduces various windows of parameters for preferential as well as uniform separation of different ln3 ions from the aqueous composite solutions namely preferential separation of nd3 ions has been observed with usage of fresh go membranes while the aged go membranes prepared at ph 3 could separate ce3 ions to a larger extent eu3 ions are found to be separated moderately under most of the membrane preparation conditions whereas low ph conditions appear to favour the separation of the la3 and gd3 ions indisputably aged go membranes facilitate uniform uptake of all the studied ln3 ions and the usage of corresponding thick membranes momentously enhance the separation efficiencies further these results and inferences introduce optimum conditions for separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions with multiple competitive lanthanide ions and manifest the optimal adsorption performance of the go membranes the membrane based procedure demonstrated in the present work facilitates to provide larger surface area and supports efficient exploitation of surface interaction sites of go for competent adsorption of multiple ln3 ions further the current method involves limited steps and less waste generation cost effective in terms of membrane preparation and filtration and most importantly hinders the aggregation of go sheets which has been a serious concern in solution based separation procedures 5 conclusions in the present work go ln composites prepared under different ambient conditions have been examined to study the changes induced in their chemical composition and morphology and ln3 ion separation efficiencies of the respective go membranes were evaluated both ft ir and fe sem studies indicated that the edge based carboxylic acids and hydroxyls on basal plane are the major sites for ln3 ion interactions and evidence the larger formation of carboxylate and hydroxide complexes of ln3 ions in aged composites particularly in the ph range of 5 7 interaction of la3 nd3 ions with go primarily results in formation of monodentate complexes while the rest of the studied ln3 ions appears to generate multiple carboxylate complexes various defining factors including the extent of carboxylate hydroxide complex generation polarization of carboxylate groups formation of strong chelation bonds during the ln3 ion functional group interactions together determine the preferential lanthanide adsorption on go sheets membrane filters made up of fresh go sheets exhibited preferential separation

13772,spectroscopic and morphological properties of different graphene oxide go lanthanide ln composites were analysed with the aim of preparing go membranes for preferential separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions these studies indicated that the extent of ln3 ion uptake on go sheets and consequent carboxylate hydroxide complex formation are strongly determined by interaction ability of ln3 ion relative proportions of go functional groups and ionization of composite ambience membrane filters prepared using fresh and aged go dispersions of varying go concentrations and ph have been evaluated for their individual and overall ln3 ion removal efficiencies among the studied lanthanide ions nd3 and ce3 ions are found to be preferentially separated by fresh go 8 and aged go 16 membranes respectively while eu3 ions are removed moderately under all the membrane preparation conditions preferential separation of these ln3 ions may be attributed to relatively stronger polarization effects and formation of strong chelation bonds during their interaction with functional groups the overall ln removal efficiency of go membranes was found to increase with aging of go 25 54 mass of go on membrane 54 154 and optimum in ph range of 3 5 32 36 which is attributed to availability of large surface area abundant functional groups sufficiently ionized ambience and ample porous go mass for the ln3 ion adsorption keywords graphene oxide lanthanides membrane functional groups filtration 1 introduction separation of lanthanides ln from various resources including ores and minerals mining industrial and reprocessed nuclear wastes has been a major concern in the past few decades owing to their global demand in production of phosphors catalysts ceramics magnets and development of sensors hybrid batteries 1 2 in particular nuclear industrial prerequisites such as fuel element fabrication and selective ion enrichment emerging biological applications including bio labelling bio imaging and bio molecule detection necessitate the production of high pure lanthanides 3 5 however chemical homogeneity and minuscule differences in the physio chemical behaviour of lanthanides have been the prime hurdles for the selective lanthanide recovery and enrichment processes variety of traditional extraction methods including liquid liquid extraction co precipitation fractional crystallization and ion exchange were investigated extensively for both large scale and selective separation of lanthanides from ores minerals and industrial waste 2 6 7 however most of these methods involve multiple extraction sequences reported to be expensive time consuming and leave out large amounts of toxic waste 6 on the other hand adsorption and filtration methods have been investigated as alternates to these traditional methods owing to the recent development of efficient lanthanide adsorbents cost effective and trouble free operation procedures and most importantly less sludge generation 3 8 10 most frequently studied lanthanide adsorbents include impregnated resins 11 mesoporous carbon silica 6 8 12 magnetite metal oxide nanoparticles 3 13 ion imprinted polymer films 14 and graphene oxide go based composites 15 18 for instance awul et al synthesized carboxamide functionalized mesoporous silica for selective adsorption of eu3 125 63 mg g and sm3 124 38 mg g ions from mixed cation solutions where the ion selectivity was attributed to strong affinity of eu3 and sm3 ions towards o and n donors of amide ligand 12 the solid phase lanthanide extraction studies conducted by perreault et al using diglycolamide modified mesoporous carbons demonstrated the necessity and importance of highly reactive anchoring functional groups and rigid ligand structure for the effective and selective sorption of ln3 ions 8 selective lanthanide adsorption and recovery studies carried out by ashour et al using citric acid l cysteine functionalized fe3o4 nanoparticles indicated that ln3 ions are largely captured at negatively charged carboxylate ions by formation of the surface complexes 3 on the other hand graphene oxide go sheets are known to possess most of the above described adsorbent characteristics owing to which go has been widely investigated in recent years as a prime lanthanide adsorbent and for enhancing the sorption efficiencies of other materials as well 19 23 in most of the previous works go functionalized go go composites were evaluated with the aim of obtaining physio chemical and thermodynamic parameters for optimal adsorption of selected ln3 ion sorption mainly through batch adsorption experiments 16 18 for instance hu et al examined the effect of contact time ph ionic strength temperature coexisting electrolyte ions and humic substances on eu iii sorption efficiency of go and reported optimum eu iii sorption 57 60 mg g at ph 7 5 and temperature 338 k 16 in another work chen et al employed colloidal go suspensions of different ph ionic strength and temperatures sealed in dialysis bags for sorption of gd iii ions and achieved maximum gd iii sorption capacity of 286 86 mg g at ph 5 9 and temperature 303 k 18 thiacalixarene functionalized go composite was found to exhibit optimal removal efficiency towards nd iii ions 337 84 mg g from aqueous solutions in the ph range of 6 7 21 furthermore go go composites have also been investigated for adsorption of multiple ln3 ions and table s1 summarizes various go based adsorbents their adsorption efficiency towards each ln3 ion and the optimum experimental conditions 15 22 24 28 in particular research group of xu et al synthesized diverse composites of go using corn zein 25 high gluten flour 26 egg white 27 and maize amylopectin 28 for adsorption of la3 nd3 y3 er3 and yb3 from aqueous solutions among which go egg white composite was found to exhibit the maximum sorption efficiencies towards all the studied ln3 ions table s1 despite frequent efforts on separation of multiple ln3 ions by different go adsorbents definitive information on preferential ln3 ion removal ability of these sorbents particularly in presence of competitive or co adsorbing ions is very limited moreover aggregation of composite go nanostructures has been the major impediment in most of these solution based separation procedures which apparently limits the optimal adsorption performance of go composites in recent years go membranes and laminates have been investigated as tunable transport nano channels for efficient ion or molecular adsorption separation and also to reduce the defective interface or aggregation effects in the go based composite studies 15 23 29 31 although such go membrane based studies were carried out widely for the separation of dyes heavy metal ions organic molecules solvents 30 31 there are only a few reports 13 29 on selective separation of ln3 ions from aqueous waste composite solutions in a recent work lu et al developed go based eu3 ion imprinted nanocomposite membranes for selective adsorption of eu3 ions from composite solution comprising competitive ions la3 gd3 and sm3 in which n iso propylacrylamide and acrylamide functional monomers were shown to act as temperature controlled recognition sites for eu3 ions 15 in another work polydopamine modified go was used to prepare gd iii imprinted membranes for selective permeation of gd3 ions permeation selectivity of 2 91 la gd and 2 49 eu gd from solution having multiple ln3 ions 29 although the traditionally imprinted membranes are known to exhibit unique efficiency towards the target ion selectivity they endure issues associated with site accessibility and low mass transfer present work describes the preparation of surface modified go membranes for preferential separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions with multiple competitive ions and analyses the underlying adsorption mechanism in this process chemical composition and morphology of go ln composite samples prepared under diverse ambient conditions were characterized to attain comprehensive understanding on oxygen functional group ln3 ion interactions at individual as well as composite scale based on those inferences ln3 ion interaction sites on go sheets have been identified and relative ratio of go functional groups were tuned further to bring out optimized conditions for selective ln3 ion separation membrane filters made up of such chemically tuned go sheets were evaluated for overall selective ln3 ion removal efficiency and distinct windows of parameters have been proposed for preferential separation of the studied ln3 ions 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of go go has been synthesized using modified hummer offeman s method 32 33 and all the chemicals sigma aldrich used in this procedure are of ar grade briefly 0 5 g graphite powder bay carbon sp 1 usa and nano3 0 5 g were stirred in an ice bath followed by addition of conc h2so4 23 ml and kmno4 3 g respectively the mixture was maintained at 35 5 c in an oil bath to which 40 ml ultra filtered deionised water millipore 18 2 mω cm was added followed by rise of temperature to 90 5 c further the solution was diluted with 100 ml deionised water and 3 ml h2o2 30 was added subsequently final solution containing exfoliated go particles sheets was filtered using teflon membrane of 0 45 μm porosity and washed thoroughly with deionised water the go particle sheet dispersion was centrifuged in the order of 1000 rpm 8000 rpm and 2500 rpm to separate monolayer go sheets into deionised water referred to as fresh go the concentration of go sheets in aqueous dispersion was standardized using absorbance measurements and maintained typically at 0 08 mg ml the aqueous go dispersion left idle for 60 days is referred to as aged go dispersion and that with go concentration of 0 5 mg ml is termed as thick go tgo dispersion the ph of fresh go dispersion was observed to be 3 5 and dilute hcl nahco3 was used to alter the ph of the go dispersions 2 2 preparation of go ln composites synthetic mixture of multiple ln3 ions mimicking the reprocessing solution referred as ln solution was prepared using salts of la3 ce3 nd3 eu3 and gd3 ions by maintaining their relative ratios as per the earlier report 34 precisely 1 ml of synthetic ln solution consists of la3 12 μg ce3 74 μg nd3 45 μg eu3 3 μg and gd3 1 μg ions and these relative ratios were maintained same throughout this work unless otherwise specified go composite dispersions were uniformly drop casted on znse substrate under infra red lamp radiation to prepare the samples for fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy analysis go composite sheets were transferred on to rca 1 treated silicon si substrate using dip coating method to study the surface morphology of samples 2 3 preparation of go membranes for the ln3 ion filtration studies go membranes were prepared by drop casting different volumes 3 15 ml of fresh aged thick go dispersions on mixed cellulose ester filter papers merk millipore make 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm porosity under vacuum and thus obtained membranes were dried for 72 h synthetic ln solutions 5 ml were percolated through the go membranes under vacuum and the collected filtrates were analysed for individual ln3 ion concentrations 2 4 characterization studies absorbance of aqueous go dispersions was measured using uv vis spectrometer avantes avaspec netherlands in the wavelength range of 215 600 nm the ft ir spectra of go composite samples were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000 650 cm 1 using vertex 70 ft ir spectrometer bruker optik gmbh germany operated at 4 cm 1 resolution equipped with la doped deuterated triglycine sulphate detector la dtgs surface morphology of go composite sheets deposited on si substrate was studied using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem supra 55 zeiss germany the filtrates collected after percolation through go membrane were analysed for individual ln3 ion concentrations using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes ametek spectro arcos germany 3 results 3 1 fresh go ln interaction and filtration studies with the aim of identifying the interaction sites of ln3 ions on fresh go sheets composite samples were prepared on znse and si substrates using varying volumes of ln solution ft ir spectroscopy and fe sem studies have been carried out on these samples to examine the extent of lanthanide uptake and the consequent changes in chemical composition and surface morphology of composite sheets the ft ir spectrum of fresh go sheets fig 1 a shows multiple vibrational bands ascribed to stretching of hydroxyls 2000 3800 cm 1 stretching of carbonyls associated with carboxylic acids 1730 cm 1 in plane vibrations of sp2 carbons 1586 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of epoxides 1100 1300 cm 1 stretching of ethers 1044 cm 1 and deformation vibrations of epoxides 868 cm 1 35 37 incorporation of ln3 ions enhances the intensity of broad vibrational band due to hydroxyls 2000 3800 cm 1 reduces the intensity of bands due to carboxylic acids 1730 cm 1 and sp2 carbons 1586 cm 1 while the relative intensities of vibrational bands associated with epoxides 1100 1300 cm 1 and 868 cm 1 remain nearly unaltered fig 1 b at higher concentrations of lanthanides evolution of new vibrational bands at 1628 cm 1 1424 cm 1 and 1336 cm 1 has been observed in the spectra of composite sheets fig 1 c d vibrational peaks emerged at 1628 cm 1 and 1424 cm 1 are attributed to asymmetric νas coo and symmetric νs coo stretching of lanthanide carboxylates 38 respectively and the peak seen at 1336 cm 1 is ascribed to formation of lanthanide hydroxides 23 however no further new changes are observed in the vibrational features of composite sheets beyond certain limit of lanthanide uptake 50 μl of ln soln which indicates much possible saturation in the interactions of oxygen functional groups and ln3 ions fig 1 c e interactions among the functional groups of go and ln3 ions were reported to be largely dominated by inner sphere complexation mechanism resulting in formation of mononuclear monodentate complexes at lower ph ph 5 and binuclear bidentate surface complexes at higher ph conditions 19 39 in the present work the large separation between asymmetric νas coo and symmetric νs coo stretching bands of carboxylates 217 cm 1 indicates strong polarization and asymmetry of coo groups which in turn suggests monodentate coordination of carboxylate groups 38 fig 2 shows the fe sem images of go as well as go ln composite 100 μl ln soln sheets deposited on si substrate in case of go uniformly distributed closely spaced and nearly monolayer sheet transfer has been observed while go ln composites exhibit overlapped sheet morphology possessing folds and wrinkles bonding of trivalent ln3 ions at multiple oxygen functional groups can induce the formation of such overlapping sheet morphology with multiple folds wrinkles 23 and indirectly evidences the go ln composite formation the fold and wrinkle morphology of composite sheets further suggests that edge based carboxylic acids and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane are the major interaction sites of ln3 ions supporting the inferences drawn from ft ir results a set of filter membranes prepared using fresh go dispersions fig 3 were used to examine the ln3 ion filtration ability of the as synthesized go sheets fig s1 shows the typical fe sem images of the completely dried 72 h go membrane filters which depicts rough surface morphology with random folds wrinkles and clusters such extremely rough surface morphology of membrane filters may be attributed to random stacking of multiple go layers under vacuum suction and consequent irregularities in the go layer packing the mass of go on each of these membrane filters is considered for the evaluation of ln3 ion adsorption efficiencies a fixed 5 ml volume of lanthanide composite solution ln solution was percolated through these go membrane filters and the collected filtrates were analysed using icp oes for individual ln3 ion concentrations fig 4 shows the consolidated picture of ln3 ion removal efficiency exhibited by fresh go membranes fig 4 a along with their efficiency towards each individual ln3 ion fig 4 b these results clearly evidence the efficiency of go membranes towards ln3 ion separation and indicate considerable increase in the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency 9 25 with increase in mass of go on membrane interestingly the filtration efficiency of fresh go membranes is not uniform for all the ln3 ions studied where the nd3 ions are found to get filtered to larger extent 8 and the removal efficiencies of other ln3 ions are limited to 2 5 the plateau regions of fig 4 b indicate quick saturation in the adsorption behaviour of fresh go membranes possibly due to the limited availability or fixed population of adsorption sites for further ln3 ion uptake from the earlier studies 19 20 electrostatic interactions were reported to play instrumental role in the competitive ln3 ion adsorption by various go based composites and the possibility of stable lanthanide complex formations is determined by a variety of factors including ln3 ion electronegativity ionic radius ln oxygen bond distance etc 3 nevertheless sorption efficiencies exhibited by the fresh go membranes do not follow any of the above said trends suggesting a large interference in multiple oxygen functional group ln3 ion interactions and limited role of electrostatic interactions in the adsorption process 3 2 aged go ln interaction and filtration studies go sheets are known to be metastable at room temperature both in dispersion as well as solid state film forms and the relative proportion of residing oxygen functional groups was reported to change significantly with aging 40 41 precisely go sheets were reported to undergo chemisorbed h species mediated modification with time typically 40 days which in turn reduce the fraction of energy costlier epoxides enrich that of hydroxyl groups fig s2 and cause consequent formation of water molecules 40 in order to examine the effect of such substantial reconstruction of functional groups on go ln3 ion interactions aged go composite samples were prepared at varying volumes of ln solution the vibrational features of aged 60 days old go sheets fig 5 a clearly indicate minimization of epoxides 1098 cm 1 enrichment of hydroxides and water molecules 2700 3800 cm 1 as compared to the features of fresh go sheets fig 1 a even with the modified proportions of oxygen functional groups aged go ln composite sheets show evolution of vibrational bands attributable to asymmetric νas coo 1641 cm 1 and symmetric νs coo 1400 cm 1 stretching of carboxylates and stretching of hydroxides 1345 cm 1 of ln3 ions however considerably larger enhancement in intensities of carboxylate and hydroxide vibrational features is see fig 5 d and fig 1 indicates substantial uptake of lanthanides on aged go sheets furthermore increased separation between asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks of carboxylates 242 cm 1 suggests much stronger polarization of carboxylate groups in the case of aged go composites 38 corroborating with the ft ir results filter membranes prepared using aged go sheets also exhibited appreciable enhancement in overall as well as individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies fig 6 the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency of aged go membranes enhances significantly with increase in mass of go on membrane 20 54 fig 6 a and their maximum removal efficiency towards individual ln3 ions is seen in the range of 9 12 enhanced filtration ability of aged go membranes is attributed to larger uptake of ln3 ions and consequent formation of lanthanide carboxylates and hydroxides fig 5 owing to the availability of surplus oxygen functional groups formed during the aging the trends of ln3 ion removal efficiencies fig 6 b indicate that aged go membranes can accommodate larger proportions of ln3 ions in contrast to the quick saturation behaviour exhibited by fresh go membranes fig 4 b in addition the filtration ability of aged membranes is nearly uniform towards all the tested ln3 ions particularly when the membrane filters are mounted with larger go mass in view of the superior performance exhibited by aged go sheets and membrane filters further studies on ln3 ion adsorption and separation were carried out using aged go dispersions 60 days old unless otherwise specified 3 3 effect of ph on aged go ln interaction and filtration in order to examine the effect of ph on composite formation and ln3 ion uptake aged go composite samples are prepared at different ph conditions and characterized using fe sem as well as ft ir spectroscopy from the earlier works most of the ln3 ions in particular la3 nd3 eu3 and gd3 ions are known to form insoluble hydroxides and precipitations at higher ph conditions ph 7 5 16 18 24 to avoid such precipitate formations ph range of the aged go dispersions is limited to 3 7 in the present work and fig s3 shows the fe sem images of the corresponding aged go ln composite sheets from fig s3 it may be observed that the composite samples prepared at ph 3 and ph 5 show mere overlapping of sheets without much wrinkles or folds while the composites prepared at ph 7 display relatively aggregated morphology corresponding ft ir spectra fig 7 a c also show significant differences in the vibrational features of composites with the change of ph conditions with increase of ph composite spectra exhibit monotonous reduction in the intensities of vibrational features associated with hydroxyls 2700 3800 cm 1 and epoxides 1135 cm 1 and substantial enhancement of the vibrational peak ascribed to lanthanide hydroxide formation 1345 cm 1 spectra of composites prepared at ph 3 or ph 5 indicate the formation of both carboxylates 1642 cm 1 as well as hydroxides 1345 cm 1 whereas the spectrum of composites prepared at ph 7 evidences the presence of a major proportion of hydroxides 1358 cm 1 alone further the peak observed at 838 cm 1 in fig 7 c may be attributed to out of plane wagging of hydrogen formed during the deprotonation of carboxylic acid groups of go at ph 7 42 the ln3 ion filtration efficiencies exhibited by the ph altered aged go membrane filters are shown in fig 7 d each of these membranes is prepared using 9 ml of aged go dispersion 0 08 mg ml of specific ph value in the range 3 7 insert of fig 7 d shows that the overall percentage of ln3 ion removal efficiency decreases substantially 36 to 12 with increase in the ph of aged go dispersion 3 7 aged go membranes prepared at ph 3 exhibited maximum ln3 ion removal efficiency 36 and were able to separate ce3 ions to large extent 16 among all the studied ln3 ions in contrast with usage of aged go membranes prepared at ph 5 almost all the five ln3 ions are separated moderately together contributing an overall ln removal efficiency of 32 fig 7 d also indicates that the aged go membranes prepared at ph 7 have poor ability towards ln3 ion separation except for eu3 ions which are seen to be separated by 6 9 irrespective of the ph conditions thus an optimized window of parameters comprising go dispersions aged for 60 days and maintained at ph 5 is chosen to prepare the filter membranes for further studies 3 4 thick go ln interaction and filtration studies all the above described filtration studies clearly evidence that the overall and individual ln3 ion filtration efficiency of go membranes is largely determined by the concentration of fresh aged go dispersions and subsequently mounted mass of go on membrane filters in view of these inferences thick go tgo filter membranes have been prepared by using aged go dispersions of 0 5 mg ml concentration and ph 5 instead of 0 08 mg ml ph 3 and their ln3 ion filtration abilities are examined fig 8 shows the ft ir spectra of tgo film as well as the composite films prepared using thick go dispersions the ft ir spectrum of tgo film primarily shows vibrational features associated with hydroxyls 2240 3800 cm 1 1380 cm 1 carboxylic acids 1731 cm 1 carbonyl adsorbed water molecules 1621 cm 1 and ether 1071 cm 1 groups as compared to the spectrum shown in fig 1 a fresh go 0 08 mg ml ph 3 the vibrational features associated with epoxides are largely suppressed or overlapped with the features of ethers 1071 cm 1 possibly due to the rigid stacking of go sheets that suppress symmetric or asymmetric stretching of out of plane epoxide groups in accordance with their precursor aged composites fig 5 tgo ln composites also show larger formation of carboxylates 1640 cm 1 and 1400 cm 1 and hydroxides 1330 cm 1 of lanthanides interestingly spectra of these composites reveal the presence of a significant proportion of left over carboxylic acids 1731 cm 1 fig 9 shows the filtration efficiencies exhibited by tgo filter membranes of different go mass in contrast to the earlier results figs 4 and 6 filtration ability of tgo membranes towards all the studied ln3 ions is observed to be nearly uniform irrespective of the go mass on the membranes further the individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies are found to increase monotonously with the increase of go mass depicting uniform enhancement in overall ln3 ion removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of tgo membranes towards individual ln3 ions range from 15 to 32 and the overall ln3 ion removal efficiency is seen in the range of 81 154 substantial and uniform enhancement of ln3 ion removal efficiencies may be attributed to the availability of abundant oxygen functional groups 0 5 mg ml go dispersions sufficiently ionized ambience ph 5 and ample porous go mass 1 5 7 5 mg for the ln3 ion entrapment 4 discussion the typical adsorption efficiencies exhibited by variety of go membranes may be explained by understanding the interaction mechanism of individual ln3 ions with the functional groups go under diverse ambient conditions fig 10 a shows the ft ir spectra of composites prepared using fresh go sheets and individual ln3 ions which are shown in the wavenumber range of 650 1850 cm 1 all these composite spectra exhibit vibrational features associated with the formation of carboxylate 1634 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 and hydroxide 1312 cm 1 complexes which corroborate well with the ft ir results described earlier fig 1 from these spectra it may also be observed that few vibrational features associated with go composites of la3 and nd3 ions are significantly different from those of the rest of ln3 ions precisely composite spectra of la3 nd3 ions display signatures of a relatively larger proportion of left out epoxides 1120 cm 1 while those of ce3 eu3 gd3 composites exhibit vibrational features due to bending vibrations of carboxylate groups 750 cm 1 38 careful scan of these composite spectra further reveal that the relative ratios of the peaks associated with asymmetric 1634 cm 1 to symmetric stretching 1460 cm 1 vibrations of ce3 eu3 gd3 carboxylates is smaller compared to those seen for the la3 nd3 composites substantial increase in asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylates and consequent raise in the intensities of vibrational peaks at higher wavenumber region 1634 cm 1 indicate stronger polarization of carboxyl groups 43 furthermore composite spectra of ce3 eu3 gd3 ions alone exhibit doublet features in the vibrational peaks corresponding to symmetric stretching 1460 cm 1 and bending vibrations 750 cm 1 of carboxylates as well as hydroxides 1312 cm 1 presence of doublet features in wavenumber regions of 1460 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 indicates the existence of more than one type of coo ions in ce3 eu3 gd3 composites and formation of multiple carboxylate complexes possibly monodentate and bidentate forms 43 44 the separations between asymmetric including doublet features and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of ce3 eu3 gd3 carboxylates 174 cm 1 and 210 cm 1 also support the inference on presence of bidentate complexes along with the stable monodentate ones from all the above inputs it is inferred that the interactions among la3 nd3 ions and the oxygen functional groups of go are much straightforward without multiple complex formations large proportions of un interacted left out epoxides in the la3 nd3 composites indicate that go la3 nd3 ion interactions of do not necessitate these functional groups while the other ln3 ions ce3 eu3 gd3 ions consume these epoxides as well and form multiple complexes in the composites among the la3 nd3 ions nd3 ions appears to be the frontrunners in capturing the abundant adsorption sites available on go membranes owing to the relatively stronger polarization effects observed fig 10 a or following the sequence of electronegativity and ionic radii 3 24 furthermore nd3 ions are reported to form strong chelation bonds with oxygen functional groups even under heterogeneous surface conditions in particular with hydroxyl functional groups of go 14 17 21 which corroborate well with the superior adsorption efficiencies seen in the present work fig 10 b shows the ft ir spectra of aged go composites prepared using individual ln3 ions all these aged composite spectra also depict the vibrational peaks due to formation of lanthanide carboxylate and hydroxides but without any doublet like features except the case of eu 750 cm 1 further the separation between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching carboxylate peaks 208 233 cm 1 suggests the dominant formation of monodentate carboxylate complexes 38 45 the homogeneity in interaction behaviour of aged go sheets with all the studied ln3 ions is consistent with their lanthanide ion adsorption efficiencies both in thin 0 08 mg ml as well as thick 0 5 mg ml membrane forms ft ir studies figs 1 and 5 indicate that the relatively larger proportion of hydroxyl functional groups on aged go sheets facilitates the formation of more hydroxide complexes in the aged go composites furthermore the ionized ambience introduced by ph 7 can cause generation of additional hydroxide complexes in the aged go composites fig 7 c relative to those could form at lower ph conditions corresponding morphological studies fig s3 indicate that acidic ambience ph 3 or ph 5 prevents the aggregation wrinkling folding of aged go sheets in contrast to the largely overlapped aggregated sheet morphology seen at ph 7 thus the conditions favouring the availability of larger go surface area ph 3 or ph 5 along with abundant oxygen functional groups aged go appear to facilitate superior ln3 ion sorption by aged go membranes and cause significant enhancement in their overall lanthanide removal efficiencies under acidic ambience 32 36 fig 8 b in case of thick go tgo membranes either due to the availability of surplus oxygen functional groups or inaccessibility of edge based carboxylic acid functional groups for interaction with ln3 ions few carboxylic acids are always seen to be left out in tgo composites nevertheless the membrane structure of tgo sheets constantly impose constraints on accessibility of these surplus functional groups to ln3 ions hence a cap on the much anticipated ln3 ion removal efficiencies by the thick go membranes despite the limitations tgo membranes displayed substantial and uniform enhancement in overall individual ln3 ion removal efficiencies with increase of go mass on the membrane filter in a nutshell present work introduces various windows of parameters for preferential as well as uniform separation of different ln3 ions from the aqueous composite solutions namely preferential separation of nd3 ions has been observed with usage of fresh go membranes while the aged go membranes prepared at ph 3 could separate ce3 ions to a larger extent eu3 ions are found to be separated moderately under most of the membrane preparation conditions whereas low ph conditions appear to favour the separation of the la3 and gd3 ions indisputably aged go membranes facilitate uniform uptake of all the studied ln3 ions and the usage of corresponding thick membranes momentously enhance the separation efficiencies further these results and inferences introduce optimum conditions for separation of ln3 ions from composite solutions with multiple competitive lanthanide ions and manifest the optimal adsorption performance of the go membranes the membrane based procedure demonstrated in the present work facilitates to provide larger surface area and supports efficient exploitation of surface interaction sites of go for competent adsorption of multiple ln3 ions further the current method involves limited steps and less waste generation cost effective in terms of membrane preparation and filtration and most importantly hinders the aggregation of go sheets which has been a serious concern in solution based separation procedures 5 conclusions in the present work go ln composites prepared under different ambient conditions have been examined to study the changes induced in their chemical composition and morphology and ln3 ion separation efficiencies of the respective go membranes were evaluated both ft ir and fe sem studies indicated that the edge based carboxylic acids and hydroxyls on basal plane are the major sites for ln3 ion interactions and evidence the larger formation of carboxylate and hydroxide complexes of ln3 ions in aged composites particularly in the ph range of 5 7 interaction of la3 nd3 ions with go primarily results in formation of monodentate complexes while the rest of the studied ln3 ions appears to generate multiple carboxylate complexes various defining factors including the extent of carboxylate hydroxide complex generation polarization of carboxylate groups formation of strong chelation bonds during the ln3 ion functional group interactions together determine the preferential lanthanide adsorption on go sheets membrane filters made up of fresh go sheets exhibited preferential separation efficiency towards nd3 ions 8 and those of aged go maintained at ph 3 are found to be more suitable for ce3 ion separation 16 owing to the availability of surplus oxygen functional groups formed during the aging aged go membranes display considerably larger ln3 ion adsorption efficiency 54 the ln3 ion removal efficiency of the aged go membranes enhances further with optimum ionization of composite ambience ph range 3 5 and substantially increases with the raise of go mass on membrane filter 154 current work manifests go membrane based lanthanide separation procedure and optimum conditions for the preferential separation of different ln3 ions and these studies can be extended further for preferential elimination of other lanthanide trivalent ions from aqueous composite

13773,this work aims to analyse the effectiveness of catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc for the degradation of the neonicotinoid pesticides listed in the eu watch list decision 2018 840 acetamiprid act imidacloprid imd clothianidin clt thiacloprid thc and thiamethoxam thm with the exception of thc all neonicotinoid pesticides 1000 μg l 1 were completely removed in 30 min at 25 c using 0 25 g l 1 of a commercial pd al2o3 1 wt catalyst and 50 n ml min 1 h2 flow rate strikingly the micropollutant nature played a critical role on the activity and stability of the catalyst the sulphur bearing structures clt thc and thm showed the slowest degradation rates and led to a progressive deactivation of the catalyst tem eds and elemental analyses confirmed that the selective interaction of sulphur species on pd active sites was the main reason for catalyst deactivation the position of the heteroatom in the pesticide structure also influenced the catalytic deactivation the catalyst showed a constant activity upon its sequential use in the hdc of act and imd when these compounds were treated individually nevertheless the interaction of the sulphur containing compounds with the catalyst was remarkably favoured when the five micropollutants were treated in a mixture a deactivation kinetic model in a long term experiment was proposed with thc to overcome catalyst deactivation a regeneration procedure based on a simple catalyst washing with a diluted naclo solution was developed the process suitability was finally demonstrated in successive hdc regeneration runs keywords

compound and hydrochloric acid 5 moreover the system can be operated under ambient conditions within a wide range of initial pollutant concentrations 6 all these features can be favourably compared with advanced oxidation processes aops which have received so far major attention in the removal of persistent pollutants from water 7 9 these processes are based on the action of hydroxyl radicals which are extraordinarily reactive species which attack most of the organic pollutants non selectively the application of aops usually involve expensive reagents energy requirements and can lead to the generation of harmful by products 10 11 however advanced oxidation processes allow pollutant mineralization while hydrochlorination process only change pollutant chemical structure to make them less toxic or more easily biodegradable hdc has been widely explored for the treatment of priority organochlorinated compounds as well as different real industrial effluents like those of the pulp and paper industry 12 15 nevertheless in the last few years the application of hdc is being focused on the degradation of chlorinated micropollutants obtaining promising results 2 16 17 the wide occurrence of these compounds in fresh waters represents a significant issue for drinking water treatment plants dwtps given their high persistence high toxicity and inherent bioaccumulation character in a prior work 16 hdc proved to be a highly effective process for the degradation of a representative group of organochlorinated micropollutants diclofenac chloramphenicol triclosan and sertraline and also trihalomethanes undesired by products formed in the oxidation step of the raw water in dwtps the complete abatement of micropollutants and trihalomethanes was reached in short reaction times and the catalyst pd al2o3 was fairly stable upon five consecutive runs accordingly hdc was postulated as a promising polishing step for the removal of chlorinated pollutants in dwtps one of the main limitations of hdc is the catalyst deactivation given the high cost of the catalysts commonly based on precious metals 6 catalyst deactivation is a complex phenomenon but poisoning of the metal active sites by the hcl released along reaction by products adsorption leaching of the metal and mechanical damage are identified as the main reasons for the loss of catalytic activity 12 18 in this context pd al2o3 appears as one of the most effective catalysts due to its high resistance towards chlorine poisoning and pd leaching and excellent mechanical strength 19 21 as has been aforementioned hdc over pd al2o3 has proved to be remarkably effective for the removal of a wide range of chlorinated micropollutants nevertheless in a recent work a significant deactivation of this catalyst was found in the hdc of the pharmaceutical chlorpromazine due to the strong interaction between the obtained reaction product promazine and pd active sites 22 despite its importance the effect of the pollutant structure on the stability of the catalyst has been scarcely investigated so far díaz et al 2015 6 showed that pd ac was fairly stable in the hdc of 2 4 dichlorophenol while it suffered an important deactivation in the treatment of 2 4 diclorophenoxyacetic acid and 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid despite all compounds contained the same elements in their structures c h cl o the authors attributed the loss of activity to the accumulation of organochlorinated species on the catalyst surface which was more pronounced with phenoxyacetic compounds than with phenolic ones to get further insights about the influence of the pollutant structure on catalyst deactivation upon hdc a representative group of micropollutans i e neonicotinoid pesticides has been selected in the current work in particular the five neonicotinoid pesticides listed in the eu watch list decision 2018 840 acetamiprid act imidacloprid imd clothianidin clt thiacloprid thc and thiamethoxam thm have been considered these compounds show different chemical composition containing cl n s or o as heteroatoms which is suitable for the stability study the neonicicotinoid pesticides family is the insecticides group most used nowadays worldwide 23 accordingly it is extensively distributed in the environment which poses not only a well known risk for bees but also a threat for aquatic ecosystems and public health due to their high water solubility and low biodegradability in the framework of this contribution the kinetics of the reactions was investigated and the reaction pathways were proposed the stability of the pd al2o3 catalyst was also evaluated upon four consecutive runs with the isolated pesticides once determined the reactivity of the micropollutants towards hdc and their effect on catalyst stability the degradation of their mixture was investigated in order to determine the main deactivation causes the fresh and used catalyst were characterized by several analytical techniques on the other hand to overcome deactivation issues consecutive hdc regeneration runs were carried out using the pd al2o3 used catalyst regenerated by a simple and low cost method based on washing the catalyst with a diluted naclo solution finally a deactivation kinetic model was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials acetamiprid 99 imidacloprid 98 clothianidin 98 thiachloprid 98 and thiamethoxam 98

performance using deionized water 2 2 experimental procedure hdc tests were carried out batch wise in a magnetically stirred glass slurry type reactor 500 ml where 50 n ml min 1 of h2 was continuously fed under 900 rpm stirring velocity in order to avoid external mass transfer limitations 17 the initial concentration of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides was established at 1000 μg l 1 in order to quantify properly the target pollutants and the intermediates despite being somehow higher than the real water concentrations 24 the catalyst concentration was fixed at 0 25 g l 1 for the degradation of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides and in a range of 0 25 and 2 g l 1 for the degradation of the pesticides mixture the impact of the operating temperature was evaluated in the range of 15 35 c 2 3 analytical methods in each hdc reaction liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor in order to follow the evolution of the different pesticides and were centrifuged for catalyst

cm 1 using kbr for the sample preparation 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic hydrodechlorination of neonicotinoid pesticides fig 1 shows the evolution of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides with pd al2o3 catalyst through hdc at 25 c as observed the different compounds can be classified in two different groups according to their reactivity towards hdc the former including act and imd was much more reactive than the latter clt thc and thm while the pesticides act and imd were completely converted in 10 min reaction time the complete conversion of clt and thc required up to 30 min in the case of thc its conversion reached a plateau at 80 after 20 min reaction time which suggests a deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction of this pesticide the main difference between the chemical composition of both groups of compounds is the presence of sulphur in the chemical structure of clt thc and thm which is a recognized poison for pd based catalysts 25 a kinetic study was performed with all pesticides within the temperature range 15 35 c see fig s1 of the supplementary material the resulting pseudo first order rate constant and apparent activation energy values are collected in table 2 the following reactivity order was observed act imd thm thc clt the sulphur bearing pesticides showed rate constant values up to 4 times lower than act and imd all the activation energy values were in the range of 13 31 kj mol 1 which are close to those obtained with other organochlorinated compounds such as chlorophenols or pharmaceuticals i e diclofenac sertraline chlorpromazine using the same catalyst under similar operating conditions 16 22 26 as has been mentioned in the introduction aops have been also investigated to a high extent for the removal of a wide range of organic pollutants including neonicotinoid pesticides 8 9 27 although the comparison of the kinetics among aop and hdc is not straightforward as they are different catalytic systems the reaction time required under optimized conditions operating at ambient temperature are of the same order of magnitude 9 27 in this work reaction times around 15 30 min have been required for the removal of neonicotinoid pesticides by hdc with pd al2o3 as representative examples they will be compared with those achieved with common aops such as fenton oxidation or photocatalysis for instance serrano et al 2020 27 reported reaction times of around 20 min for the removal of the same five neonicotinoid pesticides tested in this work at 1000 μg l 1 using heterogeneous fenton oxidation promoted by natural magnetite somehow higher reaction times up to 2 h were required for the removal of imd thm and clt by photocatalysis using immobilized tio2 8 nevertheless it should be noted that a significantly higher concentration of the pesticides was tested in that work 100 mg l 1 in a more recent work tang et al 2020 9 achieved almost complete degradation 95 of the neonicotinoid pesticide nitenpyram 5 mg l 1 with a novel dual z scheme g c3n4 wo3 agi photocatalyst under visible light degradation in order to identify the intermediates and products generated along the hdc reaction a new set of experiments was carried out using a significantly higher initial concentration of the pesticides 20 mg l 1 the tentative identification of their structures was carried out analysing different samples along the hdc reaction using an hplc ms scheme 1 shows the reaction pathways proposed for the five neonicotinoid pesticides in first place it must be noted that the release of chloride took place in all cases in fact in the case of thc the non chlorinated counterpart was the only reaction product observed on the other hand those compounds showing a no2 group imd clt and thm suffered its reduction leading to the formation of a nh2 group this mechanism has been widely investigated especially in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene for the production of aniline a relevant commercial product in the polyurethane industry 28 29 in fact pd al2o3 is recognized as an outstanding catalyst for nitriles hydrogenation 30 dealing with water treatment díaz et al 31 showed that catalytic hydrogenation using a pd al2o3 catalyst is a feasible technology for the degradation of nitrophenols obtaining amino compounds as final products in all cases in the current work further hydrogenation of the nh2 group was also observed in the hdc of imd clt and act which ultimately led to the hydrogenolysis of nn or cn bonds and the release of nh4 this behaviour is consistent with those previously reported in the literature 32 apart from the hydrodechlorination of the chlorinated heteroatoms and the reduction of the no2 groups the reasonable hydrogenation of the pyridine act and imd and thiazol clt and thm rings was also observed 3 2 stability tests the stability of the catalyst was evaluated upon four consecutive hdc runs using the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides as target pollutants as representative summary of the results obtained fig 2 shows the conversion of each compound at 15 min reaction time in each run in line with the abovementioned results the same two groups of pollutants can be also distinguished in terms of stability the catalyst showed a remarkable stability with act and imd pesticides as they were completely removed in the four consecutive runs in 15 reaction time these results are consistent with those previously reported for other micropollutants at similar conditions using the pd al2o3 catalyst 16 17 on the opposite a sharp decrease on the conversion of clt thm and thc was observed along the four consecutive runs this effect was particularly evident in the case of thc whose conversion decreased from 80 to 40 from the first to the second run reaching very low conversion values 5 in further experiments this behaviour is consistent with the fact that even with the fresh catalyst thc reaction was stopped after 20 min remaining its concentration almost constant from this reaction time fig 1 it is then clear that a progressive deactivation of the catalyst took place when sulphur bearing pesticides were used as target pollutants which is consistent with our previous work dealing with the hdc of cpz 22 although it was evident that the presence of sulphur in the target pollutant played a key role on the catalyst deactivation the effect was significantly stronger when the micropollutant treated was thc compared to thm and clt this means that the sulphur position has also a remarkable influence on the catalyst poisoning considering that the sulphur content of the three molecules was nearly the same 12 wt in both thm and clt structures the sulphur is contained in the thiazol ring where chlorine is located in position 2 in the case of thc the sulphur atom is part of the thiazolidine ring whereas the chlorine atom is a substituent of the pyridine group the catalyst deactivation found in this work with sulphur bearing pesticides contrast with the behaviour observed in the elimination of such compounds by aop processes these pollutants do not seem to negatively impact the activity of common fe3o4 based catalysts or tio2 photocatalysts for instance serrano et al 2020 27 did not find any sign of deactivation of the fe3o4 r400 catalyst along the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of the same group of neonicotinoid pesticides tested in this work in the same line zabar et al 2012 8 did not observe a deactivation of the tio2 photocatalyst along the oxidation of imd thm and clt therefore it is clear that the deactivation observed in the current work seems to be related to the interaction between pd al2o3 and sulphur bearing neonicotinoid pesticides this fact has been previously observed in the literature in different works 33 35 nevertheless the deactivation of the catalyst depends on the nature of the sulphur species for instance celik et al 2019 34 studied the effect of different sulphur species on the catalyst activity through the hdc of trichloroethylene resulting the presence of bisulfide hs in a deactivation due to the chemisorption of sulfur on the active pd sites of a pd al2o3 catalyst on the other hand the presence of sulphate so4 2 did not seem to affect the catalyst stability the used catalysts were characterized by different techniques to understand the reasons for the deactivation the elemental analyses showed different amounts of carbon deposited on the used catalyst depending on the treated compound in this sense while the catalyst used for act and imd hydrodechlorination showed carbon concentrations around 1 0 wt that used in the clt thc and thm reactions contained carbon amounts of 1 24 1 53 and 2 27 wt respectively it must be noted that these are relevant concentrations considering that 0 15 wt was measured in the fresh catalyst a similar behaviour was found with the sulphur content but to a significantly lesser extent which is expected due to the low sulphur content of the starting pollutants in this sense the highest sulphur concentration in the used catalyst was measured after thc hydrodechlorination 0 07 wt while the content in all the other solids were at or below 0 04 wt on the other hand the specific surface area of the used catalysts was nearly the same as that of the fresh one 270 m2 g 1 which allows to confirm that fouling or pore blockage are not the main cause for catalyst deactivation xps analyses see fig s2 of the supplementary material showed that the pd species present at the catalytic surface remained unchanged along the hdc reaction regardless of the pesticide treated pd pdn 1 according to the previous work of chenakin et al 2014 the contact of a pd catalyst with sulphur species led to significant changes in the pd pdn ratio and thus to a remarkable deactivation 33 this fact was not observed in this work most probably due to the significantly lower concentration of s used in the same line sulphur was not present in the s 2p core level spectra of the used catalysts see fig s3 of the supplementary material nevertheless the content of sulphur in the external surface of the used catalyst was clearly higher 0 12 when ctd thc and thm were used as target pollutants 0 03 was found with act and imd furthermore tem eds analyses of the used catalysts fig 3 suggested that sulphur compounds interacted selectively with the pd nanoparticles in those catalysts as sulphur is only observed on them and not on the al2o3 support see fig s4 of the supplementary material confirming the key role of this species on the deactivation of the catalyst although ftir analyses of the used catalysts were also performed see fig s5 of the supplementary material no conclusive results could be obtained dealing with the possible formation of pd s bonds given the low s and pd contents on the solid to get better insights about the deactivation mechanism new experiments were carried out for such goal thc was selected as target compound given its clear effect on pd catalyst stability to check if thc itself could deactivate the catalyst the fresh solid was immersed in a concentrated solution of thc prior to start a typical reaction procedure the activity of the previously saturated catalyst in the thc hydrodechlorination was nearly the same as that showed by the fresh solid see fig s6 of the supplementary material which suggests that the non chlorinated reaction product is the main reason for the deactivation thus when the molecule contains both cl and s groups it seems to be chemisorbed by the former group onto pd species this cl pd bond would be easily broken upon the hdc reaction nevertheless according to our results when the molecule only presents s the formation of strong pd s bonds seems to be formed which cannot be afterwards broken along hdc 3 3 operation in mixture once demonstrated that the hdc process is effective for the removal of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides the degradation of their mixture was investigated the experiments were performed using the same concentration of each pesticide 1000 μg l 1 and two different catalyst doses 0 25 and 1 g l 1 as can be observed in fig 4 a unexpectedly the sulphur containing pollutants were the most reactive towards hdc complete conversion of thm and clt was reached in 2 h reaction time with rate constants of 0 053 and 0 028 min 1 respectively in the case of thc similar results as those previously achieved in the degradation of the isolated pollutant were obtained in this sense almost 40 conversion was reached in 10 min reaction time with a rate constant value of 0 056 min 1 but from that time until the end of reaction 120 min the reaction rate significantly decreased 0 004 min 1 strikingly the degradation of act and imd was negligible along the whole experiment this allows to confirm that the interaction of sulphur containing pollutants with pd active sites is significantly favoured in comparison with the sulphur free compounds moreover this behaviour also ratifies that the reaction products obtained in the degradation of those sulphur containing pollutants clearly deactivate the catalyst it can be concluded that pd active sites were completely deactivated being the act and imd hydrodechlorination inhibited when the catalyst concentration was increased up to 1 g l 1 fig 4b complete conversion of all sulphur containing pollutants even thc was reached in around 10 min reaction time due to the high excess of pd active sites act and imd were also removed but requiring significantly higher reaction times up to 90 min as their hydrogenation did not begin until the degradation of the sulphur containing compounds was almost complete 3 4 hydrodechlorination regeneration tests in order to overcome the catalyst deactivation in the hdc reactions an efficient regeneration method should be implemented most of the works that have investigated in this field consist of oxidation reduction thermal treatments although the catalyst washing with different solutions such as sodium hydroxyde sodium hypochlorite sodium borohydride hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate has been explored 18 36 39 in our prior contribution we proved that a chemical washing treatment with 750 mg l 1 naclo allowed to regenerate the deactivated pd al2o3 upon hdc of chlorpromazine 22 in the current work that regeneration treatment was also evaluated in three consecutive hydrodechlorination regeneration runs where the neonicotinoid pesticides mixture was treated to warrant the fast removal of all pollutants a catalyst load of 2 g l 1 was fixed the regenerated catalyst was characterized prior being used remarkably the elemental analysis showed similar carbon concentration to the fresh catalyst 0 17 wt in the same line the xps analysis resulted in a pd pdn ratio around 1 furthermore the external surface did not present any sulphur content regarding tem eds analysis the sulphur signal was not showed in the regenerated catalyst confirming that the pd nanoparticles were no longer inactive after the catalyst washing as can be observed in fig 5 the five compounds were completely removed in 5 min reaction time in the first run although up to 10 min were required in the third run it is clear that the regeneration procedure allowed to restoring almost completely the activity of the catalyst hdc has been compared with aops along the different sections of this paper although in the case of aops no deactivation has been observed along the treatment of sulphur bearing neonicotinoid pesticides it should be mentioned that one of the most common deactivation mechanisms is related to fouling by organic intermediates 40 41 accordingly the regeneration procedures commonly involve the thermal treatment of the catalyst 42 3 5 deactivation kinetics as has been shown in section 1 1 thc conversion upon the hdc reaction reaches a plateau in relatively short reaction times which was attributed to a catalyst deactivation phenomenon this fact was further demonstrated in the stability tests where the pd al2o3 catalyst suffered an almost complete deactivation in four sequential hdc runs to gain a better insight about the deactivation kinetics a long term continuous experiment was carried out in a tank reactor at 25 c using a thc 1000 mg l 1 flow rate of 5 ml min 1 a catalyst concentration of 0 25 g l 1 and 50 ml n min 1 of h2 flow rate the evolution of thc upon the hdc reaction under these conditions is depicted in fig 6 as can be seen a dramatic decrease in thc conversion occurred along the whole time on stream to fit these experimental data a catalyst deactivation model previously used in the hdc of other chlorinated pollutants with a pd al2o3 catalyst was evaluated 15 43 this deactivation model based on a pseudo first order kinetics equation describes the activity over time as follows 1 d a d t k d a a where k d is the deactivation kinetic constant min 1 a is the catalyst activity dimensionless from 0 to 1 and a is the residual activity of the catalyst taking into account the mass balance in a continuous stirred tank reactor a can be expressed as 2 w f t h c 0 x t h c 0 r t h c 0 x t h c t r t h c t a r t h c t r t h c 0 x t h c t x t h c 0 where w is the catalyst mass g f a 0 is the thc molar flow mol min 1 x t h c 0 and x t h c t correspond to the initial and t time min thc conversion respectively thus integrating eq 1 leads to 3 x t h c t x t h c 0 e k d t 1 a a the experimental data showed in fig 6 were fitted to eq 3 as can be observed the model allows to describe accurately the strong deactivation suffered by the catalyst during the thc hydrodechlorination obtaining a deactivation kinetic constant of 6 5 10 3 1 6 10 3 min 1 and a residual activity of 0 03 r2 0 98 4 conclusions the micropollutant nature has demonstrated to play a critical role on the reactivity towards the hdc reaction and the stability of the pd catalyst employed this fact has been proved with a relevant group of neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid act imidacloprid imd clothianidin clt thiacloprid thc and thiamethoxam thm while act and imd were completely removed in 30 min the sulphur containing compounds clt thc and thm showed a slower degradation and led to a progressive deactivation of the catalyst in consecutive hdc runs which was associated to the interaction of sulphur species on the pd active sites among the sulphur containing compounds thc was by far the most aggressive pollutant for the catalyst leading to its almost complete deactivation in four consecutive runs nevertheless when the five micropollutants were treated in a mixture the sulphur containing compounds were favoured showing a faster degradation than act and imd which did not begin to degrade until clt thc and thm were completely removed in order to overcome catalyst deactivation consecutive hdc regeneration runs using a simple washing with naclo solution were successfully accomplished finally the high catalyst deactivation suffered in the continuous hdc reaction of thc was successfully fitted to a first order

13773,this work aims to analyse the effectiveness of catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc for the degradation of the neonicotinoid pesticides listed in the eu watch list decision 2018 840 acetamiprid act imidacloprid imd clothianidin clt thiacloprid thc and thiamethoxam thm with the exception of thc all neonicotinoid pesticides 1000 μg l 1 were completely removed in 30 min at 25 c using 0 25 g l 1 of a commercial pd al2o3 1 wt catalyst and 50 n ml min 1 h2 flow rate strikingly the micropollutant nature played a critical role on the activity and stability of the catalyst the sulphur bearing structures clt thc and thm showed the slowest degradation rates and led to a progressive deactivation of the catalyst tem eds and elemental analyses confirmed that the selective interaction of sulphur species on pd active sites was the main reason for catalyst deactivation the position of the heteroatom in the pesticide structure also influenced the catalytic deactivation the catalyst showed a constant activity upon its sequential use in the hdc of act and imd when these compounds were treated individually nevertheless the interaction of the sulphur containing compounds with the catalyst was remarkably favoured when the five micropollutants were treated in a mixture a deactivation kinetic model in a long term experiment was proposed with thc to overcome catalyst deactivation a regeneration procedure based on a simple catalyst washing with a diluted naclo solution was developed the process suitability was finally demonstrated in successive hdc regeneration runs keywords catalytic hydrodechlorination pd al2o3 neonicotinoid pesticides deactivation poisoning 1 introduction catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc is considered a developing technology for the degradation of chlorinated pollutants from water 1 4 this process allows to reduce considerably the effluent toxicity the organochlorinated pollutant reacts with hydrogen which leads to a chlorine free hydrogenated compound and hydrochloric acid 5 moreover the system can be operated under ambient conditions within a wide range of initial pollutant concentrations 6 all these features can be favourably compared with advanced oxidation processes aops which have received so far major attention in the removal of persistent pollutants from water 7 9 these processes are based on the action of hydroxyl radicals which are extraordinarily reactive species which attack most of the organic pollutants non selectively the application of aops usually involve expensive reagents energy requirements and can lead to the generation of harmful by products 10 11 however advanced oxidation processes allow pollutant mineralization while hydrochlorination process only change pollutant chemical structure to make them less toxic or more easily biodegradable hdc has been widely explored for the treatment of priority organochlorinated compounds as well as different real industrial effluents like those of the pulp and paper industry 12 15 nevertheless in the last few years the application of hdc is being focused on the degradation of chlorinated micropollutants obtaining promising results 2 16 17 the wide occurrence of these compounds in fresh waters represents a significant issue for drinking water treatment plants dwtps given their high persistence high toxicity and inherent bioaccumulation character in a prior work 16 hdc proved to be a highly effective process for the degradation of a representative group of organochlorinated micropollutants diclofenac chloramphenicol triclosan and sertraline and also trihalomethanes undesired by products formed in the oxidation step of the raw water in dwtps the complete abatement of micropollutants and trihalomethanes was reached in short reaction times and the catalyst pd al2o3 was fairly stable upon five consecutive runs accordingly hdc was postulated as a promising polishing step for the removal of chlorinated pollutants in dwtps one of the main limitations of hdc is the catalyst deactivation given the high cost of the catalysts commonly based on precious metals 6 catalyst deactivation is a complex phenomenon but poisoning of the metal active sites by the hcl released along reaction by products adsorption leaching of the metal and mechanical damage are identified as the main reasons for the loss of catalytic activity 12 18 in this context pd al2o3 appears as one of the most effective catalysts due to its high resistance towards chlorine poisoning and pd leaching and excellent mechanical strength 19 21 as has been aforementioned hdc over pd al2o3 has proved to be remarkably effective for the removal of a wide range of chlorinated micropollutants nevertheless in a recent work a significant deactivation of this catalyst was found in the hdc of the pharmaceutical chlorpromazine due to the strong interaction between the obtained reaction product promazine and pd active sites 22 despite its importance the effect of the pollutant structure on the stability of the catalyst has been scarcely investigated so far díaz et al 2015 6 showed that pd ac was fairly stable in the hdc of 2 4 dichlorophenol while it suffered an important deactivation in the treatment of 2 4 diclorophenoxyacetic acid and 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid despite all compounds contained the same elements in their structures c h cl o the authors attributed the loss of activity to the accumulation of organochlorinated species on the catalyst surface which was more pronounced with phenoxyacetic compounds than with phenolic ones to get further insights about the influence of the pollutant structure on catalyst deactivation upon hdc a representative group of micropollutans i e neonicotinoid pesticides has been selected in the current work in

these compounds show different chemical composition containing cl n s or o as heteroatoms which is suitable for the stability study the neonicicotinoid pesticides family is the insecticides group most used nowadays worldwide 23 accordingly it is extensively distributed in the environment which poses not only a well known risk for bees but also a threat for aquatic ecosystems and public health due

cm 1 using kbr for the sample preparation 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic hydrodechlorination of neonicotinoid pesticides fig 1 shows the evolution of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides with pd al2o3 catalyst through hdc at 25 c as observed the different compounds can be classified in two different groups according to their reactivity towards hdc the former including act and imd was much more reactive than the latter clt thc and thm while the pesticides act and imd were completely converted in 10 min reaction time the complete conversion of clt and thc required up to 30 min in the case of thc its conversion reached a plateau at 80 after 20 min reaction time which suggests a deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction of this pesticide the main difference between the chemical composition of both groups of compounds is the presence of sulphur in the chemical structure of clt thc and thm which is a recognized poison for pd based catalysts 25 a kinetic study was performed with all pesticides within the temperature range 15 35 c see fig s1 of the supplementary material the resulting pseudo first order rate constant and apparent activation energy values are collected in table 2 the following reactivity order was observed act imd thm thc clt the sulphur bearing pesticides showed rate constant values up to 4 times lower than act and imd all the activation energy values were in the range of 13 31 kj mol 1 which are close to those obtained with other organochlorinated compounds such as chlorophenols or pharmaceuticals i e diclofenac sertraline chlorpromazine using the same catalyst under similar operating conditions 16 22 26 as has been mentioned in the introduction aops have been also investigated to a high extent for the removal of a wide range of organic pollutants including neonicotinoid pesticides 8 9 27 although the comparison of the kinetics among aop and hdc is not straightforward as they are different catalytic systems the reaction time required under optimized conditions operating at ambient temperature are of the same order of magnitude 9 27 in this work reaction times around 15 30 min have been required for the removal of neonicotinoid pesticides by hdc with pd al2o3 as representative examples they will be compared with those achieved with common aops such as fenton oxidation or photocatalysis for instance serrano et al 2020 27 reported reaction times of around 20 min for the removal of the same five neonicotinoid pesticides tested in this work at 1000 μg l 1 using heterogeneous fenton oxidation promoted by natural magnetite somehow higher reaction times up to 2 h were required for the removal of imd thm and clt by photocatalysis using immobilized tio2 8 nevertheless it should be noted that a significantly higher concentration of the pesticides was tested in that work 100 mg l 1 in a more recent work tang et al 2020 9 achieved almost complete degradation 95 of the neonicotinoid pesticide nitenpyram 5 mg l 1 with a novel dual z scheme g c3n4 wo3 agi photocatalyst under visible light degradation in order to identify the intermediates and products generated along the hdc reaction a new set of experiments was carried out using a significantly higher initial concentration of the pesticides 20 mg l 1 the tentative identification of their structures was carried out analysing different samples along the hdc reaction using an hplc ms scheme 1 shows the reaction pathways proposed for the five neonicotinoid pesticides in first place it must be noted that the release of chloride took place in all cases in fact in the case of thc the non chlorinated counterpart was the only reaction product observed on the other hand those compounds showing a no2 group imd clt and thm suffered its reduction leading to the formation of a nh2 group this mechanism has been widely investigated especially in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene for the production of aniline a relevant commercial product in the polyurethane industry 28 29 in fact pd al2o3 is recognized as an outstanding catalyst for nitriles hydrogenation 30 dealing with water treatment díaz et al 31 showed that catalytic hydrogenation using a pd al2o3 catalyst is a feasible technology for the degradation of nitrophenols obtaining amino compounds as final products in all cases in the current work further hydrogenation of the nh2 group was also observed in the hdc of imd clt and act which ultimately led to the hydrogenolysis of nn or cn bonds and the release of nh4 this behaviour is consistent with those previously reported in the literature 32 apart from the hydrodechlorination of the chlorinated heteroatoms and the reduction of the no2 groups the reasonable hydrogenation of the pyridine act and imd and thiazol clt and thm rings was also observed 3 2 stability tests the stability of the catalyst was evaluated upon four consecutive hdc runs using the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides as target pollutants as representative summary of the results obtained fig 2 shows the conversion of each compound at 15 min reaction time in each run in line with the abovementioned results the same two groups of pollutants can be also distinguished in terms of stability the catalyst showed a remarkable stability with act and imd pesticides as they were completely removed in the four consecutive runs in 15 reaction time these results are consistent with those previously reported for other micropollutants at similar conditions using the pd al2o3 catalyst 16 17 on the opposite a sharp decrease on the conversion of clt thm and thc was observed along the four consecutive runs this effect was particularly evident in the case of thc whose conversion decreased from 80 to 40 from the first to the second run reaching very low conversion values 5 in further experiments this behaviour is consistent with the fact that even with the fresh catalyst thc reaction was stopped after 20 min remaining its concentration almost constant from this reaction time fig 1 it is then clear that a progressive deactivation of the catalyst took place when sulphur bearing pesticides were used as target pollutants which is consistent with our previous work dealing with the hdc of cpz 22 although it was evident that the presence of sulphur in the target pollutant played a key role on the catalyst deactivation the effect was significantly stronger when the micropollutant treated was thc compared to thm and clt this means that the sulphur position has also a remarkable influence on the catalyst poisoning considering that the sulphur content of the three molecules was nearly the same 12 wt in both thm and clt structures the sulphur is contained in the thiazol ring where chlorine is located in position 2 in the case of thc the sulphur atom is part of the thiazolidine ring whereas the chlorine atom is a substituent of the pyridine group the catalyst deactivation found in this work with sulphur bearing pesticides contrast with the behaviour observed in the elimination of such compounds by aop processes these pollutants do not seem to negatively impact the activity of common fe3o4 based catalysts or tio2 photocatalysts for instance serrano et al 2020 27 did not find any sign of deactivation of the fe3o4 r400 catalyst along the heterogeneous fenton oxidation of the same group of neonicotinoid pesticides tested in this work in the same line zabar et al 2012 8 did not observe a deactivation of the tio2 photocatalyst along the oxidation of imd thm and clt therefore it is clear that the deactivation observed in the current work seems to be related to the interaction between pd al2o3 and sulphur bearing neonicotinoid pesticides this fact has been previously observed in the literature in different works 33 35 nevertheless the deactivation of the catalyst depends on the nature of the sulphur species for instance celik et al 2019 34 studied the effect of different sulphur species on the catalyst activity through the hdc of trichloroethylene resulting the presence of bisulfide hs in a deactivation due to the chemisorption of sulfur on the active pd sites of a pd al2o3 catalyst on the other hand the presence of sulphate so4 2 did not seem to affect the catalyst stability the used catalysts were characterized by different techniques to understand the reasons for the deactivation the elemental analyses showed different amounts of carbon deposited on the used catalyst depending on the treated compound in this sense while the catalyst used for act and imd hydrodechlorination showed carbon concentrations around 1 0 wt that used in the clt thc and thm reactions contained carbon amounts of 1 24 1 53 and 2 27 wt respectively it must be noted that these are relevant concentrations considering that 0 15 wt was measured in the fresh catalyst a similar behaviour was found with the sulphur content but to a significantly lesser extent which is expected due to the low sulphur content of the starting pollutants in this sense the highest sulphur concentration in the used catalyst was measured after thc hydrodechlorination 0 07 wt while the content in all the other solids were at or below 0 04 wt on the other hand the specific surface area of the used catalysts was nearly the same as that of the fresh one 270 m2 g 1 which allows to confirm that fouling or pore blockage are not the main cause for catalyst deactivation xps analyses see fig s2 of the supplementary material showed that the pd species present at the catalytic surface remained unchanged along the hdc reaction regardless of the pesticide treated pd pdn 1 according to the previous work of chenakin et al 2014 the contact of a pd catalyst with sulphur species led to significant changes in the pd pdn ratio and thus to a remarkable deactivation 33 this fact was not observed in this work most probably due to the significantly lower concentration of s used in the same line sulphur was not present in the s 2p core level spectra of the used catalysts see fig s3 of the supplementary material nevertheless the content of sulphur in the external surface of the used catalyst was clearly higher 0 12 when ctd thc and thm were used as target pollutants 0 03 was found with act and imd furthermore tem eds analyses of the used catalysts fig 3 suggested that sulphur compounds interacted selectively with the pd nanoparticles in those catalysts as sulphur is only observed on them and not on the al2o3 support see fig s4 of the supplementary material confirming the key role of this species on the deactivation of the catalyst although ftir analyses of the used catalysts were also performed see fig s5 of the supplementary material no conclusive results could be obtained dealing with the possible formation of pd s bonds given the low s and pd contents on the solid to get better insights about the deactivation mechanism new experiments were carried out for such goal thc was selected as target compound given its clear effect on pd catalyst stability to check if thc itself could deactivate the catalyst the fresh solid was immersed in a concentrated solution of thc prior to start a typical reaction procedure the activity of the previously saturated catalyst in the thc hydrodechlorination was nearly the same as that showed by the fresh solid see fig s6 of the supplementary material which suggests that the non chlorinated reaction product is the main reason for the deactivation thus when the molecule contains both cl and s groups it seems to be chemisorbed by the former group onto pd species this cl pd bond would be easily broken upon the hdc reaction nevertheless according to our results when the molecule only presents s the formation of strong pd s bonds seems to be formed which cannot be afterwards broken along hdc 3 3 operation in mixture once demonstrated that the hdc process is effective for the removal of the isolated neonicotinoid pesticides the degradation of their mixture was investigated the experiments were performed using the same concentration of each pesticide 1000 μg l 1 and two different catalyst doses 0 25 and 1 g l 1 as can be observed in fig 4 a unexpectedly the sulphur containing pollutants were the most reactive towards hdc complete conversion of thm and clt was reached in 2 h reaction time with rate constants of 0 053 and 0 028 min 1 respectively in the case of thc similar results as those previously achieved in the degradation of the isolated pollutant were obtained in this sense almost 40 conversion was reached in 10 min reaction time with a rate constant value of 0 056 min 1 but from that time until the end of reaction 120 min the reaction rate significantly decreased 0 004 min 1 strikingly the degradation of act and imd was negligible along the whole experiment this allows to confirm that the interaction of sulphur containing pollutants with pd active sites is significantly favoured in comparison with the sulphur free compounds moreover this behaviour also ratifies that the reaction products obtained in the degradation of those sulphur containing pollutants clearly deactivate the catalyst it can be concluded that pd active sites were completely deactivated being the act and imd hydrodechlorination inhibited when the catalyst concentration was increased up to 1 g l 1 fig 4b complete conversion of all sulphur containing pollutants even thc was reached in around 10 min reaction time due to the high excess of pd active sites act and imd were also removed but requiring significantly higher reaction times up to 90 min as their hydrogenation did not begin until the degradation of the sulphur containing compounds was almost complete 3 4 hydrodechlorination regeneration tests in order to overcome the catalyst deactivation in the hdc reactions an efficient regeneration method should be implemented most of the works that have investigated in this field consist of oxidation reduction thermal treatments although the catalyst washing with different solutions such as sodium hydroxyde sodium hypochlorite sodium borohydride hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate has been explored 18 36 39 in our prior contribution we proved that a chemical washing treatment with 750 mg l 1 naclo allowed to regenerate the deactivated pd al2o3 upon hdc of chlorpromazine 22 in the current work that regeneration treatment was also evaluated in three consecutive hydrodechlorination regeneration runs where the neonicotinoid pesticides mixture was treated to warrant the fast removal of all pollutants a catalyst load of 2 g l 1 was fixed the regenerated catalyst was characterized prior being used remarkably the elemental analysis showed similar carbon concentration to the fresh catalyst 0 17 wt in the same line the xps analysis resulted in a pd pdn ratio around 1 furthermore the external surface did not present any sulphur content regarding tem eds analysis the sulphur signal was not showed in the regenerated catalyst confirming that the pd nanoparticles were no longer inactive after the catalyst washing as can be observed in fig 5 the five compounds were completely removed in 5 min reaction time in the first run although up to 10 min were required in the third run it is clear that the regeneration procedure allowed to restoring almost completely the activity of the catalyst hdc has been compared with aops along the different sections of this paper although in the case of aops no deactivation has been observed along the treatment of sulphur bearing neonicotinoid pesticides it should be mentioned that one of the most common deactivation mechanisms is related to fouling by organic intermediates 40 41 accordingly the regeneration procedures commonly involve the thermal treatment of the catalyst 42 3 5 deactivation kinetics as has been shown in section 1 1 thc conversion upon the hdc reaction reaches a plateau in relatively short reaction times which was attributed to a catalyst deactivation phenomenon this fact was further demonstrated in the stability tests where the pd al2o3 catalyst suffered an almost complete deactivation in four sequential hdc runs to gain a better insight about the deactivation kinetics a long term continuous experiment was carried out in a tank reactor at 25 c using a thc 1000 mg l 1 flow rate of 5 ml min 1 a catalyst concentration of 0 25 g l 1 and 50 ml n min 1 of h2 flow rate the evolution of thc upon the hdc reaction under these conditions is depicted in fig 6 as can be seen a dramatic decrease in thc conversion occurred along the whole time on stream to fit these experimental data a catalyst deactivation model previously used in the hdc of other chlorinated pollutants with a pd al2o3 catalyst was evaluated 15 43 this deactivation model based on a pseudo first order kinetics equation describes the activity over time as follows 1 d a d t k d a a where k d is the deactivation kinetic constant min 1 a is the catalyst activity dimensionless from 0 to 1 and a is the residual activity of the catalyst taking into account the mass balance in a continuous stirred tank reactor a can be expressed as 2 w f t h c 0 x t h c 0 r t h c 0 x t h c t r t h c t a r t h c t r t h c 0 x t h c t x t h c 0 where w is the catalyst mass g f a 0 is the thc molar flow mol min 1 x t h c 0 and x t h c t correspond to the initial and t time min thc conversion respectively thus integrating eq 1 leads to 3 x t h c t x t h c 0 e k d t 1 a a the experimental data showed in fig 6 were fitted to eq 3 as can be observed the model allows to describe accurately the strong deactivation suffered by the catalyst during the thc hydrodechlorination obtaining a deactivation kinetic constant of 6 5 10 3 1 6 10 3 min 1 and a residual activity of 0 03 r2 0 98 4 conclusions the micropollutant nature has demonstrated to play a critical role on the reactivity towards the hdc reaction and the stability of the pd catalyst employed this fact has been proved with a relevant group of neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid act imidacloprid imd clothianidin clt thiacloprid thc and thiamethoxam thm while act and imd were completely removed in 30 min the sulphur containing compounds clt thc and thm showed a slower degradation and led to a progressive deactivation of the catalyst in consecutive hdc runs which was associated to the interaction of sulphur species on the pd active sites among the sulphur containing compounds thc was by far the most aggressive pollutant for the catalyst leading to its almost complete deactivation in four consecutive runs nevertheless when the five micropollutants were treated in a mixture the sulphur containing compounds were favoured showing a faster degradation than act and imd which did not begin to degrade until clt thc and thm were completely removed in order to overcome catalyst deactivation consecutive hdc regeneration runs using a simple washing with naclo solution were successfully accomplished finally the high catalyst deactivation suffered in the continuous hdc reaction of thc was successfully fitted to a first order

13774,this study focuses on phosphorus recovery from simulated aqueous environment by hydrothermally carbonized microalgae biomass a detailed study on parameters influencing adsorption such as time 10 60 min temperature 10 60 c agitation speed 50 250 rpm and bio char concentration 0 3 1 5 g l was carried out batch studies showed a maximum 90 phosphorus removal for a concentration of bio char of 1 5 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm temperature of 60 c and at 60 min the adsorption experimental data fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir isotherm models with correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively according to langmuir model phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption capacity of bio char was 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g with least error to avoid leaching of ammonia and phosphorus to atmosphere the spent bio char was activated with ammonia and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and tested as fertilizer pot experiments performed with tomato plant showed that spent bio char is an excellent fertilizer and comparable to commercial di ammonium phosphate dap the plants cultivated with spent bio char fertilizer have reached an average height of 22 0 5 cm and their chlorophyll contents were 24 5 0 42 mg g this study provides a proof of concept and it can be extended to real time wastewater in future this study is an example of sustainable approach towards recovery of valuable phosphorus from aqueous environment and using it as fertile soil amendment keywords phosphorus wastewater bio char microalgae fertilizer 1 introduction urbanized population and growing industries have consumed groundwater enormously and resulted in surging wastewater generation 1 3 the reason is that almost all the process in our day to day life needs water and at the end of the process not all the water is being utilized efficiently which results in large quantity of wastewater the wastewater becomes unfit for the environment as it contains a variety of physical chemical or biological pollutants depending on the source of the wastewater 4 5 the major issue that the world faces at present is the scarcity of water even though two third of the earth is made up of water all of this water is not available for consumption as they are locked in ice caps or saline in nature therefore we must look for an economical and eco friendly technique to make the wastewater fit for the environment 6 9 currently techniques such as precipitation coagulation ozonation ion exchange adsorption and reverse osmosis are being used to removal organic pollutants from wastewater 10 13 different types of wastewater generated are domestic wastewater municipal wastewater agricultural wastewater aquaculture and piggery wastewater amongst all these types of wastewater municipal wastewater tends to contain more quantity of organic pollutants 14 15 common biological wastewater treatments modes are aerated lagoons anaerobic digestion algae processing microbe assisted membranes etc biological wastewater treatment modes results in degradation and decomposition of nutrients in the wastewater amongst all these methods algae cultivation was superior as it produces biomass via sequestration of carbon dioxide from atmosphere for photosynthesis process in presence of sunlight and treated wastewater at the end of the process 16 agricultural wastewater are rich in organic pollutants like phosphorus and ammonia the agricultural wastewater was treated via adsorption process as we can recover phosphorus from wastewater the phosphorus rich adsorbate can be used as fertilizer for plants hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process in which any kind of biomass can be converted into a solid coal like fuel called bio char htc of the biomass was carried out at a temperature of 300 500 c and pressure of 10 40 bar for 1 6 h the advantages of the htc process are they are co2 neutral process high carbon efficiency no pre drying is required as it is a wet process a variety of biomass can be processed exothermic in nature low processing cost eco friendly and easy handling 17 18 algal biomass are rich in nutrients and thus can be used directly as feedstock s for aquaculture solid fuel production biofuel production and lipid extraction 19 bio char can be used as adsorbent to remove organic pollutants dye metals etc from wastewater efficiently 8 carbonization is preferred than pyrolysis since it requires only moderate temperature while later needs higher temperature algal biomass helps in efficient recovery of nutrients from wastewater when converted into carbonized bio coal 20 carbonized bio char helps in with holding the water at higher rate and this makes them a better soli amendment 21 bio char possess the ability to withhold the pollutants adsorbed from the aqueous environment 22 recovery of nutrients from wastewater was the hot topic in current scenario as it was ease of operation for wastewater treatment 23 24 numerous elements such as phosphate sulphate nitrate heavy metals etc are recovered from wastewater through adsorption membrane filtration etc bio char microbes and other elements are used to recover these compounds from wastewater globally 25 the spent bio char was used as soil amendment as an alternative to chemical fertilizer and pesticide repellent 26 this helps in better plant growth as it is comparable to the commercial chemical fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium spent bio char when added as fertilizer it helps in better fixation in rhizospheres 27 water retention capacity of bio char depends upon the pore size pore volume and surface composition 28 table 1 provides the broad literature survey on nutrient recovery from various wastewater fertilizer is the material that is basically made of natural or from synthetic origin that was applied to soil for plant growth agriculture in last decades was depended on potassium k of 23 nitrogen n of 21 and phosphorus p of 21 as in npk fertilizers 29 npk usage has increased almost 800 during 1961 2019 30 government of india goi has passed a regulation on essential commodity act in 1957 to regulate the price and distribution of fertilizer all over the country 31 agricultural trade policy was initiated by goi to ensure self sufficiency in agricultural sector and consumers 32 microalgae scenedesmus sp was converted into bio char via htc in this study to remove phosphorus from wastewater to the best of our knowledge there were not much studies reported on reuse of spent bio char as fertilizer for plant cultivation therefore the novelty of this study was adsorb phosphorus from wastewater by bio char and the property of spent bio char as fertilizer on plant growth was evaluated before plant growth studies the spent bio char was activated with ammonia and phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms in this present study bio char was prepared via hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae biomass cultivated from wastewater the effect of parameters on phosphorus adsorption capacity of bio char from aqueous environment was investigated the surface properties and functional groups of the bio char was depicted by scanning electron microscopy sem and infrared spectroscopy ft ir the isotherm and kinetic models were validated and interpreted for all experimental data the fertilizer nature of spent bio char raw bio char and di ammonium phosphorus dap are studied with tomato plants in bamboo pots effect of spent bio char vs dap and raw bio char on plant height moisture and chlorophyll content are investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 bio char preparation the microalgae biomass for carbonization was cultivated following the procedure mentioned in the previous study 47 precisely the algae was cultivated in a hybrid loop airlift photo bioreactor hlalpbr using 5 l of domestic wastewater the biomass was cultivated at temperature of 30 2 c and light intensity of 4000 lx for a time of 16 days the harvested microalgae biomass was converted into bio char via htc the htc experiments were performed in a closed stainless steel reactor under ammoniacal nitrogen environment algae biomass of 20 g was converted into bio char in an airtight stainless steel reactor of 250 ml capacity under nitrogen environment the reactor was heated with 200 ml of water at a reaction temperature of 350 c at a pressure of 5 mpa for a residence time of 60 min the slurry was mixed with dichloromethane and the bio char was recovered using separating funnel 48 49 higher temperature leads to higher amount of ash formation hence medium temperature range was used electric furnace provided the heat energy required for carbonization of biomass after the experiments reactor was cooled rapidly using cold water the bio char solid carbonaceous product was washed using deionized water and dried in air at last the bio char was stored in sealed containers for further experiments 2 2 characterization of bio char the elemental analysis of the bio char was performed in accordance with the american society for testing and materials astm standard test methods using elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 japan to determine the percentage of carbon hydrogen ammoniacal nitrogen and sulphur content prior to astm analysis the recovered bio char was oven dried at 110 c to free from moisture content proximate analysis of the bio char was carried out as per astm standards to determine the moisture and ash content 50 the surface properties and microstructures of the bio char were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 6510 japan the infrared spectroscopy analysis of bio char was performed using perkin elmer ftirc 100566 japan instrument 2 3 phosphorus removal study 2 3 1 preparation of wastewater the phosphorus rich wastewater was prepared in lab conditions to study the effect of various parameters during adsorption process the formulated wastewater was prepared to meet the characteristics of distillery wastewater chemicals used for wastewater preparation are potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium acid phthalate sodium hydroxide and ammonium sulphate are purchased from srihari chemicals india few modifications in pollutants concentrations were made as compared to the parameters studied 46 the simulated wastewater had ph of 7 3 chemical oxygen demand cod of 5000 mg l phosphorus concentration of 150 mg l and ammoniacal nitrogen of 80 mg l respectively concentrations of each pollutants were measured using standard methods before and after adsorption experiments ammoniacal nitrogen was

impact of parameters on adsorption process one parameter was varied while other parameters were kept constant all the experiments were performed in an incubator cum shaker for betterment of adsorption process the samples were collected after the experiments and filtered using whatman no 4 filter paper pore size 20 μm the adsorption capacity of filter paper was tested to depict whether it influence the adsorption process in all experimental conditions blank absence of testing substance and control without bio char and presence of known amount of testing substance i e cod of 5000 mg l phosphorus

fertilizer was studied through pot studies agricultural soil with ph of 7 1 carbon content of 7 5 wt phosphorus of 0 2 g kg was used as support for plant growth with bio char the soil and bio char were sieved to even size of 1 mm in order to eliminate the higher sized particles to evaluate the soil fertility nature control pot without bio char or dap was used as pot 1 0 5 g of bio char pot 2 0 5 g of di ammonium phosphorus dap pot 3 and 0 5 g of spent bio char pot 4 were added in three different pots and studied for the period of 30 days pots of width 8 cm and height 15 cm were used with 250 g of soil tomato plants were seeded and watered at regular intervals the pots were placed outdoor in sunlight for traditional photosynthesis and growth the plant height was noted periodically for all three conditions the chlorophyll content of plants grown on different soil conditions were evaluated by biochemical method 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass and bio char characterization the microalgae biomass was analyzed for its characteristics such as proximate and ultimate composition the biomass had 54 23 of carbon 9 8 of hydrogen 4 2 of ammoniacal nitrogen 2 7 of sulphur and 28 of oxygen bio char yield was 3 4 g 20 g of biomass from the htc process at a temperature of 350 c the biomass had 13 2 wt and 9 2 wt of moisture and ash content from our recent studies it was seen that the algae biomass had carbon 41 55 wt hydrogen 6 8 wt nitrogen 1 7 wt and oxygen 30 50 wt content respectively 21 47 48 the bio char resulted from the htc composed of 85 3 of carbon 4 9 of hydrogen and 8 5 of oxygen content similarly bio char produced from microalgae s obliquus resulted in carbon content of 71 42 wt 50 in another study carbonization of alaria resulted in carbon hydrogen sulphur and oxygen of 59 1 5 6 0 3 and 17 3 wt respectively 20 higher temperature of the htc conditions resulted in favor of higher degree of carbon formation due to evaporation of moisture and volatile compounds after the htc experiments the bio char was analyzed via sem spectroscopy to depict its surface properties as shown in fig 1 the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis revealed that bio char composed of small cracks and pores of size 10 μm and volume of 0 01 cm3 g the surface area of the bio char was 117 m2 g degradation of moisture impurities during htc process ended up in formation these void pores 55 56 and it was clear from sem images these pores present on the surface of the char helps in adsorption process by cross linking with pollutants present in the aquatic system aggregate formation was also seen from the images and it may reduce the pores when compared to activated carbon 57 aggregate formation was due to the physical and chemical reactions occurred during the htc process amount of aggregate formation depends upon the temperature pressure and quantity of finer particles in the bio char the finer particles tends to bind at pressurized conditions to initiate the aggregate formation the organic compounds in the biomass leads to decompose as glue and helps in binding of these finer particles into agglomerates the infrared analysis exposed the functional groups present on the surface of bio char the peaks seen at 2950 27 cm 1 2924 56 cm 1 and 2856 23 cm 1 corresponds to c h stretching due to carboxylic acids the intense band at 1450 80 cm 1 evident to presence of cc stretching the intense peaks at 1378 25 cm 1 1215 01 cm 1 1055 05 cm 1 corresponds to co extending vibrations similar functional groups were also reported for the bio char prepared from cassis fistula for adsorption process 58 based on the pore formation and major functional groups with adsorption properties on the surface makes them a vital condidate on adsorption process in current scenario 3 2 phosphorus removal study 3 2 1 effect of adsorption temperature the effect of temperature 10 60 c on phosphorus adsorption by bio char was studied the other parameters like concentration of bio char was 1 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm and time was 60 min the percentage removal of ammoniacal nitrogen cod and phosphorus from wastewater by bio char was plotted against temperature and shown in fig 2 the percentage removal of phosphorus was 90 ammonia was 73 and cod was 76 at temperature of 60 c from the results it was seen that the trend of pollutants removal is slowed at higher temperatures the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible of 0 08 0 05 and 0 1 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the blank was used for calibration of analysis since it does not had any testing substance and control samples showed 99 88 99 9 and 99 9 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample the loss of 0 12 0 1 and 0 1 is negligible as it may be lost due to handling errors the kinetic energy of the adsorbent increases with increase in temperature and thus the adsorbed pollutants undergo desorption it was reported that adsorption capacity increases because of the mobility of the adsorbate increases at higher temperature causing a reduction in retarding force acted on the diffusing ions 59 the chemical oxygen demand removal percentage increased gradually from 68 at 40 c to 76 at 60 c loess biomass removed 0 095 mg l of phosphorous at 60 c from the municipal wastewater 60 the ammonia adsorption capacity of bentonite chitosan beads was 2 25 mg g at temperature of 20 c 61 activated carbon derived from coconut shell resulted in 50 74 of cod removal respectively 62 3 2 2 effect of contact time the removal percentage of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod on bio char was investigated to depict the equilibrium contact time the effect of time 0 90 min on adsorption of pollutants in to bio char was shown in fig 3 the experimental conditions are agitation speed of 150 rpm bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c from the results it can inferred that increase in contact time beyond 60 min does not resulted in much removal percentage of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of time since it showed 0 03 0 08 and 0 09 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 91 99 86 and 99 93 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample adsorption is a balancing process and thus the adsorption of ions by the adsorbent attains equilibrium eventually and thus preventing further adsorption by the adsorbent at 60 min the removal of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod was 90 73 and 69 respectively in our study the equilibrium time for phosphorus and ammonia removal was 60 min and it was 70 min for cod removal respectively zeolite attained equilibrium conditions at 15 min showed 90 of adsorption efficiency for phosphorus removal in a previous study 63 adsorption of ammonia by bentonite chitosan attained equilibrium at a reaction time of 30 min with removal percentage of 60 61 bagasse fly ash on cod removal attained equilibrium at time of 180 min with removal of 50 cod 64 contact time obtained from this lab scale study helps us to evaluate the time required to process enormous amount of wastewater generated from industry scale the study also helps to determine the time required for nutrient removal when concentration of nutrients vary from the wastewater irrespective of quantity 3 2 3 effect of bio char concentration bio char dosage was the major factor that determine the capacity of bio char on removal percentage of pollutants from aquatic system the effect of bio char dosage 0 3 1 5 g l on pollutant removal was evaluated and depicted in fig 4 the experimental conditions are agitation speed of 150 rpm time of 60 min and temperature of 60 c the maximum adsorption was 89 72 and 60 for 1 5 g l of bio char dosage the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of the concentration of the bio char added since it showed 0 05 0 1 and 0 02 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 86 99 97 and 99 92 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample increase in bio char dosage leads to increase in adsorption active sites and surface area this shows that the pollutants gets adsorbed at higher proportion onto the surface of the bio char increase in bio char concentration from 0 9 to 1 5 g l does not showed greater difference in phosphorus removal efficiency as the wastewater was enriched with organic compounds this contributes to the cod of the wastewater the cod of wastewater is reduced during adsorption process by the binding of these compounds to the pores of bio char the functional groups present on the surface of bio char determines the rate of cod removal the mechanism of cod removal depends upon the rate of adsorption of organic compounds in the wastewater by the bio char as ion exchange process 21 65 66 3 2 4 effect of agitation speed the agitation speed is one of the parameter which has impact on adsorption process mixing the solution enables the even distribution of solute in the solution the agitation experiments were performed with varying agitation rates of 50 250 rpm time of 60 min bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c from the results fig 5 it was clear that increase in agitation speed beyond 150 rpm does not increased the adsorption efficiency beyond 150 rpm negligible increments in removal percentage of all three pollutants were noted the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of agitation speed since it showed 0 1 0 12 and 0 04 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 84 99 92 and 99 95 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample higher agitation speed led to adverse effects like breakdown of bonded adsorbent and adsorbate by strong shear force 67 3 3 validation of isotherm models adsorption isotherms provides the best fit to engage pollutants in the active sites of bio char from the wastewater at equilibrium conditions langmuir freundlich and henry s models were fitted phosphorus 0 400 mg l and ammonia 0 200 mg l removal using matlab r2020a software in our study the correlation coefficient r2 values for phosphorus removal were almost same 0 999 0 988 and 0 99 for all three isotherm models it was also in similar trend for ammoniacal nitrogen 0 99 0 98 and 0 998 for all three isotherm models table 2 provides the detailed report on isotherm models of both phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption the parameters like coefficient values r2 error values rmse root mean square error and sse sum of squared error were obtained from the fit and elaborated in table 2 in literature it was reported that langmuir model fits and provide equal adsorption rate when the adsorbent has homogenous surface heterogeneous active sites lead to multilayer adsorption 68 the adsorption capacity of bio char was found to be 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g for phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen respectively the bio char showed a better adsorption of phosphorus from aqueous system and it was comparable with characterization performed in batch studies from the r2 values it was clear that the adsorption system follows multilayer adsorption since langmuir and freundlich does not showed much difference in correlation coefficient values higher correlation coefficient with low error value are the reason for phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen removal system as multilayer hence it can be concluded that the adsorption of phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen into bio char was favorable 3 4 adsorption kinetic models kinetic models were fitted to determine the effect of parameters on adsorption rate pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris models were fitted using matlab r2020a software for experimental data figs 6 and 7 shows the adsorption kinetic models fitted for the experimental data obtained from phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen removal study the rate constant with correlation coefficient r2 and constants were elaborated in table 3 from the results it was depicted that pseudo first order kinetic model fitted well among all three models the correlation coefficient values r2 are 0 97 0 96 and 0 93 for phosphorus and 0 96 0 96 and 0 92 for ammoniacal nitrogen removal data respectively it was reported in literature that when concentration of phosphorus was an important parameter then it follows pseudo first order kinetics 69 when time is considered as a parameter then it was depicted in literature as physical adsorption was favored in phosphate adsorption onto bio char for initial 4 h of the reaction time 70 beyond this as adsorption tendency slows down which leads to shift from physical to chemical due to attainment of balance of ions between bio char and aqueous system 71 based on this literature support and it was concluded that our results follows physi sorption since our study showed 60 min as optimal time followed first order kinetics and exhibited langmuir isotherm hence arrhenius theory was not studied as it was a temperature depended process 3 5 bio char as fertilizer elemental and ultimate analysis of spent bio char were performed the fertilizer study was performed with spent bio char obtained from the adsorption conditions such as time of 60 min mixing rate of 150 rpm bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c the spent bio char had moisture content of 36 8 wt and carbon content of 87 6 wt respectively after the adsorption experiments the bio char composed of various functional groups the bands found at 3027 91 cm 1 due to presence of oh groups attributed from the water molecules the peaks seen at 2957 94 cm 1 2925 75 cm 1 and 2873 18 cm 1 corresponds to c h stretching due to carboxylic acids the intense band at 1461 80 cm 1 1495 54 cm 1 and 1604 56 cm 1 was attributed by the presence of cc stretching the intense peaks at 1378 91 cm 1 1080 90 cm 1 and 1030 10 cm 1 corresponds to co extending vibrations few bands were also seen below 725 80 cm 1 due to the aromatic compounds 72 the spent bio char had reduced the cod phosphorus and ammonia from aqueous environment to avoid release of phosphorus and ammonia to atmosphere the spent bio char was activated with phosphorus and ammonia solubilizing bacteria bacterial culture rhizobium and bacillus megatarium of 1 ml was added to the spent bio char and kept undisturbed for 24 h at room temperature after the incubation period the spent bio char was studied to depict its fertilizer nature 3 5 1 effect of spent bio char on plant height the potential of spent bio char as fertilizer was compared with raw bio char and dap in three different pots tomato plant was seeded and cultivated in all three pots under sunlight with humid conditions height of the plants in all four pots were measured once they sprouted and started to grow from the results fig 8 it was inferred that the height of the plant grown in the spent bio char dap raw bio char and control pot was 22 cm 18 cm 14 cm and 10 cm at 30th day of the study the plant growth was higher in spent bio char since it contain relatively higher amount of ammoniacal nitrogen and phosphorus components the commercially available dap fertilizer exhibited only a fixed amount of nutrition furthermore the addition of phosphorus and nitrate solubilizing bacteria in spent bio char made these nutrients readily bio available compared to direct chemical fertilizers hence it can be concluded that adsorption of phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen by bio char by adsorption process will be economical and eco friendly since the bio char is a by product of the process of hydrothermal carbonization it possess minimal environmental hazard comparatively this eco friendly fertilizer can be of great potent as fertilizer to improve the plants productivity if studied more deeply 3 5 2 plant properties 3 5 2 1 moisture and weight of plant apart from the influence of spent bio char on plant growth the chlorophyll and moisture content of the plant was also measured the tomato plants cultivated in four pots such as only soil control and soil mixed with fresh bio char spent bio char and dap are compared to depict the fertilizer nature the spent bio char showed higher plant growth with higher chlorophyll content and moisture content since it composed of adsorbed ammonium and phosphorus the chlorophyll content was 10 4 13 5 24 5 and 19 6 mg g for control raw bio char spent bio char and dap respectively after the cultivation the wet and dry weight of plant was weighed to depict its moisture holding capacity table 4 provides the data for chlorophyll dry and wet weight of plants cultivated in all three pots the dry weight was 285 385 640 and 525 mg for plant cultivated in control raw bio char spent bio char and dap respectively the dry weight of the plant cultivated in spent bio char comparatively higher than the other two the additional amount of ammonium and phosphorus in the spent bio char helped the plant to grow better than other plants from this study it was inferred that bio char accumulates the pollutants from aqueous environment and it served as fertilizer for plant growth the sustainability statement of this study was that the algae biomass was cultivated from wastewater and this biomass was converted into bio char this bio char was used to recover valuable phosphorus from wastewater the spent bio char was used as fertilizer to enhance the plant growth as soil amendment in this way this study provides an sustainable way for wastewater treatment and recovery of valuable products for soil amendment the methods for analyzing the sustainability was via depicting the adsorption capacity of bio char and fertilizer nature of spent bio char 73 75 in future this study can be applied to recover valuable phosphorus from wastewater as phosphorus leads to algal bloom formation in water environment since it serves as a vital food supplement for algal growth in india huge quantity of fertilizer was used in agriculture sector for grain production annually phosphorus rich wastewater are resulted from leaching of chemicals from agricultural sector fertilizer manufacturing industries rock phosphate mining geographic locations etc spent bio char with phosphorus can be used as bio fertilizer as they are eco friendly and economical than chemical fertilizers due to high water retention behavior and bio degradability nature of bio char it can be used in gardens lawns center medians of highways etc in our future study we have planned to recover phosphate from real time wastewater obtained from rock phosphate mining sector using bio char derived from sewage sludge and agricultural residues 3 6 conclusions in this study microalgae biomass was carbonized to effectively adsorb phosphorus from aqueous environment the factors influencing phosphorus removal are studied and it showed bio char concentration of 1 5 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm temperature of 60 c at 60 min achieved maximum removal rate the phosphorus adsorption followed pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model the langmuir model showed phosphorus and ammonia adsorption capacity of bio char was 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g this showed that bio char had excellent properties to remove phosphorus of 90 and ammoniacal nitrogen of 73 from aqueous environment at 60 min the spent bio char was activated with ammonium and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and its role as fertilizer was evaluated with commercially available dap the spent bio char resulted in plant height of 22 cm chlorophyll content of 24 5 mg g and dry weight of 640 mg respectively this sustainable and holistic approach provides dual advantage of phosphorus recovery from wastewater and treatment of wastewater in an eco friendly manner declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement authors thank ssn trust and sathyabama

13774,this study focuses on phosphorus recovery from simulated aqueous environment by hydrothermally carbonized microalgae biomass a detailed study on parameters influencing adsorption such as time 10 60 min temperature 10 60 c agitation speed 50 250 rpm and bio char concentration 0 3 1 5 g l was carried out batch studies showed a maximum 90 phosphorus removal for a concentration of bio char of 1 5 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm temperature of 60 c and at 60 min the adsorption experimental data fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir isotherm models with correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively according to langmuir model phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption capacity of bio char was 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g with least error to avoid leaching of ammonia and phosphorus to atmosphere the spent bio char was activated with ammonia and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and tested as fertilizer pot experiments performed with tomato plant showed that spent bio char is an excellent fertilizer and comparable to commercial di ammonium phosphate dap the plants cultivated with spent bio char fertilizer have reached an average height of 22 0 5 cm and their chlorophyll contents were 24 5 0 42 mg g this study provides a proof of concept and it can be extended to real time wastewater in future this study is an example of sustainable approach towards recovery of valuable phosphorus from aqueous environment and using it as fertile soil amendment keywords phosphorus wastewater bio char microalgae fertilizer 1 introduction urbanized population and growing industries have consumed groundwater enormously and resulted in surging wastewater generation 1 3 the reason is that almost all the process in our day to day life needs water and at the end of the process not all the water is being utilized efficiently which results in large quantity of wastewater the wastewater becomes unfit for the environment as it contains a variety of physical chemical or biological pollutants depending on the source of the wastewater 4 5 the major issue that the world faces at present is the scarcity of water even though two third of the earth is made up of water all of this water is not available for consumption as they are locked in ice caps or saline in nature therefore we must look for an economical and eco friendly technique to make the wastewater fit for the environment 6 9 currently techniques such as precipitation coagulation ozonation ion exchange adsorption and reverse osmosis are being used to removal organic pollutants from wastewater 10 13 different types of wastewater generated are domestic wastewater municipal wastewater agricultural wastewater aquaculture and piggery wastewater amongst all these types of wastewater municipal wastewater tends to contain more quantity of organic pollutants 14 15 common biological wastewater treatments modes are aerated lagoons anaerobic digestion algae processing microbe assisted membranes etc biological wastewater treatment modes results in degradation and decomposition of nutrients in the wastewater amongst all these methods algae cultivation was superior as it produces biomass via sequestration of carbon dioxide from atmosphere for photosynthesis process in presence of sunlight and treated wastewater at the end of the process 16 agricultural wastewater are rich in organic pollutants like phosphorus and ammonia the agricultural wastewater was treated via adsorption process as we can recover phosphorus from wastewater the phosphorus rich adsorbate can be used as fertilizer for plants hydrothermal carbonization htc is a process in which any kind of biomass can be converted into a solid coal like fuel called bio char htc of the biomass was carried out at a temperature of 300 500 c and pressure of 10 40 bar for 1 6 h the advantages of the htc process are they are co2 neutral process high carbon efficiency no pre drying is required as it is a wet process a variety of biomass can be processed exothermic in nature low processing cost eco friendly and easy handling 17 18 algal biomass are rich in nutrients and thus can be used directly as feedstock s for aquaculture solid fuel production biofuel production and lipid extraction 19 bio char can be used as adsorbent to remove organic pollutants dye metals etc from wastewater efficiently 8 carbonization is preferred than pyrolysis since it requires only moderate temperature while later needs higher temperature algal biomass helps in efficient recovery of nutrients from wastewater when converted into carbonized bio coal 20 carbonized bio char helps in with holding the water at higher rate and this makes them a better soli amendment 21 bio char possess the ability to withhold the pollutants adsorbed from the aqueous environment 22 recovery of nutrients from wastewater was the hot topic in current scenario as it was ease of operation for wastewater treatment 23 24 numerous elements such as phosphate sulphate nitrate heavy metals etc are recovered from wastewater through adsorption membrane filtration etc bio char microbes and other elements are used to recover these compounds from wastewater globally 25 the spent bio char was used as soil amendment as an alternative to chemical fertilizer and pesticide repellent 26 this helps in better plant growth as it is comparable to the commercial chemical fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium spent bio char when added as fertilizer it helps in better fixation in rhizospheres 27 water retention capacity of bio char depends upon the pore size pore volume and surface composition 28 table 1 provides the broad literature survey on nutrient recovery from various wastewater fertilizer is the material that is basically made of natural or from synthetic origin that was applied to soil for plant growth agriculture in last decades was depended on potassium k of 23 nitrogen n of 21 and phosphorus p of 21 as in npk fertilizers 29 npk usage has increased almost 800 during 1961 2019 30 government of india goi has passed a regulation on essential commodity act in 1957 to regulate the price and distribution of fertilizer all over the country 31 agricultural trade policy was initiated by goi to ensure self sufficiency in agricultural sector and consumers 32 microalgae scenedesmus sp was converted into bio char via htc in this study to remove phosphorus from wastewater to the best of our knowledge there were not much studies reported on reuse of spent bio char as fertilizer for plant cultivation therefore the novelty of this study was adsorb phosphorus from wastewater by bio char and the property of spent bio char as fertilizer on plant growth was evaluated before plant growth studies the spent bio char was activated with ammonia and phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms in this present study bio char was prepared via hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae biomass cultivated from wastewater the effect of parameters on phosphorus adsorption capacity of bio char from aqueous environment was investigated the surface properties and functional groups of the bio char was depicted by scanning electron microscopy sem and infrared spectroscopy ft ir the isotherm and kinetic models were validated and interpreted for all experimental data the fertilizer nature of spent bio char raw bio char and di ammonium phosphorus dap are studied with tomato plants in bamboo pots effect of spent bio char vs dap and raw bio char on plant height moisture and chlorophyll content are investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 bio char preparation the microalgae biomass for carbonization was cultivated following the procedure mentioned in the previous study 47 precisely the algae was cultivated in a hybrid loop airlift photo bioreactor hlalpbr using 5 l of domestic wastewater the biomass was cultivated at temperature of 30 2 c and light intensity of 4000 lx for a time of 16 days the harvested microalgae biomass was converted into bio char via htc the htc experiments were performed in a closed stainless steel reactor under ammoniacal nitrogen environment algae biomass of 20 g was converted into bio char in an airtight stainless steel reactor of 250 ml capacity under nitrogen environment the reactor was heated with 200 ml of water at a reaction temperature of 350 c at a pressure of 5 mpa for a residence time of 60 min the slurry was mixed with dichloromethane and the bio char was recovered using separating funnel 48 49 higher temperature leads to higher amount of ash formation hence medium temperature range was used electric furnace provided the heat energy required for carbonization of biomass after the experiments reactor was cooled rapidly using cold water the bio char solid carbonaceous product was washed using deionized water and dried in air at last the bio char was stored in sealed containers for further experiments 2 2 characterization of bio char the elemental analysis of the bio char was performed in accordance with the american society for testing and materials astm standard test methods using elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 japan to determine the percentage of carbon hydrogen ammoniacal nitrogen and sulphur content prior to astm analysis the recovered bio char was oven dried at 110 c to free from moisture content proximate analysis of the bio

jsm 6510 japan the infrared spectroscopy analysis of bio char was performed using perkin elmer ftirc 100566 japan instrument 2 3 phosphorus removal study 2 3 1 preparation of wastewater the phosphorus rich wastewater was prepared in lab conditions to study the effect of various parameters during adsorption process the formulated wastewater was prepared to meet the characteristics of distillery wastewater chemicals used for wastewater preparation are potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium acid phthalate sodium hydroxide and ammonium sulphate are purchased from srihari chemicals india few modifications in pollutants concentrations were made as compared to the parameters studied 46 the simulated wastewater had ph of 7 3 chemical oxygen demand cod of 5000 mg l phosphorus concentration of 150 mg l and ammoniacal nitrogen of 80 mg l respectively concentrations of each pollutants were measured using standard methods before and after adsorption experiments ammoniacal nitrogen was evaluated as per astm d1426 15 standard 51 phosphorus by ascorbic acid method 52 and cod by hach model number drb200 with cod solutions 53 2 3 2 batch adsorption studies the batch equilibrium

impact of parameters on adsorption process one parameter was varied while other parameters were kept constant all the experiments were performed in an incubator cum shaker for betterment of adsorption process the samples were collected after the experiments and filtered using whatman no 4 filter paper pore size 20 μm the adsorption capacity of filter paper was tested to depict whether it influence the adsorption process in all experimental conditions blank absence of testing substance and control without bio char and presence of known amount of testing substance i e cod of 5000 mg l phosphorus

fertilizer was studied through pot studies agricultural soil with ph of 7 1 carbon content of 7 5 wt phosphorus of 0 2 g kg was used as support for plant growth with bio char the soil and bio char were sieved to even size of 1 mm in order to eliminate the higher sized particles to evaluate the soil fertility nature control pot without bio char or dap was used as pot 1 0 5 g of bio char pot 2 0 5 g of di ammonium phosphorus dap pot 3 and 0 5 g of spent bio char pot 4 were added in three different pots and studied for the period of 30 days pots of width 8 cm and height 15 cm were used with 250 g of soil tomato plants were seeded and watered at regular intervals the pots were placed outdoor in sunlight for traditional photosynthesis and growth the plant height was noted periodically for all three conditions the chlorophyll content of plants grown on different soil conditions were evaluated by biochemical method 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass and bio char characterization the microalgae biomass was analyzed for its characteristics such as proximate and ultimate composition the biomass had 54 23 of carbon 9 8 of hydrogen 4 2 of ammoniacal nitrogen 2 7 of sulphur and 28 of oxygen bio char yield was 3 4 g 20 g of biomass from the htc process at a temperature of 350 c the biomass had 13 2 wt and 9 2 wt of moisture and ash content from our recent studies it was seen that the algae biomass had carbon 41 55 wt hydrogen 6 8 wt nitrogen 1 7 wt and oxygen 30 50 wt content respectively 21 47 48 the bio char resulted from the htc composed of 85 3 of carbon 4 9 of hydrogen and 8 5 of oxygen content similarly bio char produced from microalgae s obliquus resulted in carbon content of 71 42 wt 50 in another study carbonization of alaria resulted in carbon hydrogen sulphur and oxygen of 59 1 5 6 0 3 and 17 3 wt respectively 20 higher temperature of the htc conditions resulted in favor of higher degree of carbon formation due to evaporation of moisture and volatile compounds after the htc experiments the bio char was analyzed via sem spectroscopy to depict its surface properties as shown in fig 1 the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis revealed that bio char composed of small cracks and pores of size 10 μm and volume of 0 01 cm3 g the surface area of the bio char was 117 m2 g degradation of moisture impurities during htc process ended up in formation these void pores 55 56 and it was clear from sem images these pores present on the surface of the char helps in adsorption process by cross linking with pollutants present in the aquatic system aggregate formation was also seen from the images and it may reduce the pores when compared to activated carbon 57 aggregate formation was due to the physical and chemical reactions occurred during the htc process amount of aggregate formation depends upon the temperature pressure and quantity of finer particles in the bio char the finer particles tends to bind at pressurized conditions to initiate the aggregate formation the organic compounds in the biomass leads to decompose as glue and helps in binding of these finer particles into agglomerates the infrared analysis exposed the functional groups present on the surface of bio char the peaks seen at 2950 27 cm 1 2924 56 cm 1 and 2856 23 cm 1 corresponds to c h stretching due to carboxylic acids the intense band at 1450 80 cm 1 evident to presence of cc stretching the intense peaks at 1378 25 cm 1 1215 01 cm 1 1055 05 cm 1 corresponds to co extending vibrations similar functional groups were also reported for the bio char prepared from cassis fistula for adsorption process 58 based on the pore formation and major functional groups with adsorption properties on the surface makes them a vital condidate on adsorption process in current scenario 3 2 phosphorus removal study 3 2 1 effect of adsorption temperature the effect of temperature 10 60 c on phosphorus adsorption by bio char was studied the other parameters like concentration of bio char was 1 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm and time was 60 min the percentage removal of ammoniacal nitrogen cod and phosphorus from wastewater by bio char was plotted against temperature and shown in fig 2 the percentage removal of phosphorus was 90 ammonia was 73 and cod was 76 at temperature of 60 c from the results it was seen that the trend of pollutants removal is slowed at higher temperatures the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible of 0 08 0 05 and 0 1 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the blank was used for calibration of analysis since it does not had any testing substance and control samples showed 99 88 99 9 and 99 9 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample the loss of 0 12 0 1 and 0 1 is negligible as it may be lost due to handling errors the kinetic energy of the adsorbent increases with increase in temperature and thus the adsorbed pollutants undergo desorption it was reported that adsorption capacity increases because of the mobility of the adsorbate increases at higher temperature causing a reduction in retarding force acted on the diffusing ions 59 the chemical oxygen demand removal percentage increased gradually from 68 at 40 c to 76 at 60 c loess biomass removed 0 095 mg l of phosphorous at 60 c from the municipal wastewater 60 the ammonia adsorption capacity of bentonite chitosan beads was 2 25 mg g at temperature of 20 c 61 activated carbon derived from coconut shell resulted in 50 74 of cod removal respectively 62 3 2 2 effect of contact time the removal percentage of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod on bio char was investigated to depict the equilibrium contact time the effect of time 0 90 min on adsorption of pollutants in to bio char was shown in fig 3 the experimental conditions are agitation speed of 150 rpm bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c from the results it can inferred that increase in contact time beyond 60 min does not resulted in much removal percentage of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of time since it showed 0 03 0 08 and 0 09 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 91 99 86 and 99 93 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample adsorption is a balancing process and thus the adsorption of ions by the adsorbent attains equilibrium eventually and thus preventing further adsorption by the adsorbent at 60 min the removal of phosphorus ammoniacal nitrogen and cod was 90 73 and 69 respectively in our study the equilibrium time for phosphorus and ammonia removal was 60 min and it was 70 min for cod removal respectively zeolite attained equilibrium conditions at 15 min showed 90 of adsorption efficiency for phosphorus removal in a previous study 63 adsorption of ammonia by bentonite chitosan attained equilibrium at a reaction time of 30 min with removal percentage of 60 61 bagasse fly ash on cod removal attained equilibrium at time of 180 min with removal of 50 cod 64 contact time obtained from this lab scale study helps us to evaluate the time required to process enormous amount of wastewater generated from industry scale the study also helps to determine the time required for nutrient removal when concentration of nutrients vary from the wastewater irrespective of quantity 3 2 3 effect of bio char concentration bio char dosage was the major factor that determine the capacity of bio char on removal percentage of pollutants from aquatic system the effect of bio char dosage 0 3 1 5 g l on pollutant removal was evaluated and depicted in fig 4 the experimental conditions are agitation speed of 150 rpm time of 60 min and temperature of 60 c the maximum adsorption was 89 72 and 60 for 1 5 g l of bio char dosage the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of the concentration of the bio char added since it showed 0 05 0 1 and 0 02 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 86 99 97 and 99 92 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample increase in bio char dosage leads to increase in adsorption active sites and surface area this shows that the pollutants gets adsorbed at higher proportion onto the surface of the bio char increase in bio char concentration from 0 9 to 1 5 g l does not showed greater difference in phosphorus removal efficiency as the wastewater was enriched with organic compounds this contributes to the cod of the wastewater the cod of wastewater is reduced during adsorption process by the binding of these compounds to the pores of bio char the functional groups present on the surface of bio char determines the rate of cod removal the mechanism of cod removal depends upon the rate of adsorption of organic compounds in the wastewater by the bio char as ion exchange process 21 65 66 3 2 4 effect of agitation speed the agitation speed is one of the parameter which has impact on adsorption process mixing the solution enables the even distribution of solute in the solution the agitation experiments were performed with varying agitation rates of 50 250 rpm time of 60 min bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c from the results fig 5 it was clear that increase in agitation speed beyond 150 rpm does not increased the adsorption efficiency beyond 150 rpm negligible increments in removal percentage of all three pollutants were noted the adsorption capacity of filter paper was negligible irrespective of agitation speed since it showed 0 1 0 12 and 0 04 of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively the control samples showed 99 84 99 92 and 99 95 of cod ammonia and phosphorus in the sample higher agitation speed led to adverse effects like breakdown of bonded adsorbent and adsorbate by strong shear force 67 3 3 validation of isotherm models adsorption isotherms provides the best fit to engage pollutants in the active sites of bio char from the wastewater at equilibrium conditions langmuir freundlich and henry s models were fitted phosphorus 0 400 mg l and ammonia 0 200 mg l removal using matlab r2020a software in our study the correlation coefficient r2 values for phosphorus removal were almost same 0 999 0 988 and 0 99 for all three isotherm models it was also in similar trend for ammoniacal nitrogen 0 99 0 98 and 0 998 for all three isotherm models table 2 provides the detailed report on isotherm models of both phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption the parameters like coefficient values r2 error values rmse root mean square error and sse sum of squared error were obtained from the fit and elaborated in table 2 in literature it was reported that langmuir model fits and provide equal adsorption rate when the adsorbent has homogenous surface heterogeneous active sites lead to multilayer adsorption 68 the adsorption capacity of bio char was found to be 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g for phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen respectively the bio char showed a better adsorption of phosphorus from aqueous system and it was comparable with characterization performed in batch studies from the r2 values it was clear that the adsorption system follows multilayer adsorption since langmuir and freundlich does not showed much difference in correlation coefficient values higher correlation coefficient with low error value are the reason for phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen removal system as multilayer hence it can be concluded that the adsorption of phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen into bio char was favorable 3 4 adsorption kinetic models kinetic models were fitted to determine the effect of parameters on adsorption rate pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris models were fitted using matlab r2020a software for experimental data figs 6 and 7 shows the adsorption kinetic models fitted for the experimental data obtained from phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen removal study the rate constant with correlation coefficient r2 and constants were elaborated in table 3 from the results it was depicted that pseudo first order kinetic model fitted well among all three models the correlation coefficient values r2 are 0 97 0 96 and 0 93 for phosphorus and 0 96 0 96 and 0 92 for ammoniacal nitrogen removal data respectively it was reported in literature that when concentration of phosphorus was an important parameter then it follows pseudo first order kinetics 69 when time is considered as a parameter then it was depicted in literature as physical adsorption was favored in phosphate adsorption onto bio char for initial 4 h of the reaction time 70 beyond this as adsorption tendency slows down which leads to shift from physical to chemical due to attainment of balance of ions between bio char and aqueous system 71 based on this literature support and it was concluded that our results follows physi sorption since our study showed 60 min as optimal time followed first order kinetics and exhibited langmuir isotherm hence arrhenius theory was not studied as it was a temperature depended process 3 5 bio char as fertilizer elemental and ultimate analysis of spent bio char were performed the fertilizer study was performed with spent bio char obtained from the adsorption conditions such as time of 60 min mixing rate of 150 rpm bio char concentration of 1 g l and temperature of 60 c the spent bio char had moisture content of 36 8 wt and carbon content of 87 6 wt respectively after the adsorption experiments the bio char composed of various functional groups the bands found at 3027 91 cm 1 due to presence of oh groups attributed from the water molecules the peaks seen at 2957 94 cm 1 2925 75 cm 1 and 2873 18 cm 1 corresponds to c h stretching due to carboxylic acids the intense band at 1461 80 cm 1 1495 54 cm 1 and 1604 56 cm 1 was attributed by the presence of cc stretching the intense peaks at 1378 91 cm 1 1080 90 cm 1 and 1030 10 cm 1 corresponds to co extending vibrations few bands were also seen below 725 80 cm 1 due to the aromatic compounds 72 the spent bio char had reduced the cod phosphorus and ammonia from aqueous environment to avoid release of phosphorus and ammonia to atmosphere the spent bio char was activated with phosphorus and ammonia solubilizing bacteria bacterial culture rhizobium and bacillus megatarium of 1 ml was added to the spent bio char and kept undisturbed for 24 h at room temperature after the incubation period the spent bio char was studied to depict its fertilizer nature 3 5 1 effect of spent bio char on plant height the potential of spent bio char as fertilizer was compared with raw bio char and dap in three different pots tomato plant was seeded and cultivated in all three pots under sunlight with humid conditions height of the plants in all four pots were measured once they sprouted and started to grow from the results fig 8 it was inferred that the height of the plant grown in the spent bio char dap raw bio char and control pot was 22 cm 18 cm 14 cm and 10 cm at 30th day of the study the plant growth was higher in spent bio char since it contain relatively higher amount of ammoniacal nitrogen and phosphorus components the commercially available dap fertilizer exhibited only a fixed amount of nutrition furthermore the addition of phosphorus and nitrate solubilizing bacteria in spent bio char made these nutrients readily bio available compared to direct chemical fertilizers hence it can be concluded that adsorption of phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen by bio char by adsorption process will be economical and eco friendly since the bio char is a by product of the process of hydrothermal carbonization it possess minimal environmental hazard comparatively this eco friendly fertilizer can be of great potent as fertilizer to improve the plants productivity if studied more deeply 3 5 2 plant properties 3 5 2 1 moisture and weight of plant apart from the influence of spent bio char on plant growth the chlorophyll and moisture content of the plant was also measured the tomato plants cultivated in four pots such as only soil control and soil mixed with fresh bio char spent bio char and dap are compared to depict the fertilizer nature the spent bio char showed higher plant growth with higher chlorophyll content and moisture content since it composed of adsorbed ammonium and phosphorus the chlorophyll content was 10 4 13 5 24 5 and 19 6 mg g for control raw bio char spent bio char and dap respectively after the cultivation the wet and dry weight of plant was weighed to depict its moisture holding capacity table 4 provides the data for chlorophyll dry and wet weight of plants cultivated in all three pots the dry weight was 285 385 640 and 525 mg for plant cultivated in control raw bio char spent bio char and dap respectively the dry weight of the plant cultivated in spent bio char comparatively higher than the other two the additional amount of ammonium and phosphorus in the spent bio char helped the plant to grow better than other plants from this study it was inferred that bio char accumulates the pollutants from aqueous environment and it served as fertilizer for plant growth the sustainability statement of this study was that the algae biomass was cultivated from wastewater and this biomass was converted into bio char this bio char was used to recover valuable phosphorus from wastewater the spent bio char was used as fertilizer to enhance the plant growth as soil amendment in this way this study provides an sustainable way for wastewater treatment and recovery of valuable products for soil amendment the methods for analyzing the sustainability was via depicting the adsorption capacity of bio char and fertilizer nature of spent bio char 73 75 in future this study can be applied to recover valuable phosphorus from wastewater as phosphorus leads to algal bloom formation in water environment since it serves as a vital food supplement for algal growth in india huge quantity of fertilizer was used in agriculture sector for grain production annually phosphorus rich wastewater are resulted from leaching of chemicals from agricultural sector fertilizer manufacturing industries rock phosphate mining geographic locations etc spent bio char with phosphorus can be used as bio fertilizer as they are eco friendly and economical than chemical fertilizers due to high water retention behavior and bio degradability nature of bio char it can be used in gardens lawns center medians of highways etc in our future study we have planned to recover phosphate from real time wastewater obtained from rock phosphate mining sector using bio char derived from sewage sludge and agricultural residues 3 6 conclusions in this study microalgae biomass was carbonized to effectively adsorb phosphorus from aqueous environment the factors influencing phosphorus removal are studied and it showed bio char concentration of 1 5 g l agitation speed of 150 rpm temperature of 60 c at 60 min achieved maximum removal rate the phosphorus adsorption followed pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model the langmuir model showed phosphorus and ammonia adsorption capacity of bio char was 2505 and 6 7 e4 mg g this showed that bio char had excellent properties to remove phosphorus of 90 and ammoniacal nitrogen of 73 from aqueous environment at 60 min the spent bio char was activated with ammonium and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and its role as fertilizer was evaluated with commercially available dap the spent bio char resulted in plant height of 22 cm chlorophyll content of 24 5 mg g and dry weight of 640 mg respectively this sustainable and holistic approach provides dual advantage of phosphorus recovery from wastewater and treatment of wastewater in an eco friendly manner declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement authors thank ssn trust and sathyabama
