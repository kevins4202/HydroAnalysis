21395,the hydrodynamic coefficients in semi empirical tool are optimized for a riser attached with staggered buoyancy modules undergoing vortex induced vibration viv based on the shell oil experiment the existing prediction tools are based on data derived from experiments number of assumptions from strip theory energy balance between fluid and structure and use of lift coefficient databases current advancements in conducting and calculating viv response from the experiments shows that these assumptions may be invalid the major difference arises between experimental observations and theoretical estimations is from lift coefficient databases the databases extracted under laboratory conditions have limited reynolds number flow conditions and only cross flow motions were considered the extracted hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database is posed to optimization problem where the main objective is to minimize the prediction error of semi empirical tools when compared with experimental results we optimize the existing excitation coefficient database to improve the fatigue damage prediction of riser attached with staggered buoyancy modules application of modification factors and optimizing the hydrodynamic lift coefficients to the data from shell exploration and production test provides the new optimized excitation coefficient datasets which reduce the error in

technical challenges and the cost of riser systems increase rapidly to hinder these challenges steel lazy wave riser slwr is developed which is extension of steel catenary riser scr attached with buoyancy modules along the length of the riser section slwr operating in water column is exposed to currents the presence of the riser causes the flow separation and vortices are formed in the wake of the riser the vortex shedding would lead riser to vibrate collaterally and perpendicular to the ambient fluid flow which are called in line il and cross flow cf respectively such periodic vibrations are called vortex induced vibrations viv and these vibrations would lead to rapid accumulation of fatigue damage of the riser viv is considered as the main patron to the fatigue damage viv of long flexible structures with bluff cross sections are exposed to a great variety of physical problems from aeolian vibrations hanging in air to the vibrations of cables and risers exposed to ocean currents bourguet et al 2011 these issues are thoroughly studied by researchers from past three decades wang et al 2015 one of the most challenging issues is the accurate prediction of riser s fatigue damage risers in deep waters are installed with staggered buoyancy modules to provide additional lift force and consequently reducing the effective tension on the riser li et al 2011 meantime buoyancy modules are also widely used to maintain the lazy wave shape of the riser system jhingran et al 2012 however due to its larger diameter normally 2 5 5 times larger than bare riser diameter the vortices formation may largely change behind the structure and have different viv responses for the riser with buoyancy modules when compared to bare riser there exists excitation competition between bare and buoyancy modules to dominate the dynamic responses due to the difference in diameters length and coverage ratio of buoyancy modules to predict the winner of excitation competition between bare and buoyancy modules for a given coverage of buoyancy the power extracted from the flow is used as metric parameter three main excitation frequencies are found in the curvature spectrum i e il cf and nonlinear frequencies but the viv response contribution is minimal from nonlinear interaction frequency when compared with total response thus the excitation competition becomes the competition between bare and buoyancy frequencies rao et al 2015 lie et al 1998 and vandiver 2000 expressed the excitation competition as the ratio of viv power on the bare regions to the buoyancy regions as shown in eq 1 for more details can be referred to rao et al 2015 1 p r e d i c t o r p b a r e p b u o y a n c y d b a r e d b u o y a n c y l b a r e l b u o y a n c y if the amplitude is used as a metric parameter to determine the winner of excitation competition then the expression is as below vandiver 2000 2 p r e d i c t o r p b a r e p b u o y a n c y d b a r e d b u o y a n c y l b a r e l b u o y a n c y 2 in eqs 1 and 2 suggests that when the ratio is greater than one the excitation from bare part of the riser dominates and when the ratio is less than one the excitation from buoyancy modules on the riser dominate the responses rao et al 2015 since the hydrodynamics of the risers are not well studied so far the factor of safety fos greater than ten is normally considered in industry for riser design to avoid the failure however with the advancement of oil and gas into deep waters the integrity of risers cannot be guaranteed by simply increasing fos alone thence investigations of hydrodynamic properties of flexible riser with buoyancy segments subjected to viv becomes necessary several experimental tests have been carried out to the study the interaction between bare riser and buoyancy segments and nature of viv with buoyancy modules lie et al 1998 jhingran et al 2012 rao et al 2015 wu et al 2016a b fan 2017 yuan et al 2017 the study of these experiments shows that the interaction and dynamic responses can be influenced by different parameters such as arrangement of buoyancy modules aspect ratio and slenderness ratio viv of spring mounted rigid cylinders in fluctuating flow has studied by several researchers such as sarpkaya 1979 and sumer and fredsoe 1998 fu et al 2013 studied the flow around elastically mounted cylinder in oscillation flow and discovered the characteristic process of developing viv with vibrations ceaselessly working up and vanishing computational fluid dynamics cfd was used by constantinides et al 2008 and yamamoto et al 2004 to study the complex behaviour of fluid structure interaction of a riser problem such as viv and compared with existing model tests and concluded that the simulation time taken by this tests were very long evangelions et al 2000 used direct numerical simulation dns to simulate rigid and flexible cylinders and calculated the hydrodynamic forces acting on the risers however cfd required detailed meshes for fluid and structures which requires great efforts on computation yamamoto et al 2004 used a quasi 3d model to investigate the behaviour of the flexible risers and estimated the hydrodynamic forces by using the discrete vortex method chen et al 2006 states that to study a 6 m long riser requires several months to complete the computation hence cfd methods are still limited to analyse the hydrodynamic forces of risers zhang et al 2018 have investigated the effect of excitation coefficients and added mass coefficients along the flexible riser with staggered buoyancy modules and compared with the experimental results and concluded that there are differences between coefficients identified and existing database expectedly extensive research has been carried on viv over last fifteen years chaplin 2005 xu et al 2008 raghavan et al 2011 wu et al 2012 yuan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 this allowed to understand the physics behind the occurrence of viv and behaviour of these vibrations in uniform and sheared current profiles these understandings have resulted in development of viv prediction programs like shear7 vandiver and li 2019 viva triantafyllou et al 1999 and vivana passano et al 2014 to estimate the effects of viv on slender marine structures these tools typically consist of two parts 1 fluid structure interaction model 2 experimental derived empirical databases based on hydrodynamic forces the fluid structure interaction model consists of fluid force model and structural dynamics equations the hydrodynamic database primarily consists of hydrodynamic information in the form of drag coefficients and lift coefficients these hydrodynamic coefficients extracted from fixed and forced oscillation viv modelled tests gopalkrishnan 1993 where the cylinder is oscillated at a specified frequency while the fluid is towed at constant speed inverse analyses are used to extract the hydrodynamic force coefficients from experimental results wu et al 2010 lekkala et al 2016 and wu et al 2016a b have carried viv analysis of riser with staggered buoyancy modules to predict the mode number response frequency and fatigue damage using default hydrodynamic excitation coefficients from vivana they have concluded that the default coefficients from the available semi empirical tools was either underpredicted or over predicted the results when compared with the experimental results based on the buoyancy configurations the hydrodynamic force coefficients database is extracted from fixed and forced oscillation test results with rigid bare cylinder however these databases may not be substantial for an adaptable riser attached with staggered buoyancy elements along these lines the excitation coefficients pose an optimization problem and hence there is a need to optimize force coefficient database considering the impact of the vortex shedding interaction between bare riser and the buoyancy modules by proper tuning the hydrodynamic coefficient database significant improvement can be achieved in prediction of viv response by semi empirical tools wu et al 2007 hence there is a need to optimize the hydrodynamic coefficient database in semi empirical tools despite the large number of experimental data a systematic approach is required to investigate the variation of hydrodynamic coefficients for different buoyancy configurations and the flow patterns are missing park et al 2016 developed a systematic design for strake configurations based on length and location on scr using modal approach in this study they have considered dominant mode for viv suppression through modal analysis to find the suitable location of strakes and concluded that the required length of strakes on riser is much shorter than the conventional method an innovative method to estimate the fatigue damage of riser was proposed by kim et al 2018 based on fatigue damage versus current index f c diagram which was inspired by the concept of residual strength versus damage index r d diagram proposed paik et al 2012 and validated by several studies kim et al 2013a 2013b 2014 2020 the proposed current index concept showed good agreement with the existing method wong and kim 2018 developed an alternative approach for existing methods by using artificial neural network ann model to predict the short term fatigue damage of the riser due to viv a parametric study was carried for a riser subjected to viv by kim et al 2019 and concluded that as the current flow speed outer diameter increases the fatigue damage increased but decreased with increase in top tension and shear rate wu et al 2020 developed an optimization technique to optimize the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database for vivana with this technique the prediction error was reduced by tuning the default database the source of data is from the shell exploration and production company model test conducted at marintek ocean basin refer jhingran et al 2012 the ocean basin is 80 0 m long 50 0 m wide and 10 0 m deep this test was conducted for 45 runs with combinations of varying the towing velocities and configurations of staggered buoyancy modules on riser for every buoyancy configuration comprised of 9 runs at various flow speeds for every test only uniform speed with minimum and maximum flow speed between 0 5 m s 1 2 m s respectively this test arrangement was described in jhingran et al 2012 and rao et al 2015 moreover the proposed numerical technique is validated against laboratory experiments under uniform flows this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the riser dynamic and basic theory in calculation of hydrodynamic forces and coefficients section 3 describes the proposed technique and analysis methodology section 4 presents the modified technique results and comparison with the experimental results for five different configurations the sensitivity studies are carried out to present the interesting responses of buoyancy modules on the riser in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 it is worth mentioning that the contributions of the present study is not developing the original approach but optimizing the hydrodynamic coefficient database in the existing viv semi empirical model predictions software shear7 and revealing the features of viv under uniform flow conditions for a riser with buoyancy modules this modification technique was adopted from wu et al 2020 to optimize the hydrodynamic excitation coefficients in shear7 response frequency and fatigue damage are predicted by semi empirical viv methods with uniform flow speed and are evaluated by comparing with the measured responses from experiment the fatigue damage is considered to be the most important design aspect for deepwater risers since the fatigue damage is governed by response frequency and curvature in this study we have considered response frequency and fatigue damage to optimize and update the available hydrodynamic coefficient database in the semi empirical tools 2 riser dynamics basic theory the submerged flexible pipe with a tension t is subjected to uniform current flow the central axis of the pipe is parallel to x axis and direction of the flow is parallel to y axis and perpendicular to pipe as shown in fig 1 based on the finite element method the governing equation of the pipe is expressed as 3 m u c u k u f where m c and k are global mass matrix structural damping matrix and structural stiffness matrix of the pipe song et al 2016a u u u are the displacement velocity and acceleration matrices respectively f is the cf hydrodynamic force matrix the force displacement velocity and acceleration vectors for one node can be expressed as 4 f i n x i n y i n z i t u i x i y i θ i t u i x i y i θ i t u i x i y i θ i t where x i and y i represents the displacements in il and cf directions respectively the model superposition method is used to obtain the viv displacements from the corresponding bending strains and cubic spline difference method is used to calculate the first and second order derivatives of u with respective to time to obtain displacement velocity and acceleration vectors 2 1 hydrodynamic coefficients assumes that cf direction vibrations have n different frequencies with periodic vibrations then viv displacement at node can be expressed as 5 y x t i 1 n y 0 i x sin ω i t θ i where ω i is the ith frequency of the vibration in the cf direction y 0 i and θ i are the displacement amplitude and phase angle at frequency ω i the hydrodynamic force induced by vortex induced vibrations at a node i f c f x t can be written as 6 f c f x t i 1 n f 0 i x sin ω i t θ i ϕ i by expanding eq 6 7 f c f x t i 1 n f 0 i x cos ω i t θ i sin ϕ i f 0 i x sin ω i t θ i cos ϕ i by differentiating eq 5 the viv velocity y x t and acceleration y x t can be written as 8 y x t i 1 n y 0 i x ω i cos ω i t θ i 9 y x t i 1 n y 0 i x ω i 2 sin ω i t θ i where f 0 i is the amplitude at frequency ω i and ϕ i is the phase angle between displacement and hydrodynamic force at frequency ω i from eq 7 the term i 1 n f 0 i x cos ω i t θ i sin ϕ i and i 1 n f 0 i x sin ω i t θ i cos ϕ i are the hydrodynamic forces in phase with velocity y x t and viv acceleration y x t respectively thus the two expressions can be defined as below 10

pointed two terms in eq 6 are excitation force and added mass force in phase with velocity and acceleration respectively under a single frequency under a single frequency the vortex induced forces of

study is presented 3 1 modification of excitation coefficient database the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database in empirical programs is often represented by a set of empirical parameters these parameters are systematically scaled with respect to non dimensional frequency to create a large matrix of different excitation coefficient database in the present study the default hydrodynamic force coefficient database from shear7 is parameterized as shown in table 1 and these datasets are systematically varied in shear7 until the predicted response frequency and fatigue damage concur well with the shell test results the proposed method of optimizing hydrodynamic coefficients originates from passano et al 2014 this paper improves the prediction of viv hydrodynamic coefficient database in shear7 by modifying the available default lift and excitation coefficients these hydrodynamic excitation coefficients are presented in the form of excitation coefficient curves and are expressed as a function of non dimensional response amplitude a c l and reduced velocity which can be determined as smooth curve by fitting two parabolas through three points yun et al 2011 these curves in shear7 are assigned to each point along the riser to calculate the responses since the default cl curves in shear7 are presented for viv analysis of bare riser and riser with helical strakes vandiver and li 2019 these curves may not predict the correct responses for riser with staggered buoyancy elements it also presents a non conservative experimental data fit where lift coefficient curve varies based on frequency ratio and a c l as shown in fig 2 hence there is a need to optimize these hydrodynamic excitation coefficient curves which can be used for riser with staggered buoyancy modules based on the test results the optimization is performed by varying the modification factors of a c l and c l at regular intervals until the analysis shows the best possible agreement with the experiments in terms of specified responses the excitation coefficient database in empirical programs are often represented by a set of empirical parameters these parameters are systematically scaled with respect to non dimensional frequency to create a large matrix of different excitation coefficient database in the present study the curve in fig 3 is explained as following point a presents the excitation coefficient c l when a c l is zero i e c l 0 point b defines the maximum non dimensional response amplitude a c l max to the corresponding maximum excitation coefficient c l max point c defines the a c l value when c l is zero the default excitation coefficient database in shear7 contains curves for 26 different non dimensional frequencies as shown in fig 2 these 26 curves are simplified to 3 representative non dimensional frequencies blue lines as shown fig 4 it corresponds to the excitation curve corresponding to the peak excitation coefficient as shown in table 1 this curve is represented by 4 excitation parameters this curve is systematically changed by using two modification factors representing each for a c l and c l the lower and upper boundaries of non dimensional frequency remain same as the default dataset of excitation parameters and they remain constant throughout the analysis the values between these lower and upper boundary points will be linearly interpolated as shown in fig 4 3 2 variation of non dimensional frequency in shear7 the corresponding non dimensional frequency n d f r e q for the peak values of a c l and c l is 1 0 in the present examination non dimensional frequency value is varied between 0 73 and 1 74 with an interim of 0 05 for different a c l and c l modification factors stated below 3 3 modification of excitation coefficients step 1 variation of non dimensional response amplitude the modification factor for non dimensional amplitude is defined as 13 γ a c l a c l max a c l max d e f where a c l max is the maximum non dimensional response amplitude a c l max d e f is the default maximum non dimensional response amplitude from shear7 in shear7 the default peak value of a c l at a non dimensional frequency 1 0 is 0 90 to modify the a c l the modification factor is varied between 0 4 and 1 5 for e g by considering 0 8 as modification factor then 14 a c l max a c l max d e f γ a c l 0 9 0 8 0 72 the blue curve in fig 5 presents the modified non dimensional response amplitude values of the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient curve after multiplying with non dimensional response amplitude modification factor less than 1 then a c l becomes smaller than the original values yellow line as it shifts towards left from points b and c but the values of c l remains the same at points a and b as shown in fig 5 step 2 variation of excitation coefficient the modification factor for excitation coefficient is defined as 15 γ c l c l max c l max d e f where c l max d e f is the default excitation coefficient data point c l max is the modified excitation coefficient data point γ c l is the excitation coefficient modification factor in shear7 the default peak value of c l max at a non dimensional frequency 1 0 is 0 80 to modify the c l max the modification factor is ranged between 0 4 and 2 0 for e g consider 0 7 as modification factor then 16 c l max c l max d e f γ c l 0 8 0 7 0 56 the procedure to optimize the existing hydrodynamic excitation coefficients is summarized in fig 6 the riser buoyancy material properties and environmental loadings are collected from the shell experiment to design a model in orcaflex orcina 2018 shear7 is integrated with orcaflex for viv analysis of the riser initially default excitation coefficients in shear7 are used to carry out the analysis and the responses are compared with the available experimental results to reduce the error between semi empirical analysis and experimental results the hydrodynamic coefficients in shear7 are modified with specified intervals as stated in the above sections for the selection of best optimal set of parameters the predicted responses from the numerical analysis results in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage rate are compared with experimental results until they match with specified criteria as shown in fig 6 based on fig 2 the lower and upper boundaries of non dimensional frequency for new datasets will remain same as the default database but the peak value of the curve will be changing for every data set generated by considering the range of modification factors for non dimensional response amplitude and excitation coefficients 11520 new data sets were generated for all configurations examples of new data sets are shown in table a 2 these new data sets were used as input parameters for numerical analysis in shear7 the datasets which minimizes the error between the experimental results and prediction results is chosen as the optimal set of parameters the procedure to obtain the optimized datasets is explained in fig 7 4 analysis of riser with staggered buoyancy modules with new datasets of hydrodynamic excitation coefficients this section presents the numerical simulations of riser with staggered buoyancy elements for default dataset and newly generated hydrodynamic coefficient datasets based on modification process the total length of bare riser was 38 m with a continuous diameter of 30 mm made of fiberglass tubing the outside diameter of buoyancy module was 80 mm with a length of 0 4086 made of two flexible urethanes half shells which snapped together around the bare riser and secured with locking clips for more information refer rao et al 2015 the material properties of the test pipe and the buoyancy element are summarized in table 2 different buoyancy configurations could be modelled by clamping buoyancy elements on bare riser by leaving gaps at regular intervals as shown in fig 8 for staggered buoyancy elements over the bare riser the length of each buoyancy module is represented as l b and the length of the bare riser section between two adjacent buoyancy sections is represented as l c fig 8 represents the schematic of a flexible riser with buoyancy elements l b and l c are taken as multiples of length of each buoyancy module for e g l c 2 is defined as the gap between two neighbouring buoyancy sections as shown in fig 9 is equal to the length of two buoyancy elements 2 0 4086 m to study the effect of buoyancy elements on viv five different buoyancy configurations namely l c l b 1 1 l c l b 2 2 l c l b 3 1 l c l b 3 2 l c l b 5 2 were tested as shown in fig 8 numerical simulations material properties of riser and buoyancy modules are shown in table 2 current is perpendicular to riser model sn curve d type

default parameters the riser model in orcaflex was modelled based on the riser properties as presented in table 2 the default excitation coefficients parameters from shear7 as shown in table a 1 is used for analysis the predicted response frequencies and fatigue damage for five different configurations with flow speed ranging from 0 5 m s to 1 2 m s are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively 4 2 prediction with new generated set of parameters 4 2 1 procedure to obtain an optimal set of parameters to obtain an optimal set of hydrodynamic coefficients different datasets of excitation coefficient parameters are generated based on methodology as mentioned in earlier section and these datasets are used to run the simulations the simulation results are compared with the shell test results in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage rate the best approximation which satisfies the specified criteria as shown in table 3 is selected as the optimal set of parameters the predicted frequency and the maximum fatigue damage values need to be within 10 and 15 of the measured responses test results 4 2 2 analysis results this section presents the numerical results for five different configurations for flow speeds between 0 5 m s 1 2 m s also presents the comparison of results between measured test results prediction responses based on default coefficients and optimized coefficients in terms of response frequency and maximum accumulated fatigue damage rate the design of buoyancy modules of slwr is dependent on fatigue damage considerations since the fatigue damage is governed by response frequency and curvature the authors have studied on frequency analysis in this paper by interpolating the results from the numerical simulations based on the specified criteria as specified in table 3 and comparing the responses with the test results for five configurations reported by rao et al 2015 the below sections presents the comparison of responses for test results default excitation parameters results and best approximations for five configurations for various flow speeds the optimal set of parameters for every configuration at each flow speed is presented in table a 3 4 2 2 1 response frequency in this section the response frequencies from the 11520 sets of generated parameters are analysed and the only datasets which presented good approximation with the test results are presented for five configurations for each flow speed the obtained outcome from semi empirical tool is analysed and the sets which showed good approximation in terms of response frequency is shown in fig 12 a e in each graph three different outcomes have been compared which are 1 fem optimized optimal set of parameters obtained from newly generated datasets 2 fem default simulations with default set of excitation parameter 3 test results at each flow speed between 0 5 m s to 1 25 m s from the obtained results optimized parameters it was observed that the methodology in the present study produces reasonable accuracy with the test outcomes fig 12 a e shows the comparison of response frequencies between test results and predicted response by semi empirical for default parameters and optimized coefficients the predicted response frequency for 1 1 configuration with default coefficients was 31 95 under predicted whereas the optimized coefficients reduced the error by 25 51 when compared with test results as shown in fig 12 a with optimized excitation coefficients as presented in table a 3 the response frequency for 2 2 configuration was over predicted by 1 77 whereas with default parameters it was under predicted by 33 17 compared with test results as shown in fig 12 b from fig 12 c it shows that for 3 1 configuration the response frequency was 16 8 under predicted whereas with default parameters it was 40 25 under predicted for 3 2 and 5 2 configurations the response frequency was 36 98 and 38 5 under predicted respectively whereas this methodology of optimizing coefficients reduced the error by 31 5 and 23 01 as shown in fig 12 d and e respectively 4 2 2 2 fatigue damage this section presents the comparison of maximum fatigue damage for every configuration at each flow speed here only the cases which minimized the error between test results and prediction responses is presented the semi empirical prediction of maximum accumulated fatigue damage for 1 1 configuration was over predicted by 4 12 whereas 42 8 under predicted with default parameters as shown in fig 13 a the fatigue damage for 2 2 configuration was under predicted by 32 59 with default parameters whereas over predicted by 4 4 with optimized coefficients fig 13 b fig 13 c shows the prediction with default parameters for 3 1 configuration which was 8 77 unpredicted whereas 2 37 over predicted with optimized coefficients for 3 2 and 5 2 the fatigue damage was under predicted by 49 38 and 47 81 respectively with default coefficients but with optimization process the prediction error was reduced to 6 95 and 8 6 respectively as shown in fig 13 d e 4 2 2 3 comparison the three results namely test fem default and fem optimized results are presented with their mean and covs values the accuracy of the fem prediction from the optimized excitation coefficients can be verified with other outcomes as shown in table a 4 for comparison the individual outcomes in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage for every test case at each flow speed are presented in fig 14 a to e and fig 15 a to e respectively the horizontal axis represents the measured results as a reference point while the vertical axis presents the predicted results from default and optimized excitation coefficients table a 4 summarises the predicted results comparison between fem default and fem optimized excitation coefficients in terms of mean and covs from the obtained outcome it is evident that the used method to optimize the predicted responses are in good agreement with test results the mean and cov graphs shows that the proposed method produces identical results with the test results 5 behaviour of riser by sensitivity analysis in this section the effect of hydrodynamic drag coefficient and current flow speeds are studied in detail to predict the influence on fatigue damage of the riser riser with 2 2 configuration of buoyancy modules at 1 0 m s is considered as the base case for parametric analysis 5 1 effect of drag coefficient a sensitivity analysis was carried to assess the fatigue damage rate of the slwr for different hydrodynamic drag coefficients the analysis for base case was carried out using cd 1 2 table 4 shows the comparisons made with cd values of 0 6 1 5 over the entire length of riser with staggered buoyancy elements the fatigue damage of riser decreased when the drag coefficient is increased as shown in fig 16 a the increased drag on the riser is presented by higher drag coefficients due to presence of bigger diameters of buoyancy modules it can be noted that when the diameter of buoyancy elements is increased it could decrease the fatigue damage of riser this clearly defines that the selection of drag coefficient is crucial issue for riser analysis it is clear that as the drag coefficient increases the overall trend of fatigue damage of the riser decreases the fatigue damage rate between 0 6 and 0 8 drag coefficients reduces drastically and then follows gradually decrease 5 2 sensitivity to current flow speed fig 16 b shows the sensitivity of the predicted fatigue damage to the current velocity used in the analysis current velocity has a significant influence on fatigue damage as flow speed increases the maximum fatigue damage gradually increases due to higher mode being excited leading to high modal curvature as the flow speed increases the overall trend of fatigue damage rate also increases as presented in table 5 6 conclusion in the present study we have used a method to update the existing excitation coefficient database using experimental data for riser with staggered buoyancy elements the original hydrodynamic excitation coefficients were extracted from previously conducted fixed and forced oscillation tests on bare riser were used as backbone for semi empirical tools but these databases may not be valid for risers attached with staggered buoyancy elements an optimization process was selected to optimize the coefficients to reduce the error between experimental results and theoretical predictions an optimization process allowed the database to reduce the prediction error by using the optimal set of parameters significant improvement can be seen in predicting the response when compared with the default hydrodynamic excitation coefficient parameters further additional studies could be carried to present a single set of parameters for every test case for different current flow speeds additional configurations may also be generated based on aspect ratio of buoyancy modules and tested for significant improvement in theoretical approaches to predict the viv fatigue damage in addition to this more case studies are recommended to conduct on different parameters to figure out the sensitivity of each parameter on the performance of the riser credit author contribution statement m r lekkala conceptualization funding acquisition writing

21395,the hydrodynamic coefficients in semi empirical tool are optimized for a riser attached with staggered buoyancy modules undergoing vortex induced vibration viv based on the shell oil experiment the existing prediction tools are based on data derived from experiments number of assumptions from strip theory energy balance between fluid and structure and use of lift coefficient databases current advancements in conducting and calculating viv response from the experiments shows that these assumptions may be invalid the major difference arises between experimental observations and theoretical estimations is from lift coefficient databases the databases extracted under laboratory conditions have limited reynolds number flow conditions and only cross flow motions were considered the extracted hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database is posed to optimization problem where the main objective is to minimize the prediction error of semi empirical tools when compared with experimental results we optimize the existing excitation coefficient database to improve the fatigue damage prediction of riser attached with staggered buoyancy modules application of modification factors and optimizing the hydrodynamic lift coefficients to the data from shell exploration and production test provides the new optimized excitation coefficient datasets which reduce the error in

technical challenges and the cost of riser systems increase rapidly to hinder these challenges steel lazy wave riser slwr is developed which is extension of steel catenary riser scr attached with buoyancy modules along the length of the riser section slwr operating in water column is exposed to currents the presence of the riser causes the flow separation and vortices are formed in the wake of the riser the vortex shedding would lead riser to vibrate collaterally and perpendicular to the ambient fluid flow which are called in line il and cross flow cf respectively such periodic vibrations are called vortex induced vibrations viv and these vibrations would lead to rapid accumulation of fatigue damage of the riser viv is considered as the main patron to the fatigue damage viv of long flexible structures with bluff cross sections are exposed to a great variety of physical problems from aeolian vibrations hanging in air to the vibrations of cables and risers exposed to ocean currents bourguet et al 2011 these issues are thoroughly studied by researchers from past three decades wang et al 2015 one of the most challenging issues is the accurate prediction of riser s fatigue damage risers in deep waters are installed with staggered buoyancy modules to provide additional lift force and consequently reducing the effective tension on the riser li et al 2011 meantime buoyancy modules are also widely used to maintain the lazy wave shape of the riser system jhingran et al 2012 however due to its larger diameter normally 2 5 5 times larger than bare riser diameter the vortices formation may largely change behind the structure and have different viv responses for the riser with buoyancy modules when compared to bare riser there exists excitation competition between bare and buoyancy modules to dominate the dynamic responses due to the difference in diameters length and coverage ratio of buoyancy modules to predict the winner of excitation competition between bare and buoyancy modules for a given coverage of buoyancy the power extracted from the flow is used as metric parameter three main excitation frequencies are found in the curvature spectrum i e il cf and nonlinear frequencies but the viv response contribution is minimal from nonlinear interaction frequency when compared with total response thus the excitation competition becomes the competition between bare and buoyancy frequencies rao et al 2015 lie et al 1998 and vandiver 2000 expressed the excitation competition as the ratio of viv power on the bare regions to the buoyancy regions as shown in eq 1 for more details can be referred to rao et al 2015 1 p r e d i c t o r p b a r e p b u o y a n c y d b a r e d b u o y a n c y l b a r e l b u o y a n c y if the amplitude is used as a metric parameter to determine the winner of excitation competition then the expression is as below vandiver 2000 2 p r e d i c t o r p b a r e p b u o y a n c y d b a r e d b u o y a n c y l b a r e l b u o y a n c y 2 in eqs 1 and 2 suggests that when the ratio is greater than one the excitation from bare part of the riser dominates and when the ratio is less than one the excitation from buoyancy modules on the riser dominate the responses rao et al 2015 since the hydrodynamics of the risers are not well studied so far the factor of safety fos greater than ten is normally considered in industry for riser design to avoid the failure however with the advancement of oil and gas into deep waters the integrity of risers cannot be guaranteed by simply increasing fos alone thence investigations of hydrodynamic properties of flexible riser with buoyancy segments subjected to viv becomes necessary several experimental tests have been carried out to the study the interaction between bare riser and buoyancy segments and nature of viv with buoyancy modules lie et al 1998 jhingran et al 2012 rao et al 2015 wu et al 2016a b fan 2017 yuan et al 2017 the study of these experiments shows that the interaction and dynamic responses can be influenced by different parameters such as arrangement of buoyancy modules aspect ratio and slenderness ratio viv of spring mounted rigid cylinders in fluctuating flow has studied by several researchers such as sarpkaya 1979 and sumer and fredsoe 1998 fu et al 2013 studied the flow around elastically mounted cylinder in oscillation flow and discovered the characteristic process of developing viv with vibrations ceaselessly working up and vanishing computational fluid dynamics cfd was used by constantinides et al 2008 and yamamoto et al 2004 to study the complex behaviour of fluid structure interaction of a riser problem such as viv and compared with existing model tests and concluded that the simulation time taken by this tests were very long evangelions et al 2000 used direct numerical simulation dns to simulate rigid and flexible cylinders and calculated the hydrodynamic forces acting on the risers however cfd required detailed meshes for fluid and structures which requires great efforts on computation yamamoto et al 2004 used a quasi 3d model to investigate the behaviour of the flexible risers and estimated the hydrodynamic forces by using the discrete vortex method chen et al 2006 states that to study a 6 m long riser requires several months to complete the computation hence cfd methods are still limited to analyse the hydrodynamic forces of risers zhang et al 2018 have investigated the effect of excitation coefficients and added mass coefficients along the flexible riser with staggered buoyancy modules and compared with the experimental results and concluded that there are differences between coefficients identified and existing database expectedly extensive research has been carried on viv over last fifteen years chaplin 2005 xu et al 2008 raghavan et al 2011 wu et al 2012 yuan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 this allowed to understand the physics behind the occurrence of viv and behaviour of these vibrations in uniform and sheared current profiles these understandings have resulted in development of viv prediction programs like shear7 vandiver and li 2019 viva triantafyllou et al 1999 and vivana passano et al 2014 to estimate the effects of viv on slender marine structures these tools typically consist of two parts 1 fluid structure interaction model 2 experimental derived empirical databases based on hydrodynamic forces the fluid structure interaction model consists of fluid force model and structural dynamics equations the hydrodynamic database primarily consists of hydrodynamic information in the form of drag coefficients and lift coefficients these hydrodynamic coefficients extracted from fixed and forced oscillation viv modelled tests gopalkrishnan 1993 where the cylinder is oscillated at a specified frequency while the fluid is towed at constant speed inverse analyses are used to extract the hydrodynamic force coefficients from experimental results wu et al 2010 lekkala et al 2016 and wu et al 2016a b have carried viv analysis of riser with staggered buoyancy modules to predict the mode number response frequency and fatigue damage using default hydrodynamic excitation coefficients from vivana they have concluded that the default coefficients from the available semi empirical tools was either underpredicted or over predicted the results when compared with the experimental results based on the buoyancy configurations the hydrodynamic force coefficients database is extracted from fixed and forced oscillation test results with rigid bare cylinder however these databases may not be substantial for an adaptable riser attached with staggered buoyancy elements along these lines the excitation coefficients pose an optimization problem and hence there is a need to optimize force coefficient database considering the impact of the vortex shedding interaction between bare riser and the buoyancy modules by proper tuning the hydrodynamic coefficient database significant improvement can be achieved in prediction of viv response by semi empirical tools wu et al 2007 hence there is a need to optimize the hydrodynamic coefficient database in semi empirical tools despite the large number of experimental data a systematic approach is required to investigate the variation of hydrodynamic coefficients for different buoyancy configurations and the flow patterns are missing park et al 2016 developed a systematic design for strake configurations based on length and location on scr using modal approach in this study they have considered dominant mode for viv suppression through modal analysis to find the suitable location of strakes and concluded that the required length of strakes on riser is much shorter than the conventional method an innovative method to estimate the fatigue damage of riser was proposed by kim et al 2018 based on fatigue damage versus current index f c diagram which was inspired by the concept of residual strength versus damage index r d diagram proposed paik et al 2012 and validated by several studies kim et al 2013a 2013b 2014 2020 the proposed current index concept showed good agreement with the existing method wong and kim 2018 developed an alternative approach for existing methods by using artificial neural network ann model to predict the short term fatigue damage of the riser due to viv a parametric study was carried for a riser subjected to viv by kim et al 2019 and concluded that as the current flow speed outer diameter increases the fatigue damage increased but decreased with increase in top tension and shear rate wu et al 2020 developed an optimization technique to optimize the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database for vivana with this technique the prediction error was reduced by tuning the default database the source of data is from the shell exploration and production company model test conducted at marintek ocean basin refer jhingran et al 2012 the ocean basin is 80 0 m long 50 0 m wide and 10 0 m deep this test was conducted for 45 runs with combinations of varying the towing velocities and configurations of staggered buoyancy modules on riser for every buoyancy configuration comprised of 9 runs at various flow speeds for every test only uniform speed with minimum and maximum flow speed between 0 5 m s 1 2 m s respectively this test arrangement was described in jhingran et al 2012 and rao et al 2015 moreover the proposed numerical technique is validated against laboratory experiments under uniform flows this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the riser dynamic and basic theory in calculation of hydrodynamic forces and coefficients section 3 describes the proposed technique and analysis methodology section 4 presents the modified technique results and comparison with the experimental results for five different configurations the sensitivity studies are carried out to present the interesting responses of buoyancy modules on the riser in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 it is worth mentioning that the contributions of the present study is not developing the original approach but optimizing the hydrodynamic coefficient database in the existing viv semi empirical model predictions software shear7 and revealing the features of viv under uniform flow conditions for a riser with buoyancy modules this modification technique was adopted from wu et al 2020 to optimize the hydrodynamic excitation coefficients in shear7 response frequency and fatigue damage are predicted by semi empirical viv methods with uniform flow speed and are evaluated by comparing with the measured responses from experiment the fatigue damage is considered to be the most important design aspect for deepwater risers since the fatigue damage is governed by response frequency and curvature in this study we have considered response frequency and fatigue damage to optimize and update the available hydrodynamic coefficient database in the semi empirical tools 2 riser dynamics basic theory the submerged flexible pipe with a tension t is subjected to uniform current flow the central axis of the pipe is parallel to x axis and direction of the flow is parallel to y axis and perpendicular to pipe as shown in fig 1 based on the finite element method the governing equation of the pipe is expressed as 3 m u c u k u f where m c and k are global mass matrix structural damping matrix and structural stiffness matrix of the pipe song et al 2016a u u u are the displacement velocity and acceleration matrices respectively f is the cf hydrodynamic force matrix the force displacement velocity and acceleration vectors for one node can be expressed as 4 f i n x i n y i n z i t u i x i y i θ i t u i x i y i θ i t u i x i y i θ i t where x i and y i represents the displacements in il and cf directions respectively the model superposition method is used to obtain the viv displacements from the corresponding bending strains and cubic spline difference method is used to calculate the first and second order derivatives of u with respective to time to obtain displacement velocity and acceleration vectors 2 1 hydrodynamic coefficients assumes that cf direction vibrations have n different frequencies with periodic vibrations then viv displacement at node can be expressed as 5 y x t i 1 n y 0 i x sin ω i t θ i where ω i is the ith frequency of the vibration in the cf direction y 0 i and θ i are the displacement amplitude and phase angle at frequency ω i the hydrodynamic force induced by vortex induced vibrations at a node i f c f x t can be written as 6 f c f x t i 1 n f 0 i x sin ω i t θ i ϕ i by expanding eq 6 7 f c f x t i 1 n f 0 i

i x ω i 2 sin ω i t θ i where f 0 i is the amplitude at frequency ω i and ϕ i is the phase angle between displacement and hydrodynamic force at frequency ω i from eq 7 the term i 1 n f 0 i x cos ω i t θ i sin ϕ i and i 1 n f 0 i x sin ω i t θ i cos ϕ i are the hydrodynamic forces in phase with velocity y x t and viv acceleration y x t respectively thus the two expressions can be defined as below 10

study is presented 3 1 modification of excitation coefficient database the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient database in empirical programs is often represented by a set of empirical parameters these parameters are systematically scaled with respect to non dimensional frequency to create a large matrix of different excitation coefficient database in the present study the default hydrodynamic force coefficient database from shear7 is parameterized as shown in table 1 and these datasets are systematically varied in shear7 until the predicted response frequency and fatigue damage concur well with the shell test results the proposed method of optimizing hydrodynamic coefficients originates from passano et al 2014 this paper improves the prediction of viv hydrodynamic coefficient database in shear7 by modifying the available default lift and excitation coefficients these hydrodynamic excitation coefficients are presented in the form of excitation coefficient curves and are expressed as a function of non dimensional response amplitude a c l and reduced velocity which can be determined as smooth curve by fitting two parabolas through three points yun et al 2011 these curves in shear7 are assigned to each point along the riser to calculate the responses since the default cl curves in shear7 are presented for viv analysis of bare riser and riser with helical strakes vandiver and li 2019 these curves may not predict the correct responses for riser with staggered buoyancy elements it also presents a non conservative experimental data fit where lift coefficient curve varies based on frequency ratio and a c l as shown in fig 2 hence there is a need to optimize these hydrodynamic excitation coefficient curves which can be used for riser with staggered buoyancy modules based on the test results the optimization is performed by varying the modification factors of a c l and c l at regular intervals until the analysis shows the best possible agreement with the experiments in terms of specified responses the excitation coefficient database in empirical programs are often represented by a set of empirical parameters these parameters are systematically scaled with respect to non dimensional frequency to create a large matrix of different excitation coefficient database in the present study the curve in fig 3 is explained as following point a presents the excitation coefficient c l when a c l is zero i e c l 0 point b defines the maximum non dimensional response amplitude a c l max to the corresponding maximum excitation coefficient c l max point c defines the a c l value when c l is zero the default excitation coefficient database in shear7 contains curves for 26 different non dimensional frequencies as shown in fig 2 these 26 curves are simplified to 3 representative non dimensional frequencies blue lines as shown fig 4 it corresponds to the excitation curve corresponding to the peak excitation coefficient as shown in table 1 this curve is represented by 4 excitation parameters this curve is systematically changed by using two modification factors representing each for a c l and c l the lower and upper boundaries of non dimensional frequency remain same as the default dataset of excitation parameters and they remain constant throughout the analysis the values between these lower and upper boundary points will be linearly interpolated as shown in fig 4 3 2 variation of non dimensional frequency in shear7 the corresponding non dimensional frequency n d f r e q for the peak values of a c l and c l is 1 0 in the present examination non dimensional frequency value is varied between 0 73 and 1 74 with an interim of 0 05 for different a c l and c l modification factors stated below 3 3 modification of excitation coefficients step 1 variation of non dimensional response amplitude the modification factor for non dimensional amplitude is defined as 13 γ a c l a c l max a c l max d e f where a c l max is the maximum non dimensional response amplitude a c l max d e f is the default maximum non dimensional response amplitude from shear7 in shear7 the default peak value of a c l at a non dimensional frequency 1 0 is 0 90 to modify the a c l the modification factor is varied between 0 4 and 1 5 for e g by considering 0 8 as modification factor then 14 a c l max a c l max d e f γ a c l 0 9 0 8 0 72 the blue curve in fig 5 presents the modified non dimensional response amplitude values of the hydrodynamic excitation coefficient curve after multiplying with non dimensional response amplitude modification factor less than 1 then a c l becomes smaller than the original values yellow line as it shifts towards left from points b and c but the values of c l remains the same at points a and b as shown in fig 5 step 2 variation of excitation coefficient the modification factor for excitation coefficient is defined as 15 γ c l c l max c l max d e f where c l max d e f is the default excitation coefficient data point c l max is the modified excitation coefficient data point γ c l is the excitation coefficient modification factor in shear7 the default peak value of c l max at a non dimensional frequency 1 0 is 0 80 to modify the c l max the modification factor is ranged between 0 4 and 2 0 for e g consider 0 7 as modification factor then 16 c l max c l max d e f γ c l 0 8 0 7 0 56 the procedure to optimize the existing hydrodynamic excitation coefficients is summarized in fig 6 the riser buoyancy material properties and environmental loadings are collected from the shell experiment to design a model in orcaflex orcina 2018 shear7 is integrated with orcaflex for viv analysis of the riser initially default excitation coefficients in shear7 are used to carry out the analysis and the responses are compared with the available experimental results to reduce the error between semi empirical analysis and experimental results the hydrodynamic coefficients in shear7 are modified with specified intervals as stated in the above sections for the selection of best optimal set of parameters the predicted responses from the numerical analysis results in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage rate are compared with experimental results until they match with specified criteria as shown in fig 6 based on fig 2 the lower and upper boundaries of non dimensional frequency for new datasets will remain same as the default database but the peak value of the curve will be changing for every data set generated by considering the range of modification factors for non dimensional response amplitude and excitation coefficients 11520 new data sets were generated for all configurations examples of new data sets are shown in table a 2 these new data sets were used as input parameters for numerical analysis in shear7 the datasets which minimizes the error between the experimental results and prediction results is chosen as the optimal set of parameters the procedure to obtain the optimized datasets is explained in fig 7 4 analysis of riser with staggered buoyancy modules with new datasets of hydrodynamic excitation coefficients this section presents the numerical simulations of riser with staggered buoyancy elements for default dataset and newly generated hydrodynamic coefficient datasets based on modification process the total length of bare riser was 38 m with a continuous diameter of 30 mm made of fiberglass tubing the outside diameter of buoyancy module was 80 mm with a length of 0 4086 made of two flexible urethanes half shells which snapped together around the bare riser and secured with locking clips for more information refer rao et al 2015 the material properties of the test pipe and the buoyancy element are summarized in table 2 different buoyancy configurations could be modelled by clamping buoyancy elements on bare riser by leaving gaps at regular intervals as shown in fig 8 for staggered buoyancy elements over the bare riser the length of each buoyancy module is represented as l b and the length of the bare riser section between two adjacent buoyancy sections is represented as l c fig 8 represents the schematic of a flexible riser with buoyancy elements l b and l c are taken as multiples of length of each buoyancy module for e g l c 2 is defined as the gap between two neighbouring buoyancy sections as shown in fig 9 is equal to the length of two buoyancy elements 2 0 4086 m to study the effect of buoyancy elements on viv five different buoyancy configurations namely l c l b 1 1 l c l b 2 2 l c l b 3 1 l c l b 3 2 l c l b 5 2 were tested as shown in fig 8 numerical simulations material properties of riser and buoyancy modules are shown in table 2 current is perpendicular to riser model sn curve d type

used for analysis the predicted response frequencies and fatigue damage for five different configurations with flow speed ranging from 0 5 m s to 1 2 m s are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively 4 2 prediction with new generated set of parameters 4 2 1 procedure to obtain an optimal set of parameters to obtain an optimal set of hydrodynamic coefficients different datasets of excitation coefficient parameters are generated based on methodology as mentioned in earlier section and these datasets are used to run the simulations the simulation results are compared with the shell test results in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage rate the best approximation which satisfies the specified criteria as shown in table 3 is selected as the optimal set of parameters the predicted frequency and the maximum fatigue damage values need to be within 10 and 15 of the measured responses test results 4 2 2 analysis results this section presents the numerical results for five different configurations for flow speeds between 0 5 m s 1 2 m s also presents the comparison of results between measured test results prediction responses based on default coefficients and optimized coefficients in terms of response frequency and maximum accumulated fatigue damage rate the design of buoyancy modules of slwr is dependent on fatigue damage considerations since the fatigue damage is governed by response frequency and curvature the authors have studied on frequency analysis in this paper by interpolating the results from the numerical simulations based on the specified criteria as specified in table 3 and comparing the responses with the test results for five configurations reported by rao et al 2015 the below sections presents the comparison of responses for test results default excitation parameters results and best approximations for five configurations for various flow speeds the optimal set of parameters for every configuration at each flow speed is presented in table a 3 4 2 2 1 response frequency in this section the response frequencies from the 11520 sets of generated parameters are analysed and the only datasets which presented good approximation with the test results are presented for five configurations for each flow speed the obtained outcome from semi empirical tool is analysed and the sets which showed good approximation in terms of response frequency is shown in fig 12 a e in each graph three different outcomes have been compared which are 1 fem optimized optimal set of parameters obtained from newly generated datasets 2 fem default simulations with default set of excitation parameter 3 test results at each flow speed between 0 5 m s to 1 25 m s from the obtained results optimized parameters it was observed that the methodology in the present study produces reasonable accuracy with the test outcomes fig 12 a e shows the comparison of response frequencies between test results and predicted response by semi empirical for default parameters and optimized coefficients the predicted response frequency for 1 1 configuration with default coefficients was 31 95 under predicted whereas the optimized coefficients reduced the error by 25 51 when compared with test results as shown in fig 12 a with optimized excitation coefficients as presented in table a 3 the response frequency for 2 2 configuration was over predicted by 1 77 whereas with default parameters it was under predicted by 33 17 compared with test results as shown in fig 12 b from fig 12 c it shows that for 3 1 configuration the response frequency was 16 8 under predicted whereas with default parameters it was 40 25 under predicted for 3 2 and 5 2 configurations the response frequency was 36 98 and 38 5 under predicted respectively whereas this methodology of optimizing coefficients reduced the error by 31 5 and 23 01 as shown in fig 12 d and e respectively 4 2 2 2 fatigue damage this section presents the comparison of maximum fatigue damage for every configuration at each flow speed here only the cases which minimized the error between test results and prediction responses is presented the semi empirical prediction of maximum accumulated fatigue damage for 1 1 configuration was over predicted by 4 12 whereas 42 8 under predicted with default parameters as shown in fig 13 a the fatigue damage for 2 2 configuration was under predicted by 32 59 with default parameters whereas over predicted by 4 4 with optimized coefficients fig 13 b fig 13 c shows the prediction with default parameters for 3 1 configuration which was 8 77 unpredicted whereas 2 37 over predicted with optimized coefficients for 3 2 and 5 2 the fatigue damage was under predicted by 49 38 and 47 81 respectively with default coefficients but with optimization process the prediction error was reduced to 6 95 and 8 6 respectively as shown in fig 13 d e 4 2 2 3 comparison the three results namely test fem default and fem optimized results are presented with their mean and covs values the accuracy of the fem prediction from the optimized excitation coefficients can be verified with other outcomes as shown in table a 4 for comparison the individual outcomes in terms of response frequency and fatigue damage for every test case at each flow speed are presented in fig 14 a to e and fig 15 a to e respectively the horizontal axis represents the measured results as a reference point while the vertical axis presents the predicted results from default and optimized excitation coefficients table a 4 summarises the predicted results comparison between fem default and fem optimized excitation coefficients in terms of mean and covs from the obtained outcome it is evident that the used method to optimize the predicted responses are in good agreement with test results the mean and cov graphs shows that the proposed method produces identical results with the test results 5 behaviour of riser by sensitivity analysis in this section the effect of hydrodynamic drag coefficient and current flow speeds are studied in detail to predict the influence on fatigue damage of the riser riser with 2 2 configuration of buoyancy modules at 1 0 m s is considered as the base case for parametric analysis 5 1 effect of drag coefficient a sensitivity analysis was carried to assess the fatigue damage rate of the slwr for different hydrodynamic drag coefficients the analysis for base case was carried out using cd 1 2 table 4 shows the comparisons made with cd values of 0 6 1 5 over the entire length of riser with staggered buoyancy elements the fatigue damage of riser decreased when the drag coefficient is increased as shown in fig 16 a the increased drag on the riser is presented by higher drag coefficients due to presence of bigger diameters of buoyancy modules it can be noted that when the diameter of buoyancy elements is increased it could decrease the fatigue damage of riser this clearly defines that the selection of drag coefficient is crucial issue for riser analysis it is clear that as the drag coefficient increases the overall trend of fatigue damage of the riser decreases the fatigue damage rate between 0 6 and 0 8 drag coefficients reduces drastically and then follows gradually decrease 5 2 sensitivity to current flow speed fig 16 b shows the sensitivity of the predicted fatigue damage to the current velocity used in the analysis current velocity has a significant influence on fatigue damage as flow speed increases the maximum fatigue damage gradually increases due to higher mode being excited leading to high modal curvature as the flow speed increases the overall trend of fatigue damage rate also increases as presented in table 5 6 conclusion in the present study we have used a method to update the existing excitation coefficient database using experimental data for riser with staggered buoyancy elements the original hydrodynamic excitation coefficients were extracted from previously conducted fixed and forced oscillation tests on bare riser were used as backbone for semi empirical tools but these databases may not be valid for risers attached with staggered buoyancy elements an optimization process was selected to optimize the coefficients to reduce the error between experimental results and theoretical predictions an optimization process allowed the database to reduce the prediction error by using the optimal set of parameters significant improvement can be seen in predicting the response when compared with the default hydrodynamic excitation coefficient parameters further additional studies could be carried to present a single set of parameters for every test case for different current flow speeds additional configurations may also be generated based on aspect ratio of buoyancy modules and tested for significant improvement in theoretical approaches to predict the viv fatigue damage in addition to this more case studies are recommended to conduct on different parameters to figure out the sensitivity of each parameter on the performance of the riser credit author contribution statement m r lekkala conceptualization funding acquisition writing

21396,in shipyards block erection operations are generally conducted by several cranes to transport and vertically rotate blocks during such operations potentially risky situations such as interferences between hoisted bodies and crane wire ropes overloading and collisions could arise resulting in major damage to mitigate the occurrence of these incidents it is proposed that the interferences between the wire ropes and blocks should be verified in advance to assess the operation plan and prevent structural damage to the blocks in this study algorithms that consider the interference between the wire rope and the block were proposed which consist of contact sliding and friction models a constraint based wire rope was adopted for the simulation the contact model detects the interferences and creates or removes the contact nodes at the wire rope the sliding model subsequently produces the relative motion between the block and the wire rope and updates the position of the contact nodes accordingly the static and kinetic frictional forces were calculated in the friction model for this application the block turnover operation was simulated and the contact forces exerted on the blocks were calculated under various environmental conditions the results show that the proposed algorithms can be properly applied to block turnover operations graphical abstract image 1 keywords block erection physics based simulation wire rope interference frictional contact 1 introduction 1 1 background block erection operations are one of the most common operations in shipyards to construct ships and offshore structures it generally includes block lifting transporting and lowering procedures for convenient production and outfitting operations several blocks are constructed by rotating them upside down the block turnover process is often necessary in block erection operations in cases where the vertical rotation of such blocks is required block turnover can be achieved using either a single crane or several cranes in a coordinated arrangement in such a procedure interferences between the crane s wire rope and the block often occur see fig 1 the interference between the wire ropes and block can result in considerable property damage as the forces exerted by the wire ropes can damage vulnerable structures in the block generally in anticipation of such interferences either the block s lug arrangement design or the operation method is changed to avoid them when interference is unavoidable structural analysis of the block is conducted to establish its structural stability in advance when the block cannot support the exerted force structural reinforcement is necessary thus detection of the interferences and subsequent analysis of their exerted force can be performed through physics based simulation of the block turnover operation however interferences are difficult to analyze in advance first as blocks with outfitting have intricate structures isolating a definite area where interferences with wire ropes can be quantified is challenging the detection of interferences also has a high computational cost generally the mesh models of the block exported from the ship computer aided design cad system are complicated and the number of wire ropes for the operation is high moreover the block s motion as induced by the interference is almost unpredictable especially when there are environmental loads such as wind or waves the relative motion between the block and the wire ropes during the operation causes sliding motion and subsequent frictional forces therefore the frictional force should be considered in the calculation of the contact forces exerted by the wire ropes in this study we proposed an interaction model for wire ropes and a block system considering contact and friction forces then the contact forces exerted on the block were calculated for representative applications 1 2 related works this section provides related works that deal with the interferences between wire ropes and bodies see table 1 servin and lacoursière 2008 modeled a wire rope with several rigid bodies connected with angular constraints the wire rope was modeled as a physical body that allows interaction with other objects and a simple coulomb friction model was applied similarly servin et al 2011 modeled the wire rope with the number of lumped masses combined with distance constraints to consider the interference between the wire rope and block the frictional contact nodes were inserted in the wire rope when it collided with the block with the stick and slide friction along the wire rope as well as its edges being exerted at each node the proposed wire rope model was included in the augmented formulation of the multibody system however as the model considers the relationship between each lumped mass or the rigid bodies in one wire rope as a constraint the size of the matrix is relatively large compared to other models as multiple wire ropes are generally used in shipyard operations the model is not sufficient for application moreover the static friction model has several limitations for example stick slip transitions are not realized properly there have been other attempts to model wire rope as a deformable physical body using the finite element method cao et al 2017 analyzed the behavior of wire rope using a flexible multibody dynamics model based on absolute nodal coordinate formation the wire rope was modeled as a three dimensional beam element with two nodes having six degrees at each node then the contact between the wire rope and rigid body was simplified as a point surface contact jeong et al 2017 modeled a mooring line which can be regarded as a flexible body similar to the wire ropes with several one dimensional beam elements and considered the contact with the seabed using a spring damper system the wire rope model using finite elements can simulate the dynamic motion of the wire rope accurately but has a high computational cost owing to a large number of elements and degrees of freedom smyth 2018 modeled the wire rope using one dimensional elements by using ls dyna simulation to assist in determining the expected fatigue life of crane wire ropes the complex contact of the wire rope with the drum and sheave was analyzed using an explicit solver lee et al 2018 analyzed the motion of the mooring line with several flexible bodies with six degrees of freedom contact with the seabed was modeled as the constraint and frictional forces were considered both studies simplified the contact of the mooring line by assuming the seabed as a plane in the ship and offshore engineering fields several researchers analyzed block turnover operation using various cranes however there are only a few works that consider the interference between the wire rope and the block during the operation ha et al 2016 simulated block turnover operations using two gantry cranes wherein an event based scenario was created for the simulation and recursive formulations were used for the motion analysis however the wire ropes were modeled with incompressible springs as in general shipyard operation simulation and the interference with the block was not considered the block turnover operation using one floating crane and two crawler cranes was simulated by li et al 2019 in this work the collaborative simulation was performed by integrating dynamic analysis virtual reality and control devices similarly the contact between the block and the wire rope was ignored several studies have considered the interferences between blocks and wire ropes jo et al 2012 proposed a wire rope model consisting of lumped masses connected to elastic bodies the contact node was then inserted into the wire rope model after the definite location of the interference was determined the frictional force along the edge was then calculated however in addition to the friction along the wire rope being neglected a simplified block geometry was used for this model lee et al 2016 performed a block turnover simulation using a gantry crane considering the interferences the wire rope was modeled as a constraint and included in the discrete euler lagrange equation dele for the analysis with the multibody system however as the contact node is assumed to be fixed to the block the sliding motion and the frictional forces between the block and the wire ropes are not considered most existing studies consider wire ropes as separate constraints when simulating interferences in these studies the wire rope is modeled as an elastic body and the interferences are simulated as collisions between bodies nevertheless the simulation cost will be enormous as there are many wire ropes in operation and the procedures for collision detection between bodies are costly the tendency of the interference changes significantly according to the lug arrangements environmental conditions or operation methods therefore the simulation should be performed repeatedly many times to find the optimum operation method the entire process for the modeling and the simulation takes considerable time therefore the computational efficiency of the simulation is a very important issue in this study we modeled the wire rope using constraints to consider the interferences which is cost effective for the simulation then the contact and friction model was proposed as the tool of analysis for the sliding motion along the wire ropes and the block edges consequently the static and kinetic friction model was introduced for a reasonable stick slip transition finally the motion analysis was performed using the dele even for the wire rope constraints for the application the block turnover operation by floating and crawler cranes was simulated with the load exerted on the floating crane considered 2 multibody dynamics multibody dynamics is a discipline that describes the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems that consist of multiple bodies connected via joints which represent a kinematic constraint between separate bodies the bodies can be divided into rigid and flexible components depending on whether they are deformable a multibody system composed of both rigid and flexible bodies is called a flexible multibody system a multibody system is a system consisting of multiple bodies connected by joints to analyze the dynamic behavior of multibody systems the equations of motion describing the multiple bodies and joints should be constructed and solved with external forces in a multibody system the joints restrain the motion of each body by exerting constraint forces on the connected bodies therefore it is very difficult to directly apply the newton euler equation which is the basic form for dynamic analysis a modified form of the equation of motion is then proposed including constraint equations describing the joints 2 1 discrete euler lagrange equation to describe the motion of the multibody system various formulations have previously been proposed as the procedure for finding the constraint forces for multibody dynamics is complex shabana 2001 divided the formulations into two techniques according to the constraint force consideration method namely the embedding technique amirouche 1992 and the augmented formulation amirouche 1992 shabana 1997 alternatively lacoursière 2007 formulated the dele which is derived from the discretization of the euler lagrange equation other alternative approaches for the formulation of the motion equations of the multibody system are recursive methods book 1983 in this study a dele formulated by lacoursière 2007 is used which is proven to be numerically stable for the case of linear holonomic constraints the dele is derived from the discretization step of the euler lagrange equation together with the application of the finite differential method wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 and lew 2003 explained the derivation of the dele in their works and ham et al 2015 proposed a more detailed process to obtain the dele the matrix form of the dele is obtained as follows 1 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 γ h g k γ g k v k where m is the mass matrix g k is the constraint jacobian γ is the stabilization term h is the time step ε is the regularization term v k is the generalized velocity λ k 1 is the revised lagrange multiplier q k is the generalized coordinate g k is the constraint equation v is the potential energy and f is the external force by introducing λ k 1 h 2 λ k 1 2 λ k λ k 1 4 where λ k and λ k 1 are the lagrange multipliers at the current and previous time the revised lagrange multiplier is defined by the following equation 2 λ k 1 λ k 1 h 2 2 constraint based wire rope in this study the wire rope is modeled as a constraint to incorporate the interferences with the body effectively servin et al 2011 the constraints g k and jacobian g k of the wire ropes are then induced to formulate dele 1 ham et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 body a and body b are connected by a wire rope of length l and the initial length of the wire rope is l initial the constraint of the wire rope is then expressed as 3 g q l l i n i t i a l r a r b l i n i t i a l 0 where r a and r b are position vectors from origin o to bodies a and b respectively the constraint equation becomes zero when the length of the wire rope is equal to the initial length if the wire rope is stretched the constraint is violated and the constraint force is exerted on the wire rope to satisfy the constraint conditions the constraint force is then given by 4 f λ g q the constraint force is proportional to g q which represents the change in the length of the wire rope and is exerted at each end of the wire rope the spring coefficient denoted by λ is an intrinsic property of the wire rope therefore the constraint force acts as tension in the wire rope this model is the same as the massless spring model which calculates the spring force as a constraint force in dele 1 the term ε is inversely proportional to the spring coefficient it determines how strongly the constraint equation restrains the stretching similar to the spring model the error value of the constraint equation can increase when the spring coefficient of the wire rope is small as the wire rope is modeled as a straight line the looseness of the wire rope was not considered in this study however the constraint model displays more rigor when applied to more complex cases than the spring model as shown in fig 3 even when the wire rope is split into several segments it can be expressed as a simple constraint in particular the bending and torsion stiffness are neglected in this study 5 g q l a l b l c l i n i t i a l r 1 r a r 2 r 1 r b r 2 l i n i t i a l 0 based on the concept of the wire rope constraint above the contact between the wire rope and bodies can be considered if the wire rope contacts another body a new contact node can be inserted that divides the wire rope into two segments in this way the split of the wire rope due to contact with bodies see fig 4 or its winding around the body such as the case of pulleys see fig 5 can be simulated by using a constraint based wire rope ham et al 2016 lee et al 2014 2016 the advantage of this model is that the number of constraints does not increase as the number of segments consisting of one wire rope increases despite the wire rope splitting into several segments a single wire rope constraint is maintained by ascribing the sum total of all segmented lengths to be equal to the initial length it can simply simulate the various situations of the block erection operation without increasing the simulation cost 3 interaction model between the body and wire rope the interaction between the wire rope and the body can be divided into two processes contact and sliding see fig 6 the contact process performs node insertion and removal and the sliding process updates the position of the node and calculates the frictional force this section presents three mathematical models for the wire rope and the contact algorithm contact sliding and friction lee 2020 2019 3 1 contact model the contact model consists of a contact detection procedure and a contact force calculation procedure the overall procedure is illustrated in fig 7 and consists of a contact force calculation node removal contact detection and node insertion process these procedures are also presented by lee et al 2016 and have been partly improved in this study the complete procedure is performed at constant time intervals during the numerical calculation of the equations of motion in this section details of each process of the contact node update are illustrated 3 1 1 contact force calculations when the wire rope is in contact with the body it is split into several segments see fig 4 the contact force on each contact point is then calculated and the wire rope segments are merged if the body is detached from the wire rope the determination of the force normal to the constraint force is a prerequisite for deciding whether or not to merge the wires as a result of the contact detection process the contact node is always positioned on the edge of the body to calculate the force normal to the constraint force the normal of the edge is first obtained the edge of the block is a segment created by the intersection of two planes which suggests that we could find two neighboring planes that include the given edge in this study the normal vector at the edge is obtained by the sum of the normal vectors of neighboring planes the plane s normal vector is assumed to be facing inwards at all times as presented in fig 8 the normal vector at the edge of the contact node vn can be expressed as the sum of vp1 and vp2 the contact node is included within this tangential plane with the normal vector v n meanwhile the contact force at the node is the result of the tension of the wire rope segments split by the node the contact force is given by the vector sum of the individual tensions of the wire rope with the longitudinal direction of the wire rope 6 f c t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 if the friction along the wire rope is disregarded then the tension in the wire rope is constant throughout the rope the normal of the contact force at the body s edge is then calculated as the inner product of the normal vector at the edge with the contact force 7 f n v n f c fig 9 demonstrates the attachment and detachment of the body and wire rope if the normal of the contact force is positive it means that the wire rope exerts a force on the body and the wire rope remains attached in the event that the normal of the contact force becomes negative we conclude that the wire rope is no longer exerting force on the body and the wire mergence process is activated 3 1 2 wire mergence through node removal if the normal of the contact force is negative the node is removed and the wire ropes including the contact node are merged lee et al 2016 the exact opposite applies to the node insertion and wire split processes as the contact node is removed the neighboring nodes of the wire rope are connected as illustrated in fig 10 as previously indicated the wire rope is assumed to be a straight line connecting two nodes ignoring any bends in the wire rope 3 1 3 contact detection as the contact between the wire rope and the body is detected the contact nodes are inserted which split the wire rope the contact detection is composed of a broad phase and a narrow phase see fig 11 to reduce the detection time in the broad phase the intersection between the wire rope and bounding box of the body is checked then if the intersection is detected in the broad phase the narrow phase is activated generally the block model used in the shipbuilding and offshore industries consists of triangular meshes in the narrow phase the intersection between the wire rope and each triangular mesh of the block is checked to find these intersection points general intersection algorithms between a triangle and a straight line can be used accordingly the möller trumbore intersection algorithm möller and trumbore 1997 which is generally known as the fastest algorithm used by lee et al 2016 was adopted provided that the starting point and direction of a straight line line are specified as well as three vertices of a triangular mesh triangle the möller trumbore intersection algorithm calculates the intersection point by using the barycentric coordinates of the triangle see fig 12 the distance t of the intersection points from the origin and the barycentric coordinates u and v can be determined by using eq 8 the solution for the equation can then be obtained using cramer s rule 8 t u v 1 d v 2 v 0 v 1 v 0 t v 1 v 0 v 2 v 0 d v 2 v 0 t t v 1 v 0 d the möller trumbore intersection algorithm finds the intersection between the triangle and the line considering that the line is a ray which is an infinite half straight line with an origin as the wire rope is a finite line in the simulation the intersection is not calculated if the distance t is larger than the length of the wire rope as the block can be represented as a group of triangular meshes all triangles in the mesh group should be verified to determine if they intersect with the wire rope if the intersection points are found the node insertion process is performed 3 1 4 wire split through node insertion as established the intersection points of the wire rope and block are calculated through the contact detection procedure although lee et al 2016 segmented the wire rope at the points of intersection as per the application of the möller trumbore intersection algorithm this does not adequately reflect the actual situation where the wire rope penetrates the body in the numerical simulation time passes in discrete time steps thus the wire rope could penetrate the body as the time increases discretely to solve this problem we calculated the contact point on the edge of the body as presented in fig 13 as depicted in fig 14 the contact node is found as the closest point on the edge from each of the intersection points if the contact node is inserted in the wire rope the constraint equation that represents the wire rope changes to the following equation 9 g q r a r c r c r b l t o t a l 0 where r a and r b are the start and end position vectors of the wire rope and r c is the position vector of the contact node 3 2 wire body sliding model if contact between the wire rope and the body occurs a relative motion between them arises the relative motion occurs in two distinctive ways sliding along the edge and sliding along the wire rope see fig 15 these procedures are also presented briefly by lee et al 2019 and have been improved in this study the sliding motion along the wire rope represents the relative motion wherein the body moves along the length of the wire rope if the block slides down along the wire rope as illustrated in fig 16 the position of the contact node attached to the body changes with time and the wire rope s constraint equation changes accordingly in this case the node is assumed to be fixed to the body and presented as body fixed coordinates therefore the position of the node is automatically updated at each time interval as the position of the body is changed in addition if the wire rope slides along the edge of the body the position of the contact node relative to the body is changed the local position of the contact node relative to the body should then be updated accordingly in this study the wire rope is modeled as a constraint rather than an object with mass and inertia therefore the dynamic motion of the wire rope cannot be considered and the position of the contact node along the edge should be explicitly calculated when the wire rope is stretched the contact node slides along the edge of the body to keep the total length of the wire rope to a minimum therefore the position of the contact node p is updated to the final point p which is the closest point on the edge from the line connecting neighboring nodes see fig 17 fig 17 shows the sliding motion of the wire rope along the edge from an existing contact node to another however in the case of the final point of the contact node it does not exist on the same edge as the one succeeding it as the contact node moves to the other edge to minimize the length to solve this problem we developed an updated procedure considering this occurrence of the contact node sliding to the other edges fig 18 presents the procedure developed to update the position of the contact node when it slides from one edge to another first the final point p that the contact node moves to is calculated if the final point is located on the edge but at a distance from the vertex the contact node moves to the end of the edge ① in fig 18 the contact node is then segmented into several nodes located at the succeeding edges that share the same vertex ② in fig 18 this represents the intermediate state of the contact nodes subsequently the contact force calculation and node removal procedures were performed for the contact nodes at this intermediate state in summary these intermediate nodes wherein the normal of the contact force is negative are removed the final contact node and the wire rope are then shown in ③ fig 18 3 3 wire body friction model when the body and the wire rope exhibit the relative motion stated above frictional forces are exerted between them accordingly the static and kinematic frictional forces should be calculated 3 3 1 friction along wire rope if a body slides along the length of a wire rope a frictional force is exerted on the body to restrain its motion using the coulomb friction model the frictional force is divided into two namely static and kinematic friction to simulate static friction when sliding motion occurs along the wire rope see fig 19 an additional constraint is applied as follows 10 g s t a i c q l a l a l b l a i n i t i a l l i n i t i a l 0 eq 10 is the static friction constraint that calculates the sliding motion velocity of contact node b considering the extension of the entire wire rope it restrains the contact node s possible sliding motion along the wire rope after the contact node is detected a static constraint is immediately created with this constraint the contact node does not slide along the wire rope and the body is stuck consequently the constraint force eq 11 from the static friction constraint becomes the static frictional force exerted on the contact node and body 11 f s t a t i c g s t a t i c t λ as shown in fig 19 the constraint force is exerted in the opposite direction to stop the sliding motion of the contact node if the constraint force exceeds the maximum static friction force which is obtained from the static frictional coefficient μ s eq 12 the static friction constraint is removed and the kinetic frictional force is exerted 12 f s t a t i c μ s f n o r m a l the kinetic frictional force is calculated by multiplying the kinetic frictional coefficient μ k by the normal force 13 f k i n e t i c μ k f n o r m a l t e μ k f n t e the normal force f n is the constraint force exerted in the direction normal to the body s edge which is calculated using eq 7 vector e t is a unit vector that is the direction of the kinetic frictional force the unit vector has the opposite direction to the body s relative velocity in the tangential plane see fig 20 3 3 2 friction along the edge when the wire rope is sliding along the edge of the body the frictional force is likewise exerted on the contact node the tangential force exerted on the contact node is calculated as the projection of the wire rope tension in the direction of the edge the maximum static friction is then obtained as a product of the normal force at the contact node and the coefficient of static friction t if the tangential force at the contact node is under the maximum static friction the contact node of the wire rope is assumed to be fixed on the body consequently the location of the contact node is then expressed as a constant local vector of the body and fixed on the edge if the tangential force which is a static friction force exceeds the maximum static friction as in eq 12 the contact node starts to slide along the edge as the wire rope is modeled as a constraint in this study and not a mass entity the motion of the contact node with frictional force is approximated according to servin et al 2011 as presented in fig 21 the contact node moves to the desired final point obtained in fig 17 according to a specific ratio the position of the contact node is calculated as follows 14 p n e x t p α μ k p p where p is the final location that minimizes the length of the wire rope and p and p next are the present and next locations of the contact node respectively α is the displacement ratio which is a function of the kinematic friction coefficient the ratio decreases linearly from 1 to 0 as the kinematic friction coefficient increases from 0 to 1 4 verification this section provides a convergence test and several verification examples compared with the analytic solutions to increase the reliability of the proposed methods to verify the interaction algorithm between the wire rope and the body we separated the proposed model into contact friction and sliding models 4 1 convergence test as the contact detection and interaction algorithm strongly depend on the time step the convergence test is performed the simulation results of a numerical test with varying time step sizes are compared and a reasonable range of the time step is provided a simple example is presented in fig 22 a cubic box of length 10 m was dropped from a height of 20 m above the wire rope the weight of the box was assumed to be 1 ton then the values of the z position of the block and the tension of the wire rope during contact are compared with the various time step sizes from 0 001 s to 0 1 s as presented in fig 23 after the box is dropped the box makes contact with the wire rope from 1 75 s to 2 15 s the position of the block and the tension of the wire rope converge as the size of the time step decreases the time at which contact occurs is also different due to the discrete contact detection procedure the minimum z position of the block and the maximum tension of the wire rope with varying time step size in the logarithmic scale is then depicted in fig 24 both the position of the block and the tension of the wire rope converged with a small time step under 0 02 s showing a difference of less than 1 with the result at a time step size of 0 001 in conclusion the reasonable range of time step size was determined to be under 0 02 s 4 2 collision model the collision model includes collision detection wire split force calculation and wire merge procedures to verify such procedures the same example for the convergence test presented in fig 22 is adopted with a time step of 0 01 s 15 m g h 1 m g h 2 1 2 m v 2 2 1 2 k x 2 2 for comparison the analytic solution is calculated from the energy conservation law expressed in eq 15 where h 1 is the height of the box at the initial state h 2 and v 2 are the height and the velocity of the box during contact respectively and x 2 is the elongation length of the wire rope the summation of the potential kinetic and elastic energy of the box and the wire rope during the simulation should remain the same as the initial potential energy assuming there is no loss of energy owing to damping the values of the z position velocity and tension of the wire rope during contact are depicted in fig 25 and fig 26 during contact the wire rope is stretched which increases the duration of the contact time and the contact force induced by the tension is continuously exerted as a result the velocity of the block changes smoothly during the contact time which is shown by the yellow shaded area the box makes contact with the wire rope at 1 75 s which is the same as in the analytic solution the z position of the box has regular oscillations and returns to the initial position after the collision as damping is neglected the tension of the wire rope increases after the collision and reaches a peak at the lowest position of the box the minimum position of the box and the maximum tension of the wire rope are compared with the analytic solution in table 2 the error between the simulation result and the analytic solution was less than 1 for both values the error can occur owing to the option of the 0 01 s discrete time progression during the simulation 4 3 sliding model when a wire rope slides on the body the contact node moves along the edge and splits onto the other edges the algorithm for the sliding process to other edges is required only for the numerical simulation as the body is modeled with triangular meshes in the simulation therefore the same model with different mesh compositions should produce similar results to verify the proposed algorithm we compared the sliding motion of the wire ropes along two identical box models consisting of different mesh sizes see fig 27 although the shape and weight of the models are the same the number of edges for each of the boxes is different the configuration of the simulation is illustrated in fig 28 the box is located 1 m away from the centerline on the y axis therefore as the box is dropped on the wire rope it begins to slide and fall the sliding motion of the box and wire rope is illustrated in fig 29 and fig 30 as shown in fig 29 the box fell onto the wire rope and slipped away from the centerline fig 30 shows the sliding motion of the wire rope along the edge of the box the contact nodes move along the actual edge of the box regardless of the composition of the meshes the motion of the box and the tension of the wire rope are depicted in fig 31 and fig 32 the solid red line is the result of the box model in case 1 and the black dotted line represents the result of case 2 figs 31 and 32 show the y and z positions of the box and the tension of the two wire ropes the tension of the wire ropes increases as the box makes contact with the wire rope and decreases to zero after the block is detached the motion of the box and the tension of the wire ropes were similar in both cases the time of detachment of the box and the wire ropes which depends on the mesh composition of the box and the simulation time step is slightly different owing to the sliding motion of the wire rope to other edges however the composition of the meshes in an identical model had a minimal influence on the sliding motion of the wire ropes and the contact nodes 4 4 friction model the friction model is verified for cases wherein the sliding motion is experienced along the edge of the body or along the wire rope the coulomb friction model was then adopted for the comparison following servin et al 2011 in case 1 the frictional force exerted on the wire rope during sliding along the edge of the body was verified the simplified friction model is shown in fig 33 the comparison experiment involves two boxes that are connected to a wire rope which wraps the long rectangular beam each of the two boxes weighs 10 tons so the sliding motion along the wire rope does not occur the rectangular beam s angle of inclination is 30 and the wire rope connecting the boxes slides down along the long edge of the beam owing to its weight the motion of the wire rope and boxes are illustrated in fig 34 in the coulomb friction model the tangential force exerted on the contact node is mg sinθ μ k cosθ and the acceleration decreases linearly by the kinetic friction coefficient μ k according to eq 16 the stick friction is reached when μ k 0 58 16 a g sin θ 1 μ k sec θ case 2 tests the friction along the wire rope the configuration of the sliding test is illustrated in fig 35 similar to the previous case two boxes are connected to one wire rope wrapping the rectangular beam only this time one of the masses weighs 20 tons while the other one weighs 10 tons in addition the contact node slides along the wire rope the tension of the wire rope without friction is t 2m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 g which yields t 13 33 g in this example if the coulomb friction force is exerted eq 17 is obtained the normal of the contact force is 2 t owing to the 90 turn at the edge 17 t m 1 g 2 t μ k m 1 g m 2 g t 2 t μ k m 2 g where m 1 and m 2 are the weights of the boxes and μ k is the friction coefficient the wire rope stops sliding and reaches stick friction when μ k 0 24 both sides of eq 17 are the magnitude of the vertical acceleration of the boxes the acceleration with no friction is 3 3 m s2 the motion of the boxes is shown in fig 36 in both cases the accelerations of the boxes for different friction coefficients are calculated and compared with the result of the coulomb friction model in the coulomb friction model the friction force is proportional to the friction coefficient and the acceleration decreases linearly as the friction coefficient increases the results are shown in fig 37 the red line represents the result of the proposed method and the black line represents the coulomb friction model in case 2 depicted with a solid line the result of the proposed friction model along the wire rope is identical to the coulomb friction model in contrast the friction model along the edge in case 1 shows a difference from the coulomb friction model such behavior is due to the assumption about the motion along the edge introduced in section 3 2 as the wire rope is modeled as a constraint instead of a flexible body with mass and inertia determining the wire rope s dynamic motion is challenging therefore the wire rope s sliding motion and the effect of the kinetic friction force are approximated using eq 14 these limitations can lead to a marked deviation from the coulomb friction model behavior as demonstrated in the sliding test however the stick slip transition can be simulated properly in both sliding directions and the resultant acceleration shows a tendency similar to that of the coulomb friction model according to the friction coefficient 5 numerical test cases this section presents three test cases to validate the mathematical model for the contact algorithm explained in the previous sections each case includes a body and wire ropes with large spring coefficients which were used to analyze the motion and contact forces 5 1 dropping of a tilted body the contact detection and static friction calculation processes are validated by dropping the tilted body on one wire rope this confirmation exercise is conducted for three cases in cases 1 1 and 1 2 the body is assumed to be a simple cube shaped box and the effect of static friction is investigated in case 1 3 a bunny model which is composed of more complicated meshes is used for the same test in cases 1 1 and 1 2 the motion of a tilted box dropped on the wire rope with and without static friction is compared fig 38 depicts the motion of the box in case 1 1 the box spins in the same place infinitely as there is no friction between the box and the wire rope if static friction is exerted between them as in case 1 2 the torque induced by the static friction force is exerted on the box and the box rotates with the contact node as the center and stops at the end fig 38 shows that the position of the box along the wire rope is unchanged in case 1 1 and moves in the right direction in case 2 2 the same test case is performed with a bunny model of complex meshes consisting of both convex and concave shapes static friction is included in this case the motion of the bunny is illustrated in fig 39 similar to case 1 2 the bunny rotates with a contact node as the center and moves to the end of the wire rope the contact nodes are properly detected along the curved surface of the bunny model 5 2 sliding motion of a body along the wire rope to check the effect of the kinetic friction the motion of the body sliding along the tilted wire rope is compared for two separate cases see fig 40 in the absence of kinetic friction the box slides along the wire rope until the end however in the presence of a kinetic frictional force exerted on the box the sliding speed is reduced over time and stops when it reaches the static friction state 5 3 dropping of a body between wire ropes in the sliding model the contact node is split into several nodes as the wire rope slides onto other edges on the body to test the sliding model two cases are simulated to observe the motion of the contact node and the body the test cases are applied to a body with complex meshes such as a sphere and a bunny model the body is dropped through two wire ropes and the wire ropes slide along the curvature of each body fig 41 presents the results of case 3 1 with a spherical model the figure shows that the contact nodes are created on the sphere as the wire ropes touch the body then the sphere passes through the wire rope and the contact node slides along several edges case 3 2 with a bunny model is shown in fig 42 in this case the contact node moves along the edges in different directions on the bunny model finally the ear of the bunny is caught in a wire rope and then slides down 6 application the block turnover operations using the floating crane and crawler cranes ham et al 2018 li et al 2019 are simulated based on the multibody system dynamics including the proposed interaction algorithm between the body and the wire rope the configuration of the block turnover simulation is shown in fig 43 the floating crane and two crawler cranes simultaneously lift the block on the quay with wire ropes attached to both ends of the block the floating crane has one block loader with four slings and each crawler crane holds the block with three slings the floating crane is moored to the quay and the seabed whereas the crawler cranes are fixed to the ground the mooring lines are modeled with massless springs the properties of the floating barge are summarized in table 3 the principal dimensions of the block are shown in fig 44 the block data were extracted from the ship cad data and converted into triangular mesh data the figure shows that the entire block consists of a number of triangular meshes its weight is 348 tons with a length of 27 m breadth of 34 m and depth of 9 m the turnover operation is completed in three phases as shown in fig 45 both cranes hoist the wire rope up and down to rotate the block to the end position in phase 1 all cranes hoist up the wire rope connected to the hooks to lift the block after lifting the block to a certain height the crawler cranes stop hoisting and the floating crane continues hoisting up to rotate the block furthermore in phase 3 the crawler cranes slowly hoist down the wire ropes until the loads become zero while the floating crane stops hoisting the interferences between the slings of the crawler cranes and the block occur during this phase finally the floating crane holds the block at a 90 rotation the actual operation involves additional procedures to flip over the block 180 but only the three phases stated above are considered in this simulation the simulation cases are performed with different wave conditions as presented in table 4 the test cases are selected by different wave periods and heights in cases 1 3 the interferences between the block and the wire ropes as well as the responses according to wave periods are compared subsequently the results according to the wave height are checked from cases 2 4 and 5 the motion of the block and the wire ropes during the operation in case 2 are presented in fig 46 interferences between the block and the wire ropes occur during phase 3 in every case as shown in fig 47 six contact nodes are created one for each sling of the crawler cranes the contact nodes are inserted into the wire rope and the contact forces are calculated during the simulation the impulsive forces during contact are calculated from the tension of the wire ropes and the normal of the edges at the contact points as explained in section 1 in case 5 which has the maximum wave height the sliding of the contact points occurs owing to the motion of the block induced by a wave this is presented in fig 48 the contact forces exerted on the block during the simulation are calculated and depicted in fig 49 and fig 50 further the contact forces exerted on six contact nodes are presented separately as interferences occur between the block and the wire rope contact forces are generated the contact forces are then reduced to zero as the wire ropes are detached from the body cases 1 2 and 3 have different wave periods leading to differences in the motion of the floating crane as shown in fig 49 the contact time and contact forces are similar at an early stage as the wave height is the same however the contact forces suddenly increase in cases 1 and 2 when the crawler cranes hoist down the wire rope the oscillation of the floating crane increases owing to the change in the block load and the impact is exerted between the block and the wire rope as the attachment and detachment of the wire rope are repeated a sudden increase in the contact force occurs the maximum contact forces exerted on the block are 55 tons 33 tons and 27 tons for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the maximum value of the contact force increases as the wave period decreases owing to resonance the contact forces under different wave heights are likewise obtained in cases 4 and 5 similarly the motion of the floating crane has a large influence on the contact force unlike cases 1 3 the time at which contact is initially detected is changed owing to the different motion amplitudes of the floating crane when compared to case 2 where the wave height is 1 0 m the contact occurs earlier in case 5 as the wave height increases and later in case 4 the impact then occurs in case 5 as the wave height increases resulting in the maximum contact force case 4 with a wave height of 0 5 m shows the lowest value of the maximum contact force that is 24 tons in case 5 the contact force has a maximum value of 108 tons in summary the contact force exerted between the wire rope and the block during the block turnover operations increases with increasing wave height and decreases with increasing wave period in this application 7 conclusions and future work during block erection operations in shipyards interferences between the blocks and the wire ropes often occur possibly resulting in severe damage to prevent such incidents interferences should be verified in advance by physics based simulation in this study we realized the general interaction between the wire rope and the body using the contact sliding and friction models accordingly the constraint based wire rope model is adopted because of its ease of applicability and cost effectiveness in the contact model the contact node was generated by the contact detection algorithm and removed according to the calculated contact force the sliding motion of the contact node was divided into sliding motion along the wire rope on the one hand and sliding motion on the edge of the body on the other the motion of the wire rope and body was subsequently obtained under static and kinetic frictional forces we provided several verification examples that were compared with the analytic solutions to increase the reliability of the proposed models for the application the block turnover operation using two crawler cranes and one floating crane was simulated then the contact forces at every contact node were analyzed under various wave conditions of different wave heights and periods during the simulation six contact nodes were created as the crawler cranes hoist down the wire ropes then it was observed that the contact node slid along the edge of the block as the wave loads were exerted the results revealed that the contact force exerted between the wire rope and the block tends to increase with increasing wave height and decrease with increasing wave period the maximum contact force was 108 tons at a wave height of 2 0 m and a wave period of 10 s the minimum contact force was 24 tons when the wave height was 0 5 m this result proved that the proposed models could be adopted to block erection operations future research will focus on the validation and improvement of the proposed models the interference algorithms between the wire rope and body will be improved by considering the dynamics of the wire rope the proposed model will then be evaluated by comparison with the actual experimental results finally the simulation results will be compared with the actual operations through collaboration with a shipyard to validate and improve the reliability of the proposed model credit authorship

21396,in shipyards block erection operations are generally conducted by several cranes to transport and vertically rotate blocks during such operations potentially risky situations such as interferences between hoisted bodies and crane wire ropes overloading and collisions could arise resulting in major damage to mitigate the occurrence of these incidents it is proposed that the interferences between the wire ropes and blocks should be verified in advance to assess the operation plan and prevent structural damage to the blocks in this study algorithms that consider the interference between the wire rope and the block were proposed which consist of contact sliding and friction models a constraint based wire rope was adopted for the simulation the contact model detects the interferences and creates or removes the contact nodes at the wire rope the sliding model subsequently produces the relative motion between the block and the wire rope and updates the position of the contact nodes accordingly the static and kinetic frictional forces were calculated in the friction model for this application the block turnover operation was simulated and the contact forces exerted on the blocks were calculated under various environmental conditions the results show that the proposed algorithms can be properly applied to block turnover operations graphical abstract image 1 keywords block erection physics based simulation wire rope interference frictional contact 1 introduction 1 1 background block erection operations are one of the most common operations in shipyards to construct ships and offshore structures it generally includes block lifting transporting and lowering procedures for convenient production and outfitting operations several blocks are constructed by rotating them upside down the block turnover process is often necessary in block erection operations in cases where the vertical rotation of such blocks is required block turnover can be achieved using either a single crane or several cranes in a coordinated arrangement in such a procedure interferences between the crane s wire rope and the block often occur see fig 1 the interference between the wire ropes and block can result in considerable property damage as the forces exerted by the wire ropes can damage vulnerable structures in the block generally in anticipation of such interferences either the block s lug arrangement design or the operation method is changed to avoid them when interference is unavoidable structural analysis of the block is conducted to establish its structural stability in advance when the block cannot support the exerted force structural reinforcement is necessary thus detection of the interferences and subsequent analysis of their exerted force can be performed through physics based simulation of the block turnover operation however interferences are difficult to analyze in advance first as blocks with outfitting have intricate structures isolating a definite area where interferences with wire ropes can be quantified is challenging the detection of interferences also has a high computational cost generally the mesh models of the block exported from the ship computer aided design cad system are complicated and the number of wire ropes for the operation is high moreover the block s motion as induced by the interference is almost unpredictable especially when there are environmental loads such as wind or waves the relative motion between the block and the wire ropes during the operation causes sliding motion and subsequent frictional forces therefore the frictional force should be considered in the calculation of the contact forces exerted by the wire ropes in this study we proposed an interaction model for wire ropes and a block system considering contact and friction forces then the contact forces exerted on the block were calculated for representative applications 1 2 related works this section provides related works that deal with the interferences between wire ropes and bodies see table 1 servin and lacoursière 2008 modeled a wire rope with several rigid bodies connected with angular constraints the wire rope was modeled as a physical body that allows interaction with other objects and a simple coulomb friction model was applied similarly servin et al 2011 modeled the wire rope with the number of lumped masses combined with distance constraints to consider the interference between the wire rope and block the frictional contact nodes were inserted in the wire rope when it collided with the block with the stick and slide friction along the wire rope as well as its edges being exerted at each node the proposed wire rope model was included in the augmented formulation of the multibody system however as the model considers the relationship between each lumped mass or the rigid bodies in one wire rope as a constraint the size of the matrix is relatively large compared to other models as multiple wire ropes are generally used in shipyard operations the model is not sufficient for application moreover the static friction model has several limitations for example stick slip transitions are not realized properly there have been other attempts to model wire rope as a deformable physical body using the finite element method cao et al 2017 analyzed the behavior of wire rope using a flexible multibody dynamics model based on absolute nodal coordinate formation the wire rope was modeled as a three dimensional beam element with two nodes having six degrees at each node then the contact between the wire rope and rigid body was simplified as a point surface contact jeong et al 2017 modeled a mooring line which can be regarded as a flexible body similar to the wire ropes with several one dimensional beam elements and considered the contact with the seabed using a spring damper system the wire rope model using finite elements can simulate the dynamic motion of the wire rope accurately but has a high computational cost owing to a large number of elements and degrees of freedom smyth 2018 modeled the wire rope using one dimensional elements by using ls dyna simulation to assist in determining the expected fatigue life of crane wire ropes the complex contact of the wire rope with the drum and sheave was analyzed using an explicit solver lee et al 2018 analyzed the motion of the mooring line with several flexible bodies with six degrees of freedom contact with the seabed was modeled as the constraint and frictional forces were considered both studies simplified the contact of the mooring line by assuming the seabed as a plane in the ship and offshore engineering fields several researchers analyzed block turnover operation using various cranes however there are only a few works that consider the interference between the wire rope and the block during the operation ha et al 2016 simulated block turnover operations using two gantry cranes wherein an event based scenario was created for the simulation and recursive formulations were used for the motion analysis however the wire ropes were modeled with incompressible springs as in general shipyard operation simulation and the interference with the block was not considered the block turnover operation using one floating crane and two crawler cranes was simulated by li et al 2019 in this work the collaborative simulation was performed by integrating dynamic analysis virtual reality and control devices similarly the contact between the block and the wire rope was ignored several studies have considered the interferences between blocks and wire ropes jo et al 2012 proposed a wire rope model consisting of lumped masses connected to elastic bodies the contact node was then inserted into the wire rope model after the definite location of the interference was determined the frictional force along the edge was then calculated however in addition to the friction along the wire rope being neglected a simplified block geometry was used for this model lee et al 2016 performed a block turnover simulation using a gantry crane considering the interferences the wire rope was modeled as a constraint and included in the discrete euler lagrange equation dele for the analysis with the multibody system however as the contact node is assumed to be fixed to the block the sliding motion and the frictional forces between the block and the wire ropes are not considered most existing studies consider wire ropes as separate constraints when simulating interferences in these studies the wire rope is modeled as an elastic body and the interferences are simulated as collisions between bodies nevertheless the simulation cost will be enormous as there are many wire ropes in operation and the procedures for collision detection between bodies are costly the tendency of the interference changes significantly according to the lug arrangements environmental conditions or operation methods therefore the simulation should be performed repeatedly many times to find the optimum operation method the entire process for the modeling and the simulation takes considerable time therefore the computational efficiency of the simulation is a very important issue in this study we modeled the wire rope using constraints to consider the interferences which is cost effective for the simulation then the contact and friction model was proposed as the tool of analysis for the sliding motion along the wire ropes and the block edges consequently the static and kinetic friction model was introduced for a reasonable stick slip transition finally the motion analysis was performed using the dele even for the wire rope constraints for the application the block turnover operation by floating and crawler cranes was simulated with the load exerted on the floating crane considered 2 multibody dynamics multibody dynamics is a discipline that describes the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems that consist of multiple bodies connected via joints which represent a kinematic constraint between separate bodies the bodies can be divided into rigid and flexible components depending on whether they are deformable a multibody system composed of both rigid and flexible bodies is called a flexible multibody system a multibody system is a system consisting of multiple bodies connected by joints to analyze the dynamic behavior of multibody systems the equations of motion describing the multiple bodies and joints should be constructed and solved with external forces in a multibody system the joints restrain the motion of each body by exerting constraint forces on the connected bodies therefore it is very difficult to directly apply the newton euler equation which is the basic form for dynamic analysis a modified form of the equation of motion is then proposed including constraint equations describing the joints 2 1 discrete euler lagrange equation to describe the motion of the multibody system various formulations have previously been proposed as the procedure for finding the constraint forces for multibody dynamics is complex shabana 2001 divided the formulations into two techniques according to the constraint force consideration method namely the embedding technique amirouche 1992 and the augmented formulation amirouche 1992 shabana 1997 alternatively lacoursière 2007 formulated the dele which is derived from the discretization of the euler lagrange equation other alternative approaches for the formulation of the motion equations of the multibody system are recursive methods book 1983 in this study a dele formulated by lacoursière 2007 is used which is proven to be numerically stable for the case of linear holonomic constraints the dele is derived from the discretization step of the euler lagrange equation together with the application of the finite differential method wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 and lew 2003 explained the derivation of the dele in their works and ham et al 2015 proposed a more detailed process to obtain the dele the matrix form of the dele is obtained as follows 1 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 γ h g k γ g k v k where m is the mass matrix g k is the constraint jacobian γ is the stabilization term h is the time step ε is the regularization term v k is the generalized velocity λ k 1 is the revised lagrange multiplier q k is the generalized coordinate g k is the constraint equation v is the potential energy and f is the external force by introducing λ k 1 h 2 λ k 1 2 λ k λ k 1 4 where λ k and λ k 1 are the lagrange multipliers at the current and previous time the revised lagrange multiplier is defined by the following equation 2 λ k 1 λ k 1 h 2 2 constraint based wire rope in this study the wire rope is modeled as a constraint to incorporate the interferences with the body effectively servin et al 2011 the constraints g k and jacobian g k of the wire ropes are then induced to formulate dele 1 ham et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 body a and body b are connected by a wire rope of length l and the initial length of the wire rope is l initial the constraint of the wire rope is then expressed as 3 g q l l i n i t i a l r a r b l i n i t i a l 0 where r a and r b are position vectors from origin o to bodies a and b respectively the constraint equation becomes zero when the length of the wire rope is equal to the initial length if the wire rope is stretched the constraint is violated and the constraint force is exerted on the wire rope to satisfy the constraint conditions the constraint force is then given by 4 f λ g q the constraint force is proportional to g q which represents the change in the length of the wire rope and is exerted at each end of the wire rope the spring coefficient denoted by λ is an intrinsic property of the wire rope therefore the constraint force acts as tension in the wire rope this model is the same as the massless spring model which calculates the spring force as a constraint force in dele 1 the term ε is inversely proportional to the spring coefficient it determines how strongly the constraint equation restrains the stretching similar to the spring model the error value of the constraint equation can increase when the spring coefficient of the wire rope is small as the wire rope is modeled as a straight line the looseness of the wire rope was not considered in this study however the constraint model displays more rigor when applied to more complex cases than the spring model as shown in fig 3 even when the wire rope is split into several segments it can be expressed as a simple constraint in particular the bending and torsion stiffness are neglected in this study 5 g q l a l b l c l i n i t i a l r 1 r a r 2 r 1 r b r 2 l i n i t i a l 0 based on the concept of the wire rope constraint above the contact between the wire rope and bodies can be considered if the wire rope contacts another body a new contact node can be inserted that divides the wire rope into two segments in this way the split of the wire rope due to contact with bodies see fig 4 or its winding around the body such as the case of pulleys see fig 5 can be simulated by using a constraint based wire rope ham et al 2016 lee et al 2014 2016 the advantage of this model is that the number of constraints does not increase as the number of segments consisting of one wire rope increases despite the wire rope splitting into several segments a single wire rope constraint is maintained by ascribing the sum total of all segmented lengths to be equal to the initial length it can simply simulate the various situations of the block erection operation without increasing the simulation cost 3 interaction model between the body and wire rope the interaction between the wire rope and the body can be divided into two processes contact and sliding see fig 6 the contact process performs node insertion and removal and the sliding process updates the position of the node and calculates the frictional force this section presents three mathematical models for the wire rope and the contact algorithm contact sliding and friction lee 2020 2019 3 1 contact model the contact model consists of a contact detection procedure and a contact force calculation procedure the overall procedure is illustrated in fig 7 and consists of a contact force calculation node removal contact detection and node insertion process these procedures are also presented by lee et al 2016 and have been partly improved in this study the complete procedure is performed at constant time intervals during the numerical calculation of the equations of motion in this section details of each process of the contact node update are illustrated 3 1 1 contact force calculations when the wire rope is in contact with the body it is split into several segments see fig 4 the contact force on each contact point is then calculated and the wire rope segments are merged if the body is detached from the wire rope the determination of the force normal to the constraint force is a prerequisite for deciding whether or not to merge the wires as a result of the contact detection process the contact node is always positioned on the edge of the body to calculate the force normal to the constraint force the normal of the edge is first obtained the edge of the block is a segment created by the intersection of two planes which suggests that we could find two neighboring planes that include the given edge in this study the normal vector at the edge is obtained by the sum of the normal vectors of neighboring planes the plane s normal vector is assumed to be facing inwards at all times as presented in fig 8 the normal vector at the edge of the contact node vn can be expressed as the sum of vp1 and vp2 the contact node is included within this tangential plane with the normal vector v n meanwhile the contact force at the node is the result of the tension of the wire rope segments split by the node the contact force is given by the vector sum of the individual tensions of the wire rope with the longitudinal direction of the wire rope 6 f c t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 if the friction along the wire rope is disregarded then the tension in the wire rope is constant throughout the rope the normal of the contact force at the body s edge is then calculated as the inner product of the normal vector at the edge with the contact force 7 f n v n f c fig 9 demonstrates the attachment and detachment of the body and wire rope if the normal of the contact force is positive it means that the wire rope exerts a force on the body and the wire rope remains attached in the event that the normal of the contact force becomes negative we conclude that the wire rope is no longer exerting force on the body and the wire mergence process is activated 3 1 2 wire mergence through node removal if the normal of the contact force is negative the node is removed and the wire ropes including the contact node are merged lee et al 2016 the exact opposite applies to the node insertion and wire split processes as the contact node is removed the neighboring nodes of the wire rope are connected as illustrated in fig 10 as previously indicated the wire rope is assumed to be a straight line connecting two nodes ignoring any bends in the wire rope 3 1 3 contact detection as the contact between the wire rope and the body is detected the contact nodes are inserted which split the wire rope the contact detection is composed of a broad phase and a narrow phase see fig 11 to reduce the detection time in the broad phase the intersection between the wire rope and bounding box of the body is checked then if the intersection is detected in the broad phase the narrow phase is activated generally the block model used in the shipbuilding and offshore industries consists of triangular meshes in the narrow phase the intersection between the wire rope and each triangular mesh of the block is checked to find these intersection points general intersection algorithms between a triangle and a straight line can be used accordingly the möller trumbore intersection algorithm möller and trumbore 1997 which is generally known as the fastest algorithm used by lee et al 2016 was adopted provided that the starting point and direction of a straight line line are specified as well as three vertices of a triangular mesh triangle the möller trumbore intersection algorithm calculates the intersection point by using the barycentric coordinates of the triangle see fig 12 the distance t of the intersection points from the origin and the barycentric coordinates u and v can be determined by using eq 8 the solution for the equation can then be obtained using cramer s rule 8 t u v 1 d v 2 v 0 v 1 v 0 t v 1 v 0 v 2 v 0 d v 2 v 0 t t v 1 v 0 d the möller trumbore intersection algorithm finds the intersection between the triangle and the line considering that the line is a ray which is an infinite half straight line with an origin as the wire rope is a finite line in the simulation the intersection is not calculated if the distance t is larger than the length of the wire rope as the block can be represented as a group of triangular meshes all triangles in the mesh group should be verified to determine if they intersect with the wire rope if the intersection points are found the node insertion process is performed 3 1 4 wire split through node insertion as established the intersection points of the wire rope and block are calculated through the contact detection procedure although lee et al 2016 segmented the wire rope at the points of intersection as per the application of the möller trumbore intersection algorithm this does not adequately reflect the actual situation where the wire rope penetrates the body in the numerical simulation time passes in discrete time steps thus the wire rope could penetrate the body as the time increases discretely to solve this problem we calculated the contact point on the edge of the body as presented in fig 13 as depicted in fig 14 the contact node is found as the closest point on the edge from each of the intersection points if the contact node is inserted in the wire rope the constraint equation that represents the wire rope changes to the following equation 9 g q r a r c r c r b l t o t a l 0 where r a and r b are the start and end position vectors of the wire rope and r c is the position vector of the contact node 3 2 wire body sliding model if contact between the wire rope and the body occurs a relative motion between them arises the relative motion occurs in two distinctive ways sliding along the edge and sliding along the wire rope see fig 15 these procedures are also presented briefly by lee et al 2019 and have been improved in this study the sliding motion along the wire rope represents the relative motion wherein the body moves along the length of the wire rope if the block slides down along the wire rope as illustrated in fig 16 the position of the contact node attached to the body changes with time and the wire rope s constraint equation changes accordingly in this case the node is assumed to be fixed to the body and presented as body fixed coordinates therefore the position of the node is automatically updated at each time interval as the position of the body is changed in addition if the wire rope slides along the edge of the body the position of the contact node relative to the body is changed the local position of the contact node relative to the body should then be updated accordingly in this study the wire rope is modeled as a constraint rather than an object with mass and inertia therefore the dynamic motion of the wire rope cannot be considered and the position of the contact node along the edge should be explicitly calculated when the wire rope is stretched the contact node slides along the edge of the body to keep the total length of the wire rope to a minimum therefore the position of the contact node p is updated to the final point p which is the closest point on the edge from the line connecting neighboring nodes see fig 17 fig 17 shows the sliding motion of the wire rope along the edge from an existing contact node to another however in the case of the final point of the contact node it does not exist on the same edge as the one succeeding it as the contact node moves to the other edge to minimize the length to solve this problem we developed an updated procedure considering this occurrence of the contact node sliding to the other edges fig 18 presents the procedure developed to update the position of the contact node when it slides from one edge to another first the final point p that the contact node moves to is calculated if the final point is located on the edge but at a distance from the vertex the contact node moves to the end of the edge ① in fig 18 the contact node is then segmented into several nodes located at the succeeding edges that share the same vertex ② in fig 18 this represents the intermediate state of the contact nodes subsequently the contact force calculation and node removal procedures were performed for the contact nodes at this intermediate state in summary these intermediate nodes wherein the normal of the contact force is negative are removed the final contact node and the wire rope are then shown in ③ fig 18 3 3 wire body friction model when the body and the wire rope exhibit the relative motion stated above frictional forces are exerted between them accordingly the static and kinematic frictional forces should be calculated 3 3 1 friction along wire rope if a body slides along the length of a wire rope a frictional force is exerted on the body to restrain its motion using the coulomb friction model the frictional force is divided into two namely static and kinematic friction to simulate static friction when sliding motion occurs along the wire rope see fig 19 an additional constraint is applied as follows 10 g s t a i c q l a l a l b l a i n i t i a l l i n i t i a l 0 eq 10 is the static friction constraint that calculates the sliding motion velocity of contact node b considering the extension of the entire wire rope it restrains the contact node s possible sliding motion along the wire rope after the contact node is detected a static constraint is immediately created with this constraint the contact node does not slide along the wire rope and the body is stuck consequently the constraint force eq 11 from the static friction constraint becomes the static frictional force exerted on the contact node and body 11 f s t a t i c g s t a t i c t λ as shown in fig 19 the constraint force is exerted in the opposite direction to stop the sliding motion of the contact node if the constraint force exceeds the maximum static friction force which is obtained from the static frictional coefficient μ s eq 12 the static friction constraint is removed and the kinetic frictional force is exerted 12 f s t a t i c μ s f n o r m a l the kinetic frictional force is calculated by multiplying the kinetic frictional coefficient μ k by the normal force 13 f k i n e t i c μ k f n o r m a l t e μ k f n t e the normal force f n is the constraint force exerted in the direction normal to the body s edge which is calculated using eq 7 vector e t is a unit vector that is the direction of the kinetic frictional force the unit vector has the opposite direction to the body s relative velocity in the tangential plane see fig 20 3 3 2 friction along the edge when the wire rope is sliding along the edge of the body the frictional force is likewise exerted on the contact node the tangential force exerted on the contact node is calculated as the projection of the wire rope tension in the direction of the edge the maximum static friction is then obtained as a product of the normal force at the contact node and the coefficient of static friction t if the tangential force at the contact node is under the maximum static friction the contact node of the wire rope is assumed to be fixed on the body consequently the location of the contact node is then expressed as a constant local vector of the body and fixed on the edge if the tangential force which is a static friction force exceeds the maximum static friction as in eq 12 the contact node starts to slide along the edge as the wire rope is modeled as a constraint in this study and not a mass entity the motion of the contact node with frictional force is approximated according to servin et al 2011 as presented in fig 21 the contact node moves to the desired final point obtained in fig 17 according to a specific ratio the position of the contact node is calculated as follows 14 p n e x t p α μ k p p where p is the final location that minimizes the length of the wire rope and p and p next are the present and next locations of the contact node respectively α is the displacement ratio which is a function of the kinematic friction coefficient the ratio decreases linearly from 1 to 0 as the kinematic friction coefficient increases from 0 to 1 4 verification this section provides a convergence test and several verification examples compared with the analytic solutions to increase the reliability of the proposed methods to verify the interaction algorithm between the wire rope and the body we separated the proposed model into contact friction and sliding models 4 1 convergence test as the contact detection and interaction algorithm strongly depend on the time step the convergence test is performed the simulation results of a numerical test with varying time step sizes are compared and a reasonable range of the time step is provided a simple example is presented in fig 22 a cubic box of length 10 m was dropped from a height of 20 m above the wire rope the weight of the box was assumed to be 1 ton then the values of the z position of the block and the tension of the wire rope during contact are compared with the various time step sizes from 0 001 s to 0 1 s as presented in fig 23 after the box is dropped the box makes contact with the wire rope from 1 75 s to 2 15 s the position of the block and the tension of the wire rope converge as the size of the time step decreases the time at which contact occurs is also different due to the discrete contact detection procedure the minimum z position of the block and the maximum tension of the wire rope with varying time step size in the logarithmic scale is then depicted in fig 24 both the position of the block and the tension of the wire rope converged with a small time step under 0 02 s showing a difference of less than 1 with the result at a time step size of 0 001 in conclusion the reasonable range of time step size was determined to be under 0 02 s 4 2 collision model the collision model includes collision detection wire split force calculation and wire merge procedures to verify such procedures the same example for the convergence test presented in fig 22 is adopted with a time step of 0 01 s 15 m g h 1 m g h 2 1 2 m v 2 2 1 2 k x 2 2 for comparison the analytic solution is calculated from the energy conservation law expressed in eq 15 where h 1 is the height of the box at the initial state h 2 and v 2 are the height and the velocity of the box during contact respectively and x 2 is the elongation length of the wire rope the summation of the potential kinetic and elastic energy of the box and the wire rope during the simulation should remain the same as the initial potential energy assuming there is no loss of energy owing to damping the values of the z position velocity and tension of the wire rope during contact are depicted in fig 25 and fig 26 during contact the wire rope is stretched which increases the duration of the contact time and the contact force induced by the tension is continuously exerted as a result the velocity of the block changes smoothly during the contact time which is shown by the yellow shaded area the box makes contact with the wire rope at 1 75 s which is the same as in the analytic solution the z position of the box has regular oscillations and returns to the initial position after the collision as damping is neglected the tension of the wire rope increases after the collision and reaches a peak at the lowest position of the box the minimum position of the box and the maximum tension of the wire rope are compared with the analytic solution in table 2 the error between the simulation result and the analytic solution was less than 1 for both values the error can occur owing to the option of the 0 01 s discrete time progression during the simulation 4 3 sliding model when a wire rope slides on the body the contact node moves along the edge and splits onto the other edges the algorithm for the sliding process to other edges is required only for the numerical simulation as the body is modeled with triangular meshes in the simulation therefore the same model with different mesh compositions should produce similar results to verify the proposed algorithm we compared the sliding motion of the wire ropes along two identical box models consisting of different mesh sizes see fig 27 although the shape and weight of the models are the same the number of edges for each of the boxes is different the configuration of the simulation is illustrated in fig 28 the box is located 1 m away from the centerline on the y axis therefore as the box is dropped on the wire rope it begins to slide and fall the sliding motion of the box and wire rope is illustrated in fig 29 and fig 30 as shown in fig 29 the box fell onto the wire rope and slipped away from the centerline fig 30 shows the sliding motion of the wire rope along the edge of the box the contact nodes move along the actual edge of the box regardless of the composition of the meshes the motion of the box and the tension of the wire rope are depicted in fig 31 and fig 32 the solid red line is the result of the box model in case 1 and the black dotted line represents the result of case 2 figs 31 and 32 show the y and z positions of the box and the tension of the two wire ropes the tension of the wire ropes increases as the box makes contact with the wire rope and decreases to zero after the block is detached the motion of the box and the tension of the wire ropes were similar in both cases the time of detachment of the box and the wire ropes which depends on the mesh composition of the box and the simulation time step is slightly different owing to the sliding motion of the wire rope to other edges however the composition of the meshes in an identical model had a minimal influence on the sliding motion of the wire ropes and the contact nodes 4 4 friction model the friction model is verified for cases wherein the sliding motion is experienced along the edge of the body or along the wire rope the coulomb friction model was then adopted for the comparison following servin et al 2011 in case 1 the frictional force exerted on the wire rope during sliding along the edge of the body was verified the simplified friction model is shown in fig 33 the comparison experiment involves two boxes that are connected to a wire rope which wraps the long rectangular beam each of the two boxes weighs 10 tons so the sliding motion along the wire rope does not occur the rectangular beam s angle of inclination is 30 and the wire rope connecting the boxes slides down along the long edge of the beam owing to its weight the motion of the wire rope and boxes are illustrated in fig 34 in the coulomb friction model the tangential force exerted on the contact node is mg sinθ μ k cosθ and the acceleration decreases linearly by the kinetic friction coefficient μ k according to eq 16 the stick friction is reached when μ k 0 58 16 a g sin θ 1 μ k sec θ case 2 tests the friction along the wire rope the configuration of the sliding test is illustrated in fig 35 similar to the previous case two boxes are connected to one wire rope wrapping the rectangular beam only this time one of the masses weighs 20 tons while the other one weighs 10 tons in addition the contact node slides along the wire rope the tension of the wire rope without friction is t 2m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 g which yields t 13 33 g in this example if the coulomb friction force is exerted eq 17 is obtained the normal of the contact force is 2 t owing to the 90 turn at the edge 17 t m 1 g 2 t μ k m 1 g m 2 g t 2 t μ k m 2 g where m 1 and m 2 are the weights of the boxes and μ k is the friction coefficient the wire rope stops sliding and reaches stick friction when μ k 0 24 both sides of eq 17 are the magnitude of the vertical acceleration of the boxes the acceleration with no friction is 3 3 m s2 the motion of the boxes is shown in fig 36 in both cases the accelerations of the boxes for different friction coefficients are calculated and compared with the result of the coulomb friction model in the coulomb friction model the friction force is proportional to the friction coefficient and the acceleration decreases linearly as the friction coefficient increases the results are shown in fig 37 the red line represents the result of the proposed method and the black line represents the coulomb friction model in case 2 depicted with a solid line the result of the proposed friction model along the wire rope is identical to the coulomb friction model in contrast the friction model along the edge in case 1 shows a difference from the coulomb friction model such behavior is due to the assumption about the motion along the edge introduced in section 3 2 as the wire rope is modeled as a constraint instead of a flexible body with mass and inertia determining the wire rope s dynamic motion is challenging therefore the wire rope s sliding motion and the effect of the kinetic friction force are approximated using eq 14 these limitations can lead to a marked deviation from the coulomb friction model behavior as demonstrated in the sliding test however the stick slip transition can be simulated properly in both sliding directions and the resultant acceleration shows a tendency similar to that of the coulomb friction model according to the friction coefficient 5 numerical test cases this section presents three test cases to validate the mathematical model for the contact algorithm explained in the previous sections each case includes a body and wire ropes with large spring coefficients which were used to analyze the motion and contact forces 5 1 dropping of a tilted body the contact detection and static friction calculation processes are validated by dropping the tilted body on one wire rope this confirmation exercise is conducted for three cases in cases 1 1 and 1 2 the body is assumed to be a simple cube shaped box and the effect of static friction is investigated in case 1 3 a bunny model which is composed of more complicated meshes is used for the same test in cases 1 1 and 1 2 the motion of a tilted box dropped on the wire rope with and without static friction is compared fig 38 depicts the motion of the box in case 1 1 the box spins in the same place infinitely as there is no friction between the box and the wire rope if static friction is exerted between them as in case 1 2 the torque induced by the static friction force is exerted on the box and the box rotates with the contact node as the center and stops at the end fig 38 shows that the position of the box along the wire rope is unchanged in case 1 1 and moves in the right direction in case 2 2 the same test case is performed with a bunny model of complex meshes consisting of both convex and concave shapes static friction is included in this case the motion of the bunny is illustrated in fig 39 similar to case 1 2 the bunny rotates with a contact node as the center and moves to the end of the wire rope the contact nodes are properly detected along the curved surface of the bunny model 5 2 sliding motion of a body along the wire rope to check the effect of the kinetic friction the motion of the body sliding along the tilted wire rope is compared for two separate cases see fig 40 in the absence of kinetic friction the box slides along the wire rope until the end however in the presence of a kinetic frictional force exerted on the box the sliding speed is reduced over time and stops when it reaches the static friction state 5 3 dropping of a body between wire ropes in the sliding model the contact node is split into several nodes as the wire rope slides onto other edges on the body to test the sliding model two cases are simulated to observe the motion of the contact node and the body the test cases are applied to a body with complex meshes such as a sphere and a bunny model the body is dropped through two wire ropes and the wire ropes slide along the curvature of each body fig 41 presents the results of case 3 1 with a spherical model the figure shows that the contact nodes are created on the sphere as the wire ropes touch the body then the sphere passes through the wire rope and the contact node slides along several edges case 3 2 with a bunny model is shown in fig 42 in this case the contact node moves along the edges in different directions on the bunny model finally the ear of the bunny is caught in a wire rope and then slides down 6 application the block turnover operations using the floating crane and crawler cranes ham et al 2018 li et al 2019 are simulated based on the multibody system dynamics including the proposed interaction algorithm between the body and the wire rope the configuration of the block turnover simulation is shown in fig 43 the floating crane and two crawler cranes simultaneously lift the block on the quay with wire ropes attached to both ends of the block the floating crane has one block loader with four slings and each crawler crane holds the block with three slings the floating crane is moored to the quay and the seabed whereas the crawler cranes are fixed to the ground the mooring lines are modeled with massless springs the properties of the floating barge are summarized in table 3 the principal dimensions of the block are shown in fig 44 the block data were extracted from the ship cad data and converted into triangular mesh data the figure shows that the entire block consists of a number of triangular meshes its weight is 348 tons with a length of 27 m breadth of 34 m and depth of 9 m the turnover operation is completed in three phases as shown in fig 45 both cranes hoist the wire rope up and down to rotate the block to the end position in phase 1 all cranes hoist up the wire rope connected to the hooks to lift the block after lifting the block to a certain height the crawler cranes stop hoisting and the floating crane continues hoisting up to rotate the block furthermore in phase 3 the crawler cranes slowly hoist down the wire ropes until the loads become zero while the floating crane stops hoisting the interferences between the slings of the crawler cranes and the block occur during this phase finally the floating crane holds the block at a 90 rotation the actual operation involves additional procedures to flip over the block 180 but only the three phases stated above are considered in this simulation the simulation cases are performed with different wave conditions as presented in table 4 the test cases are selected by different wave periods and heights in cases 1 3 the interferences between the block and the wire ropes as well as the responses according to wave periods are compared subsequently the results according to the wave height are checked from cases 2 4 and 5 the motion of the block and the wire ropes during the operation in case 2 are presented in fig 46 interferences between the block and the wire ropes occur during phase 3 in every case as shown in fig 47 six contact nodes are created one for each sling of the crawler cranes the contact nodes are inserted into the wire rope and the contact forces are calculated during the simulation the impulsive forces during contact are calculated from the tension of the wire ropes and the normal of the edges at the contact points as explained in section 1 in case 5 which has the maximum wave height the sliding of the contact points occurs owing to the motion of the block induced by a wave this is presented in fig 48 the contact forces exerted on the block during the simulation are calculated and depicted in fig 49 and fig 50 further the contact forces exerted on six contact nodes are presented separately as interferences occur between the block and the wire rope contact forces are generated the contact forces are then reduced to zero as the wire ropes are detached from the body cases 1 2 and 3 have different wave periods leading to differences in the motion of the floating crane as shown in fig 49 the contact time and contact forces are similar at an early stage as the wave height is the same however the contact forces suddenly increase in cases 1 and 2 when the crawler cranes hoist down the wire rope the oscillation of the floating crane increases owing to the change in the block load and the impact is exerted between the block and the wire rope as the attachment and detachment of the wire rope are repeated a sudden increase in the contact force occurs the maximum contact forces exerted on the block are 55 tons 33 tons and 27 tons for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the maximum value of the contact force increases as the wave period decreases owing to resonance the contact forces under different wave heights are likewise obtained in cases 4 and 5 similarly the motion of the floating crane has a large influence on the contact force unlike cases 1 3 the time at which contact is initially detected is changed owing to the different motion amplitudes of the floating crane when compared to case 2 where the wave height is 1 0 m the contact occurs earlier in case 5 as the wave height increases and later in case 4 the impact then occurs in case 5 as the wave height increases resulting in the maximum contact force case 4 with a wave height of 0 5 m shows the lowest value of the maximum contact force that is 24 tons in case 5 the contact force has a maximum value of 108 tons in summary the contact force exerted between the wire rope and the block during the block turnover operations increases with increasing wave height and decreases with increasing wave period in this application 7 conclusions and future work during block erection operations in shipyards interferences between the blocks and the wire ropes often occur possibly resulting in severe damage to prevent such incidents interferences should be verified in advance by physics based simulation in this study we realized the general interaction between the wire rope and the body using the contact sliding and friction models accordingly the constraint based wire rope model is adopted because of its ease of applicability and cost effectiveness in the contact model the contact node was generated by the contact detection algorithm and removed according to the calculated contact force the sliding motion of the contact node was divided into sliding motion along the wire rope on the one hand and sliding motion on the edge of the body on the other the motion of the wire rope and body was subsequently obtained under static and kinetic frictional forces we provided several verification examples that were compared with the analytic solutions to increase the reliability of the proposed models for the application the block turnover operation using two crawler cranes and one floating crane was simulated then the contact forces at every contact node were analyzed under various wave conditions of different wave heights and periods during the simulation six contact nodes were created as the crawler cranes hoist down the wire ropes then it was observed that the contact node slid along the edge of the block as the wave loads were exerted the results revealed that the contact force exerted between the wire rope and the block tends to increase with increasing wave height and decrease with increasing wave period the maximum contact force was 108 tons at a wave height of 2 0 m and a wave period of 10 s the minimum contact force was 24 tons when the wave height was 0 5 m this result proved that the proposed models could be adopted to block erection operations future research will focus on the validation and improvement of the proposed models the interference algorithms between the wire rope and body will be improved by considering the dynamics of the wire rope the proposed model will then be evaluated by comparison with the actual experimental results finally the simulation results will be compared with the actual operations through collaboration with a shipyard to validate and improve the reliability of the proposed model credit authorship

21397,a model for the stiffness degradation coefficient of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments is established the spatial variability of the modulus of elasticity of soil is obtained by the centre point method a probabilistic analysis of the behaviour of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments is conducted based on the proposed stiffness degradation coefficient the influences of significant factors on the failure probability under the failure criterion for the bending moment and lateral displacement are determined the results show that the failure probability remains constant in the period of corrosion initiation under the two failure criteria then the failure probability increases with the increase in the service time and the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more sensitive than the failure criterion for the bending moment based on the specific case study the failure probability increases gradually with increasing bending moment vertical load lateral load and autocorrelation length for the same service time the failure probability decreases with increasing modulus of elasticity of the soil and pile concrete keywords laterally loaded piles probabilistic analysis chloride environments soil spatial variability 1 introduction pile foundations in marine environments are vulnerable to chloride attack during their lifetimes the chloride ions in marine environments can penetrate into pile concrete through the action of diffusion when the chloride concentration at the depth of the reinforcement reaches a threshold concentration the reinforcement corrosion is initiated with the progress of steel corrosion the reinforcing steel experiences volume expansion due to the corrosion products when the expansion pressure acting on the concrete cover exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete cracking of the concrete occurs and the pile stiffness decreases thus resulting in the deterioration of the behaviour of pile foundations li and shao 2014 meanwhile under the wave tide and wind loading pile foundations in marine environments can experience large lateral displacements and bending moments pile foundations fail when the lateral displacement or the bending moment exceeds the maximum allowable value the stiffness degradation of a pile due to chloride erosion is a serious threat to the long term safety of pile foundations therefore it is necessary to investigate the behaviour of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments numerous scholars have investigated the behaviour of laterally loaded piles by experimental analytical and numerical simulation methods jeong et al 2011 yu et al 2018 peng et al 2019 these researches mainly focused on the interaction mechanism of pile and soil the load and displacement curves and the response of laterally loaded piles based on the deterministic analysis method with the development of structural reliability theory the structural responses are evaluated by the reliability method in the engineering field some scholars studied the reliability of piles based on the response surface method tandjiria et al 2000 and monte carlo simulation method jiang et al 2016 the two step hybrid approach and the probabilistic framework were proposed to modify and develop the reliability method and the influences of significant factors on the reliability index and the probability of failure were investigated chan and low 2012 most scholars assumed that the parameters of soil were random variable models for reliability analysis and the spatial variability of soil parameters had significant effect on the behaviour of a geotechnical system hong et al 2020 some scholars introduced the spatial variability of soil into the probabilistic analysis of structures to obtain a more accurate representation of soil in nature niandou and breysse 2007 developed a numerical model of piled raft foundations to describe the effect of the horizontal soil variability on soil structure interaction and analysed the structural response of the system using monte carlo simulations haldar and babu haldar and sivakumar babu 2008 obtained the two dimensional random fields of soil parameters by the centre point method and evaluated the behaviour of piles by the monte carlo simulation method elachachi et al 2012 assumed that there was no correlation between the different soil parameters described the spatial variability of soil parameters by the geostatistical approach and studied the influence of different correlation lengths on the cumulative distribution function haldar and basu 2013 proposed a new method for the analysis of flexible foundations on spatially random elastic soil and the randomness of the soil young s modulus was modeled using a two dimensional non gaussian homogeneous random field wang and cao 2013 developed an expanded reliability based design approach for drilled shafts with the random field theory to model the inherent spatial variability of soil properties fan et al 2014 proposed a probabilistic approach to evaluate the serviceability performance with the consideration of soil spatial variability in the reliability analysis by using random field modeling damgaard et al 2015 performed the probabilistic analysis on the dynamic behaviour of monopile foundations by considering the influence of random variability of soil properties huang et al 2017 modeled the elastic modulus of soil by the isotropic and horizontally stratified anisotropic random fields and the influence of the randomness of soil stiffness on the tunnel convergence in soft soils was also discussed ching et al 2017 investigated the correlation of the effective young s modulus of a spatial variable soil and any spatial average by modeling the spatially variable young s modulus as a stationary lognormal field guo et al 2019 presented a probabilistic stability analysis of an embankment dam considering soil spatial variabilities leung and lo

parameters of soil at different points are different but are also simultaneously correlated and the distribution of the property parameters of soil is nonuniform and random which is referred to as the spatial variability of soil spatial variability is the natural property of soil and even exists in homogeneous soil layers scholars usually use the random field model proposed by vanmarcke 1977 to represent the spatial variability of soil the karhunen loève k l expansion method the centre point method and the covariance decomposition method are often used to discretize the random field to obtain the distribution form of the soil parameters in this paper the modulus of elasticity of soil e s is assumed to be a random variable generated by the lognormal distribution with a mean value of 6000 kn m2 and a coefficient of variation of 0 1 haldar and sivakumar babu 2008 su et al 2018 in view of the vertical spatial variability of soil the centre point approach is applied to discretize the random field and obtain the parameter distribution by using the autocorrelation function it is difficult to fit the actual and complicated autocorrelation function of the soil because the field measured data of soil are limited therefore scholars have chosen to use a theoretical autocorrelation function to describe the spatial variability of soil parameters the random field e 1 is assumed to follow the standard normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of 1 then the one dimensional exponential autocorrelation function ρ τ can be expressed as cao and wang 2013 11 ρ τ exp 2 τ l where τ z i z j represents the absolute distance between any two points in the random field z i is the depth of the soil elements and l is the autocorrelation length in the vertical direction which represents the minimum distance between any two uncorrelated points in the soil because the field measured data of soil are limited it is assumed that l 4 m in the vertical direction wang and cao 2013 the correlation coefficient matrix between soil units u is expressed as follows 12 u ρ 11 ρ 1 m ρ m 1 ρ m m where m is the number of discrete units and m 100 in this paper u is a real

variability of soil is shown in fig 1 4 probabilistic analysis 4 1 performance functions the displacement governing equation of the pile can be represented as 19 e i d 4 y d z 4 k y 0 where ei is the bending stiffness of the pile ei 0 85e c i i is the moment of inertia of the pile section and k is the subgrade reaction modulus kn m2 where k k h d d is the pile diameter mm and k h is the subgrade reaction coefficient kn m3 y is the lateral displacement of the pile shaft and z is the depth m defining v s as the poisson s coefficient of the soil the value of subgrade reaction coefficient k h can be determined by poulos and davis 1980 20 k h 0 65 d e s d 4 e i 12 e s 1 v s 2 the pile head is assumed to be free and the subgrade soil is soft clay eq 19 can be rewritten by the finite difference form 21 e i y i 2 4 y i 1 6 y i 4 y i 1 y i 2 d h 4 k hi d y i 0 where k hi is the subgrade reaction coefficient at node i kn m3 the deflection of the pile has the following relationship with the bending moment 22 m e i d 2 y d z 2 the bending moment of the pile head is obtained by 23 y 2 2 y 1 y 1 m l p e i n 3 the bending stiffness of the corroded piles can be modified by introducing the degradation coefficient and is expressed as 24 e p i p η e i where e p i p is the pile stiffness after corrosion the finite difference process is programmed in matlab the differential step is dh l p n where n is the number of elements and the stiffness degradation coefficient is introduced into the finite difference program the finite difference analysis is shown in fig 2 in the probabilistic analysis the maximum bending moment m max reaching the limit level m th and the maximum lateral displacement y max reaching the limit level y th are defined as the failure criteria for the bending moment and lateral displacement respectively the performance functions of these two failure criteria can be expressed as 25 j 1 m th m max 26 j 2 y th y max based on the performance functions the failure probabilities p fm and p fy under the failure criteria for the bending moment and lateral displacement can be calculated by 27 p f m p m j 1 0 28 p f y p y j 2 0 in this section the randomness of the parameters refers to the random number matrix generated by the lateral load h 0 the bending moment m 0 the modulus of elasticity of soil e s and pile concrete e c considering the randomness of the parameters the reliability of the behaviour of laterally loaded piles is analysed by the monte carlo simulation method with a sample size of 104 in this analysis it is assumed that m th is equal to 1088 kn m haldar and sivakumar babu 2008 and y th is equal to 100 mm chan and low 2009 because the analysis involves a random simulation and differential processes the code is optimized to shorten the running time of the matlab program 4 2 stiffness degradation coefficient the parameter values used for the stiffness degradation coefficient are shown in table 1 the time dependent stiffness degradation coefficient is shown in fig 3 the degradation coefficient remains constant in the 18 year period of corrosion initiation afterwards the degradation coefficient decreases slightly as the service time increases in this process though the reinforcing steel has corroded the pile concrete has not cracked thus the pile stiffness slowly decreases after the service time reaches 25 years cracking of the pile concrete occurs and the degradation coefficient decreases rapidly with increasing service time after 45 0 years the reduction speed of the degradation coefficient slows down the degradation coefficient decreases to 0 57 and 0 48 for service times of 50 years and 90 years respectively 4 3 time dependent behaviour the time dependent behaviour of laterally loaded piles is analysed in this section the parameter values used in the analysis are presented in table 2 the bending moment of the pile shaft for different service times is presented in fig 4 the maximum bending moment appears at a position of approximately 2 0 m and increases gradually with increasing service time the maximum bending moment increases from 750 7 kn m to 799 9 kn m as the service time increases from 20 years to 80 years the negative bending moment appears at depths below 9 0 m the maximum negative bending moment increases and the position where it appears gradually moves upwards with increasing service time the lateral displacement of the pile shaft for different service times is shown in fig 5 the maximum lateral displacement increases from 73 2 mm to 102 3 mm as the service time increases from 20 years to 80 years therefore with increasing service time the lateral displacement is more likely to surpass the ultimate lateral displacement thus leading to the failure of the pile foundation 4 4 time dependent failure probability the parameter values used in the probabilistic analysis are shown in table 3 the failure probabilities of the laterally loaded piles under two failure criteria are given in fig 6 it can be observed that the curve of the failure probability appears to suddenly change the failure probability remains constant during the period of corrosion initiation under the two failure criteria and then the failure probability increases with increasing service time the failure probability under the failure criteria for the bending moment and lateral displacement reaches 0 01 and 0 68 for the service time of 90 years the growth rate of the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is much faster than that under the failure criterion for the bending moment therefore with increasing service time the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more sensitive than the failure criterion for the bending moment based on the specific case study in this paper therefore the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more suitable as the criterion for determining the failure of laterally loaded piles 4 5 parametric analysis the effect of the bending moment on the failure probability is shown in fig 7 the failure probability increases gradually with increasing bending moment for a given service time specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 06 to 0 40 from 0 13 to 0 57 and from 0 58 to 0 94 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the bending moment increases from 480 kn m to 760 kn m the failure probability increases significantly with increasing service time due to the degradation of the pile stiffness specifically for the bending moment of 600 kn m the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 16 to 0 29 and from 0 18 to 0 79 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the effect of the lateral load on the failure probability is given in fig 8 the failure probability increases gradually as the lateral load increases this can be explained that increasing the lateral load generates a larger lateral displacement at the pile head specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 22 to 0 86 from 0 32 to 0 90 and from 0 73 to 0 97 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the lateral load increases from 260 kn to 440 kn for the lateral load of 360 kn the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 39 to 0 46 and from 0 68 to 0 94 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the influence of the vertical load on the failure probability is given in fig 9 the failure probability increases gradually with increasing vertical load for a given service time specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 02 to 0 40 from 0 04 to 0 58 and from 0 32 to 0 96 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the vertical load increases from 5500 kn to 10 000 kn the difference in the failure probability tends to increase as the service time increases for the same vertical load specifically for the vertical load of 10 000 kn the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 29 to 0 80 and from 0 40 to 0 96 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the effect of the modulus of elasticity of the pile concrete on the failure probability is given in fig 10 the failure probability reduces quickly with the increase in modulus of elasticity of the pile concrete increasing the modulus of elasticity leads to the increase of the pile stiffness thus resulting in a reduction in the maximum displacement and bending moment of the pile shaft the failure probability increases gradually with increasing service time for the same elastic modulus of the pile concrete this is because the pile stiffness decreases with increasing service time thus resulting in an increase in the displacement and bending moment the effect of the modulus of elasticity of soil around the pile on the failure probability is shown in fig 11 the failure probability decreases dramatically with the increase in the modulus of elasticity of soil thus increasing the modulus of elasticity of soil by common foundation treatment methods is a very effective way to enhance the service safety of laterally loaded piles the curves of the failure probability are tortuous because the elastic modulus of the soil experiences an abrupt change and randomness when the spatial variability of the soil is considered the random field of the modulus of elasticity of soil around the pile in the vertical direction for different autocorrelation lengths is shown in fig 12 the spatial variability of modulus of elasticity of soil decreases with increasing autocorrelation length the influence of the autocorrelation length on the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is shown in fig 13 the failure probability increases with increasing autocorrelation length for the same service time this is because the correlation among the soil units increases with the increase in the correlation distance when the autocorrelation length of the soil is infinite the soil units in the random field are completely correlated and can be regarded as a random variable model therefore it is obvious that the estimation of the failure probability by the random variable method is more conservative than the estimation taking into account the spatial variability of soil 5 conclusions in this paper a model for the stiffness degradation coefficient of a pile in chloride environments is established taking into account the spatial variability of soil the random field of the modulus of elasticity of soil is obtained by the centre point method a probabilistic analysis of the behaviour of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments is conducted based on the stiffness degradation coefficient the influences of significant factors on the failure probability under the failure criterion for the bending moment and lateral displacement are determined the results show that the pile stiffness decreases gradually with increasing service time the failure probability remains constant in the period of corrosion initiation under the two failure criteria then the failure probability increases with increasing service time and the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more sensitive than the failure criterion for the bending moment based on the specific case study in this paper the failure probability increases gradually with increasing bending moment vertical load and lateral load for the same service time the failure probability decreases with increasing modulus of elasticity of the soil and pile concrete the

piles probabilistic analysis chloride environments soil spatial variability 1 introduction pile foundations in marine environments are vulnerable to chloride attack during their lifetimes the chloride ions in marine environments can penetrate into pile concrete through the action of diffusion when the chloride concentration at the depth of the reinforcement reaches a threshold concentration the reinforcement corrosion is initiated with the progress of steel corrosion the reinforcing steel experiences volume expansion due to the corrosion products when the expansion pressure acting on the concrete cover exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete cracking of the concrete occurs and the pile stiffness decreases thus resulting in the deterioration of the behaviour of pile foundations li and shao 2014 meanwhile under the wave tide and wind loading pile foundations in marine environments can experience large lateral displacements and bending moments pile foundations fail when the lateral displacement or the bending moment exceeds the maximum allowable value the stiffness degradation of a pile due to chloride erosion is a serious threat to the long term safety of pile foundations therefore it is necessary to investigate the behaviour of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments numerous scholars have investigated the behaviour of laterally loaded piles by experimental analytical and numerical simulation methods jeong et al 2011 yu et al 2018 peng et al 2019 these researches mainly focused on the interaction mechanism of pile and soil the load and displacement curves and the response of laterally loaded piles based on the deterministic analysis method with the development of structural reliability theory the structural responses are evaluated by the reliability method in the engineering field some scholars studied the reliability of piles based on the response surface method tandjiria et al 2000 and monte carlo simulation method jiang et al 2016 the two step hybrid approach and the probabilistic framework were proposed to modify and develop the reliability method and the influences of significant factors on the reliability index and the probability of failure were investigated chan and low 2012 most scholars assumed that the parameters of soil were random variable models for reliability analysis and the spatial variability of soil parameters had significant effect on the behaviour of a geotechnical system hong et al 2020 some scholars introduced the spatial variability of soil into the probabilistic analysis of structures to obtain a more accurate representation of soil in nature niandou and breysse 2007 developed a numerical model of piled raft foundations to describe the effect of the horizontal soil variability on soil structure interaction and analysed the structural response of the system using monte carlo simulations haldar and babu haldar and sivakumar babu 2008 obtained the two dimensional random fields of soil parameters by the centre point method and evaluated the behaviour of piles by the monte carlo simulation method elachachi et al 2012 assumed that there was no correlation between the different soil parameters described the spatial variability of soil parameters by the geostatistical approach and studied the influence of different correlation lengths on the cumulative distribution function haldar and basu 2013 proposed a new method for the analysis of flexible foundations on spatially random elastic soil and the randomness of the soil young s modulus was modeled using a two dimensional

moment and lateral displacement respectively the performance functions of these two failure criteria can be expressed as 25 j 1 m th m max 26 j 2 y th y max based on the performance functions the failure probabilities p fm and p fy under the failure criteria for the bending moment and lateral displacement can be calculated by 27 p f m p m j 1 0 28 p f y p y j 2 0 in this section the randomness of the parameters refers to the random number matrix generated by the lateral load h 0 the bending moment m 0 the modulus of elasticity of soil e s and pile concrete e c considering the randomness of the parameters the reliability of the behaviour of laterally loaded piles is analysed by the monte carlo simulation method with a sample size of 104 in this analysis it is assumed that m th is equal to 1088 kn m haldar and sivakumar babu 2008 and y th is equal to 100 mm chan and low 2009 because the analysis involves a random simulation and differential processes the code is optimized to shorten the running time of the matlab program 4 2 stiffness degradation coefficient the parameter values used for the stiffness degradation coefficient are shown in table 1 the time dependent stiffness degradation coefficient is shown in fig 3 the degradation coefficient remains constant in the 18 year period of corrosion initiation afterwards the degradation coefficient decreases slightly as the service time increases in this process though the reinforcing steel has corroded the pile concrete has not cracked thus the pile stiffness slowly decreases after the service time reaches 25 years cracking of the pile concrete occurs and the degradation coefficient decreases rapidly with increasing service time after 45 0 years the reduction speed of the degradation coefficient slows down the degradation coefficient decreases to 0 57 and 0 48 for service times of 50 years and 90 years respectively 4 3 time dependent behaviour the time dependent behaviour of laterally loaded piles is analysed in this section the parameter values used in the analysis are presented in table 2 the bending moment of the pile shaft for different service times is presented in fig 4 the maximum bending moment appears at a position of approximately 2 0 m and increases gradually with increasing service time the maximum bending moment increases from 750 7 kn m to 799 9 kn m as the service time increases from 20 years to 80 years the negative bending moment appears at depths below 9 0 m the maximum negative bending moment increases and the position where it appears gradually moves upwards with increasing service time the lateral displacement of the pile shaft for different service times is shown in fig 5 the maximum lateral displacement increases from 73 2 mm to 102 3 mm as the service time increases from 20 years to 80 years therefore with increasing service time the lateral displacement is more likely to surpass the ultimate lateral displacement thus leading to the failure of the pile foundation 4 4 time dependent failure probability the parameter values used in the probabilistic analysis are shown in table 3 the failure probabilities of the laterally loaded piles under two failure criteria are given in fig 6 it can be observed that the curve of the failure probability appears to suddenly change the failure probability remains constant during the period of corrosion initiation under the two failure criteria and then the failure probability increases with increasing service time the failure probability under the failure criteria for the bending moment and lateral displacement reaches 0 01 and 0 68 for the service time of 90 years the growth rate of the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is much faster than that under the failure criterion for the bending moment therefore with increasing service time the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more sensitive than the failure criterion for the bending moment based on the specific case study in this paper therefore the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more suitable as the criterion for determining the failure of laterally loaded piles 4 5 parametric analysis the effect of the bending moment on the failure probability is shown in fig 7 the failure probability increases gradually with increasing bending moment for a given service time specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 06 to 0 40 from 0 13 to 0 57 and from 0 58 to 0 94 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the bending moment increases from 480 kn m to 760 kn m the failure probability increases significantly with increasing service time due to the degradation of the pile stiffness specifically for the bending moment of 600 kn m the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 16 to 0 29 and from 0 18 to 0 79 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the effect of the lateral load on the failure probability is given in fig 8 the failure probability increases gradually as the lateral load increases this can be explained that increasing the lateral load generates a larger lateral displacement at the pile head specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 22 to 0 86 from 0 32 to 0 90 and from 0 73 to 0 97 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the lateral load increases from 260 kn to 440 kn for the lateral load of 360 kn the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 39 to 0 46 and from 0 68 to 0 94 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the influence of the vertical load on the failure probability is given in fig 9 the failure probability increases gradually with increasing vertical load for a given service time specifically the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement increases from 0 02 to 0 40 from 0 04 to 0 58 and from 0 32 to 0 96 for service times of 10 years 30 years and 50 years respectively as the vertical load increases from 5500 kn to 10 000 kn the difference in the failure probability tends to increase as the service time increases for the same vertical load specifically for the vertical load of 10 000 kn the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement and bending moment increases from 0 29 to 0 80 and from 0 40 to 0 96 as the service time increases from 10 years to 50 years the effect of the modulus of elasticity of the pile concrete on the failure probability is given in fig 10 the failure probability reduces quickly with the increase in modulus of elasticity of the pile concrete increasing the modulus of elasticity leads to the increase of the pile stiffness thus resulting in a reduction in the maximum displacement and bending moment of the pile shaft the failure probability increases gradually with increasing service time for the same elastic modulus of the pile concrete this is because the pile stiffness decreases with increasing service time thus resulting in an increase in the displacement and bending moment the effect of the modulus of elasticity of soil around the pile on the failure probability is shown in fig 11 the failure probability decreases dramatically with the increase in the modulus of elasticity of soil thus increasing the modulus of elasticity of soil by common foundation treatment methods is a very effective way to enhance the service safety of laterally loaded piles the curves of the failure probability are tortuous because the elastic modulus of the soil experiences an abrupt change and randomness when the spatial variability of the soil is considered the random field of the modulus of elasticity of soil around the pile in the vertical direction for different autocorrelation lengths is shown in fig 12 the spatial variability of modulus of elasticity of soil decreases with increasing autocorrelation length the influence of the autocorrelation length on the failure probability under the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is shown in fig 13 the failure probability increases with increasing autocorrelation length for the same service time this is because the correlation among the soil units increases with the increase in the correlation distance when the autocorrelation length of the soil is infinite the soil units in the random field are completely correlated and can be regarded as a random variable model therefore it is obvious that the estimation of the failure probability by the random variable method is more conservative than the estimation taking into account the spatial variability of soil 5 conclusions in this paper a model for the stiffness degradation coefficient of a pile in chloride environments is established taking into account the spatial variability of soil the random field of the modulus of elasticity of soil is obtained by the centre point method a probabilistic analysis of the behaviour of laterally loaded piles in chloride environments is conducted based on the stiffness degradation coefficient the influences of significant factors on the failure probability under the failure criterion for the bending moment and lateral displacement are determined the results show that the pile stiffness decreases gradually with increasing service time the failure probability remains constant in the period of corrosion initiation under the two failure criteria then the failure probability increases with increasing service time and the failure criterion for the lateral displacement is more sensitive than the failure criterion for the bending moment based on the specific case study in this paper the failure probability increases gradually with increasing bending moment vertical load and lateral load for the same service time the failure probability decreases with increasing modulus of elasticity of the soil and pile concrete the spatial variability of the elastic modulus of the soil decreases with increasing autocorrelation length the failure probability increases gradually with increasing autocorrelation length for the same service time the evaluation of the failure probability by the random variable method is more conservative than the estimation considering the spatial variability of soil credit authorship contribution

21398,the present study investigates the feasibility of wave energy exploitation along the indian coast using 19 year 2000 2018 hindcasted wave data generated by wavewatch iii with a fine spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution 6 h the wave model is validated against 12 month measured wave data collected at multiple buoy sites and compared with 19 year era5 data across the study area the results show good agreement between model data and the other two datasets the spatio temporal variability analysis of wave energy flux reveals that southern coast of india has the mean wave energy flux ranging from 6 to 10 kw m with a minimum monthly 2 0 seasonal 1 0 and annual 0 2 variability which could be a promising area for future wave energy exploitation a detailed analysis of wave power resource has been discussed for nine hotspot locations which were selected based on the optimum hotspot index geographical restrictions on bathymetry and distance to the shore further each hotspot has been analysed through combined scatter and energy diagrams finally electrical power output is estimated at each hotspot using five wave energy converters and observed that the annual energy production at most of the locations is above 800 mwh with more than 70 availability keywords wave energy wwiii india wave resource assessment wave energy converters 1 introduction over the past few decades global energy demand has escalated due to the increasing population economic expansion and growing transportation international energy agency 2018 an exponential increase of indian share in global energy consumption is anticipated to grow rapidly from 5 in 2016 to 11 in 2040 bp energy economics 2018 as per the paris agreement 2016 on the climate change india has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 33 35 of its gdp before 2030 and increase the share of power generation with low carbon sources to at least 40 of the total generation by 2022 equivalent to 175 gw garg et al 2017 therefore to reduce carbon emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels and to counter the challenge of rising energy demand india has been looking forward to explore new and renewable sources of energy india has the longest coastline of about 7500 km moreover approximately 35 of india s population lives within 100 km range from the coastline centre in this context the extraction of marine renewable energy can be one of the potential alternatives in the near future to meet its fast growing energy demand the ministry of new and renewable energy mnre of government of india estimated the available wave power along the indian coastline as 80 gw which suggests that wave energy can be a suitable choice to increase the fraction of renewable energies and the diversity of energy portfolio the main advantages of ocean wave energy are high power density kim et al 2011 more consistency and close to population settlements behrens et al 2012 the assortment of technologies known as wave energy converters wecs can be used to harness the wave energy for electricity generation researchers and developers suggested several wave energy converters concepts for electricity generation however progress from pre commercial to full scale prototype testing for commercialization of wec has been relatively slow morim et al 2019a it is because of financial risks associated with the variable nature of the wave energy resource and subsequent potential power production performance throughout the expected lifetime of the projects morim et al 2019a mackay et al 2010 precise resource characterization and assessment play an important role to develop strategies for selection of site and suitable wec at that location the wave climate data plays a vital role however acquiring accurate and reliable long term wave climate data is one of the challenging and crucial steps for wave resource assessment a long term wave climate data can be obtained from various sources such as in situ buoy chen et al 2017 wu et al 2015 wave observation from ships yaakob et al 2016 pontes et al 2009 numerical modelling chiu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2012 hughes and heap 2010 liberti et al 2013 and satellite altimeters yaakob et al 2016 goddijn murphy et al 2015 although in situ buoys and observation from ships provide more accurate data it does not provide complete global coverage satellite altimeters provide reliable data with good comprehensive coverage but lack in high temporal resolution because these satellites record wave data once in every few days moreover it has limited accuracy around the land water interface aboobacker et al 2017 in the recent years numerical wave models such as wavewatch iii wwiii aboobacker et al 2017 besio et al 2016a ahn et al 2019 simulating waves nearshore swan lisboa et al 2017 lin et al 2019 morim et al 2016 wave modelling wam foteinis et al 2017 rusu and onea 2017 and mike 21 spectral wave mike 21 sw venugopal and nemalidinne 2015 jadidoleslam and ozger 2016 have become feasible tools for evaluating wave potential primarily due to their ability to produce long term wave hindcasts with high spatial and temporal resolution and suitable sampling bento et al 2018 so far wave resource assessments have been conducted on both global and regional scale by several researchers worldwide on a global scale wave energy is higher above 35 kw m in the north eastern parts of the north atlantic and the pacific oceans reguero et al 2015 the western coast of north america the southern coast of australia chile in south america and the southwest coast of south africa arinaga and cheung 2012 zheng and li 2015 on a regional scale the majority of studies have focused on europe neill et al 2014 neill and hashemi 2013 gonçalves et al 2014a as wave heights are significantly high throughout the year whereas a few studies have been conducted to assess the wave energy in calm and enclosed fully and semi seas such as red sea aboobacker et al 2017 mediterranean sea liberti et al 2013 besio et al 2016a black sea akpinar and kömürcü 2013 rusu 2015 akpınar et al 2017 caspian sea alamian et al 2017 caribbean sea appendini et al 2015 and baltic sea jakimavičius et al 2018 where the magnitude of wave energy is significantly low as compared to the open seas due to limited fetch in recent years a few studies yang et al 2019 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 sanil kumar et al 2013 have been conducted for the assessment of wave resource in the north indian ocean nio particularly along the indian coast yang et al 2019 assessed wind and wave energy resource in the nio based on ten years of model hindcast data and reported that the somalia waters and the arabian sea are the most energy rich areas wave energy flux between 9 and 24 kw m and wind energy density between 350 and 650 w m2 in another study sanil kumar et al sanil kumar and anoop 2015 assessed wave resource assessment along the indian coast and found that the mean annual wave power along the western coast 7 9 11 3 kw m is higher as compared to the eastern coast 2 2 9 9 kw m the wave energy resource shows a clear seasonal pattern with the energetic monsoon 20 kw m along the indian coast sanil kumar and anoop 2015 sanil kumar et al 2013 identification of the best location for wave energy harvesting is an essential step for wave farm development former studies have considered either buoy location wu et al 2015 venugopal and nemalidinne 2015 appendini et al 2015 or site of local maxima based on mean wave power bernardino et al 2017 morim et al 2016 considered various aspects for site selection proximity to the port wave energy magnitude variability and water depth for selection of locations however there is still a lack of precise information and research related to suitable site selection criterion for wave energy harvesting along the indian coast some studies have been conducted for a few locations and assessed the wave resource based on measured data sanil kumar et al 2013 or numerical model output yang et al 2019 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 the limitations of these studies are that analysis is based on a short time period and coarser spatial resolution the model grid resolution plays an important role in obtaining reliable wave energy resource estimation therefore coarser resolution can lead up to 50 uncertainty in wave power estimation besio et al 2016a moreover these studies haven t considered the variability parameters and thresholds for wave energy conversion as a criterion for determining the most appropriate locations along the indian coast a few studies have suggested the selection criteria for energy extraction devices sannasiraj and sundar 2016 suggested the criteria according to site characteristics and regional socio economic conditions in addition to the wave characteristics in another study maurya a et al maurya and singh 2019 proposed the selection of wecs based on annual cost per mw efficiency and relative impact on the surrounding and proposed that the l1 l3 model sweden and sea wave slot cone generator ssg wecs are suitable for indian coast nagababu et al 2018 assessed the performance of five wecs in terms of capacity factor and developed the spatial maps along indian eez exclusive economic zone it was concluded that all selected wecs perform better on the western coast of india these studies maurya and singh 2019 nagababu et al 2018 referenced many devices which are now obsolete and have not been in production for the last many years moreover these studies have not considered device specific applicable depth range because each wec can work only in the specified depth range thus the present study intends to provide comprehensive information on the wave energy resource along the indian coast higher resolution data is obtained by running the wavewatch iii wwiii model for nineteen years 2000 2018 with 0 1 resolution forced by the era interim wind fields provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf the higher resolution data allows us to establish a comprehensive database of wave energy and device performance along the indian coastal region the hindcasted wave dataset is validated using in situ wave data obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois buoys and compared with era5 data recent reanalysis data from ecmwf the results of the numerical model are analysed to estimate the mean wave energy and to measure its temporal wave energy variability both in terms of seasonal and inter annual fluctuations further distance from the shore and bathymetry can impact the cost of transmission cables transportation and reliability of offshore wave energy converter devices therefore to identify the best suitable locations for wave farm an optimum hotspot identifier ohi suggested by kamranzad et al 2017 has been used by considering the geographical restrictions on distance from shore and water depth further the performance of recently developed state of art wecs is analysed and compared at selected optimal locations this paper is structured as follows section 2 covers the study area wave model description with input condition and parameters for the characterisation of wave power in section 3 detailed wave resource analysis is described including the selection of potential sites and estimation of power generation at these locations by applying recently developed wecs finally the main conclusions and remarks are drawn in the last section 2 methodology 2 1 wave model description and model setup in the present study the generation and propagation of waves have been modelled using wavewatch iii wwiii version 4 18 a third generation spectral model developed in the spirit of the wave model wam model at national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa wamdi group t 1988 many researchers have employed wwiii as a successful wind wave hindcast model aboobacker et al 2017 besio et al 2016b alonso et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2014 haces fernandez et al 2018 it is based on the spectral action density equation that allows the model to incorporate large scale wave current interactions mirzaei et al 2014 it solves the action density balance equation for wavenumber direction spectra which in spherical coordinates is given by eq 1 wamdi group t 1988 1 n t 1 cos ϕ ϕ ϕ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where t is time λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave direction n is the wave action density spectrum described in five dimensions λ φ k θ t k is the wavenumber the overdot symbol denotes the wave action propagation speed in λ φ k θ space σ is relative frequency and s is the total of source sink terms in deep water the net source term s consists of three parts s in is wind wave interaction term s nl is non linear wave wave interaction term and s ds is dissipation term in shallow water additional processes have to be considered most notably wave bottom interactions s bot and depth induced breaking s db multi grid model of wwiii is used with two way interaction between the grids the global area is divided into three different nested grids including a global grid 1 1 indian ocean grid 0 5 0 5 and a local grid 0 1 0 1 as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 restricting the higher resolution grid in the study area can increase computational efficiency in the fractional step method tolman and the 2014 different time steps are used as mentioned in table 1 the propagation of the entire solution and interpolation of winds is performed by the global time step δ tg for the spatial and intra spectral propagation δ tp r and δ tk θ are used respectively the integration of the source term is carried by δ ts values of each of these time step in seconds are mentioned in table 1 for all three nested domains the wave spectrum has been discretised into 29 frequencies hemer et al 2017 ranging from 0 0350 to 0 5047 hz while the direction is subdivided into 25 intervals with a 15 degree increment for the source term scheme st4 is used to provide model input and dissipation source function ardhuin et al 2010 the non linear wave wave interactions are modelled using the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 and the joint north sea wave project jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 is considered for bottom friction seemant et al kumar and sharma 2016 observed the performance of wwiii in the indian ocean region with default parameters and found that errors are in the acceptable limits therefore in the present study the same parameters have been assumed for the elaboration of the hindcast era interim wind field global atmospheric reanalysis dataset generated by ecmwf is used as the atmospheric forcing in wwiii model in the present study 19 year hindcasted wind data 2000 2018 with 6 h time step and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution at 10 m height above mean sea level msl has been used dee et al 2011 etopo1 provided by the national geophysical data centre ngdc of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa having a 1 min spatial resolution is considered for the bathymetry data amante and eakins 2009 for the shoreline data global self consistent hierarchical high resolution gshhs database is used wessel and smith 1996 the wwiii output wave parameters in the database are significant wave height hs peak wave period tp energy wave period te mean wave period tm and mean wave direction dm at a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and 6 h temporal resolution the present study is focussed on the indian coastal region which is surrounded by the bay of bengal on the east the arabian sea on the west and the indian ocean on the south the study area is extending from 65 to 90 east longitude and 5 24 north latitude see fig 1 b fig 1 b shows that the western coast has a more extensive shallow region compared to the eastern coast the whole coastal boundary of the indian mainland is shared along with nine states of the country 2 2 statistical comparison to assess the quality of simulated wave parameters quantitatively against in situ buoy measurements and compare with latest reanalysis data error metrics such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si and pearson correlation coefficient r are used these error metrics are calculated by eqn 2 3 4 and 5 hemer et al 2017 2 bias 1 n i 1 n s i m i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 4 si 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 1 n i 1 n s i 5 r i 1 n s i s m i m i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where n represents the number of available observation pair s i is the ith wwiii simulated data value and s is its mean value m i is the ith measured data value and m is its mean value 2 3 estimation of wave energy flux the most significant parameter for wave energy estimation is the wave energy flux the incident wave power per unit width of the propagating wave front for deep water is calculated from significant wave height and wave energy period using the eqn 6 gonçalves et al 2014b 6 p w ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π where the wave energy flux pw is in kw m the density of seawater ρ is taken as 1025 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration taken as 9 81 m s2 hs is in m and te is in s 2 4 temporal variability in wave energy flux temporal variability monthly seasonal and annual of wave energy flux is another significant factor to assess the feasibility of energy resource in general wave energy has a substantial variability throughout the year the long term mean provides an average distribution of wave power which minimizes the variability inconsistencies hence while estimating the power performance of a wec temporal variability has to be considered otherwise it may result in a wrong decision while selecting the location for wec temporal variability coefficients such as monthly variability index mvi and seasonal variability index sv are used to assess the effect of intra annual variability seasonal whereas annual variability index avi is used to assess the inter annual variability the mvi svi and avi are calculated using the eqs 7 8 and 9 sierra et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2018 7 mvi p m max p m min p m e a n 8 svi p s max p s min p m e a n 9 avi p y max p y min p m e a n where p m m a x and p m m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic month respectively p s m a x and p s m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic season respectively p y m a x and p y m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic year respectively and p mean is the mean wave energy flux 2 5 optimum hotspot index with an aim to locate favourable regional hotspots for installing wave power plants along indian eez the wave energy characteristics such as mean wave energy flux the occurrence of exploitable wave energy pw 2 kw m and monthly variability index mvi has been considered the optimum hotspot index ohi is defined as given in eq 10 lin et al 2019 kamranzad et al 2017 10 ohi p mean f mean mvi where pmean is mean wave energy flux and fmean is the frequency of pw exceeding 2 kw m ohi is used to identify the optimal wave farm sites in the present study 2 6 wave energy conversion technologies ocean waves release their energy in different forms such as kinetic and potential energy it can be absorbed through wec wecs produce power based on the local characteristics of the wave energy period and wave height over the past years intense research on wec development has shown a better response under extreme wave conditions and improvements in the efficiency of the device bozzi et al 2014 according to their working principles the wecs are classified into six categories such as point absorbers attenuators oscillating wave surge terminators submerged pressure differential and oscillating water column silva et al 2013 dunnett and wallace 2009 lópez et al 2013 identification of most appropriate wec for a location depends on numerous aspects in the present study five wecs have been used to estimate actual power generation using wave energy these wecs are selected based on the following advanced development phase regardless of commercial use tested under real sea conditions and the power production matrix of the device available in the open literature the device performance amongst listed wec is carried out strictly at the location having bathymetry in the prescribed deployment depth range of that device the details of these wecs including class capacity deployment depth and present status of the development stage are summarized in table 2 the electric power produced by each device is estimated by the respective power matrix of each device provide by the manufacturer refer table a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 in appendix a and bivariate distribution of wave parameters such as hs and te the capacity factor cf is an important parameter to understand the performance of the wecs and the economic feasibility of power generation using a wec cf is calculated using the following equation lisboa et al 2017 11 cf annual energy production kwh nameplate capacity 8760 hrs 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave model validation the model s performance has been evaluated using data obtained from nine buoys shown in fig 1 b maintained by incois wave observations of 2016 collected from five buoys in the arabian sea and four buoys in the bay of bengal have been used for validation the statistical parameters such as bias rmse si and correlation coefficient r have been used for the evaluation as mentioned in section 2 2 since the wave energy period te is not available from the buoy records mean wave period tm measurements are used for validation of the simulated wave period the calculated statistical parameters with the comparison between the measurements and modelled data for hs and tm at each buoy location are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively it is observed that bias is negative for buoys located along the east coast and positive for those located along the west coast the simulated hs values are reasonably well agreement with buoy measurements having a correlation coefficient above 0 9 rmse below 0 5 m and si below 0 4 at the majority of locations negative bias indicates an under prediction tendency of the model in the case of tm the correlation coefficient is observed between 0 6 and 0 7 with rmse and si lower than 1 8 s and 0 3 respectively this variation could be due to the model s inability to correctly representing the long period swells however these values are well within the range of accuracy for hs r 0 7 0 96 rmse 0 2 0 76 m si 0 17 0 55 for tm r 0 5 0 85 rmse 1 2 4 s si 0 14 0 4 reported in the previous studies while validating model data aboobacker et al 2017 ahn et al 2019 besio et al 2016b hemer et al 2017 mentaschi et al 2015 nevertheless the error statistics indicate a reasonable agreement between the model simulations and in situ buoy observations 3 2 comparison of model output with era5 data era5 is recently available and well validated reanalysis data set from ecmwf european centre for mediu 2019 as compared to era interim era5 is produced by using sophisticated modelling and data assimilation systems to combine large quantities of historical observations into global estimates era5 thus shows significant improvement in various aspects relative to era interim mahmoodi et al 2019 this includes higher spatial and temporal resolution improved troposphere better representation of tropical cyclones more consistent sea surface temperatures and sea ice and information on variation in quality over space and time hennermann and giusti 2020 with the view to determine the comparability of model data used in the present study with recent reanalysis data era5 nineteen years model data 2000 2018 of hs tm and dm are compared with era5 data for the entire study area these comparisons are shown with spatial maps as displayed in figs 4 6 it can be noticed from fig 4 that in the offshore region model values of hs are in better agreement with era5 data with a bias between 0 2 and 0 1 m r above 0 9 rmse below 0 05 m and si below 0 05 similarly comparison of tm in the offshore region shows good agreement between model and era5 with a bias between 0 and 1 s r above 0 5 rmse below 2 s and si below 0 2 refer fig 5 furthermore model data agrees satisfactorily with era5 data for dm with a bias between 10 and 10 r above 0 5 rmse below 35 and si below 0 2 refer fig 6 as a whole results from validation studies show good agreement between model and era5 data for most part of the study area 3 3 wave energy resource characterization 3 3 1 spatial distribution of the mean wave energy flux fig 7 represents the spatial distribution of total mean wave energy flux pmean along the indian coast it can be noticed from fig 7 that the pmean varies between 2 and 14 kw m which is in accordance with the previous studies carried by sanil kumar and anoop 2015 and nagababu et al 2018 the west coast is found to be more energetic in terms of pmean observed in the range of 9 12 kw m than that of the east coast 8 kw m this existence of higher wave potential along the west coast might be due to the open exposure to swell coming from the southern indian ocean aboobacker 2017 the southern tip of india has the mean wave energy flux in the range of 6 10 kw m where the effect of refraction and the presence of strong winds prevail in the region the long term average wave energy flux specifies the overall wave potential of that region however for the planning of a wave harvesting project information related to the variation of wave energy flux with season and month is also essential for continuous functioning of wecs the monthly mean of wave energy flux is computed and presented in fig 8 it is observed that july is the most energetic month followed by june and august in a year this is probably since wind speed the main source of waves is maximum during those months christy 2015 the mean wave energy flux escalates up to 32 kw m during july to august along the western coast and attains only half of this value along the southern and eastern coast thus the western coast has high wave energy flux as compared to the eastern coast however during december january and february the southern and eastern coasts are more energetic with energy flux in the range 4 8 kw m than that of western coast 3 kw m fig 9 represents the spatial distribution of seasonal mean wave energy flux during viz winter december january february and march summer april may and june monsoon july august and september and autumn october and november india meteorological department the monsoon is identified as the most energetic season with a magnitude of 32 kw m whereas during winter the wave energy is six times lower in magnitude 5 kw m the peak wave energy flux is concentrated along the western coast in summer and monsoon seasons whereas during winter and autumn this peak energy flux is observed along the southern coastal regions besides it can be observed that mean wave energy flux during the monsoon season along the western side of indian coast is higher of the order 16 32 kw m than the peak value of total mean wave energy flux 12 kw m 3 3 2 temporal variability of wave energy flux resource variability has a significant influence on the cost efficiency of power generation reguero et al 2015 generally location with moderate but stable wave energy is preferable over the same having most energetic and fluctuating wave energy for establishing wave power plant this is because the stable wave energy resource helps to enhance wec s efficiency and performance lópez et al 2013 therefore as described in section 2 4 three indices which include mvi svi and avi have been used to evaluate the variability in wave energy flux during months seasons and years respectively the spatial distribution maps of monthly variability seasonal variability and annual variability are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively lower index value represents insignificant temporal variability and vice versa from fig 10 it can be observed that monthly and seasonal variability ranges from 1 to 4 and 0 5 2 3 respectively however these values are slightly more than the values that are observed in the other region of the world such as the mediterranean sea besio et al 2016a black sea akpınar et al 2017 menorca coastal region gonz 2014 and the western coast of france gonçalves et al 2018 further it can be noticed that the monthly variability of wave energy flux up to 4 is much higher as compared to that of seasonal and annual values this could be due to higher monthly variation of the wind speed in the study area christy 2015 strong monthly variability 3 5 and seasonal variability 2 25 can be noticed along the coasts of gujarat and maharashtra however the annual variability of wave energy flux at these locations is below 0 2 further the coastal regions of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu experience the least variability in months below 1 5 and seasons less than 0 5 however annual variation in wave energy flux is more 0 3 in these regions as compared to other regions finally it can be concluded that the southern coast of india has more stable and energetic wave resource with minimal monthly 2 0 seasonal 1 0 and annual 0 2 variability 3 3 3 frequency of exploitable wave energy it is worth to harvest power from waves if the energy flux is greater than 2 kw m lin et al 2019 aboobacker 2017 thus frequent occurrence of exploitable wave energy pw 2 kw m improves the capacity factor and energy generation reliability of a wave energy converter lin et al 2019 the frequency of exploitable wave energy needs to be considered while selecting a suitable location for a wave power plant owing to this the percentage frequency fmean for pw greater than 2 kw m is evaluated and shown in fig 11 by comparing figs 11 and 7 it can be observed that fmean and pmean have different patterns for instance the coastal region of gujarat and maharashtra has higher mean wave energy flux however the frequency of exploitable wave energy is the lowest 40 70 as compared to other regions in the study area on the other hand the southern coastal region exhibits moderate mean wave energy flux the frequency of pw greater than 2 kw m is maximum 90 in this region following this the offshore region of goa karnataka and kerala exhibit fmean values that vary from 80 to 90 altogether the results show a stable and continuous availability of wave energy resources due to moderate pw and high fmean along the southern coastal region 3 3 4 reliability in wave power delivery understanding the frequency of low wave events is also important to the reliability of wave power delivery hemer et al 2017 because wecs will generate little to no power when low wave event occurs generally for wecs low wave event is considered when hs drops below critical value morim et al 2016 power generation failure thresholds of hs for all wecs included in the present study is 1 m except rm5 producing a few kw power at 0 75 m hs therefore hs value below 1 m is taken as criteria to calculate the mean time between low wave events and mean duration of low wave events hughes and heap 2010 morim et al 2016 spatial map for mean time between low wave events and mean duration of low wave events are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively it is observed that mean time between low wave event is below ten days along the coast of tamil nadu andhra pradesh and odisha including gulf region of gujarat mean time between low wave event above ten days along the coast of maharashtra goa karnataka and kerala indicates the longer duration of power availability however the mean duration of low wave event for these regions is above twenty days shows unavailability of power for a longer duration the southern tip of the indian coast has a short mean duration of low wave event 5 days and long mean time between low wave event 10 days which make it more preferable site for installing wave energy farms in the study area 3 4 wave resource characterization at the hotspots 3 4 1 selection of the hotspot site as discussed in section 2 5 ohi metric is used to identify the best suitable hotspots for wave energy harvesting mean wave power variability and frequency are considered to calculate this metric however wecs considered for installation at any site may depend on economic and environmental factors which include the array of wec devices and associated cabling costs capital expenditures capex and operational expenditure opex models and learning curves which are beyond the scope of the present study by considering equation 10 ohi values are estimated spatially over the study area as shown in fig 14 the maximum value of ohi can occur at the ideal situation i e maximum wave power and frequency and lowest monthly variability it can be noticed from fig 14 that the maximum ohi value range from 5 to 7 are concentrated along the southern coast based on the results discussed in section 3 3 1 although the southern coast is found with moderate wave energy flux ohi values are high in this region due to frequent occurrence of exploitable energy and low mvi the east coast regions of india mainly along tamil nadu and andhra pradesh have an ohi value less than 1 0 which is lower than that of the western coast of india it can be noticed from fig 14 that most favourable regions as per ohi values are either far away from shore or located in the deep ocean it would be costly and complicated to install and maintain wec at these locations further the deployment depth for the majority of wecs is limited up to 100 m presently every country has the right to explore and use marine resources including energy generation within eez nagababu et al 2017 therefore in the present study criteria used for the hotspot identification are the maximum distance from the nearest shoreline is 25 km water depth within 100 m lin et al 2019 and located within indian eez based on these criteria nine hotspot sites are identified for each coastal state considering local maxima of ohi value refer fig 14 the fundamental characteristics of these hotspots viz depth fmean mvi ohi and mean time between and mean duration of hs 1 m along with the minimum maximum and mean values of hs te and pw are shown in table 3 the inter annual variability of wave energy flux during 2000 2018 for hotspot location tn is analysed by whisker box plots as shown in fig 15 and for remaining hotspot locations the reader is suggested to referfig b in appendix b the blue box represents the interquartile range iqr 75 25 of the data of wave energy flux mean and median wave energy flux are shown by green and red line respectively median wave energy flux for all the years remains between 5 to 6 kw m similarly the variability of mean wave flux between 6 to 7 kw m indicates that there is not much variation of wave energy flux with years there are six peaks in 2007 2009 11 2014 and 2017 at location tn according to the oceanic nino index oni el yearsintensities the year 2010 and 2016 were classified as strong el nino years 2002 03 was moderate el nino year 2004 05 and 2012 were weak el nino years 2011 was strong la nino year 2007 08 was moderate la nino year 2000 01 and 2005 06 2009 2013 14 and 2018 were weak la nina years although these features are not well annexed in the annual mean wave energy flux few replications have been noticed monthly variation of the wave energy flux for the hotspot tn is investigated using whisker box plots as shown in fig 16 whisker box plots for other hotspots refer fig c in appendix c according to fig 16 the median wave energy flux represented by the red middle quartile marks is higher 9 kw m during few months of summer june and monsoon july and august and lower 4 kw m during months of winter november december january february and march similarly mean wave energy flux as displayed by green diamond is maximum during june 25 kw m and lowest during february 6 kw m iqr 75 25 of the data of wave energy flux shown by the blue box is maximum 8 12 kw m during energetic months the range of upper and lower whisker mean 1 5 ior indicated by dashed lines is also higher 4 12 kw m during these months june july and august months have lower whisker value above 4 kw m indicates the maximum time power delivery during these months however fluctuations are also higher as compare to other months 3 4 2 combined scatter and energy diagrams information on sea states and wave energy at each location is essential to evaluate the expected power generation capacity from wecs a combined scatter and energy diagrams have been created for all the selected points refer fig 17 it can be noticed from fig 17 that at all the hotspots the most energetic sea states correspond to 1 3 m h and 4 8 s te which are located between the isolines of 2 kw m and 25 kw m further more than 50 kw m wave energy flux is associated with a sea state of 2 3 m h and 6 8 s te having occurrences exceed by 3000 times at hotspot along the west coast gj mh ga and ka at few hotspots gj mh ga ka and ap hs is less than 1 m and the corresponding wave energy flux is less than 2 kw m which is unexploitable for wec on the other hand at kl and or wave sea state 1 2 m h and 6 8 s te is occurring more than 5000 times and contributing wave energy flux exceeds 40 kw m moreover the highest occurrences 8000 of wave sea state with 1 2 m h and 4 8 s te are observed at tn which correspond to wave energy flux up to 50 kw m and can be exploited with any one of the selected wec altogether analysis of these scatter diagrams will help to design efficient wecs at those locations in the future 3 4 3 directional distribution of wave energy certain types of wecs such as terminator and attenuator can generate power only when arranged in a particular direction akpınar et al 2017 hence wave direction needs to be determined at the selected location for the operational feasibility of these types of devices and their optimum arrangement in the layout therefore to examine the directional distribution of wave energy the wave rose diagram is prepared for each hotspot and shown in fig 18 it can be observed that almost 45 of waves come from sw direction with wave energy flux exceed 20 kw m at gj moreover other locations on the west coast mh ga and ka receive more than 20 of waves come from wsw and w direction which transport wave energy flux more than 20 kw m on the other hand at hotspots along the east coast or and wb more than 50 waves are originating from s direction and the majority of them have wave energy flux below 10 kw m however wave orientation at ap split between s and sse direction with more than 30 contribution for hotspot location in the southern coast wave orientation ranging from sw to w direction at kl whereas at tn it is varying between se to e direction on the whole waves at all hotspot spropagating dominantly from the certain direction with wave energy flux exceed 2 kw m which is most suitable for all kind of wecs 3 4 4 electrical power generation typically the electrical power produced by a wec is estimated by the multiplication of occurrences of each wave sea state and the expected power output of the bin provided in the power matrix rusu and onea 2015 2017 bernardino et al 2017 guillou and chapalain 2018b however the size of the energy bins of the power matrix is insufficient for the accurate estimation of annual electric power production therefore in this study electrical power produced by each wec corresponding to each observation is estimated by interpolating the power matrix in both hs and te with a bilinear interpolation method further mean electrical power output is calculated by averaging the 17 years of the dataset at each location and results are presented in table 4 the calculation is performed by assuming zero downtime and zero power output of a wec beyond the upper and lower limits of the power matrix of that device it can be noticed from table 4 that wavedragon produces maximum mean electrical power output up to 900 kw among all the wecs considered in the present study it is due to its higher rated power than other wecs the wecs considered for the present study have different rated capacities and operate on different working principles hence to compare the performance of these devices the capacity factor is calculated by using equation 11 and exhibited in table 4 it can be observed from table 4 that wavestar exhibits maximum cf 17 in shallow water location wb in the intermediate water depth region 20 50 m wavedragon performs better with cf above 11 at ka further locations having water depth above 50 m it can be observed that cf values are significantly higher for oceantec than the rest due to the peak power the maximum and minimum cf for these wecs is 26 6 and 5 5 at kl and or respectively based on the performance of wecs cf the most suitable one for each selected location are recommended as shown in table 5 the annual energy production aep is estimated by multiplying the annual mean power output with the number of hours in a year 8760 h at each location considering a single unit of suggested wec and mentioned in table 5 further the availability of wec to produce electric power over a given duration is estimated in terms of percentage it can be noticed from table 5 that wavedragon can produce maximum aep up to 6125 mwh at gj however the availability of this wec is low 45 at the location among the recommended wecs oceantec has the maximum availability of 92 with 1164 mwh at kl aep at the majority of hotspots is more than 800 mwh except for ap where oceantec generates aep below 400 mwh moreover the availability of wecs at hotspots is more than 70 except for gj and ka at ka wavedragon produces power only 40 of the total time although currently wave power installation target is not specified for india the outcome of this study will assist in establishing additional wave power installation capacity beside the national target of 5 gw offshore wind power installation capacity by 2022 set by ministry of new and renewable energy mnre india ministry of new and ren 2018 further the results of this work will be beneficial in fulfilling the commitment of the paris agreement 2016 about the reduction of carbon emission whilst finding of the present study gives comprehensive information about wave resources along the indian coast there are few limitations of this study model accuracy in the nearshore region is poor which can be improved by refining grid size along the coast and combined model approach wwiii and swan sustainability of any wave energy project will depend on economic factors such as capital cost operational cost and levelised cost of electricity further conflict with other sea activities such as shipping lanes oil and gas platforms fishing and marine protected areas also affect the selection of hotspot location hence these factors need to be taken into consideration in future studies costal sea level dynamics and shoreline stability are mainly affected by wind and waves wind wave combination is also prime disruptors of the marine ecosystem coastal settlements and offshore installations morim et al 2019b multivariate global wind wave climate hs tm dm gets affected in future due to morphologically driven changes hoeke et al 2013 young and ribal 2019 these changes may influence the power output of future offshore wind and wave energy farms the impacts could be further exacerbated when considering directional changes in wave propagation as it is important for the orientation of wec the impacts may be more compounded when directional changes in wave propagation are considered which is critical for wec orientation recent studies have reported that changes in wave climate are detectable approximately 48 of the world s coast is at risk of wave climate change owing to changes in wave parameters annual mean significant wave height mean wave period and wave direction as reported by morim et al 2019b these wave parameters have been projected to contribute approximately 5 15 changes over global ocean regions in another study piyali chowdhury et al 2019 studied climate change impact on wave resource along the indian coast it was observed mean annual significant wave height and mean wave periods are projected to increase along the indian coast further at a few locations maximum wave height is increasing by more than 30 and wave periods are increasing in the range of 10 20 it is sufficient to transform the coastal wave driven processes and their associated vulnerabilities morim et al 2019b 4 conclusion the wave resource assessment along the indian coast has been carried out using hindcasted wave model wwiii for 19 years 2000 2018 to generate wave parameters of high spatial 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution 6 h the comparison of model simulated data and in situ buoy data shows reasonable agreement between these two datasets the wave energy resource in the study region has been characterized by the spatial distribution of mean wave energy flux variability and frequency of exploitable energy the results show moderate wave potential in the study area with peak mean wave energy flux 9 12 kw m is concentrated in the deep water of the western coast eastern coast particularly the coast of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu exhibits the lowest mean wave energy flux 2 4 kw m further monsoon is the most energetic among all four seasons with maximum potential exceeds 30 kw m during june july and august the variability of the wave energy flux is measured in terms of monthly seasonal and annual index it indicates that wave energy flux shows more variation among months and seasons as compared to annual peak monthly 3 5 and seasonal 2 25 variability is observed along the coasts of gujarat and maharashtra further the evaluation of occurrences of exploitable wave energy flux 2 kw m indicates that the southern coastal region experiences the highest frequency of occurrence 90 the southern coast exhibits the maximum ohi value 4 across the study region the most occurring sea state for the majority of locations is hs below 1 m which cannot be exploitable using current wecs majority waves are coming from sw and s direction at the hotspots along the west and east coast respectively wavedragon generates maximum power 851 kw at a hotspot location near karnataka amongst all wecs considered and selected locations however oceantec performs the best with cf value above 26 at the hotspot site near kerala than other wecs based on the cf values oceantec wavedragon and wavestar are recommended for locations fall in 50 100 m 25 50 m and below 25 m depth range respectively subsequently aep estimation for suggested wec at most of the locations is above 800 mwh except ap moreover these devices generate power for more than 70 of the total time at the respective location the outcome of the present study can be useful for planning policy development and site selection decisions for the future wave energy extraction in india moreover it will also contribute to the technological development of wave energy converters and suitability for the indian coastal region credit authorship contribution statement ravi p patel writing original draft

21398,the present study investigates the feasibility of wave energy exploitation along the indian coast using 19 year 2000 2018 hindcasted wave data generated by wavewatch iii with a fine spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution 6 h the wave model is validated against 12 month measured wave data collected at multiple buoy sites and compared with 19 year era5 data across the study area the results show good agreement between model data and the other two datasets the spatio temporal variability analysis of wave energy flux reveals that southern coast of india has the mean wave energy flux ranging from 6 to 10 kw m with a minimum monthly 2 0 seasonal 1 0 and annual 0 2 variability which could be a promising area for future wave energy exploitation a detailed analysis of wave power resource has been discussed for nine hotspot locations which were selected based on the optimum hotspot index geographical restrictions on bathymetry and distance to the shore further each hotspot has been analysed through combined scatter and energy diagrams finally electrical power output is estimated at each hotspot using five wave energy converters and observed that the annual energy production at most of the locations is above 800 mwh with more than 70 availability keywords wave energy wwiii india wave resource assessment wave energy converters 1 introduction over the past few decades global energy demand has escalated due to the increasing population economic expansion and growing transportation international energy agency 2018 an exponential increase of indian share in global energy consumption is anticipated to grow rapidly from 5 in 2016 to 11 in 2040 bp energy economics 2018 as per the paris agreement 2016 on the climate change india has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 33 35 of its gdp before 2030 and increase the share of power generation with low carbon sources to at least 40 of the total generation by 2022 equivalent to 175 gw garg et al 2017 therefore to reduce carbon emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels and to counter the challenge of rising energy demand india has been looking forward to explore new and renewable sources of energy india has the longest coastline of about 7500 km moreover approximately 35 of india s population lives within 100 km range from the coastline centre in this context the extraction of marine renewable energy can be one of the potential alternatives in the near future to meet its fast growing energy demand the ministry of new and renewable energy mnre of government of india estimated the available wave power along the indian coastline as 80 gw which suggests that wave energy can be a suitable choice to increase the fraction of renewable energies and the diversity of energy portfolio the main advantages of ocean wave energy are high power density kim et al 2011 more consistency and close to population settlements behrens et al 2012 the assortment of technologies known as wave energy converters wecs can be used to harness the wave energy for electricity generation researchers and developers suggested several wave energy converters concepts for electricity generation however progress from pre commercial to full scale prototype testing for commercialization of wec has been relatively slow morim et al 2019a it is because of financial risks associated with the variable nature of the wave energy resource and subsequent potential power production performance throughout the expected lifetime of the projects morim et al 2019a mackay et al 2010 precise resource characterization and assessment play an important role to develop strategies for selection of site and suitable wec at that location the wave climate data plays a vital role however acquiring accurate and reliable long term wave climate data is one of the challenging and crucial steps for wave resource assessment a long term wave climate data can be obtained from various sources such as in situ buoy chen et al 2017 wu et al 2015 wave observation from ships yaakob et al 2016 pontes et al 2009 numerical modelling chiu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2012 hughes and heap 2010 liberti et al 2013 and satellite altimeters yaakob et al 2016 goddijn murphy et al 2015 although in situ buoys and observation from ships provide more accurate data it does not provide complete global coverage satellite altimeters provide reliable data with good comprehensive coverage but lack in high temporal resolution because these satellites record wave data once in every few days moreover it has limited accuracy around the land water interface aboobacker et al 2017 in the recent years numerical wave models such as wavewatch iii wwiii aboobacker et al 2017 besio et al 2016a ahn et al 2019 simulating waves nearshore swan lisboa et al 2017 lin et al 2019 morim et al 2016 wave modelling wam foteinis et al 2017 rusu and onea 2017 and mike 21 spectral wave mike 21 sw venugopal and nemalidinne 2015 jadidoleslam and ozger 2016 have become feasible tools for evaluating wave potential primarily due to their ability to produce long term wave hindcasts with high spatial and temporal resolution and suitable sampling bento et al 2018 so far wave resource assessments have been conducted on both global and regional scale by several researchers worldwide on a global scale wave energy is higher above 35 kw m in the north eastern parts of the north atlantic and the pacific oceans reguero et al 2015 the western coast of north america the southern coast of australia chile in south america and the southwest coast of south africa arinaga and cheung 2012 zheng and li 2015 on a regional scale the majority of studies have focused on europe neill et al 2014 neill and hashemi 2013 gonçalves et al 2014a as wave heights are significantly high throughout the year whereas a few studies have been conducted to assess the wave energy in calm and enclosed fully and semi seas such as red sea aboobacker et al 2017 mediterranean sea liberti et al 2013 besio et al 2016a black sea akpinar and kömürcü 2013 rusu 2015 akpınar et al 2017 caspian sea alamian et al 2017 caribbean sea appendini et al 2015 and baltic sea jakimavičius et al 2018 where the magnitude of wave energy is significantly low as compared to the open seas due to limited fetch in recent years a few studies yang et al 2019 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 sanil kumar et al 2013 have been conducted for the assessment of wave resource in the north indian ocean nio particularly along the indian coast yang et al 2019 assessed wind and wave energy resource in the nio based on ten years of model hindcast data and reported that the somalia waters and the arabian sea are the most energy rich areas wave energy flux between 9 and 24 kw m and wind energy density between 350 and 650 w m2 in another study sanil kumar et al sanil kumar and anoop 2015 assessed wave resource assessment along the indian coast and found that the mean annual wave power along the western coast 7 9 11 3 kw m is higher as compared to the eastern coast 2 2 9 9 kw m the wave energy resource shows a clear seasonal pattern with the energetic monsoon 20 kw m along the indian coast sanil kumar and anoop 2015 sanil kumar et al 2013 identification of the best location for wave energy harvesting is an essential step for wave farm development former studies have considered either buoy location wu et al 2015 venugopal and nemalidinne 2015 appendini et al 2015 or site of local maxima based on mean wave power bernardino et al 2017 morim et al 2016 considered various aspects for site selection proximity to the port wave energy magnitude variability and water depth for selection of locations however there is still a lack of precise information and research related to suitable site selection criterion for wave energy harvesting along the indian coast some studies have been conducted for a few locations and assessed the wave resource based on measured data sanil kumar et al 2013 or numerical model output yang et al 2019 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 the limitations of these studies are that analysis is based on a short time period and coarser spatial resolution the model grid resolution plays an important role in obtaining reliable wave energy resource estimation therefore coarser resolution can lead up to 50 uncertainty in wave power estimation besio et al 2016a moreover these studies haven t considered the variability parameters and thresholds for wave energy conversion as a criterion for determining the most appropriate locations along the indian coast a few studies have suggested the selection criteria for energy extraction devices sannasiraj and sundar 2016 suggested the criteria according to site characteristics and regional socio economic conditions in addition to the wave characteristics in another study maurya a et al maurya and singh 2019 proposed the selection of wecs based on annual cost per mw efficiency and relative impact on the surrounding and proposed that the l1 l3 model sweden and sea wave slot cone generator ssg wecs are suitable for indian coast nagababu et al 2018 assessed the performance of five wecs in terms of capacity factor and developed the spatial maps along indian eez exclusive economic zone it was concluded that all selected wecs perform better on the western coast of india these studies maurya and singh 2019 nagababu et al 2018 referenced many devices which are now obsolete and have not been in production for the last many years moreover these studies have not considered device specific applicable depth range because each wec can work only in the specified depth range thus the present study intends to provide comprehensive information on the wave energy resource along the indian coast higher resolution data is obtained by running the wavewatch iii wwiii model for nineteen years 2000 2018 with 0 1 resolution forced by the era interim wind fields provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf the higher resolution data allows us to establish a comprehensive database of wave energy and device performance along the indian coastal region the hindcasted wave dataset is validated using in situ wave data obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois buoys and compared with era5 data recent reanalysis data from ecmwf the results of the numerical model are analysed to estimate the mean wave energy and to measure its temporal wave energy variability both in terms of seasonal and inter annual fluctuations further distance from the shore and bathymetry can impact the cost of transmission cables transportation and reliability of offshore wave energy converter devices therefore to identify the best suitable locations for wave farm an optimum hotspot identifier ohi suggested by kamranzad et al 2017 has been used by considering the geographical restrictions on distance from shore and water depth further the performance of recently developed state of art wecs is analysed and compared at selected optimal locations this paper is structured as follows section 2 covers the study area wave model description with input condition and parameters for the characterisation of wave power in section 3 detailed wave resource analysis is described including the selection of potential sites and estimation of power generation at these locations by applying recently developed wecs finally the main conclusions and remarks are drawn in the last section 2 methodology 2 1 wave model description and model setup in the present study the generation and propagation of waves have been modelled using wavewatch iii wwiii version 4 18 a third generation spectral model developed in the spirit of the wave model wam model at national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa wamdi group t 1988 many researchers have employed wwiii as a successful wind wave hindcast model aboobacker et al 2017 besio et al 2016b alonso et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2014 haces fernandez et al 2018 it is based on the spectral action density equation that allows the model to incorporate large scale wave current interactions mirzaei et al 2014 it solves the action density balance equation for wavenumber direction spectra which in spherical coordinates is given by eq 1 wamdi group t 1988 1 n t 1 cos ϕ ϕ ϕ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where t is time λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave direction n is the wave action density spectrum described in five dimensions λ φ k θ t k is the wavenumber the overdot symbol denotes the wave action propagation speed in λ φ k θ space σ is relative frequency and s is the total of source sink terms in deep water the net source term s consists of three parts s in is wind wave interaction term s nl is non linear wave wave interaction term and s ds is dissipation term in shallow water additional processes have to be considered most notably wave bottom interactions s bot and depth induced breaking s db multi grid model of wwiii is used with two way interaction between the grids the global area is divided into three different nested grids including a global grid 1 1 indian ocean grid 0 5 0 5 and a local grid 0 1 0 1 as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 restricting the higher resolution grid in the study area can increase computational efficiency in the fractional step method tolman and the 2014 different time steps are used as mentioned in table 1 the propagation of the entire solution and interpolation of winds is performed by the global time step δ tg for the spatial and intra spectral propagation δ tp r and δ tk θ are used respectively the integration of the source term is carried by δ ts values of each of these time step in seconds are mentioned in table 1 for all three nested domains the wave spectrum has been discretised into 29 frequencies hemer et al 2017 ranging from 0 0350 to 0 5047 hz while the direction is subdivided into 25 intervals with a 15 degree increment for the source term scheme st4 is used to provide model input and dissipation source function ardhuin et al 2010 the non linear wave wave interactions are modelled using the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 and the joint north sea wave project jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 is considered for bottom friction seemant et al kumar and sharma 2016 observed the performance of wwiii in the indian ocean region with default parameters and found that errors are in the acceptable limits therefore in the present study the same parameters have been assumed for the elaboration of the hindcast era interim wind field global atmospheric reanalysis dataset generated by ecmwf is used as the atmospheric forcing in wwiii model in the present study 19 year hindcasted wind data 2000 2018 with 6 h time step and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution at 10 m height above mean sea level msl has been used dee et al 2011 etopo1 provided by the national geophysical data centre ngdc of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa having a 1 min spatial resolution is considered for the bathymetry data amante and eakins 2009 for the shoreline data global self consistent hierarchical high resolution gshhs database is used wessel and smith 1996 the wwiii output wave parameters in the database are significant wave height hs peak wave period tp energy wave period te mean wave period tm and mean wave direction dm at a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and 6 h temporal resolution the present study is focussed on the indian coastal region which is surrounded by the bay of bengal on the east the arabian sea on the west and the indian ocean on the south the study area is extending from 65 to 90 east longitude and 5 24 north latitude see fig 1 b fig 1 b shows that the western coast has a more extensive shallow region compared to the eastern coast the whole coastal boundary of the indian mainland is shared along with nine states of the country 2 2 statistical comparison to assess the quality of simulated wave parameters quantitatively against in situ buoy measurements and compare with latest reanalysis data error metrics such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si and pearson correlation coefficient r are used these error metrics are calculated by eqn 2 3 4 and 5 hemer et al 2017 2 bias 1 n i 1 n s i m i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 4 si 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 1 n i 1 n s i 5 r i 1 n s i s m i m i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where n represents the number of available observation pair s i is the ith wwiii simulated data value and s is its mean value m i is the ith measured data value and m is its mean value 2 3 estimation of wave energy flux the most significant parameter for wave energy estimation is the wave energy flux the incident wave power per unit width of the propagating wave front for deep water is calculated from significant wave height and wave energy period using the eqn 6 gonçalves et al 2014b 6 p w ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π where the wave energy flux pw is in kw m the density of seawater ρ is taken as 1025 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration taken as 9 81 m s2 hs is in m and te is in s 2 4 temporal variability in wave energy flux temporal variability monthly seasonal and annual of wave energy flux is another significant factor to assess the feasibility of energy resource in general wave energy has a substantial variability throughout the year the long term mean provides an average distribution of wave power which minimizes the variability inconsistencies hence while estimating the power performance of a wec temporal variability has to be considered otherwise it may result in a wrong decision while selecting the location for wec temporal variability coefficients such as monthly variability index mvi and seasonal variability index sv are used to assess the effect of intra annual variability seasonal whereas annual variability index avi is used to assess the inter annual variability the mvi svi and avi are calculated using the eqs 7 8 and 9 sierra et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2018 7 mvi p m max p m min p m e a n 8 svi p s max p s min p m e a n 9 avi p y max p y min p m e a n where p m m a x and p m m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic month respectively p s m a x and p s m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic season respectively p y m a x and p y m i n are the mean wave energy flux of the most and the least energetic year respectively and p mean is the mean wave energy flux 2 5 optimum hotspot index with an aim to locate favourable regional hotspots for installing wave power plants along indian eez the wave energy characteristics such as mean wave energy flux the occurrence of exploitable wave energy pw 2 kw m and monthly variability index mvi has been considered the optimum hotspot index ohi is defined as given in eq 10 lin et al 2019 kamranzad et al 2017 10 ohi p mean f mean mvi where pmean is mean wave energy flux and fmean is the frequency of pw exceeding 2 kw m ohi is used to identify the optimal wave farm sites in the present study 2 6 wave energy conversion technologies ocean waves release their energy in different forms such as kinetic and potential energy it can be absorbed through wec wecs produce power based on the local characteristics of the wave energy period and wave height over the past years intense research on wec development has shown a better response under extreme wave conditions and improvements in the efficiency of the device bozzi et al 2014 according to their working principles the wecs are classified into six categories such as point absorbers attenuators oscillating wave surge terminators submerged pressure differential and oscillating water column silva et al 2013 dunnett and wallace 2009 lópez et al 2013 identification of most appropriate wec for a location depends on numerous aspects in the present study five wecs have been used to estimate actual power generation using wave energy these wecs are selected based on the following advanced development phase regardless of commercial use tested under real sea conditions and the power production matrix of the device available in the open literature the device performance amongst listed wec is carried out strictly at the location having bathymetry in the prescribed deployment depth range of that device the details of these wecs including class capacity deployment depth and present status of the development stage are summarized in table 2 the electric power produced by each device is estimated by the respective power matrix of each device provide by the manufacturer refer table a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 in appendix a and bivariate distribution of wave parameters such as hs and te the capacity factor cf is an important parameter to understand the performance of the wecs and the economic feasibility of power generation using a wec cf is calculated using the following equation lisboa et al 2017 11 cf annual energy production kwh nameplate capacity 8760 hrs 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave model validation the model s performance has been evaluated using data obtained from nine buoys shown in fig 1 b maintained by incois wave observations of 2016 collected from five buoys in the arabian sea and four buoys in the bay of bengal have been used for validation the statistical parameters such as bias rmse si and correlation coefficient r have been used for the evaluation as mentioned in section 2 2 since the wave energy period te is not available from the buoy records mean wave period tm measurements are used for validation of the simulated wave period the calculated statistical parameters with the comparison between the measurements and modelled data for hs and tm at each buoy location are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively it is observed that bias is negative for buoys located along the east coast and positive for those located along the west coast the simulated hs values are reasonably well agreement with buoy measurements having a correlation coefficient above 0 9 rmse below 0 5 m and si below 0 4 at the majority of locations negative bias indicates an under prediction tendency of the model in the case of tm the correlation coefficient is observed between 0 6 and 0 7 with rmse and si lower than 1 8 s and 0 3 respectively this variation could be due to the model s inability to correctly representing the long period swells however these values are well within the range of accuracy for hs r 0 7 0 96 rmse 0 2 0 76 m si 0 17 0 55 for tm r 0 5 0 85 rmse 1 2 4 s si 0 14 0 4 reported in the previous studies while validating model data aboobacker et al 2017 ahn et al 2019 besio et al 2016b hemer et al 2017 mentaschi et al 2015 nevertheless the error statistics indicate a reasonable agreement between the model simulations and in situ buoy observations 3 2 comparison of model output with era5 data era5 is recently available and well validated reanalysis data set from ecmwf european centre for mediu 2019 as compared to era interim era5 is produced by using sophisticated modelling and data assimilation systems to combine large quantities of historical observations into global estimates era5 thus shows significant improvement in various aspects relative to era interim mahmoodi et al 2019 this includes higher spatial and temporal resolution improved troposphere better representation of tropical cyclones more consistent sea surface temperatures and sea ice and information on variation in quality over space and time hennermann and giusti 2020 with the view to determine the comparability of model data used in the present study with recent reanalysis data era5 nineteen years model data 2000 2018 of hs tm and dm are compared with era5 data for the entire study area these comparisons are shown with spatial maps as displayed in figs 4 6 it can be noticed from fig 4 that in the offshore region model values of hs are in better agreement with era5 data with a bias between 0 2 and 0 1 m r above 0 9 rmse below 0 05 m and si below 0 05 similarly comparison of tm in the offshore region shows good agreement between model and era5 with a bias between 0 and 1 s r above 0 5 rmse below 2 s and si below 0 2 refer fig 5 furthermore model data agrees satisfactorily with era5 data for dm with a bias between 10 and 10 r above 0 5 rmse below 35 and si below 0 2 refer fig 6 as a whole results from validation studies show good agreement between model and era5 data for most part of the study area 3 3 wave energy resource characterization 3 3 1 spatial distribution of the mean wave energy flux fig 7 represents the spatial distribution of total mean wave energy flux pmean along the indian coast it can be noticed from fig 7 that the pmean varies between 2 and 14 kw m which is in accordance with the previous studies carried by sanil kumar and anoop 2015 and nagababu et al 2018 the west coast is found to be more energetic in terms of pmean observed in the range of 9 12 kw m than that of the east coast 8 kw m this existence of higher wave potential along the west coast might be due to the open exposure to swell coming from the southern indian ocean aboobacker 2017 the southern tip of india has the mean wave energy flux in the range of 6 10 kw m where the effect of refraction and the presence of strong winds prevail in the region the long term average wave energy flux specifies the overall wave potential of that region however for the planning of a wave harvesting project information related to the variation of wave energy flux with season and month is also essential for continuous functioning of wecs the monthly mean of wave energy flux is computed and presented in fig 8 it is observed that july is the most energetic month followed by june and august in a year this is probably since wind speed the main source of waves is maximum during those months christy 2015 the mean wave energy flux escalates up to 32 kw m during july to august along the western coast and attains only half of this value along the southern and eastern coast thus the western coast has high wave energy flux as compared to the eastern coast however during december january and february the southern and eastern coasts are more energetic with energy flux in the range 4 8 kw m than that of western coast 3 kw m fig 9 represents the spatial distribution of seasonal mean wave energy flux during viz winter december january february and march summer april may and june monsoon july august and september and autumn october and november india meteorological department the monsoon is identified as the most energetic season with a magnitude of 32 kw m whereas during winter the wave energy is six times lower in magnitude 5 kw m the peak wave energy flux is concentrated along the western coast in summer and monsoon seasons whereas during winter and autumn this peak energy flux is observed along the southern coastal regions besides it can be observed that mean wave energy flux during the monsoon season along the western side of indian coast is higher of the order 16 32 kw m than the peak value of total mean wave energy flux 12 kw m 3 3 2 temporal variability of wave energy flux resource variability has a significant influence on the cost efficiency of power generation reguero et al 2015 generally location with moderate but stable wave energy is preferable over the same having most energetic and fluctuating wave energy for establishing wave power plant this is because the stable wave energy resource helps to enhance wec s efficiency and performance lópez et al 2013 therefore as described in section 2 4 three indices which include mvi svi and avi have been used to evaluate the variability in wave energy flux during months seasons and years respectively the spatial distribution maps of monthly variability seasonal variability and annual variability are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively lower index value represents insignificant temporal variability and vice versa from fig 10 it can be observed that monthly and seasonal variability ranges from 1 to 4 and 0 5 2 3 respectively however these values are slightly more than the values that are observed in the other region of the world such as the mediterranean sea besio et al 2016a black sea akpınar et al 2017 menorca coastal region gonz 2014 and the western coast of france gonçalves et al 2018 further it can be noticed that the monthly variability of wave energy flux up to 4 is much higher as compared to that of seasonal and annual values this could be due to higher monthly variation of the wind speed in the study area christy 2015 strong monthly variability 3 5 and seasonal variability 2 25 can be noticed along the coasts of gujarat and maharashtra however the annual variability of wave energy flux at these locations is below 0 2 further the coastal regions of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu experience the least variability in months below 1 5 and seasons less than 0 5 however annual variation in wave energy flux is more 0 3 in these regions as compared to other regions finally it can be concluded that the southern coast of india has more stable and energetic wave resource with minimal monthly 2 0 seasonal 1 0 and annual 0 2 variability 3 3 3 frequency of exploitable wave energy it is worth to harvest power from waves if the energy flux is greater than 2 kw m lin et al 2019 aboobacker 2017 thus frequent occurrence of exploitable wave energy pw 2 kw m improves the capacity factor and energy generation reliability of a wave energy converter lin et al 2019 the frequency of exploitable wave energy needs to be considered while selecting a suitable location for a wave power plant owing to this the percentage frequency fmean for pw greater than 2 kw m is evaluated and shown in fig 11 by comparing figs 11 and 7 it can be observed that fmean and pmean have different patterns for instance the coastal region of gujarat and maharashtra has higher mean wave energy flux however the frequency of exploitable wave energy is the lowest 40 70 as compared to other regions in the study area on the other hand the southern coastal region exhibits moderate mean wave energy flux the frequency of pw greater than 2 kw m is maximum 90 in this region following this the offshore region of goa karnataka and kerala exhibit fmean values that vary from 80 to 90 altogether the results show a stable and continuous availability of wave energy resources due to moderate pw and high fmean along the southern coastal region 3 3 4 reliability in wave power delivery understanding the frequency of low wave events is also important to the reliability of wave power delivery hemer et al 2017 because wecs will generate little to no power when low wave event occurs generally for wecs low wave event is considered when hs drops below critical value morim et al 2016 power generation failure thresholds of hs for all wecs included in the present study is 1 m except rm5 producing a few kw power at 0 75 m hs therefore hs value below 1 m is taken as criteria to calculate the mean time between low wave events and mean duration of low wave events hughes and heap 2010 morim et al 2016 spatial map for mean time between low wave events and mean duration of low wave events are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively it is observed that mean time between low wave event is below ten days along the coast of tamil nadu andhra pradesh and odisha including gulf region of gujarat mean time between low wave event above ten days along the coast of maharashtra goa karnataka and kerala indicates the longer duration of power availability however the mean duration of low wave event for these regions is above twenty days shows unavailability of power for a longer duration the southern tip of the indian coast has a short mean duration of low wave event 5 days and long mean time between low wave event 10 days which make it more preferable site for installing wave energy farms in the study area 3 4 wave resource characterization at the hotspots 3 4 1 selection of the hotspot site as discussed in section 2 5 ohi metric is used to identify the best suitable hotspots for wave energy harvesting mean wave power variability and frequency are considered to calculate this metric however wecs considered for installation at any site may depend on economic and environmental factors which include the array of wec devices and associated cabling costs capital expenditures capex and operational expenditure opex models and learning curves which are beyond the scope of the present study by considering equation 10 ohi values are estimated spatially over the study area as shown in fig 14 the maximum value of ohi can occur at the ideal situation i e maximum wave power and frequency and lowest monthly variability it can be noticed from fig 14 that the maximum ohi value range from 5 to 7 are concentrated along the southern coast based on the results discussed in section 3 3 1 although the southern coast is found with moderate wave energy flux ohi values are high in this region due to frequent occurrence of exploitable energy and low mvi the east coast regions of india mainly along tamil nadu and andhra pradesh have an ohi value less than 1 0 which is lower than that of the western coast of india it can be noticed from fig 14 that most favourable regions as per ohi values are either far away from shore or located in the deep ocean it would be costly and complicated to install and maintain wec at these locations further the deployment depth for the majority of wecs is limited up to 100 m presently every country has the right to explore and use marine resources including energy generation within eez nagababu et al 2017 therefore in the present study criteria used for the hotspot identification are the maximum distance from the nearest shoreline is 25 km water depth within 100 m lin et al 2019 and located within indian eez based on these criteria nine hotspot sites are identified for each coastal state considering local maxima of ohi value refer fig 14 the fundamental characteristics of these hotspots viz depth fmean mvi ohi and mean time between and mean duration of hs 1 m along with the minimum maximum and mean values of hs te and pw are shown in table 3 the inter annual variability of wave energy flux during 2000 2018 for hotspot location tn is analysed by whisker box plots as shown in fig 15 and for remaining hotspot locations the reader is suggested to referfig b in appendix b the blue box represents the interquartile range iqr 75 25 of the data of wave energy flux mean and median wave energy flux are shown by green and red line respectively median wave energy flux for all the years remains between 5 to 6 kw m similarly the variability of mean wave flux between 6 to 7 kw m indicates that there is not much variation of wave energy flux with years there are six peaks in 2007 2009 11 2014 and 2017 at location tn according to the oceanic nino index oni el yearsintensities the year 2010 and 2016 were classified as strong el nino years 2002 03 was moderate el nino year 2004 05 and 2012 were weak el nino years 2011 was strong la nino year 2007 08 was moderate la nino year 2000 01 and 2005 06 2009 2013 14 and 2018 were weak la nina years although these features are not well annexed in the annual mean wave energy flux few replications have been noticed monthly variation of the wave energy flux for the hotspot tn is investigated using whisker box plots as shown in fig 16 whisker box plots for other hotspots refer fig c in appendix c according to fig 16 the median wave energy flux represented by the red middle quartile marks is higher 9 kw m during few months of summer june and monsoon july and august and lower 4 kw m during months of winter november december january february and march similarly mean wave energy flux as displayed by green diamond is maximum during june 25 kw m and lowest during february 6 kw m iqr 75 25 of the data of wave energy flux shown by the blue box is maximum 8 12 kw m during energetic months the range of upper and lower whisker mean 1 5 ior indicated by dashed lines is also higher 4 12 kw m during these months june july and august months have lower whisker value above 4 kw m indicates the maximum time power delivery during these months however fluctuations are also higher as compare to other months 3 4 2 combined scatter and energy diagrams information on sea states and wave energy at each location is essential to evaluate the expected power generation capacity from wecs a combined scatter and energy diagrams have been created for all the selected points refer fig 17 it can be noticed from fig 17 that at all the hotspots the most energetic sea states correspond to 1 3 m h and 4 8 s te which are located between the isolines of 2 kw m and 25 kw m further more than 50 kw m wave energy flux is associated with a sea state of 2 3 m h and 6 8 s te having occurrences exceed by 3000 times at hotspot along the west coast gj mh ga and ka at few hotspots gj mh ga ka and ap hs is less than 1 m and the corresponding wave energy flux is less than 2 kw m which is unexploitable for wec on the other hand at kl and or wave sea state 1 2 m h and 6 8 s te is occurring more than 5000 times and contributing wave energy flux exceeds 40 kw m moreover the highest occurrences 8000 of wave sea state with 1 2 m h and 4 8 s te are observed at tn which correspond to wave energy flux up to 50 kw m and can be exploited with any one of the selected wec altogether analysis of these scatter diagrams will help to design efficient wecs at those locations in the future 3 4 3 directional distribution of wave energy certain types of wecs such as terminator and attenuator can generate power only when arranged in a particular direction akpınar et al 2017 hence wave direction needs to be determined at the selected location for the operational feasibility of these types of devices and their optimum arrangement in the layout therefore to examine the directional distribution of wave energy the wave rose diagram is prepared for each hotspot and shown in fig 18 it can be observed that almost 45 of waves come from sw direction with wave energy flux exceed 20 kw m at gj moreover other locations on the west coast mh ga and ka receive more than 20 of waves come from wsw and w direction which transport wave energy flux more than 20 kw m on the other hand at hotspots along the east coast or and wb more than 50 waves are originating from s direction and the majority of them have wave energy flux below 10 kw m however wave orientation at ap split between s and sse direction with more than 30 contribution for hotspot location in the southern coast wave orientation ranging from sw to w direction at kl whereas at tn it is varying between se to e direction on the whole waves at all hotspot spropagating dominantly from the certain direction with wave energy flux exceed 2 kw m which is most suitable for all kind of wecs 3 4 4 electrical power generation typically the electrical power produced by a wec is estimated by the multiplication of occurrences of each wave sea state and the expected power output of the bin provided in the power matrix rusu and onea 2015 2017 bernardino et al 2017 guillou and chapalain 2018b however the size of the energy bins of the power matrix is insufficient for the accurate estimation of annual electric power production therefore in this study electrical power produced by each wec corresponding to each observation is estimated by interpolating the power matrix in both hs and te with a bilinear interpolation method further mean electrical power output is calculated by averaging the 17 years of the dataset at each location and results are presented in table 4 the calculation is performed by assuming zero downtime and zero power output of a wec beyond the upper and lower limits of the power matrix of that device it can be noticed from table 4 that wavedragon produces maximum mean electrical power output up to 900 kw among all the wecs considered in the present study it is due to its higher rated power than other wecs the wecs considered for the present study have different rated capacities and operate on different working principles hence to compare the performance of these devices the capacity factor is calculated by using equation 11 and exhibited in table 4 it can be observed from table 4 that wavestar exhibits maximum cf 17 in shallow water location wb in the intermediate water depth region 20 50 m wavedragon performs better with cf above 11 at ka further locations having water depth above 50 m it can be observed that cf values are significantly higher for oceantec than the rest due to the peak power the maximum and minimum cf for these wecs is 26 6 and 5 5 at kl and or respectively based on the performance of wecs cf the most suitable one for each selected location are recommended as shown in table 5 the annual energy production aep is estimated by multiplying the annual mean power output with the number of hours in a year 8760 h at each location considering a single unit of suggested wec and mentioned in table 5 further the availability of wec to produce electric power over a given duration is estimated in terms of percentage it can be noticed from table 5 that wavedragon can produce maximum aep up to 6125 mwh at gj however the availability of this wec is low 45 at the location among the recommended wecs oceantec has the maximum availability of 92 with 1164 mwh at kl aep at the majority of hotspots is more than 800 mwh except for ap where oceantec generates aep below 400 mwh moreover the availability of wecs at hotspots is more than 70 except for gj and ka at ka wavedragon produces power only 40 of the total time although currently wave power installation target is not specified for india the outcome of this study will assist in establishing additional wave power installation capacity beside the national target of 5 gw offshore wind power installation capacity by 2022 set by ministry of new and renewable energy mnre india ministry of new and ren 2018 further the results of this work will be beneficial in fulfilling the commitment of the paris agreement 2016 about the reduction of carbon emission whilst finding of the present study gives comprehensive information about wave resources along the indian coast there are few limitations of this study model accuracy in the nearshore region is poor which can be improved by refining grid size along the coast and combined model approach wwiii and swan sustainability of any wave energy project will depend on economic factors such as capital cost operational cost and levelised cost of electricity further conflict with other sea activities such as shipping lanes oil and gas platforms fishing and marine protected areas also affect the selection of hotspot location hence these factors need to be taken into consideration in future studies costal sea level dynamics and shoreline stability are mainly affected by wind and waves wind wave combination is also prime disruptors of the marine ecosystem coastal settlements and offshore installations morim et al 2019b multivariate global wind wave climate hs tm dm gets affected in future due to morphologically driven changes hoeke et al 2013 young and ribal 2019 these changes may influence the power output of future offshore wind and wave energy farms the impacts could be further exacerbated when considering directional changes in wave propagation as it is important for the orientation of wec the impacts may be more compounded when directional changes in wave propagation are considered which is critical for wec orientation recent studies have reported that changes in wave climate are detectable approximately 48 of the world s coast is at risk of wave climate change owing to changes in wave parameters annual mean significant wave height mean wave period and wave direction as reported by morim et al 2019b these wave parameters have been projected to contribute approximately 5 15 changes over global ocean regions in another study piyali chowdhury et al 2019 studied climate change impact on wave resource along the indian coast it was observed mean annual significant wave height and mean wave periods are projected to increase along the indian coast further at a few locations maximum wave height is increasing by more than 30 and wave periods are increasing in the range of 10 20 it is sufficient to transform the coastal wave driven processes and their associated vulnerabilities morim et al 2019b 4 conclusion the wave resource assessment along the indian coast has been carried out using hindcasted wave model wwiii for 19 years 2000 2018 to generate wave parameters of high spatial 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution 6 h the comparison of model simulated data and in situ buoy data shows reasonable agreement between these two datasets the wave energy resource in the study region has been characterized by the spatial distribution of mean wave energy flux variability and frequency of exploitable energy the results show moderate wave potential in the study area with peak mean wave energy flux 9 12 kw m is concentrated in the deep water of the western coast eastern coast particularly the coast of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu exhibits the lowest mean wave energy flux 2 4 kw m further monsoon is the most energetic among all four seasons with maximum potential exceeds 30 kw m during june july and august the variability of the wave energy flux is measured in terms of monthly seasonal and annual index it indicates that wave energy flux shows more variation among months and seasons as compared to annual peak monthly 3 5 and seasonal 2 25 variability is observed along the coasts of gujarat and maharashtra further the evaluation of occurrences of exploitable wave energy flux 2 kw m indicates that the southern coastal region experiences the highest frequency of occurrence 90 the southern coast exhibits the maximum ohi value 4 across the study region the most occurring sea state for the majority of locations is hs below 1 m which cannot be exploitable using current wecs majority waves are coming from sw and s direction at the hotspots along the west and east coast respectively wavedragon generates maximum power 851 kw at a hotspot location near karnataka amongst all wecs considered and selected locations however oceantec performs the best with cf value above 26 at the hotspot site near kerala than other wecs based on the cf values oceantec wavedragon and wavestar are recommended for locations fall in 50 100 m 25 50 m and below 25 m depth range respectively subsequently aep estimation for suggested wec at most of the locations is above 800 mwh except ap moreover these devices generate power for more than 70 of the total time at the respective location the outcome of the present study can be useful for planning policy development and site selection decisions for the future wave energy extraction in india moreover it will also contribute to the technological development of wave energy converters and suitability for the indian coastal region credit authorship contribution statement ravi p patel writing original draft

21399,viscoelastic damping caused by the polymer in flexible risers may not be ignored to the global analysis in deep water but because of its high complexity and non linearity damping value is generally hard to be observed to identify and calculate the loss factor corresponding to viscoelastic damping a theoretical model is developed by means of integration and iteration methods in which the fact that the gap between the adjacent layers changes over time is considered this model also accounts for the effects of continuous temperature distribution in flexible risers case study shows that the gap between metal layer and polymetric layer is easy to appear and its values gradually increase instead of being constant compared with the previous model results this model gives smaller equivalent axial stiffness but greater strain and viscoelastic damping it is also found that the larger loading frequency is the smaller viscoelastic damping is keywords flexible risers viscoelastic damping continuous temperature field structural responses 1 introduction unbonded flexible risers consisting of several steel and polymeric layers are the physical link between the floaters and subsea equipment as the offshore petroleum industry has increasingly moved into deeper field the demand of flexible risers would be increasing even further in the design of flexible risers global analysis plays a pivotal role which aims to a great extent to evaluate the maximum loads allowed to exert on flexible risers during installation normal and abnormal operations besides predicting loads for fatigue life assessment there are many sources of energy dissipation mechanisms in a suspended riser and they should be properly included in global analyses hydrodynamic normal drag and tangential friction forces which are largely dominant vibration damping induced by external vortex and internal flow riser soil interaction at seabed frictional dissipation from the contact between riser and bend stiffener bend stiffener viscoelastic behavior structural damping mainly generated by cyclic bending moment armour wires stick slip behaviour and axisymmetric loads most of those damping source mechanisms have already been effectively integrated into numerous commercial numerical softwares such as orcaflex flexcom and riflex however axial energy dissipation generated by the polymeric layers which have viscoelastic properties on condition of vessel stochastic oscillator is usually disregarded or just estimated as some values in industry as it provides a smaller effect than the others such operation in deep water applications may cause conservative results of the tension forces in the flexible risers top end and then affect the design of the attachments and arrangements on the floaters as mentioned by silveira et al 2011 therefore behavior identification and quantification of the viscoelastic damping of flexible pipes are necessary and important the viscoelastic damping behavior of a flexible riser under axial sinusoidal forces can be characterized by the loss factor χ which is defined as ratio of dissipated energy loss per radian w d 2 π divided by the peak potential or strain energy u ungar and kerwin 1962 1 χ w d 2 π u fig 1 shows a general result for the mechanical behavior of a viscoelastic bar in which the enclosed area denotes the dissipated energy in one cycle while the hatched triangle area corresponds to the peak potential energy hence to pursue the loss factor the structural behavior of flexible riser under axisymmetric loads is required that is the relationship between force and deformation although recent advances in mechanical analysis modeling in flexible pipes have been put forward by means of analytical or numerical methods custódio and vaz 2002 sollund et al 2014 it is still lacking robust tools to generate axial structural damping information for global analysis because of quite a few inherent nonlinear characteristics such as temperature dependent properties of non metallic materials and intermittent boundary conditions caused by gap openings between the adjacent layers as shown in fig 2 given the fact that polymeric layers may directly affect the viscoelastic damping behaviors and the stiffness of flexible risers some studies about viscoelastic analysis have been carried out in the last few years guedes 2010 medina 2008 santos et al 2017 liu and vaz 2016a 2016b presented the viscoelastic responses of flexible risers in both time and frequency domains discussing the influence of axial temperature field on the structural damping and energy dissipation factor but ignored the effect of radial temperature distribution however radial unsteady temperature field distribution greatly affects the performance of polymer materials which in turn affects the structural responses of flexible risers however little information focused on the effect of distributed temperature field on the structural responses in addition regarding the possible appearance of interlayer gaps some previous theoretical models neglected or just assumed it as a specific value at the initial stage instead of using it as a time varying value hence the purpose of this paper is to introduce an upgraded theoretical model for the viscoelastic damping of flexible risers which is based on the method developed previously by liu and vaz 2016b in this model two significant modifications are incorporated to obtain the more accurate structural damping values 1 the effect of the continuous temperature field and 2 the time dependent gap opening closure between adjacent layers furthermore an iterative model solving method is presented consequently the viscoelastic axisymmetric responses of flexible risers under the combined action of axisymmetric loads including stress deformation interlayer clearance and contact pressure can be found in addition solutions provide non linear force elongation relations the slope of which referred as to equivalent axial stiffness characterizes the mechanical behavior of flexible risers the loss factor is then achieved by employing the energy method a case study is carried out to verify the advanced and effectiveness of the model accordingly the gap between metal and non metal layers is revealed and gradually becomes larger over time until stable the equivalent axial stiffness given by this model is smaller than that observed by the previous model furthermore it is shown that for the case study presented in this paper the higher the external load frequency the smaller is the axial strain as well as the viscoelastic damping 2 theoretical model of viscoelastic damping one of the underlying assumptions used in the development of a mathematical model for predicting the axisymmetric behavior is that flexible riser is an assemblage of helical and cylindrical elements consider a cylindrical layer and a helical layer consisting of m wires assembled as shown in fig 3 the wire has a rectangular cross section with area a width w and thickness t and is wound around a cylinder with helical angle α let r and t denote the average radius and the thickness of each layer respectively axially loaded structural components that is components under tensile force f torque moment m internal pressure p i n and external pressure p e x are supposed to undergo homogeneous deformation which contains axial elongation rotational radial and thickness variations several simplifications and assumptions are considered 1 constitutive relationships of the flexible riser materials are homogeneous isotropic 2 flexible riser is described by an axisymmetric geometry and load condition and subjected to small deformations 3 the central axis of the riser is always constant 4 pressures inside and outside do not change along the axial direction 5 interlayer friction is ignored as well as residual stress caused by manufacture 6 carcass and pressure armor layers are simplified and modeled as helical elements 2 1 cylindrical elements the pressure barrier and outer sheath in flexible risers are cylindrical polymeric tubes their material characteristics are related to temperature and loading frequency which can be described by an empirical model composed of springs and dampers in different combinations two of the classic forms are the maxwell model and the kevin voigt models consisting of a spring and a damper in series and in parallel respectively moreover n maxwell elements in parallel are adopted to describe the relaxation modulus e r t and creep modulus e c t in prony series which can be expressed as 2 a e r t e r i 1 n e r i e t τ r i 2 b e c t e c 0 i 1 n e c i e t τ c i herein e r i and τ r i τ ri are respectively the relaxation modulus constant and the corresponding relaxation time measured experimentally similarly e c i and τ c i are the creep modulus constant and the corresponding creep time 2 1 1 viscoelastic constitution the modulus of polymeric material gradually relaxes to an asymptotic value as time grows but the decay duration is often in the order of 1014 s or more the time temperature equivalent method can be evoked to obtain the relaxation modulus curve in which data measured within a finite time is laterally shifted on time axis by a transfer factor α κ corresponding to a specific temperature shaw and macknight 1983 the transfer factor is introduced in the wlf equation williams et al 1955 3 log α κ c 1 κ κ 0 c 2 κ κ 0 hence converted relaxation modulus function at different temperatures is written as 4 e r t κ e r i 1 n e r i e t α κ τ r i where κ is the current temperature κ 0 is the reference temperature c 1 and c 2 are the standard constants usually set as 17 86 and 51 6 k respectively shaw and macknight 1983 for this study values listed in atofina atofina 2002 about material properties of pa11 at different temperatures were used as shown in fig 4 where the modulus of pa11 gradually decays from initial value e r 0 to final value e r over time the modulus datum at 0 c 10 c and 15 c in fig 4 are obtained according to the eq 3 it is seen that the relaxation modulus reduces as temperature increases so the rigidity of polymer layer gradually increases from the inside to the outside meanwhile material properties tend to exhibit viscoelasticity under actual conditions there must be temperature gradients in both radial and axial directions in the riser to simplify the thermal transfer model the circumferential temperature variation is not considered t r suppose that seawater temperature is constant according to the model given by reference su et al 2004 so the temperature distribution along the radial direction on a certain section can be expressed as κ r 5 κ r κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n where κ i n and κ e x respectively refer to innermost and outermost temperatures substituting eq 5 into eq 3 the transfer factor α κ for different radial positions can be given as 6 α κ r exp c 1 κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n κ 0 c 2 κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n κ 0 let eq 6 be substituted into eq 4 and then the modulus distribution function e t r for the polymer layer can be found in addition when viscoelastic material is under sinusoidal excitation its response is not a sinusoidal form since some parameters characterizing the material properties change in time domain meanwhile the mechanical responses are also related to loading frequency the strain responses are at the same frequency as the excitation but there is a certain creep hysteresis and a phase lag angle δ occurs when δ 0 there is no hysteresis between excitation and response the material is completely elastic however when δ 90 the material exhibits an absolute viscous property so the magnitude of δ represents the degree of viscoelasticity for the strain excitation ε 0 sin ω t ε 0 sin ω t whose amplitude is ε 0 ε 0 and frequency is ω ω the stress response of a viscoelastic material can be expressed as σ t σ 0 sin ω t σ t ε 0 sin ω t and the constitutive equation can be described by following wineman et al wineman and rajagopal 2000 7 σ t ε 0 e α 2 e β 2 sin ω t herein e α σ 0 ε 0 cos δ e α σ 0 ε 0 cos δ and e β σ 0 ε 0 sin δ respectively e β δ 0 ε 0 sin δ refer to the energy storage modulus and dissipation modulus and phase lag angle δ is obtained from tan δ e β e α tan δ e β e α 2 1 2 governing equations because of the viscoelasticity of polymeric cylinder elements their mechanical responses are time dependent and the relationships between stress and strain are also related to load frequency so the governing equations of axisymmetric mechanical behaviour of flexible risers cannot be modeled by some mathematical functions in elastic domain cauchy stress can be decomposed into hydrostatic and deviatoric stresses which are related to bulk and shear moduli respectively assuming that the bulk modulus is elastic then shear modulus is the main feature of constitutive equations for linear viscoelastic polymer materials the correspondence principle proposed by wineman and rajagopal 2000 enables the results obtained from the corresponding elastic problems to be transformed into the solution of viscoelastic problems by using laplace transform although the physical shape of objects is invariable when it is transferred to the laplace plane the boundary conditions of traction or displacement can vary spatially for example radial displacement of cylinder is transformed ℑ u r t u r s l u r t u r s transformations for the rest of material parameters such as stress deformation and boundary conditions are almost the same specifically it can be referred to the method presented in liu and vaz 2016a the time domain expression of axial force torque and radial displacement of a viscoelastic cylinder element can be obtained by means of laplace transform and inverse transformation meanwhile substituting modulus distribution function e t r e t r which considers nonlinear radial temperature field of polymer layer let ε x and μ respectively denote the axial strain and poisson ratio and then the axial force is expressed as 8 f z t r i n r e

force on each layer equals to the axial force on the riser the eq 8 and eq 16 are respectively axial forces of cylinder layer and helical wire layer then equation of axial force balance of the entire riser becomes 18 f z t o t a l j 1 q f z c j δ r c j δ t c j ε x j 1 p q f z h j δ r h j ε ϕ ε x the subscripts c and h respectively represent the cylindrical elements and helical wires and j represents the jth layer according to the eq 9 and eq 17 the total torque can be obtained 19 m t o t a l j 1 q m c j ε ϕ j 1 p q m h j δ r h j ε ϕ ε x note that the material characteristics of the adjacent layers are different and cross sections shape of carcass and pressure armour layers are irregular as mentioned before hence when the riser is loaded axially radial deformation of the adjacent layers is not coordinated resulting in interlayer gap the count for flexible riser is j 1 2 p 1 and gap between layer j and j 1 is g j j 1 g j j 1 the relation of geometric deformation is derived 20 δ r j 1 δ r j 1 2 δ t j 1 δ t j g j j 1 the quantity directly related to the occurrence of interlayer gap is contact pressure p e x j p i n j 1 p j j 1 p j j 1 p ex j p in j 1 contact pressure and gap satisfies the relationship 21 i f p j j 1 0 t h e n g j j 1 0 i f g j j 1 0 t h e n p j j 1 0 if g j j 1 0 g j j 1 0 there is no gap between adjacent layers the corresponding contact pressure p j j 1 0 p j j 1 0 if g j j 1 0 g j j 1 0 gap occurs contact pressure is thus zero then gap value needs to be calculated in conclusion interlayer gap g j j 1 g j j 1 and pressure p j j 1 are interrelated variables as shown in fig 5 the two variables cannot be simultaneously unknown that is when one is unknown the other one must be equal to 0 and both are non negative 3 solution process 3 1 solving the theoretical model assume that a flexible riser containing q layers is subjected to axisymmetric loads including axial force f z t o t a l f z total torque m total m total internal pressure p i n r i s e r p in riser external pressure p ex r i s e r p ex riser the number of unknown parameters including force and moment distributions deformations and contact pressures or gap is 5q 1 as listed in the table 1 it is necessary to establish 5q 1 equations to solve the problem processing as above for the force and deformation relations each layer has four equilibrium equations i e eqs 8 9 11 and 12 are for cylindrical layer and eqs 14 17 are for helical wire layer and then 4q equations are summarized there are also two equations for the global loads exerted on the riser i e eqs 18 19 furthermore q 1 equations are related to the assembly conditions i e eq 20 therefore the total number of equations is 5q 1 note that equations of polymer layers contain convolutions to deal with the viscoelasticity and the numerical processing method employed is 22 e r r d ε x η m 0 n ε x m δ e r r n m η here η is the decomposition step of time t and t k η the calculation starts at t 0 when there is assumed no interlayer gap in the first time step 5q 1 unknown parameters can be solved by establishing 5q 1 equations contact pressures are tested p j j 1 0 p j j 1 0 then solution progresses to next time step if any pressure value is negative it indicates that this step needs to be corrected and recalculated then negative values are set as 0 to be known and the gaps of corresponding positions become unknown and then the system is substituted to solve again as described above the calculation is completed cyclically and verified step by step as shown in fig 6 3 2 axial viscoelastic damping the loss factor characterizing the axial viscoelastic damping is expressed in eq 1 in which the potential energy stored energy u and the dissipated energy as heat wd over length l for one cycle of oscillation are respectively given by the following equations 23 a u e a e q 2 ε x 2 l 23 b w d a 0 2 π ω σ i j ε i j d τ d a l where e a e q is the equivalent axial stiffness of the pipe the value of ε x is the amplitude of the axial strain in one cycle a is the transverse section of each polymeric layer over length l 4 case study in this paper the structural responses influenced by radial temperature distribution for a 16 inch flexible riser is explored and the possible interlayer gap is also taken into consideration the flexible riser is comprised of steel and polymer material layers and the heat transfer coefficients of the above two kinds of material have a large difference for detecting viscoelastic response cyclic loading is required so a sinusoidal axial tension is applied to the flexible riser table 2 gives the geometric and material properties of the flexible riser the reason why there are 2 different young s moduli for the inner and the outer polymer sheaths is that 0 13 and 0 53 gpa are the initial and final moduli respectively according to the specific theory and method of calculation referred in reference liu and vaz 2016b fig 7 exhibits the results for the temperature field across the riser thickness for several riser depths temperature on polymer layers i e the pressure barrier layer 2 and external sheath layer 6 changes obviously in the radial direction however water depth has little effect on the temperature distribution so the average temperature in the same place at different water depths is selected in this paper in addition thermal contact resistance between the adjacent layers is also not considered thus temperatures of polymer layers are κ 2 i n 78 8 c t 2 in 78 7659 c and κ 2 e x 44 7 c t 2 ex 44 6574 c for layer 2 κ 6 i n 44 4 c t 6 in 44 4233 c and t 6 ex 4 3394 c κ 6 e x 4 3 c for layer 6 substitution of the average temperature results into eqs 3 5 gives the relaxation modulus distribution of the two polymer layers as shown in fig 8 as the radial temperature decreases the radial distribution of the polymer modulus agrees with both the experimental data atofina 2002 and the modulus results of pa11 in fig 4 in addition along the radial direction the rate at which the modulus decays from the initial value to the final value slows down in which the loading frequency w π 8 rad s axial stiffness of polymeric layer can be equivalent to the slope of the line connecting load strain data to the origin the equivalent stiffness of both pressure barrier and outer sheath shows obvious creep behavior in addition along the radial direction the viscoelastic response of materials gradually approaches to lower temperature results and axial stiffness gradually increases as shown in fig 9 it is worth noting that the stiffness response of the innermost and outermost positions on external sheath clearly differ and this is mainly because after the temperature exceeds 50 c both modulus and its decay rate of pa11 are almost the same even at different temperatures but contrarily the variation of pa11 modulus is very different from 0 c to 50 c fig 10 shows that the viscoelastic performance of pa11 varies with temperature mainly due to two aspects on one hand the difference of lag phase angle the blue line represents axial stiffness of the innermost layer e a e q i n ea eq in and red line is the axial stiffness of the outermost layer e a e q e x ea eq ex both stiffness response and load have a certain phase lag which are δ 6 i n δ 6 in and δ 6 e x δ 6 ex respectively and the phase lag angles differ from each other δ δ δ ex δ i n δ δ δ ex δ in under different load frequency or at different temperatures δ δ δ δ will also be different and specifically expressed as in accordance to eq 7 23 δ δ ω κ tan 1 e e x β ω κ e e x α ω κ tan 1 e i n β ω κ e i n α ω κ on the other hand magnitude of stiffness also varies taking a response period in fig 10 as an example the amplitude change of stiffness at the innermost layer is δ a r i n while that at the outermost one is δ a r e x δ a r ex obviously δ a r i n δ a r e x δ a r in δ a r ex indicating that material at the outermost position on external sheath tends to exhibit viscoelasticity and the more internally the more elastic the material is the axial force acted on each layer structure is shown in fig 11 a compared with other layers the axial force exerted on the tensile armour layers occupies more than 90 of the total and this result is consistent with the practical situation in addition the axial forces carried by polymer layers exhibit significant creep behavior which decreases as time grows further observation as shown in fig 11 b the distributions of axial forces on pressure barrier and external sheath along the diameter are also non uniform which are consistent with the distribution of stiffness and modulus that gradually increases in the radial direction fig 12 a shows the average contact pressure between the layers where no gap exists wherein the value between pressure armour and inner tensile armour is the largest much larger than the rest which is consistent with the main design features however the contact pressure between external sheath and outer tensile armour is zero which means gap appear fig 12 b gives the result of the interlayer gap indicating that the gap between the metal layer and the non metal layer is easy to occur it is observed that as time increases the riser is deformed by force and the gap gradually increases from 2 4 mm to 3 75 mm and exhibits creep behavior like other viscoelastic responses those gap values are so high that it could be measured or even seen however in actual situation it is unlikely to see such large gap formation because of the initial contact pressure generated by fabrication process which is not considered in this model it should be mentioned that the status of annulus between the inner and external sheath are dry during the whole modeling process next consider the responses to a cosine force f z t o t a l t 200 5cos wt kn in the fig 13 a the solutions for polymer materials in elastic domain are respectively the initial value of 530 mpa blue solid line and the final value of 130 mpa red solid line model a liu and vaz 2016a pink solid line ignores both the influence of radial temperature field distribution and the possible interlayer gap on the contrary model b green dotted line is presented in this paper the viscoelastic response results of riser gradually approach the ultimate value elastic model solution from the initial elastic model which show obvious nonlinearity and creep phenomena the equivalent axial stiffness given by the model a is bigger than that calculated by the model b but the strain and loss factor predicted by the model b are larger as shown in fig 13 b the mechanical responses of flexible riser under different loading frequencies are shown in fig 14 it is obvious that under different frequency loadings the maximum value of the axial strain is significantly different and the initial values differ slightly which is consistent with the flexible riser axisymmetric response results of the frequency dominant polymer viscoelasticity as shown in article liu and vaz 2016b moreover compared with the model a previously presented in reference liu and vaz 2016a the loss factors corresponding to viscoelastic damping calculated by model b become large among four loading conditions as shown in fig 15 these results show that both time dependent interlayer gaps and distributed temperature field may have an important influence on viscoelastic damping in forced oscillations 5 conclusion in this paper experimental data are fitted for pa11 material parameters at different temperature conditions by time temperature equivalence principle and then a polymer cylinder mechanical model that considers the radial temperature field is proposed combined with the differential geometry of helix and the theory of curved beams the assembly of cylinder elements and helical elements is formulated and the relationship between contact pressure and interlayer gap is verified the viscoelastic mechanical response of flexible riser coupled with axial symmetric load and deep water ambient temperature fields is predicted consequently the responses of the polymer layer show obvious creep phenomenon meanwhile the distribution of the radial nonlinear temperature field directly affects the material properties resulting in the uneven distribution of the modulus stiffness and bearing capacity of the polymer layer the relationship between interlayer gap and contact pressure is verified by the method of cyclic iteration to ensure that the calculated results are in line with the practical situation furthermore gaps between metal and non metal layers are easy to appear because of their large difference in modulus especially in the conditions of shutting down or outer sheath damage its value is time dependent and gradually increase to some constant compared with previous studies this model considering non uniform radial temperature distribution and interlayer gaps gives higher strain and loss factor but lower axial stiffness which means those two factors may have influence on the structural responses of flexible riser as well as the viscoelastic damping although the difference is not huge more accurate models are helpful for scientific research and engineering applications moreover the loss factor corresponding to viscoelastic damping is affected by the external loading frequency and it decreases with the increase of external load frequency the model is applicable to response prediction of flexible riser containing polymers but the property parameters of different materials need to be measured experimentally in order to improve the model the experiment of temperature influencing the response of flexible riser mechanism needs to be completed and heat loss from interlayer contact should also be considered it should be noted that the viscoelastic properties related to structural damping must affect bend behavior study and fatigue life prediction of flexible risers hence how to add viscoelastic model to the traditional models will be performed in the further credit authorship contribution statement junpeng liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis supervision

21399,viscoelastic damping caused by the polymer in flexible risers may not be ignored to the global analysis in deep water but because of its high complexity and non linearity damping value is generally hard to be observed to identify and calculate the loss factor corresponding to viscoelastic damping a theoretical model is developed by means of integration and iteration methods in which the fact that the gap between the adjacent layers changes over time is considered this model also accounts for the effects of continuous temperature distribution in flexible risers case study shows that the gap between metal layer and polymetric layer is easy to appear and its values gradually increase instead of being constant compared with the previous model results this model gives smaller equivalent axial stiffness but greater strain and viscoelastic damping it is also found that the larger loading frequency is the smaller viscoelastic damping is keywords flexible risers viscoelastic damping continuous temperature field structural responses 1 introduction unbonded flexible risers consisting of several steel and polymeric layers are the physical link between the floaters and subsea

operation in deep water applications may cause conservative results of the tension forces in the flexible risers top end and then affect the design of the attachments and arrangements on the floaters as mentioned by silveira et al 2011 therefore behavior identification and quantification of the viscoelastic damping of flexible pipes are necessary and important the viscoelastic damping behavior of a flexible riser under axial sinusoidal forces can be characterized by the loss factor χ which is defined as ratio of dissipated energy loss per radian w d 2 π divided by the peak potential or strain energy u ungar and kerwin 1962 1 χ w d 2 π u fig 1 shows a general result for the mechanical behavior of a viscoelastic bar in which the enclosed area denotes the dissipated energy in one cycle while the hatched triangle area corresponds to the peak potential energy hence to pursue the loss factor the structural behavior of flexible riser under axisymmetric loads is required that is the relationship between force and deformation although recent advances in mechanical analysis modeling in flexible pipes have been put forward by means of analytical or numerical methods custódio and vaz 2002 sollund et al 2014 it is still lacking robust tools to generate axial structural damping information for global analysis because of quite a few inherent nonlinear characteristics such as temperature dependent properties of non metallic materials and intermittent boundary conditions caused by gap openings between the adjacent layers as shown in fig 2 given the fact that polymeric layers may directly affect the viscoelastic damping behaviors and the stiffness of flexible risers some studies about viscoelastic analysis have been carried out in the last few years guedes 2010 medina 2008 santos et al 2017 liu and vaz 2016a 2016b presented the viscoelastic responses of flexible risers in both time and frequency domains discussing the influence of axial temperature field on the structural damping and energy dissipation factor but ignored the effect of radial temperature distribution however radial unsteady temperature field distribution greatly affects the performance of polymer materials which in turn affects the structural responses of flexible risers however little information focused on the effect of distributed temperature field on the structural responses in addition regarding the possible appearance of interlayer gaps some previous theoretical models neglected or just assumed it as a specific value at the initial stage instead of using it as a time varying value hence the purpose of this paper is to introduce an upgraded theoretical model for the viscoelastic damping of flexible risers which is based on the method developed previously by liu and vaz 2016b in this model two significant modifications are incorporated to obtain the more accurate structural damping values 1 the effect of the continuous temperature field and 2 the time dependent gap opening closure between adjacent layers furthermore an iterative model solving method is presented consequently the viscoelastic axisymmetric responses of flexible risers under the combined action of axisymmetric loads including stress deformation interlayer clearance and contact pressure can be found in addition solutions provide non linear force elongation relations the slope of which referred as to equivalent axial stiffness characterizes the mechanical behavior of flexible risers the loss factor is then achieved by employing the energy method a case study is carried out to verify the advanced and effectiveness of the model accordingly the gap between metal and non metal layers is revealed and gradually becomes larger over time until stable the equivalent axial stiffness given by this model is smaller than that observed by the previous model furthermore it is shown that for the case study presented in this paper the higher the external load frequency the smaller is the axial strain as well as the viscoelastic damping 2 theoretical model of viscoelastic damping one of the underlying assumptions used in the development of a mathematical model for predicting the axisymmetric behavior is that flexible riser is an assemblage of helical and cylindrical elements consider a cylindrical layer and a helical layer consisting of m wires assembled as shown in fig 3 the wire has a rectangular cross section with area a width w and thickness t and is wound around a cylinder with helical angle α let r and t denote the average radius and the thickness of each layer respectively axially loaded structural components that is components under tensile force f torque moment m internal pressure p i n and external pressure p e x are supposed to undergo homogeneous deformation which contains axial elongation rotational radial and thickness variations several simplifications and assumptions are considered 1 constitutive relationships of the flexible riser materials are homogeneous isotropic 2 flexible riser is described by an axisymmetric geometry and load condition and subjected to small deformations 3 the central axis of the riser is always constant 4 pressures inside and outside do not change along the axial direction 5 interlayer friction is ignored as well as residual stress caused by manufacture 6 carcass and pressure armor layers are simplified and modeled as helical elements 2 1 cylindrical elements the pressure barrier and outer sheath in flexible risers are cylindrical polymeric tubes their material characteristics are related to temperature and loading frequency which can be described by an empirical model composed of springs and dampers in different combinations two of the classic forms are the maxwell model and the kevin voigt models consisting of a spring and a damper in series and in parallel respectively moreover n maxwell elements in parallel are adopted to describe the relaxation modulus e r t and creep modulus e c t in prony series which can be expressed as 2 a e r t e r i 1 n e r i e t τ r i 2 b e c t e c 0 i 1 n e c i e t τ c i herein e r i and τ r i τ ri are respectively the relaxation modulus constant and the corresponding relaxation time measured experimentally similarly e c i and τ c i are the creep modulus constant and the corresponding creep time 2 1 1 viscoelastic constitution the modulus of polymeric material gradually relaxes to an asymptotic value as time grows but the decay duration is often in the order of 1014 s or more the time temperature equivalent method can be evoked to obtain the relaxation modulus curve in which data measured within a finite time is laterally shifted on time axis by a transfer factor α κ corresponding to a specific temperature shaw and macknight 1983 the transfer factor is introduced in the wlf equation williams et al 1955 3 log α κ c 1 κ κ 0 c 2 κ κ 0 hence converted relaxation modulus function at different temperatures is written as 4 e r t κ e r i 1 n e r i e t α κ τ r i where κ is the current temperature κ 0 is the reference temperature c 1 and c 2 are the standard constants usually set as 17 86 and 51 6 k respectively shaw and macknight 1983 for this study values listed in atofina atofina 2002 about material properties of pa11 at different temperatures were used as shown in fig 4 where the modulus of pa11 gradually decays from initial value e r 0 to final value e r over time the modulus datum at 0 c 10 c and 15 c in fig 4 are obtained according to the eq 3 it is seen that the relaxation modulus reduces as temperature increases so the rigidity of polymer layer gradually increases from the inside to the outside meanwhile material properties tend to exhibit viscoelasticity under actual conditions there must be temperature gradients in both radial and axial directions in the riser to simplify the thermal transfer model the circumferential temperature variation is not considered t r suppose that seawater temperature is constant according to the model given by reference su et al 2004 so the temperature distribution along the radial direction on a certain section can be expressed as κ r 5 κ r κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n where κ i n and κ e x respectively refer to innermost and outermost temperatures substituting eq 5 into eq 3 the transfer factor α κ for different radial positions can be given as 6 α κ r exp c 1 κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n κ 0 c 2 κ i n κ e x κ i n ln r e x r i n ln r r i n κ 0 let eq 6 be substituted into eq 4 and then the modulus distribution function e t r for the polymer layer can be found in addition when viscoelastic material is under sinusoidal excitation its response is not a sinusoidal form since some parameters characterizing the material properties change in time domain meanwhile the mechanical responses are also related to loading frequency the strain responses are at the same frequency as the excitation but there is a certain creep hysteresis and a phase lag angle δ occurs when δ 0 there is no hysteresis between excitation and response the material is completely elastic however when δ 90 the material exhibits an absolute viscous property so the magnitude of δ represents the degree of viscoelasticity for the strain excitation ε 0 sin ω t ε 0 sin ω t whose amplitude is ε 0 ε 0 and frequency is ω ω the stress response of a viscoelastic material can be expressed as σ t σ 0 sin ω t σ t ε 0 sin ω t and the constitutive equation can be described by following wineman et al wineman and rajagopal 2000 7 σ t ε 0 e α 2 e β 2 sin ω t herein e α σ 0 ε 0 cos δ e α σ 0 ε 0 cos δ and e β σ 0 ε 0 sin δ respectively e β δ 0 ε 0 sin δ refer to the energy storage modulus and dissipation modulus and phase lag angle δ is obtained from tan δ e β e α tan δ e β e α 2 1 2 governing equations because of the viscoelasticity of polymeric cylinder elements their mechanical responses are time dependent and the relationships between stress and strain are also related to load frequency so the governing equations of axisymmetric mechanical behaviour of flexible risers cannot be modeled by some mathematical functions in elastic domain cauchy stress can be decomposed into hydrostatic and deviatoric stresses which are related to bulk and shear moduli respectively assuming that the bulk modulus is elastic then shear modulus is the main feature of constitutive equations for linear viscoelastic polymer materials the correspondence principle proposed by wineman and rajagopal 2000 enables the results obtained from the corresponding elastic problems to be transformed into the solution of viscoelastic problems by using laplace transform although the physical shape of objects is invariable when it is transferred to the laplace plane the boundary conditions of traction or displacement can vary spatially for example radial displacement of cylinder is transformed ℑ u r t u r s l u r t u r s transformations for the rest of material parameters such as stress deformation and boundary conditions are almost the same specifically it can be referred to the method presented in liu and vaz 2016a the time domain expression of axial force torque and radial displacement of a viscoelastic cylinder element can be obtained by means of laplace transform and inverse transformation meanwhile substituting modulus distribution function e t r e t r which considers nonlinear radial temperature field of polymer layer let ε x and μ respectively denote the axial strain and poisson ratio and then the axial force is expressed as 8 f z t r i n r e

force on each layer equals to the axial force on the riser the eq 8 and eq 16 are respectively axial forces of cylinder layer and helical wire layer then equation of axial force balance of the entire riser becomes 18 f z t o t a l j 1 q f z c j δ r c j δ t c j ε x j 1 p q f z h j δ r h j ε ϕ ε x the subscripts c and h respectively represent the cylindrical elements and helical wires and j represents the jth layer according to the eq 9 and eq 17 the total torque can be obtained 19 m t o t a l j 1 q m c j ε ϕ j 1 p q m h j δ r h j ε ϕ ε x note that the material characteristics of the adjacent layers are different and cross sections shape of carcass and pressure armour layers are irregular as mentioned before hence when the riser is loaded axially radial deformation of the adjacent layers is not coordinated resulting in interlayer gap the count for flexible riser is j 1 2 p 1 and gap between layer j and j 1 is g j j 1 g j j 1 the relation of geometric deformation is derived 20 δ r j 1 δ r j 1 2 δ t j 1 δ t j g j j 1 the quantity directly related to the occurrence of interlayer gap is contact pressure p e x j p i n j 1 p j j 1 p j j 1 p ex j p in j 1 contact pressure and gap satisfies the relationship 21 i f p j j 1 0 t h e n g j j 1 0 i f g j j 1 0 t h e n p j j 1 0 if g j j 1 0 g j j 1 0 there is no gap between adjacent layers the corresponding contact pressure p j j 1 0 p j j 1 0 if g j j 1 0 g j j 1 0 gap occurs contact pressure is thus zero then gap value needs to be calculated in conclusion interlayer gap g j j 1 g j j 1 and pressure p j j 1 are interrelated variables as shown in fig 5 the two variables cannot be simultaneously unknown that is when one is unknown the other one must be equal to 0 and both are non negative 3 solution process 3 1 solving the theoretical model assume that a flexible riser containing q layers is subjected to axisymmetric loads including axial force f z t o t a l f z total torque m total m total internal pressure p i n r i s e r p in riser external pressure p ex r i s e r p ex riser the number of unknown parameters including force and moment distributions deformations and contact pressures or gap is 5q 1 as listed in the table 1 it is necessary to establish 5q 1 equations to solve the problem processing as above for the force and deformation relations each layer has four equilibrium equations i e eqs 8 9 11 and 12 are for cylindrical layer and eqs 14 17 are for helical wire layer and then 4q equations are summarized there are also two equations for the global loads exerted on the riser i e eqs 18 19 furthermore q 1 equations are related to the assembly conditions i e eq 20 therefore the total number of equations is 5q 1 note that equations of polymer layers contain convolutions to deal with the viscoelasticity and the numerical processing method employed is 22 e r r d ε x η m 0 n ε x m δ e r r n m η here η is the decomposition step of time t and t k η the calculation starts at t 0 when there is assumed no interlayer gap in the first time step 5q 1 unknown parameters can be solved by establishing 5q 1 equations contact pressures are tested p j j 1 0 p j j 1 0 then solution progresses to next time step if any pressure value is negative it indicates that this step needs to be corrected and recalculated then negative values are set as 0 to be known and the gaps of corresponding positions become unknown and then the system is substituted to solve again as described above the calculation is completed cyclically and verified step by step as shown in fig 6 3 2 axial viscoelastic damping the loss factor characterizing the axial viscoelastic damping is expressed in eq 1 in which the potential energy stored energy u and the dissipated energy as heat wd over length l for one cycle of oscillation are respectively given by the following equations 23 a u e a e q 2 ε x 2 l 23 b w d a 0 2 π ω σ i j ε i j d τ d a l where e a e q is the equivalent axial stiffness of the pipe the value of ε x is the amplitude of the axial strain in one cycle a is the transverse section of each polymeric layer over length l 4 case study in this paper the structural responses influenced by radial temperature distribution for a 16 inch flexible riser is explored and the possible interlayer gap is also taken into consideration the flexible riser is comprised of steel and polymer material layers and the heat transfer coefficients of the above two kinds of material have a large difference for detecting viscoelastic response cyclic loading is required so a sinusoidal axial tension is applied to the flexible riser table 2 gives the geometric and material properties of the flexible riser the reason why there are 2 different young s moduli for the inner and the outer polymer sheaths is that 0 13 and 0 53 gpa are the initial and final moduli respectively according to the specific theory and method of calculation referred in reference liu and vaz 2016b fig 7 exhibits the results for the temperature field across the riser thickness for several riser depths temperature on polymer layers i e the pressure barrier layer 2 and external sheath layer 6 changes obviously in the radial direction however water depth has little effect on the temperature distribution so the average temperature in the same place at different water depths is selected in this paper in addition thermal contact resistance between the adjacent layers is also not considered thus temperatures of polymer layers are κ 2 i n 78 8 c t 2 in 78 7659 c and κ 2 e x 44 7 c t 2 ex 44 6574 c for layer 2 κ 6 i n 44 4 c t 6 in 44 4233 c and t 6 ex 4 3394 c κ 6 e x 4 3 c for layer 6 substitution of the average temperature results into eqs 3 5 gives the relaxation modulus distribution of the two polymer layers as shown in fig 8 as the radial temperature decreases the radial distribution of the polymer modulus agrees with both the experimental data atofina 2002 and the modulus results of pa11 in fig 4 in addition along the radial direction the rate at which the modulus decays from the initial value to the final value slows down in which the loading frequency w π 8 rad s axial stiffness of polymeric layer can be equivalent to the slope of the line connecting load strain data to the origin the equivalent stiffness of both pressure barrier and outer sheath shows obvious creep behavior in addition along the radial direction the viscoelastic response of materials gradually approaches to lower temperature results and axial stiffness gradually increases as shown in fig 9 it is worth noting that the stiffness response of the innermost and outermost positions on external sheath clearly differ and this is mainly because after the temperature exceeds 50 c both modulus and its decay rate of pa11 are almost the same even at different temperatures but contrarily the variation of pa11 modulus is very different from 0 c to 50 c fig 10 shows that the viscoelastic performance of pa11 varies with temperature mainly due to two aspects on one hand the difference of lag phase angle the blue line represents axial stiffness of the innermost layer e a e q i n ea eq in and red line is the axial stiffness of the outermost layer e a e q e x ea eq ex both stiffness response and load have a certain phase lag which are δ 6 i n δ 6 in and δ 6 e x δ 6 ex respectively and the phase lag angles differ from each other δ δ δ ex δ i n δ δ δ ex δ in under different load frequency or at different temperatures δ δ δ δ will also be different and specifically expressed as in accordance to eq 7 23 δ δ ω κ tan 1 e e x β ω κ e e x α ω κ tan 1 e i n β ω κ e i n α ω κ on the other hand magnitude of stiffness also varies taking a response period in fig 10 as an example the amplitude change of stiffness at the innermost layer is δ a r i n while that at the outermost one is δ a r e x δ a r ex obviously δ a r i n δ a r e x δ a r in δ a r ex indicating that material at the outermost position on external sheath tends to exhibit viscoelasticity and the more internally the more elastic the material is the axial force acted on each layer structure is shown in fig 11 a compared with other layers the axial force exerted on the tensile armour layers occupies more than 90 of the total and this result is consistent with the practical situation in addition the axial forces carried by polymer layers exhibit significant creep behavior which decreases as time grows further observation as shown in fig 11 b the distributions of axial forces on pressure barrier and external sheath along the diameter are also non uniform which are consistent with the distribution of stiffness and modulus that gradually increases in the radial direction fig 12 a shows the average contact pressure between the layers where no gap exists wherein the value between pressure armour and inner tensile armour is the largest much larger than the rest which is consistent with the main design features however the contact pressure between external sheath and outer tensile armour is zero which means gap appear fig 12 b gives the result of the interlayer gap indicating that the gap between the metal layer and the non metal layer is easy to occur it is observed that as time increases the riser is deformed by force and the gap gradually increases from 2 4 mm to 3 75 mm and exhibits creep behavior like other viscoelastic responses those gap values are so high that it could be measured or even seen however in actual situation it is unlikely to see such large gap formation because of the initial contact pressure generated by fabrication process which is not considered in this model it should be mentioned that the status of annulus between the inner and external sheath are dry during the whole modeling process next consider the responses to a cosine force f z t o t a l t 200 5cos wt kn in the fig 13 a the solutions for polymer materials in elastic domain are respectively the initial value of 530 mpa blue solid line and the final value of 130 mpa red solid line model a liu and vaz 2016a pink solid line ignores both the influence of radial temperature field distribution and the possible interlayer gap on the contrary model b green dotted line is presented in this paper the viscoelastic response results of riser gradually approach the ultimate value elastic model solution from the initial elastic model which show obvious nonlinearity and creep phenomena the equivalent axial stiffness given by the model a is bigger than that calculated by the model b but the strain and loss factor predicted by the model b are larger as shown in fig 13 b the mechanical responses of flexible riser under different loading frequencies are shown in fig 14 it is obvious that under different frequency loadings the maximum value of the axial strain is significantly different and the initial values differ slightly which is consistent with the flexible riser axisymmetric response results of the frequency dominant polymer viscoelasticity as shown in article liu and vaz 2016b moreover compared with the model a previously presented in reference liu and vaz 2016a the loss factors corresponding to viscoelastic damping calculated by model b become large among four loading conditions as shown in fig 15 these results show that both time dependent interlayer gaps and distributed temperature field may have an important influence on viscoelastic damping in forced oscillations 5 conclusion in this paper experimental data are fitted for pa11 material parameters at different temperature conditions by time temperature equivalence principle and then a polymer cylinder mechanical model that considers the radial temperature field is proposed combined with the differential geometry of helix and the theory of curved beams the assembly of cylinder elements and helical elements is formulated and the relationship between contact pressure and interlayer gap is verified the viscoelastic mechanical response of flexible riser coupled with axial symmetric load and deep water ambient temperature fields is predicted consequently the responses of the polymer layer show obvious creep phenomenon meanwhile the distribution of the radial nonlinear temperature field directly affects the material properties resulting in the uneven distribution of the modulus stiffness and bearing capacity of the polymer layer the relationship between interlayer gap and contact pressure is verified by the method of cyclic iteration to ensure that the calculated results are in line with the practical situation furthermore gaps between metal and non metal layers are easy to appear because of their large difference in modulus especially in the conditions of shutting down or outer sheath damage its value is time dependent and gradually increase to some constant compared with previous studies this model considering non uniform radial temperature distribution and interlayer gaps gives higher strain and loss factor but lower axial stiffness which means those two factors may have influence on the structural responses of flexible riser as well as the viscoelastic damping although the difference is not huge more accurate models are helpful for scientific research and engineering applications moreover the loss factor corresponding to viscoelastic damping is affected by the external loading frequency and it decreases with the increase of external load frequency the model is applicable to response prediction of flexible riser containing polymers but the property parameters of different materials need to be measured experimentally in order to improve the model the experiment of temperature influencing the response of flexible riser mechanism needs to be completed and heat loss from interlayer contact should also be considered it should be noted that the viscoelastic properties related to structural damping must affect bend behavior study and fatigue life prediction of flexible risers hence how to add viscoelastic model to the traditional models will be performed in the further credit authorship contribution statement junpeng liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis supervision
