22740,a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the dynamic response of stiffened panels the uniaxial tension experiments and the dynamic experiments were conducted to obtain the material characterization the falling weight experiments were conducted to study the dynamic response of the stiffened panels a dynamic bwh criterion which combines the bwh criterion and the cowper symonds model is proposed to evaluate the material failure the scaled constant strain cs criterion can decrease the influence of mesh size and improve the accuracy of the simulations these two different criteria are applied in the simulation models and the simulation results are compared with the experiments the simulations of the experiments are carried out using the explicit solver of the finite element software package abaqus the dynamic bwh criterion is implemented in the numerical simulation using user material subroutine vumat the simulation results show that the dynamic bwh criterion is better consistent with the experimental results than the scaled cs criterion because the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered in the dynamic bwh criterion the formation mechanism of different fracture shapes of the stiffened panels is discussed keywords dynamic response stiffened panels material failure fracture shapes 1 introduction in the ship collision and grounding accidents the damage of ship structures may lead to oil leakage environmental pollution and other serious consequences research on the response and damage mode of ship structures subjected to impact loading is meaningful for ship design experimental investigations of ship collision and grounding are intuitive and persuasive in order to evaluate the response of ship structures during collision and grounding events full scale experiments have been performed vredeveldt and wevers 1993 carlebur 1995 sterndorff and pedersen 1996 although full scale experiments can actually reveal the response of ship structures during collision and grounding events they are rarely performed because of tremendous expense hence the most practical way for the research of ship collision and grounding is laboratory model tests because of having the advantage of continuous recording of the damage process and deformation details of each specimen many quasi static experiments have been conducted to investigate the ship collision and grounding problems some researchers have studied the impact response of the side or the bottom panels by penetration experiments using quasi static lateral loads wang et al 2000 karlsson et al 2009 alsos et al 2009a villavicencio et al 2014 liu et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2000 proposed a simplified analytical method to calculate the global behavior of a double hull considering the deformation mechanism and the inner force of the plate and the stiffeners respectively liu et al 2015a 2015b proposed a simplified analytical method to evaluate the energy absorption of the stiffened plate and compared with numerical simulation results zhang et al 2018b carried out experimental and numerical studies of the double hull structures subjected to transverse indentation by conical and knife edge indenters the results show that due to the different deformation and fracture modes the double hull structure has different resistance to the two indenters these studies focused on the force displacement response and the energy absorbing mechanisms of the ship structures and the failure prediction is mainly applied with the cs criterion alsos et al 2009a 2009b investigated the fracture prediction of the stiffened plates with finite element models which implemented a stress based criterion the bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 and obtained good results the bwh criterion is reasonable for failure prediction of structures under quasi static loads but it remains to be discussed for dynamic loads the dynamic response of ship collision and grounding events is more obvious as the ship speed increases in the process of rapid deformation of structures the strain rate influence on materials is not negligible and the structure failure mode of dynamic response may be different from the static response hence a lot of impact experiments have been conducted to investigate the dynamic response of ship structures the specimens including rectangular plates liu et al 2012 stiffened plates villavicencio and soares 2012 2013 x core structure ehlers et al 2012 reduced scale naval structures calle et al 2014 model scale ship tabri et al 2008 calle et al 2017 liu et al 2012 studied the plastic behavior and fracture of rectangular plates struck laterally by a hemispherical indenter the influence of the impact velocity and the diameter of the indenters were also investigated villavicencio and soares 2012 2013 studied the influence of the boundary conditions the material characterization and stiffeners form on the impact response of stiffened plates ehlers et al 2012 studied the collision resistance of the x core structure and the influence of the failure strain of laser weld was discussed tabri et al 2008 conducted a series of model scale ship collision experiments the results of model scale experiments large scale experiments and a simple analytical model were compared through the froude scaling law calle et al 2014 studied the response of the reduced scale 1 100 naval structures under lateral impact and discussed the strain rate sensitivity and compared the accuracy of structural failure criteria furthermore the investigation of ship collision and grounding with scaled model experiments was conducted by calle et al 2017 these impact experiments were conducted under relatively low impact velocity less than 5 m s thus the strain rate influence may be unapparent therefore some experiments with higher impact velocity about 6 9 m s have been designed such as lateral impact of web girders villavicencio et al 2013 collision of stiffened plates by pendulum cho and lee 2009 lateral impact of stiffened plates liu et al 2015 villavicencio et al 2013 considered the effect of strain rate and stiffeners form on the peak force and the deformation mode response of the stringers liu et al 2015 considered the influence of strain rate and mesh size on the simulation of stiffened plates under lateral impact strain rate influence can be described by cowper symonds constitutive model cowper and symonds 1957 the failure prediction of these studies is mainly applied with the cs criterion or the scaled cs criterion since stress state and loading path may also affect the structural failure some stress based criteria are proposed based on the elastic viscoplastic j2 flow theory and a one parameter fracture criterion the finite element simulations predicted the force displacement response and failure with good accuracy for the low velocity impact tests gruben et al 2017 based on the modified mohr coulomb plane stress fracture criterion kõrgesaar et al 2018 proposed a fracture criterion 2fs criterion that the fracture strain scaling depends on both the mesh size and stress triaxiality and the onset of fracture was captured with excellent accuracy independent of mesh size when employing 2fs criterion in this paper a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the nonlinearity and dynamic property of the material used and the impact response of stiffened panels in simulation models the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered the formation mechanism of different fracture shapes of the stiffened panels is also discussed 2 experimental details 2 1 material characterization material characterization of a high strength steel ah40 were obtained from the uniaxial tension experiments and the dynamic experiments the details of material property experiments are shown below 2 1 1 uniaxial tension experiments the uniaxial tension experiments were conducted in accordance with iso 6892 1 2009 the high strength hull steel ah40 was used in these experiments the specimens were divided into two groups which are parallel and perpendicular to the rolling direction respectively the specimens were cut from a 4 mm steel plate the uniaxial tension experiments were performed by the material stretch test machine zwick roell z100 the true stress strain curves were obtained from the engineering stress strain curves by eq 1 and illustrated in fig 1 1 σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g because eq 1 is valid only until the onset of diffuse necking the experiment data between initial state and the onset of diffuse necking is used the stress and strain values at the initial necking point of the two groups of experiments are very consistent see fig 1 therefore the influence of rolling direction on material behavior is ignored the average necking strain equivalent plastic strain obtained from the aforementioned two groups of experimental data is ε n 0 176 it is assumed that the material is isotropic subject to the mises yield criterion and isotropic hardening the hardening behavior of the material is evaluated by the power law model σ k ε n thus the material behavior is expressed as eq 2 and shown in fig 1 2 σ e ε i f σ σ s σ s i f ε ε h k ε n otherwise here e 202 gpa σ s 477 mpa ε h 0 0097 is the equivalent strain when the material starts to harden k 884 mpa and n 0 133 are the material strength coefficient and hardening exponent respectively the material parameters are summed up in table 1 2 1 2 dynamic experiments under the impact load the yield stress of steel materials will become higher but the fracture strain will become lower liu et al 2015 this phenomenon is usually explained as the effect of strain rate in order to obtain the dynamic properties of the high strength steel a series of high speed tension experiments and split hopkinson pressure bar shpb experiments were conducted the high speed tension experiments were performed by high speed test machine zwick roell htm 16020 the engineering stress strain curves under different strain rates are shown in fig 2 it shows that the dynamic yield stress increases with the increase of strain rate the equipment for the shpb experiment was composed of pneumatic gun impact bar input bar output bar specimen dynamic strain indicator and so on the pressure supplied by the pneumatic gun was range from 0 1 mpa to 0 3 mpa the engineering stress strain curves under different strain rates are shown in fig 3 it also shows that the dynamic yield stress increases with the increase of strain rate the cowper symonds model is widely used to assess the strain rate sensitivity of steel materials the cowper symonds model is expressed as follow jones 1989a 3 σ d σ 0 1 ε d 1 q where σ d is the dynamic yield stress σ 0 is the static yield stress the same as σ s in section 2 1 1 d and q are the constants for a specific material in this paper the constants are obtained from the high speed tension experiments and the shpb experiments the fit curve by the cowper symonds model with d 5809 s 1 and q 2 457 is shown in fig 4 these constants will be implemented in simulation models to evaluate the dynamic properties of the high strength steel 2 2 scheme of stiffened panel in falling weight experiment in order to investigate the dynamic response of the side shell structure subjected to impact loading a falling weight collision experiment was designed the schematic diagram of the falling weight collision experiments is shown in fig 5 the impact block was composed of an indenter and a weight block and which are connected with six bolts the shape of the indenter was similar to that in tabri s 2008 the height of the indenter was 288 mm and the surface was a paraboloid of revolution z 0 005 x 2 y 2 see fig 6 the total mass of the impact block was 2 11 tons the geometry of the stiffened panel is shown in fig 7 the stiffened panel included five flat bars 50 4 mm and 2 t bars 6 160 8 60 mm and plate thickness was 4 mm the distance between adjacent t bars was 1000 mm and that between adjacent flat bars was 380 mm the stiffened panel was welded to a rectangular frame 2400 1900 mm there were 42 threaded holes m20 around the rectangular frame for connecting with the support the support was composed of four h beams one base plate and four foundation bolts see fig 8 the h beams were stiffened every 200 mm for providing sufficient stiffness of the support in order to locate the impact block conveniently the attached plate of the stiffened panel was painted with 10 cm 10 cm red grid lines and the center of the panel was marked with a red dot see fig 5 b before the experiment the impact block was precisely located above the center of the stiffened panel by a crane see fig 5 a and then the impact block was adjusted to perpendicular to the stiffened panel after that the impact block was lifted up to the falling height maximum 4 6 m and free falling of the impact block was controlled by the detacher the acceleration of the impact block during the collision process was recorded by an acceleration sensor which was mounted on the top surface of the impact block see fig 9 thus the collision force can be obtained by f m a two falling weight experiments were carried out with two different falling heights namely 4 6 m model 1 and 3 5 m model 2 3 experimental results after detaching from the hook the impact block starts to free fall motion until the indenter hits the stiffened panel in the collision process the stiffened panel deforms and absorbs energy and the impact block decelerates when the indenter fully penetrates into the stiffened panel the weight block hits the stiffened panel after that the speed of the impact block drops rapidly and then the impact block rebounds and tilts after several times of bounce and collision the impact block stops as the concern is focused on the deformation and damage mechanism of the stiffened panel the process after the weight block hits the stiffened panel is not considered the collision force during ship collision accident is the direct parameter to guide the design of crashworthiness structure the analysis of structure failure mechanism mainly concentrates on both deformation and damage extent of stiffened panel hence the collision force curve are plotted the deformation and damage extent are discussed due to the limit of experiment condition the deformation process of the stiffened panel is not recorded the deformation and damage extent is measured and photographed after collision the sampling frequency and the maximum range of the acceleration sensor are 25 6 khz and 20000 g respectively the acceleration curve is from the beginning of the collision to the time when the weight block hits the stiffened panel the acceleration curve is dealt with low pass filtering to remove the interference of the high frequency signals and the cut off frequency is 1000 hz due to sensor fault in the experiment of 3 5 m height the experiment data was invalid assuming that the drop weight is rigid and damping effects are negligible the acceleration of the drop weight can be integrated numerically with respect to time by applying initial conditions to obtain velocity and displacement histories cerik et al 2015 the force displacement curve is obtained by combining the calculated force history from the acceleration data and displacement history fig 10 shows the acceleration velocity displacement time history curves and force displacement curve of the falling height of 4 6 m model 1 the peak acceleration of model 1 is 290 2m s2 and the peak force is 612 3 kn as the displacement time history curve is approximately linear the acceleration time history and force displacement curves are similar the impact center is the center of the stiffened panel and the area which has large deformation and rupture is called collision area see fig 7 the deformations and damage extent of the two stiffened panels in both upper and lower surfaces are shown in fig 11 in the orthogonal directions l1 and l2 are used to describe the damage extent which is surrounded by the dotted line as shown in table 2 from the upper surface of model 1 it can be seen that the fracture shape is like a bat the attached plate in model 1 is torn into three regions and the upper part region a1 is like a rectangle and the lower part region b1 and region c1 is triangle shaped the lower surface of model 1 shows that the flat bar in the collision area are fractured into two parts and the breaking point are close to the midpoint the left part is folded in region d1 and the right part is distorted as multiple waveforms it can be roughly seen that one crack extends along the direction parallel to the flat bar and the extensions of other cracks will be discussed later the upper surface of model 2 shows that the fracture shape looks like a quatrefoil the attached plate of model 2 is torn into four triangle shaped regions the lower surface of model 2 illustrates that the flat bar in the collision area is also fractures in the middle of stiffener as model 1 and both parts of the broken flat bar occur multiple waveform distortions it can be roughly seen that there are four cracks extend from the impact center along the directions which are perpendicular and parallel to the flat bar 4 numerical simulation 4 1 simulation models the numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit solver of the commercial software package abaqus the simulation model is shown in fig 12 the impact block is defined as rigid body and its total mass is put at the center of gravity the simulation starts when the indenter of the impact block is about to hit the stiffened panel the initial velocity of the impact block is calculated and assigned according to the falling height the boundary condition is fixing the bottom surface of the rectangular frame in order to ensure accuracy and improve computational efficiency the mesh of the stiffened panel is optimized the element type used in the simulation models is s4r with 5 integration points through the thickness the mesh size of the collision area is 5 mm and the rectangular frame is 20 mm the mesh between the collision area and the rectangular frame is smoothly transited the contact between the impact block and the stiffened panel is defined as general contact the friction coefficient is assumed as 0 28 because the two different fracture shapes of the experiments can be captured by this friction coefficient the true stress strain curve of the material shown in fig 1 in the simulation model is derived from the engineering stress strain curve of the uniaxial tension experiments the material strain rate effect is evaluated by the cowper symonds model whose constants are obtained from the dynamic experiments it is important to correctly predict the initiation of structure rupture in this paper two failure criteria are compared in the simulations one is the constant strain criterion the cs criterion and the other is the bwh criterion alsos et al 2008 the cs criterion is widely used due to its simple form and easy application however the prediction accuracy of the cs criterion is significantly influenced by mesh size hogström et al 2009 et al yang et al 2018 the scaled cs criterion which considers the influence of mesh size can obtain more reasonable results an altered form of the scaled cs criterion by alsos et al 2009 is applied in the simulations expressed as follow 4 ε f ε n 1 t l e here ε f is the failure strain ε n 0 176 is the strain at the onset of necking t is the thickness of the plate and l e is element length the bwh criterion is a stress based criterion which is used to predict the failure of material it is derived by combining the hill s local necking criterion hill 1952 and the bressan williams shear stress criterion bressan and williams 1983 the bwh criterion is expressed as follow 5 σ 1 2 k 3 1 1 2 β β 2 β 1 2 ε ˆ 1 3 β 2 β 1 1 β n β 0 hill 2 k 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 n 1 β 2 β 2 β 0 bressan willams here ε ˆ 1 is equal to ε n the necking strain of the uniaxial tension experiments β ε 2 ε 1 is the ratio of the in plane minimum principal strain rate to the maximum principal strain rate k n are the strength coefficient and the hardening exponent of the material respectively due to the strain rate effects the yield stress of steel materials will become higher but the fracture strain will become lower under impact loading that is to say the dynamic stress of the material is greater than the static stress at the same strain see eq 3 however in the bwh criterion the effect of strain rate cannot be reflected by the strain rate ratio β combining the cowper symonds model the dynamic failure stress is defined as follow 6 σ 1 d σ 1 1 ε d 1 q here σ 1 d is the critical maximum principal stress σ 1 is derived from eq 5 in the bwh criterion ε ˆ 1 is equal to the equivalent strain at local necking however the fracture of structures tends to occur earlier under dynamic loading paik 2007a 2007b based on the cowper symonds model the dynamic failure strain is the inverse of the ratio of dynamic stress to static stress similar approach by jones 1989b namely 7 ε ˆ 1 d ε n 1 ε d 1 q 1 the bwh criterion is not available in abaqus and it is implemented in the numerical simulation using user material subroutine vumat the element is removed when the all through thickness integration points are failure that means all the stress tensor components of the failure element are set to zero 4 2 simulation results in this section the results of the simulations are compared with the experimental results the force displacement curves of the experiment and simulations are shown in fig 13 the simulation results using the dynamic bwh criterion is closer to experiment than the scaled cs criterion in curve shape and peak time the force peaks of the two simulations are 646 kn dynamic bwh and 508 kn scaled cs the corresponding errors are 5 5 and 17 0 the simulation results show that the plate begins to fracture after the flat bar is completely fractured the first fracture element in the flat bar named element a and the plate named element b are shown in fig 14 it is well known that the stress state and loading path influence the failure modes of the structure the stress triaxiality η σ m σ mean stress divided by mises stress can describe the stress state and the variation of it can describe the loading paths of the structures for plane stress problem stress triaxiality can be expressed as follow 8 η σ m σ 1 β 3 1 β β 2 therefore the dynamic bwh criterion is converted into the relationship between failure strain and stress triaxiality expressed as follow 9 ε f 2 3 η ε ˆ 1 d η 1 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 d 1 β β 2 1 β 1 2 n η 1 β 3 1 β β 2 0 β 1 fig 15 shows the equivalent fracture strain stress triaxiality curves predicted by the scaled cs and the dynamic bwh criteria and the simulation curves of the falling weight collision experiment using these two criteria the black solid and black dashed lines represent the equivalent fracture strain stress triaxiality curves predicted by the scaled cs and the dynamic bwh criteria respectively the dash dotted lines flat bar cs and plate cs represent the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curves of element a and element b simulated by the scaled cs criterion the dotted lines flat bar bwh and plate bwh represent the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curves of element a and element b simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion the asterisk marks represent the fracture initiation of element a and element b simulated by the scaled cs criterion and the circular marks represent the fracture initiation of element a and element b simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion the strain rate varies greatly during the collision for example in the simulation of model 1 the strain rate at the fracture of element a is about 6 1s 1 while that of element b is about 552s 1 the strain rate s influence on structure failure is considered in the dynamic bwh criterion the fracture strain of element a predicted by the dynamic bwh criterion is greater than the one predicted by the scaled cs criterion but the fracture strain prediction of element b is opposite this will lead to differences in collision force response for the scaled cs criterion the collision force can increase for a period of time segment a b in fig 13 after the flat bar fractures point a in fig 13 for the dynamic bwh criterion the collision force reaches its peak when the flat bar fractures point a in fig 13 then the collision force decreases slightly after that the plate fractures point b in fig 13 and the collision force decreases rapidly when using the scaled cs criterion the flat bar fractures too early so the impact force is over underestimated however the trend of collision force curve simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion is more consistent with the experimental collision force curve because the effect of stress state and strain rate on structural failure is taken into account fig 16 shows the different fracture shapes of the experiments and simulations the fracture shapes of the simulations using the dynamic bwh criterion and the scaled cs criterion are similar to the experiments however the damage extent is a little different table 3 shows that the damage extent using the dynamic bwh criterion is closer to the experiments than the scaled cs criterion in summary when predicting the failure of stiffened panels under dynamic loading the dynamic bwh criterion is better than the scale cs criterion 5 discussion the fracture shape of the falling weight experiment is different from liu et al 2015 the fracture shape may be affected by falling height friction coefficient deviation of the collision center tilt of punch during impact process and so on in this experiment the deviation of the collision center and the tilt of punch during impact process are very small friction is inevitable in the process of ship collision in fea simulations the fracture shape is also affected by mesh size the influence of friction coefficient falling height and mesh size on fracture shape is discussed in this section 5 1 effect of friction coefficient and falling height the measured kinetic friction coefficients of three steels under dry contact condition were 0 23 0 22 and 0 15 respectively karlsson et al 2009 the experimental results of haag et al 2017 shown that the friction coefficients between steel plate are 0 28 dry contact and 0 03 greased however there is no comprehensive experimental research on the friction coefficient for the contact between plates made of shipbuilding steel grades especially for coated plates in the ship collision simulation the static friction coefficient is often set to 0 3 alsos et al 2009b kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 friction influences the contact area between the indenter and the shell plates and the deformation in the shell plates consequently influences the crack patterns and the crack growth directions zhang et al 2018a the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape is studied by changing the friction coefficient and falling height of the simulation model fig 17 shows four typical fracture shapes of the stiffened panel a rhombus shaped r shaped fracture b quatrefoil shaped q shaped fracture c transition shaped t shaped fracture which is between the quatrefoil and bat shaped fracture d bat shaped b shaped fracture table 4 shows the fracture shapes of different falling height and friction coefficient in table 4 r represents for r shaped fracture q represents for q shaped fracture t represents for t shaped fracture and b represents for b shaped fracture table 4 shows that when the friction coefficient is small the fracture shape is almost q shaped this is probably because the smaller friction force has less influence on the fracture shape with the increase of friction coefficient and falling height the fracture shape changes but it seems that there is no obvious rule the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape is complicated however the fracture shape is controlled by the failure criterion where the structure first reaches failure affects the final fracture shape fig 18 shows the simulation of the fracturing process of two different fracture shapes of the stiffened panel the left part of the figure is the q shaped fracture and the right part is the b shaped fracture the fracturing process can be divided into five steps the first three steps of the two different fracture shapes are the same 1 fracture of the flat bar 2 the plate splits along the direction perpendicular to the flat bar 3 one side of the plate splits along the direction parallel to the flat bar start with the fourth step the q shaped fracture splits from point a along the direction parallel to the flat bar while the b shaped fracture splits from point b1 and b2 finally the different fracture shapes occurs here a b1 and b2 are called control points take the scaled cs criterion as an example fig 19 shows the equivalent strain time history curves of control points under different friction coefficients and falling height it shows that different friction coefficients or falling height can generate different fracture shapes if control points b1 and b2 reach the failure strain earlier the b shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 1 if control point a reaches the failure strain earlier the q shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 35 6 if control points a b1 and b2 reach the failure strain almost simultaneously the t shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 24 as the collision height changes the collision force and the contact area will also change so the friction in the collision zone will also change and it will affect the deformation of the structure thus the influence of friction coefficient and collision height on the fracture shape becomes complicated essentially they affect the failure order of structure control points thus cause different fracture shapes 5 2 effect of mesh size on fracture shape in this sub section four mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are used to study the effect of mesh size on the fracture shape with the scaled cs criterion the failure strains of mesh size larger than the plate thickness 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are determined by eq 4 since eq 4 is applied for elements larger than the plate thickness alsos et al 2009 the failure strain of mesh size 2 5 mm is calibrated by comparison of simulation and experiment for the calibration of the failure strain of mesh size 2 5 mm three failure strains 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 are assumed the fracture shape of the simulations with failure strains 0 3 and 0 35 are similar as fig 17 b however the fracture shape of the simulation with failure strain 0 4 is different from experiment see fig 20 because in the simulation the plate fractures before the flat bar which is contrary to the experimental results on the other hand the simulated acceleration peaks of the three failure strains are 187 m s2 269 m s2 and 416 m s2 respectively the middle one is closest to the experimental acceleration peak therefore the failure strain 0 35 is used for mesh size 2 5 mm in the following analysis fig 21 shows the fracture shapes of the simulations with different mesh sizes fine mesh 2 5 mm and 5 mm coarse mesh 10 mm and 20 mm the b shaped fracture is captured by simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm but the assumed friction coefficients are different because the fracture shape is affected by failure strain and the influence of friction coefficient is irregular as mentioned above this makes the problem more complicated table 5 shows that both the q shaped and b shaped fractures can be captured by the simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm however the simulation with mesh size 20 mm can t capture the b shaped fracture the acceleration peaks of the simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm increase slightly with the increase of friction coefficient this indicates that the friction coefficient has little influence on the acceleration peak however there are burrs in the acceleration curves and the simulated acceleration peaks fluctuate with the increase of friction coefficient because the mesh size 20 mm is too coarse as shown in fig 22 in summary fine mesh can obtain smooth acceleration curve and capture the details of deformation and fracture of the stiffened panels while coarse mesh couldn t therefore in collision simulation the mesh size of the collision area is recommended to be close to or less than the plate thickness 6 conclusions based on the material property experiments and the falling weight experiments the dynamic response of a stiffened panel subjected to lateral impact has been studied the results show that in simulation models the mesh size the failure criterion and the friction coefficient should be considered in this study the dynamic bwh criterion is combined with the cowper symonds model thus the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered the dynamic bwh criterion is more accurate to evaluate the failure of the stiffened panel than the scaled cs criterion there is no obvious rule in the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape the friction in the collision zone changes with the collision height and it influences the deformation of the collision zone however the fracture shape is controlled by the failure criterion in reality the friction coefficient and falling height influence the failure order of the control points thus affects the final fracture shape mesh size also influence the fracture shape in order to capture the details of deformation and fracture shape in collision simulation the mesh size of the collision area is recommended to be close to or less than the plate thickness acknowledgements the present work

22740,a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the dynamic response of stiffened panels the uniaxial tension experiments and the dynamic experiments were conducted to obtain the material characterization the falling weight experiments were conducted to study the dynamic response of the stiffened panels a dynamic bwh criterion which combines the bwh criterion and the cowper symonds model is proposed to evaluate the material failure the scaled constant strain cs criterion can decrease the influence of mesh size and improve the accuracy of the simulations these two different criteria are applied in the simulation models and the simulation results are compared with the experiments the simulations of the experiments are carried out using the explicit solver of the finite element software package abaqus the dynamic bwh criterion is implemented in the numerical simulation using user material subroutine vumat the simulation results show that the dynamic bwh criterion is better consistent with the experimental results than the scaled cs criterion because the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered in the dynamic bwh criterion the formation mechanism of different fracture shapes of the stiffened panels is discussed keywords dynamic response stiffened panels material failure fracture shapes 1 introduction in the ship collision and grounding accidents the damage of ship structures may lead to oil leakage environmental pollution and other serious consequences research on the response and damage mode of ship structures subjected to impact loading is meaningful for ship design experimental investigations of ship collision and grounding are intuitive and persuasive in order to evaluate the response of ship structures during collision and grounding events full scale experiments have been performed vredeveldt and wevers 1993 carlebur 1995 sterndorff and pedersen 1996 although full scale experiments can actually reveal the response of ship structures during collision and grounding events they are rarely performed because of tremendous expense hence the most practical way for the research of ship collision and grounding is laboratory model tests because of having the advantage of continuous recording of the damage process and deformation details of each specimen many quasi static experiments have been conducted to investigate the ship collision and grounding problems some researchers have studied the impact response of the side or the bottom panels by penetration experiments using quasi static lateral loads wang et al 2000 karlsson et al 2009 alsos et al 2009a villavicencio et al 2014 liu et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2000 proposed a simplified analytical method to calculate the global behavior of a double hull considering the deformation mechanism and the inner force of the plate and the stiffeners respectively liu et al 2015a 2015b proposed a simplified analytical method to evaluate the energy absorption of the stiffened plate and compared with numerical simulation results zhang et al 2018b carried out experimental and numerical studies of the double hull structures subjected to transverse indentation by conical and knife edge indenters the results show that due to the different deformation and fracture modes the double hull structure has different resistance to the two indenters these studies focused on the force displacement response and the energy absorbing mechanisms of the ship structures and the failure prediction is mainly applied with the cs criterion alsos et al 2009a 2009b investigated the fracture prediction of the stiffened plates with finite element models which implemented a stress based criterion the bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 and obtained good results the bwh criterion is reasonable for failure prediction of structures under quasi static loads but it remains to be discussed for dynamic loads the dynamic response of ship collision and grounding events is more obvious as the ship speed increases in the process of rapid deformation of structures the strain rate influence on materials is not negligible and the structure failure mode of dynamic response may be different from the static response hence a lot of impact experiments have been conducted to investigate the dynamic response of ship structures the specimens including rectangular plates liu et al 2012 stiffened plates villavicencio and soares 2012 2013 x core structure ehlers et al 2012 reduced scale naval

indenter the influence of the impact velocity and the diameter of the indenters were also investigated villavicencio and soares 2012 2013 studied the influence of the boundary conditions the material characterization and stiffeners form on the impact response of stiffened plates ehlers et al 2012 studied the collision resistance of the x core structure and the influence of the failure strain of laser weld was discussed tabri et al 2008 conducted a series of model scale ship collision experiments the results of model scale experiments large scale experiments and a simple analytical model were compared through the froude scaling law calle et al 2014 studied the response of the reduced scale 1 100 naval structures under lateral impact and discussed the strain rate sensitivity and compared the accuracy of structural failure criteria furthermore the investigation of ship collision and grounding with scaled model experiments was conducted by calle et al 2017 these impact experiments were conducted under relatively low impact velocity less than 5 m s thus the strain rate influence may be unapparent therefore some experiments with higher impact velocity about 6 9 m s have been designed such as lateral impact of web girders villavicencio et al 2013 collision of stiffened plates by pendulum cho and lee 2009 lateral impact of stiffened plates liu et al 2015 villavicencio et al 2013 considered the effect of strain rate and stiffeners form on the peak force and the deformation mode response of the stringers liu et al 2015 considered the influence of strain rate and mesh size on the simulation of stiffened plates under lateral impact strain rate influence can be described by cowper symonds constitutive model cowper and symonds 1957 the failure prediction of these studies is mainly applied with the cs criterion or the scaled cs criterion since stress state and loading path may also affect the structural failure some stress based criteria are proposed based on the elastic viscoplastic j2 flow theory and a one parameter fracture criterion the finite element simulations predicted the force displacement response and failure with good accuracy for the low velocity impact tests gruben et al 2017 based on the modified mohr coulomb plane stress fracture criterion kõrgesaar et al 2018 proposed a fracture criterion 2fs criterion that the fracture strain scaling depends on both the mesh size and stress triaxiality and the onset of fracture was captured with excellent accuracy independent of mesh size when employing 2fs criterion in this paper a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the nonlinearity and dynamic property of the material used and the impact response of stiffened panels in simulation models the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered the formation mechanism of different fracture shapes of the stiffened panels is also discussed 2 experimental details 2 1 material characterization material characterization of a high strength steel ah40 were obtained from the uniaxial tension experiments and the dynamic experiments the details of material property experiments are shown below 2 1 1 uniaxial tension experiments the uniaxial tension experiments were conducted in accordance with iso 6892 1 2009 the high strength hull steel ah40 was used in these experiments the specimens were divided into two groups which are parallel and perpendicular to the rolling direction respectively the specimens were cut from a 4 mm steel plate the uniaxial tension experiments were performed by the material stretch test machine zwick roell z100 the true stress strain curves were obtained from the engineering stress strain curves by eq 1 and illustrated in fig 1 1 σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g because eq 1 is valid only until the onset of diffuse necking the experiment data between initial state and the onset of diffuse necking is used the stress and strain values at the initial necking point of the two groups of experiments are very consistent see fig 1 therefore the influence of rolling direction on material behavior is ignored the average necking strain equivalent plastic strain obtained from the aforementioned two groups of experimental data is ε n 0 176 it is assumed that the material is isotropic subject to the mises yield criterion and isotropic hardening the hardening behavior of the material is evaluated by the power law model σ k ε n thus the material behavior is expressed as eq 2 and shown in fig 1 2 σ e ε i f σ σ s σ s i f ε ε h k ε n otherwise here e 202 gpa σ s 477 mpa ε h 0 0097 is the equivalent strain when the material starts to harden k 884 mpa and n 0 133 are the material strength coefficient and hardening exponent respectively the material parameters are summed up in table 1 2 1 2 dynamic experiments under the impact load the yield stress of steel materials will become higher but the fracture strain will become lower liu et al 2015 this phenomenon is usually explained as the effect of strain rate in order to obtain the dynamic properties of the high strength steel a series of high speed tension experiments and split hopkinson pressure bar shpb experiments were conducted the high speed tension experiments were performed by high speed test machine zwick roell htm 16020 the engineering stress strain curves under different strain rates are shown in fig 2 it shows that the dynamic yield stress increases with the increase of strain rate the equipment for the shpb experiment was composed of pneumatic gun impact bar input bar output bar specimen dynamic strain indicator and so on the pressure supplied by the pneumatic gun was range from 0 1 mpa to 0 3 mpa the engineering stress strain curves under different strain rates are shown in fig 3 it also shows that the dynamic yield stress increases with the increase of strain rate the cowper symonds model is widely used to assess the strain rate sensitivity of steel materials the cowper symonds model is expressed as follow jones 1989a 3 σ d σ 0 1 ε d 1 q where σ d is the dynamic yield stress σ 0 is the static yield stress the same as σ s in section 2 1 1 d and q are the constants for a specific material in this paper the constants are obtained from the high speed tension experiments and the shpb experiments the fit curve by the cowper symonds model with d 5809 s 1 and q 2 457 is shown in fig 4 these constants will be implemented in simulation models to evaluate the dynamic properties of the high strength steel 2 2 scheme of stiffened panel in falling weight experiment in order to investigate the dynamic response of the side shell structure subjected to impact loading a falling weight collision experiment was designed the schematic diagram of the falling weight collision experiments is shown in fig 5 the impact block was composed of an indenter and a weight block and which are connected with six bolts the shape of the indenter was similar to that in tabri s 2008 the height of the indenter was 288 mm and the surface was a paraboloid of revolution z 0 005 x 2 y 2 see fig 6 the total mass of the impact block was 2 11 tons the geometry of the stiffened panel is shown in fig 7 the stiffened panel included five flat bars 50 4 mm and 2 t bars 6 160 8 60 mm and plate thickness was 4 mm the distance between adjacent t bars was 1000 mm and that between adjacent flat bars was 380 mm the stiffened panel was welded to a rectangular frame 2400 1900 mm there were 42 threaded holes m20 around the rectangular frame for connecting with the support the support was composed of four h beams one base plate and four foundation bolts see fig 8 the h beams were stiffened every 200 mm for providing sufficient stiffness of the support in order to locate the impact block conveniently the attached plate of the stiffened panel was painted with 10 cm 10 cm red grid lines and the center of the panel was marked with a red dot see fig 5 b before the experiment the impact block was precisely located above the center of the stiffened panel by a crane see fig 5 a and then the impact block was adjusted to perpendicular to the stiffened panel after that the impact block was lifted up to the falling height maximum 4 6 m and free falling of the impact block was controlled by the detacher the acceleration of the impact block during the collision process was recorded by an acceleration sensor which was mounted on the top surface of the impact block see fig 9 thus the collision force can be obtained by f m a two falling weight experiments were carried out with two different falling heights namely 4 6 m model 1 and 3 5 m model 2 3 experimental results after detaching from the hook the impact block starts to free fall motion until the indenter hits the stiffened panel in the collision process the stiffened panel deforms and absorbs energy and the impact block decelerates when the indenter fully penetrates into the stiffened panel the weight block hits the stiffened panel after that the speed of the impact block drops rapidly and then the impact block rebounds and tilts after several times of bounce and collision the impact block stops as the concern is focused on the deformation and damage mechanism of the stiffened panel the process after the weight block hits the stiffened panel is not considered the collision force during ship collision accident is the direct parameter to guide the design of crashworthiness structure the analysis of structure failure mechanism mainly concentrates on both deformation and damage extent of stiffened panel hence the collision force curve are plotted the deformation and damage extent are discussed due to the limit of experiment condition the deformation process of the stiffened panel is not recorded the deformation and damage extent is measured and photographed after collision the sampling frequency and the maximum range of the acceleration sensor are 25 6 khz and 20000 g respectively the acceleration curve is from the beginning of the collision to the time when the weight block hits the stiffened panel the acceleration curve is dealt with low pass filtering to remove the interference of the high frequency signals and the cut off frequency is 1000 hz due to sensor fault in the experiment of 3 5 m height the experiment data was invalid assuming that the drop weight is rigid and damping effects are negligible the acceleration of the drop weight can be integrated numerically with respect to time by applying initial conditions to obtain velocity and displacement histories cerik et al 2015 the force displacement curve is obtained by combining the calculated force history from the acceleration data and displacement history fig 10 shows the acceleration velocity displacement time history curves and force displacement curve of the falling height of 4 6 m model 1 the peak acceleration of model 1 is 290 2m s2 and the peak force is 612 3 kn as the displacement time history curve is approximately linear the acceleration time history and force displacement curves are similar the impact center is the center of the stiffened panel and the area which has large deformation and rupture is called collision area see fig 7 the deformations and damage extent of the two stiffened panels in both upper and lower surfaces are shown in fig 11 in the orthogonal directions l1 and l2 are used to describe the damage extent which is surrounded by the dotted line as shown in table 2 from the upper surface of model 1 it can be seen that the fracture shape is like a bat the attached plate in model 1 is torn into three regions and the upper part region a1 is like a rectangle and the lower part region b1 and region c1 is triangle shaped the lower surface of model 1 shows that the flat bar in the collision area are fractured into two parts and the breaking point are close to the midpoint the left part is folded in region d1 and the right part is distorted as multiple waveforms it can be roughly seen that one crack extends along the direction parallel to the flat bar and the extensions of other cracks will be discussed later the upper surface of model 2 shows that the fracture shape looks like a quatrefoil the attached plate of model 2 is torn into four triangle shaped regions the lower surface of model 2 illustrates that the flat bar in the collision area is also fractures in the middle of stiffener as model 1 and both parts of the broken flat bar occur multiple waveform distortions it can be roughly seen that there are four cracks extend from the impact center along the directions which are perpendicular and parallel to the flat bar 4 numerical simulation 4 1 simulation models the numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit solver of the commercial software package abaqus the simulation model is shown in fig 12 the impact block is defined as rigid body and its total mass is put at the center of gravity the simulation starts when the indenter of the impact block is about to hit the stiffened panel the initial velocity of the impact block is calculated and assigned according to the falling height the boundary condition is fixing the bottom surface of the rectangular frame in order to ensure accuracy and improve computational efficiency the mesh of the stiffened panel is optimized the element type used in the simulation models is s4r with 5 integration points through the thickness the mesh size of the collision area is 5 mm and the rectangular frame is 20 mm the mesh between the collision area and the rectangular frame is smoothly transited the contact between the impact block and the stiffened panel is defined as general contact the friction coefficient is assumed as 0 28 because the two different fracture shapes of the experiments can be captured by this friction coefficient the true stress strain curve of the material shown in fig 1 in the simulation model is derived from the engineering stress strain curve of the uniaxial tension experiments the material strain rate effect is evaluated by the cowper symonds model whose constants are obtained from the dynamic experiments it is important to correctly predict the initiation of structure rupture in this paper two failure criteria are compared in the simulations one is the constant strain criterion the cs criterion and the other is the bwh criterion alsos et al 2008 the cs criterion is widely used due to its simple form and easy application however the prediction accuracy of the cs criterion is significantly influenced by mesh size hogström et al 2009 et al yang et al 2018 the scaled cs criterion which considers the influence of mesh size can obtain more reasonable results an altered form of the scaled cs criterion by alsos et al 2009 is applied in the simulations expressed as follow 4 ε f ε n 1 t l e here ε f is the failure strain ε n 0 176 is the strain at the onset of necking t is the thickness of the plate and l e is element length the bwh criterion is a stress based criterion which is used to predict the failure of material it is derived by combining the hill s local necking criterion hill 1952 and the bressan williams shear stress criterion bressan and williams 1983 the bwh criterion is expressed as follow 5 σ 1 2 k 3 1 1 2 β β 2 β 1 2 ε ˆ 1 3 β 2 β 1 1 β n β 0 hill 2 k 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 n 1 β 2 β 2 β 0 bressan willams here ε ˆ 1 is equal to ε n the necking strain of the uniaxial tension experiments β ε 2 ε 1 is the ratio of the in plane minimum principal strain rate to the maximum principal strain rate k n are the strength coefficient and the hardening exponent of the material respectively due to the strain rate effects the yield stress of steel materials will become higher but the fracture strain will become lower under impact loading that is to say the dynamic stress of the material is greater than the static stress at the same strain see eq 3 however in the bwh criterion the effect of strain rate cannot be reflected by the strain rate ratio β combining the cowper symonds model the dynamic failure stress is defined as follow 6 σ 1 d σ 1 1 ε d 1 q here σ 1 d is the critical maximum principal stress σ 1 is derived from eq 5 in the bwh criterion ε ˆ 1 is equal to the equivalent strain at local necking however the fracture of structures tends to occur earlier under dynamic loading paik 2007a 2007b based on the cowper symonds model the dynamic failure strain is the inverse of the ratio of dynamic stress to static stress similar approach by jones 1989b namely 7 ε ˆ 1 d ε n 1 ε d 1 q 1 the bwh criterion is not available in abaqus and it is implemented in the numerical simulation using user material subroutine vumat the element is removed when the all through thickness integration points are failure that means all the stress tensor components of the failure element are set to zero 4 2 simulation results in this section the results of the simulations are compared with the experimental results the force displacement curves of the experiment and simulations are shown in fig 13 the simulation results using the dynamic bwh criterion is closer to experiment than the scaled cs criterion in curve shape and peak time the force peaks of the two simulations are 646 kn dynamic bwh and 508 kn scaled cs the corresponding errors are 5 5 and 17 0 the simulation results show that the plate begins to fracture after the flat bar is completely fractured the first fracture element in the flat bar named element a and the plate named element b are shown in fig 14 it is well known that the stress state and loading path influence the failure modes of the structure the stress triaxiality η σ m σ mean stress divided by mises stress can describe the stress state and the variation of it can describe the loading paths of the structures for plane stress problem stress triaxiality can be expressed as follow 8 η σ m σ 1 β 3 1 β β 2 therefore the dynamic bwh criterion is converted into the relationship between failure strain and stress triaxiality expressed as follow 9 ε f 2 3 η ε ˆ 1 d η 1 3 2 3 ε ˆ 1 d 1 β β 2 1 β 1 2 n η 1 β 3 1 β β 2 0 β 1 fig 15 shows the equivalent fracture strain stress triaxiality curves predicted by the scaled cs and the dynamic bwh criteria and the simulation curves of the falling weight collision experiment using these two criteria the black solid and black dashed lines represent the equivalent fracture strain stress triaxiality curves predicted by the scaled cs and the dynamic bwh criteria respectively the dash dotted lines flat bar cs and plate cs represent the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curves of element a and element b simulated by the scaled cs criterion the dotted lines flat bar bwh and plate bwh represent the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curves of element a and element b simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion the asterisk marks represent the fracture initiation of element a and element b simulated by the scaled cs criterion and the circular marks represent the fracture initiation of element a and element b simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion the strain rate varies greatly during the collision for example in the simulation of model 1 the strain rate at the fracture of element a is about 6 1s 1 while that of element b is about 552s 1 the strain rate s influence on structure failure is considered in the dynamic bwh criterion the fracture strain of element a predicted by the dynamic bwh criterion is greater than the one predicted by the scaled cs criterion but the fracture strain prediction of element b is opposite this will lead to differences in collision force response for the scaled cs criterion the collision force can increase for a period of time segment a b in fig 13 after the flat bar fractures point a in fig 13 for the dynamic bwh criterion the collision force reaches its peak when the flat bar fractures point a in fig 13 then the collision force decreases slightly after that the plate fractures point b in fig 13 and the collision force decreases rapidly when using the scaled cs criterion the flat bar fractures too early so the impact force is over underestimated however the trend of collision force curve simulated by the dynamic bwh criterion is more consistent with the experimental collision force curve because the effect of stress state and strain rate on structural failure is taken into account fig 16 shows the different fracture shapes of the experiments and simulations the fracture shapes of the simulations using the dynamic bwh criterion and the scaled cs criterion are similar to the experiments however the damage extent is a little different table 3 shows that the damage extent using the dynamic bwh criterion is closer to the experiments than the scaled cs criterion in summary when predicting the failure of stiffened panels under dynamic loading the dynamic bwh criterion is better than the scale cs criterion 5 discussion the fracture shape of the falling weight experiment is different from liu et al 2015 the fracture shape may be affected by falling height friction coefficient deviation of the collision center tilt of punch during impact process and so on in this experiment the deviation of the collision center and the tilt of punch during impact process are very small friction is inevitable in the process of ship collision in fea simulations the fracture shape is also affected by mesh size the influence of friction coefficient falling height and mesh size on fracture shape is discussed in this section 5 1 effect of friction coefficient and falling height the measured kinetic friction coefficients of three steels under dry contact condition were 0 23 0 22 and 0 15 respectively karlsson et al 2009 the experimental results of haag et al 2017 shown that the friction coefficients between steel plate are 0 28 dry contact and 0 03 greased however there is no comprehensive experimental research on the friction coefficient for the contact between plates made of shipbuilding steel grades especially for coated plates in the ship collision simulation the static friction coefficient is often set to 0 3 alsos et al 2009b kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 friction influences the contact area between the indenter and the shell plates and the deformation in the shell plates consequently influences the crack patterns and the crack growth directions zhang et al 2018a the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape is studied by changing the friction coefficient and falling height of the simulation model fig 17 shows four typical fracture shapes of the stiffened panel a rhombus shaped r shaped fracture b quatrefoil shaped q shaped fracture c transition shaped t shaped fracture which is between the quatrefoil and bat shaped fracture d bat shaped b shaped fracture table 4 shows the fracture shapes of different falling height and friction coefficient in table 4 r represents for r shaped fracture q represents for q shaped fracture t represents for t shaped fracture and b represents for b shaped fracture table 4 shows that when the friction coefficient is small the fracture shape is almost q shaped this is probably because the smaller friction force has less influence on the fracture shape with the increase of friction coefficient and falling height the fracture shape changes but it seems that there is no obvious rule the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape is complicated however the fracture shape is controlled by the failure criterion where the structure first reaches failure affects the final fracture shape fig 18 shows the simulation of the fracturing process of two different fracture shapes of the stiffened panel the left part of the figure is the q shaped fracture and the right part is the b shaped fracture the fracturing process can be divided into five steps the first three steps of the two different fracture shapes are the same 1 fracture of the flat bar 2 the plate splits along the direction perpendicular to the flat bar 3 one side of the plate splits along the direction parallel to the flat bar start with the fourth step the q shaped fracture splits from point a along the direction parallel to the flat bar while the b shaped fracture splits from point b1 and b2 finally the different fracture shapes occurs here a b1 and b2 are called control points take the scaled cs criterion as an example fig 19 shows the equivalent strain time history curves of control points under different friction coefficients and falling height it shows that different friction coefficients or falling height can generate different fracture shapes if control points b1 and b2 reach the failure strain earlier the b shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 1 if control point a reaches the failure strain earlier the q shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 35 6 if control points a b1 and b2 reach the failure strain almost simultaneously the t shaped fracture will occur see fig 19 24 as the collision height changes the collision force and the contact area will also change so the friction in the collision zone will also change and it will affect the deformation of the structure thus the influence of friction coefficient and collision height on the fracture shape becomes complicated essentially they affect the failure order of structure control points thus cause different fracture shapes 5 2 effect of mesh size on fracture shape in this sub section four mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are used to study the effect of mesh size on the fracture shape with the scaled cs criterion the failure strains of mesh size larger than the plate thickness 5 mm 10 mm and 20 mm are determined by eq 4 since eq 4 is applied for elements larger than the plate thickness alsos et al 2009 the failure strain of mesh size 2 5 mm is calibrated by comparison of simulation and experiment for the calibration of the failure strain of mesh size 2 5 mm three failure strains 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 are assumed the fracture shape of the simulations with failure strains 0 3 and 0 35 are similar as fig 17 b however the fracture shape of the simulation with failure strain 0 4 is different from experiment see fig 20 because in the simulation the plate fractures before the flat bar which is contrary to the experimental results on the other hand the simulated acceleration peaks of the three failure strains are 187 m s2 269 m s2 and 416 m s2 respectively the middle one is closest to the experimental acceleration peak therefore the failure strain 0 35 is used for mesh size 2 5 mm in the following analysis fig 21 shows the fracture shapes of the simulations with different mesh sizes fine mesh 2 5 mm and 5 mm coarse mesh 10 mm and 20 mm the b shaped fracture is captured by simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm but the assumed friction coefficients are different because the fracture shape is affected by failure strain and the influence of friction coefficient is irregular as mentioned above this makes the problem more complicated table 5 shows that both the q shaped and b shaped fractures can be captured by the simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm however the simulation with mesh size 20 mm can t capture the b shaped fracture the acceleration peaks of the simulations with mesh sizes 2 5 mm 5 mm and 10 mm increase slightly with the increase of friction coefficient this indicates that the friction coefficient has little influence on the acceleration peak however there are burrs in the acceleration curves and the simulated acceleration peaks fluctuate with the increase of friction coefficient because the mesh size 20 mm is too coarse as shown in fig 22 in summary fine mesh can obtain smooth acceleration curve and capture the details of deformation and fracture of the stiffened panels while coarse mesh couldn t therefore in collision simulation the mesh size of the collision area is recommended to be close to or less than the plate thickness 6 conclusions based on the material property experiments and the falling weight experiments the dynamic response of a stiffened panel subjected to lateral impact has been studied the results show that in simulation models the mesh size the failure criterion and the friction coefficient should be considered in this study the dynamic bwh criterion is combined with the cowper symonds model thus the influence of stress state and strain rate on material failure has been considered the dynamic bwh criterion is more accurate to evaluate the failure of the stiffened panel than the scaled cs criterion there is no obvious rule in the influence of friction coefficient and falling height on fracture shape the friction in the collision zone changes with the collision height and it influences the deformation of the collision zone however the fracture shape is controlled by the failure criterion in reality the friction coefficient and falling height influence the failure order of the control points thus affects the final fracture shape mesh size also influence the fracture shape in order to capture the details of deformation and fracture shape in collision simulation the mesh size of the collision area is recommended to be close to or less than the plate thickness acknowledgements the present work

22741,based on the existing structural and system reliability analysis methods structural availability was recently proposed for the yield strength of beam elements subjected to external random loads structural availability has the potential to deal with the features of operation and the maintenance of structures as well as structural integrity in a quantitative manner this paper reports another investigation on structural availability following previous research among the two different themes of this study one is the structural availability estimation on the buckling strength of beams using the same method that was previously proposed for yield strength and the other is to formulate a general failure model that covers structural deterioration over time and then to compute the structural availability based on the failure model by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation relevant examples are also included in this article this study is expected to help further understand the feasibility of structural availability application in the actual design process and the risk based design of structures keywords structural availability structural failure model buckling strength structural deterioration risk based design 1 introduction availability which is standardized as the ability of a system to be in a state to perform a required function under given conditions at a given moment in time iec 2001 is an essential measure of the engineering integrity of large and complex systems such as oil and gas processing petrochemicals and power plants in combination with reliability maintainability and safety stapelberg 2009 availability is essentially a function of how often a system fails and how long it takes to restore the system to an operational condition after failure occurrence rac 2004 availability provides a quantitative assessment of the overall system performance at the system level taking various maintenance policies as well as inherent failure characteristics into account by applying availability in a system development and related decision making a more optimized design and its maintenance planning can be achieved since it is capable of covering even unintended operation stops such as equipment failure and subsequent repair works as well as intended operation stops such as a planned preventive maintenance in a systematic manner choung and chang 2018 demonstrated that for a slender beam element subjected to long term external random and periodic loads such as waves or winds the availability of yield strength for the lifetime can be quantitatively estimated by means of combining the conventional structural and system reliability analysis methods structural availability implies the actual utilization rate of a structural element for a given period and is defined by the probability that a structural element under loads is fully functional at any specific time for a specific time interval given that it is as good as a new one at time zero they quantitatively formulated the structural availability based on a structural failure model that was derived by the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation after simplifying the long term real operation of a structure into a sequential series of numerous idealized events called sles single load event subsequently for verifying that the structural availability of yield strength is applicable to the actual beam design process the availabilities of two example cases were investigated as well as the related cost effectiveness for the purpose of clearly understanding the feasibility of structural availability applications in the actual design process this research tackles two separate topics first structural availability associated with the buckling strength of a slender beam element is described in section 2 of this paper as a follow up to the previous study choung and chang 2018 buckling is another fundamental failure mode that must be prevented in the design of beam structures in combination with yielding failure according to timoshenko and gere 1961 the buckling of a compressive stressed structure is a structural stability problem that causes structural damage with a sudden sideway deflection even though the stress in the structure is below the elastic limit of the material used in this regard taking the buckling formula of iacs common structural rules for double hull oil tankers iacs 2010 into consideration the quantification of the structural availability of a beam element is formulated and related exemplary calculations using the design data of the previous study are also performed second this article presents a study on the derivation of a structural failure model that can reflect the time variant degradation characteristics and then proposes a general form of the structural failure model in section 3 most structures operate for long periods of time and suffer from strength degradation over time in the case of ships and offshore structures an issc report issc 2009 describes the aging situation of hulls and the related structural degradation in detail it is not easy to quantify the structural availability in an analytical manner when using a structural failure model involving time varying strength degradation for this reason this study applies a monte carlo simulation which is widely used in various reliability engineering to the example stiffener discussed in section 2 3 for estimating the structural availability based on a time dependent structural failure model 2 structural availability of beam s buckling strength as a follow up to the study of choung and chang 2018 which described the structural availability of slender beam s yield strength this section presents the structural availability estimation on a beam element in terms of the buckling strength in the case of hull design of ships slender beams such as stiffeners are typical elements for structural reinforcement and their buckling strength is as essential of a criterion as yield strength for decision making in this section we first ascertain that the structural availability method proposed for the yield strength of a beam is also applicable to the beam s buckling strength second for an example calculation on the structural availability of the buckling strength which is based on the same design data used in the previous study choung and chang 2018 relevant limit state equations are formulated by means of reconstituting the stiffener buckling formulas in the existing structural rules iacs 2010 third the structural availability of buckling strength is computed for a longitudinal bottom stiffener of an actual ship as an example fourth consideration is given to the combined structural availability based on both the yield and buckling strength lastly using the longitudinal stiffener case as an example a parametric study with 12 design changes is additionally examined 2 1 structural availability quantification for beam s buckling strength while designing a ship structure the buckling failure of a stiffener is an important criterion in the design evaluation and related decision making is made through comparing the buckling utilization factor calculated with the applied loads to the predefined allowable value thus a stiffener design with a buckling utilization factor less than the allowable value is considered safe whereas a design is seen as failed if its calculated factor is larger in this context the stiffener s response to a specific load is said to have dichotomous characteristics when considering the buckling strength as well as the yield strength since the result is one of two states such as safe and failed from this point of view it can be seen that the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation which were already applied to the structural availability estimation on a beam s yield strength by choung and chang 2018 remain in effect for estimating the structural availability of a beam s buckling strength and consequently the structural availability quantification method for the yield strength of a beam is judged to be applicable to the buckling strength of a beam as is 2 2 buckling limit state equations related to hull stiffeners regarding the buckling strength or capacity of hull stiffeners the structural rules of classification societies iacs 2010 define two failure modes such as column buckling and torsional buckling and then suggest relevant formulas for the buckling utilization factor calculation the utilization factor indicates the ratio between the acting loads and the corresponding buckling strength through reinterpreting the rules buckling formulas this study comes forth with two limit state equations equations 1 and 2 show the limit state equations generated for column buckling mode and torsional buckling mode respectively the basic concept of the limit state equations is that the

study by choung and chang 2018 presented in its second example the structural availability calculation associated with the yield strength of longitudinal bottom stiffeners using actual design data of an aframax oil carrier in addition to the previous study this sub section shows another structural availability calculation involved in the buckling strength of beams the target stiffener and its dimensions are the same as those of the second example in the previous study see fig 1 as are the applied design conditions the effect of hull girder shear forces on the stiffener is however neglected in the buckling utilization factor calculation since the double bottom structure on which the considered stiffener is located is highly robust against shear forces stochastic modelling of the design variables in equations 1 and 2 is performed by referring to the existing literature and the previous study with the details described in table 2 for the variables related to dynamic wave loads such as p wk dyn m wk dyn and c scale in table 1 the same distribution type and parameters as the previous study where the weibull distribution was applied and its scale and shape parameters were determined for each load condition and each wave heading angle using direct load analysis are used in the case of m wk stat the moment values are applied in consideration of the sagging and hogging conditions of hull girder for one sle the failure probabilities of the target stiffener associated with the column and torsional buckling modes are calculated using the limit state equations and random variable modelling this study applies the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation and uses a commercial structural reliability analysis software such as strurel the same concept of failure probability combination as the previous study which deals with each loading condition and each wave heading angle separately is adopted in this example as well the calculation results of the buckling failure probabilities are shown in tables 3 and 4 the buckling utilization factors of the target stiffener which are calculated according to the classification s rule formula iacs 2010 are 0 754 and 0 481 for the column and torsional buckling modes respectively considering that the allowable utilization factor is 0 90 the stiffener s buckling capacity is thought to be quite sufficient in light of this rule based evaluation it is not surprising that the buckling failure probabilities calculated in equations 3 and 4 are highly low values furthermore it is found that the buckling failure probabilities are significantly smaller than the yielding failure probability which was 4 266x10 12 per sle in the previous study 3 p f c o l u m n b u c k 0 6 1 956 10 25 0 4 8 894

buckling strength can be determined quantitatively assumptions on the design life total number of waves over the lifetime and the repair time are same as the second example of the previous study equations 5 and 6 show the estimated failure rates for two buckling modes and equation 7 is the repair rate common for all the bucking modes and corresponds to 30 days of mean time to repair mttr 5 λ

second example calculation of the previous study the structural availability for stiffener s yield strength was close to 100 exactly 99 9998 as well thus the actual design of the stiffener is deemed robust against buckling failure as well as yielding failure considering that most of the oil tankers rarely experience yielding and buckling failures of longitudinal bottom stiffeners provided that their designs comply with the structural rules such as iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the calculated structural availabilities close to 100 are considered reasonable 8 a t c o l u m n b u c k λ

against both the yielding failure and the buckling failure simultaneously of course the fatigue failure is also another crucial design criterion but it is beyond the scope of this study thus the structural availability is for further practical usage needed to cover both the yield strength and the buckling strength from the viewpoint of structural design this sub section describes the structural availability based on the combination of the two failure modes for a system that has multiple functions or components that need to be satisfied success or safe can be depicted with a reliability block diagram based on logical relationships of the system functions furthermore a fault tree analysis is generally used for examining the failure of the system in the case of the example stiffener in section 2 3 three functional requirements exist such as yield strength column buckling strength and torsional buckling strength a design option of the stiffener is considered success or safe provided that all the functions of it are fulfilled simultaneously from this reasoning a reliability block diagram of the stiffener is drawn as a simple serial configuration such as that in fig 2 where the three functions are assumed independent of one another this assumption is based on euler s buckling theory which reveals that the buckling capacity of a beam is governed by its geometric characteristics such as slenderness sectional properties etc rather than the yield stress limit of it according to the basic theory of system reliability rausand and hoyland 2003 the probability of failure of an entire system is calculated from the combination of each system function s or component s failure probability the combination method is dependent on the system s logical configuration such as the reliability block diagram or fault tree equation 10 shows the failure probability combination of a system in which the functions are connected in series as a whole accordingly the example stiffener with a reliability block diagram as shown in fig 2 has a total failure probability per sle of 4 302x10 12 such as equation 11 which is slightly larger than the yielding failure probability by approximately 1 the combined failure probability is based on the combination of the yield and buckling strength 10 p f s y s 1 i 1 n 1 p f i 11 p f c o m b i n e d 1 1 p f y i e l d 1 p f c o l u m

availabilities with design changes the previous study choung and chang 2018 showed a parametric study in its second example which had 12 design options for demonstrating the changes of yielding structural availability followed by design modification and a subsequent cost benefit analysis based on the availability in this study for the same design options the buckling structural availability changes are additionally investigated tables 5 and 6 summarize the calculation results of the failure probability and structural availability respectively from the graphs in fig 3 it is understood that the current structural rules of the classification societies iacs 2010 suggest that the structural requirements involve a sufficient level of structural availability from the viewpoint of the buckling strength and yield strength to the hull stiffener moreover it is deemed that the total structural availability is mainly dependent on the yield strength rather than the buckling strength in the case of bottom longitudinal stiffeners of mid sized oil tankers 3 availability in view of structural deterioration in reality most structures that are subjected to numerous external loads and exposed to the natural environment for extended periods of time have gradually declining strength over time thus structural deterioration is one of the most important design issues corrosion is widely regarded as the most critical factor in the degradation of strength especially for hull structures that are continuously exposed to a marine environment for long periods of time this section proposes a general form of the structural failure model that is able to cover the time dependent features of strength degradation and presents a monte carlo simulation that can be used for estimating the structural availability based on the time variant failure model additionally considering that corrosion wastage is one of the essential factors of structural deterioration several existing marine corrosion models are investigated then time variant failure probabilities based on the corrosion models are formulated for the example stiffener in section 2 3 on a trial basis using a monte carlo simulation structural availabilities of the example stiffener are calculated with a time variant failure model in the last sub section 3 1 time variant structural failure model for a slender beam s yield strength involved in external dynamic random loads that repeatedly occur for a long time period choung and chang 2018 presented that the probability of n failure event occurrences for a time interval between zero and t can be described as a kind of hpp homogeneous poisson process as in equation 15 in equation 14 λ denotes the average number of failures occurring per unit time and ν 0 does the average frequency of sles for the entire period that the beam is exposed to the random loads 14 λ n t p f t υ 0 p f 15 p n t n λ t n e x p λ t n n 0 1 2 now let us consider a situation where the beam s yield or buckling strength is changed with the lapse of time structural degradation with time is caused by various factors among which a decrease in the dimensions of the structural elements due to corrosion wear is deemed the most usual form of degradation if we formulate the structural deterioration as a time dependent probability of failure such as p f t the probability model of equation 15 can be rewritten as equation 17 which corresponds to a kind of nhpp non homogeneous poisson process the average number of failure occurrences per unit time λ as shown in equation 16 becomes a function of time based on the probability of failure p f t as well 16 λ t n t p f t t υ 0 p f t 17 p n t n 0 t λ τ d τ n e x p 0 t λ τ d τ n n 0 1 2 regarding a significant load event that randomly occurs with random intensity mori and ellingwood 1993 proposed a simple model for a time varying structural load as in equation 18 the simple model was inferred from the assumption that a time varying load can be regarded as a sequence of randomly occurring pulses in equation 18 λ is the mean occurrence rate of the loads subsequently li et al 2015 contemplated the time dependence of load occurrence and intensity and formulated the probability model with a time varying rate equation 19 presents that significant load occurrence events are described in a probabilistic manner with a time variant occurrence rate of λ t 18 p n 0 t n λ t n e x p λ t n n 0 1 2 19 p n 0 t n 0 t λ τ d τ n e x p 0 t λ τ d τ n n 0 1 2 according to chowdhury 2007 in ocean environments the structural responses of ships to waves can be specified based on the stochastic characteristics of random waves in a probabilistic manner considering the research it is deemed reasonable that the probability models of equations 15 and 17 which are related to structural responses are analogous to the models in equations 18 and 19 which are related to random loads provided that a structural element is subjected to environmental random loads for a long period defining the time that the first failure event occurs as t the probability of the first failure occurrence during the time interval of t t dt is expressed in equation 20 and the probability density function of the first failure event is subsequently formulated in equation 21 regarding the yield or buckling strength of a slender beam subjected to stochastic and periodic long term environmental loads its failure model can be generated by means of the probability density function like equation 21 20 p t t t d t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ d t 21 p t t t d t d t f t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ the general failure model of a slender beam s yield or buckling strength is shown in equations 22 26 and has the form of exponential distribution this failure model contains the feature of time varying degradation of the structure meanwhile the failure model that does not consider structural deterioration over time where the probability of failure is constant was addressed by the previous study in detail 22 f a i l u r e d e n s i t y f u n c t i o n f t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ 23 f a i l u r e f u n c t i o n f t 1 exp 0 t λ τ d τ 24 re l i a b i

described above is identical to the general failure model based on the exponential distribution in the system reliability analysis in general hardware reliability may adopt one of two different approaches such as the physical approach and the actuarial approach rausand and hoyland 2003 the structural reliability analysis is mainly based on the physical approach where the strength and the loads of structures are modelled as random variables by contrast the system reliability analysis uses the actuarial approach where various reliability characteristics of an item are directly generated by a specific probability distribution function that covers all information of the item together without explicit modelling of its strength and loads the two approaches have been developed and applied separately in reliability engineering the structural failure model proposed in this study however demonstrates how the structural reliability analysis and the system reliability analysis are utilized together that is it is possible to handle the reliability characteristics of structures with various methods of system reliability analysis if using the structural failure model derived through both stochastic theory and the failure probability from structural reliability analysis 3 2 instances of corrosion model and time varying failure probability for structures exposed to long term natural environmental conditions the initial strength obtained at the stage of structural design or construction is apt to decrease gradually depending on operation times and maintenance schemes hence the structural deterioration over time that is the structural ageing problem is an important issue in the lifetime performance of structures and there exist various studies on the time dependent reliability of structures thus far structural degradation associated with ageing for ships and offshore structures is said to be caused mainly from corrosion and or fatigue in the case of corrosion marine environments are known to be highly corrosive to mild and low alloy carbon steels which are broadly applied to ships and offshore structures and existing accident reports show that many cases of the structural failures of ships are attributed to highly corroded hulls emi et al 1991 while corrosion protection system such as paint coating and cathodic protection are currently applied to ships and offshore structures for preventing or reducing the corrosion effects corrosion is still a major concern in structural design and maintenance there are various marine immersion corrosion models that were suggested from a range of studies over several decades for instance southwell et al 1979 and melchers 1999 proposed linear nonlinear or power models this study considers three empirical models among the corrosion models already developed and attempts to calculate a time varying failure probability of a typical beam element the first corrosion loss model which was proposed by guedes soares and garbatov 1999 represents the time dependent structural deterioration due to general corrosion by using a non linear time function with three parameters as in equation 27 in the formula d is the long term thickness of corrosion wastage τ c is the coating life and τ t stands for the transition time qin and cui 2003 also showed another non linear model of a general uniform corrosion loss in structures subjected to the seawater environment this model has a time function with four parameters such as d t st β and η in equation 28 t st is the instant when pitting corrosion starts and β and η are weibull parameters to be determined by the statistical analysis on corrosion measurement data this is the second model considered here the last is the corrosion model of paik et al 2004 the third model as shown in equation 29 is expressed by a non linear time function with four parameters among which the coefficients c 1 and c 2 closely interact and are determined based on statistics of corrosion measurement data t t is the duration of transition and may be considered to be zero from a conservative viewpoint in equations 27 29 d t is the nominal corrosion depth of plate

demonstrate that the structural degradation is described using a time function of the failure probability a typical bottom longitudinal stiffener whose structural availabilities are calculated in section 2 3 is analyzed here on a trial basis for calculating the time dependent marine corrosion wastage based on the above three models the following assumptions on the parameters and coefficients of the models are applied periodic inspection and maintenance are not taken into consideration in this exemplary calculation d 5 50 mm τ c 5 0 years and τ t 4 5 years t c 5 0 years t st 5 0 years and t t 0 year β 1 99 and η 9 19 qin and cui 2003 c 1 0 1469 and c 2 1 0 paik et al 2004 fig 4 presents the calculation results of the change in corrosion wastages over time and associated failure probabilities that are the results of combining the yield strength and the buckling strength according to the method in section 2 4 the probabilities of the example stiffener failure are computed using the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation and a commercial structural reliability analysis software strurel from the calculation it is understood that the failure probability of the structure which is weakened over time due to marine corrosion can be represented by a specific time function as shown in equations 30 and 31 or 32 which are generated with a form of polynomial or exponential functions by a usual regression method the variable t is the yearly unit the initial failure probability based on no corrosion wastage occurrence is 4 302x10 12 per sle and the later failure probability involved in a full corrosion wastage deduction is 1 323x10 5 quedes and qin model or 3 577x10 6 paik model approximately 30 p f t 4 693 10 11 t 4 4 630 10 9 t 3 1 405 10

542 10 7 t 2 1 264 10 6 t 1 487 10 6 f o r p a i k mod e l from the graphs in fig 4 it is found that after approximately 20 years corrosion wastages of the first and second models i e guedes model and qin model cease to increase and begin to remain constant as the operation time passes however the paik model maintains its linear tendency of corrosion wastage increases over time even after 20 years of operation it is presumed that the third model does not consider the effect of corroded material protecting the structure s surface from contact with the corrosive environment while staying attached to the surface guedes soares and garbatov 1999 3 3 structural availability using monte carlo simulation the production or operation availability of a certain system is determined by the difference between the expected numbers of failures and repairs during the time interval from zero to t kumamoto and henley 1996 as shown in equation 33 the expected number of failures and repairs during 0 t which correspond to w 0 t and v 0 t respectively are defined by means of w t and v t 33 a t 1 w 0 t v 0 t 34 w 0 t 0 t w t d t 35 v 0 t 0 t v t d t the unconditional failure intensity w t and the unconditional repair intensity v t are calculated via the iterative numerical integration of equations 36 and 37 provided that the failure and repair density functions f t and g t are known in the case that the density functions have constant failure and repair rates the iterative integral equations can be solved in an analytical way such as with the laplace transform method however if the failure or repair rates are not constant but functions varying with independent variables e g functions of time it is either not easy or not possible to analytically obtain the solutions of equations 36 and 37 depending on the types of f t and g t 36 w t f t 0 t f t u v u d u 37 v t 0 t g t u w u d u in the case of a complex and large scale system the monte carlo simulation approach can be used for the production or operation availability estimation since analytical approaches have limitations verma et al 2010 monte carlo simulation has the advantage of effectively dealing with the reliability analysis including a production availability estimation on a complicated system that consists of a large number of components and involves various operation concepts and failure modes compared to analytical approaches marquez et al 2005 in practice monte carlo simulation is widely applied to reliability engineering for complex system in various fields such as petrochemical industry power plant industry and so forth zio et al 2006 for a structural element in which its failure model is defined as a specific function the structural availability can be calculated in the same way as the method of availability estimation by a direct monte carlo simulation approach chang et al 2010 further details on monte carlo simulation can be found in amstadter 1971 and fishman 1996 a structural element can be assumed to have two states at a certain time safe and failed when accounting for its yielding or buckling failure mode the transition times between the two states are directly sampled using the inverse transform method labeau and zio 2002 through equation 38 based on the failure function in equation 23 in section 3 1 the time t j m is the transition time for the state of the element to change from j to m in this study the transition time involves only the two states of a structural element such as safe and failed the number u j m is generated at that time by random sampling and has a value between zero and one 38 t j m t 0 f 1 u j m w h e r e u j m u 0 1 sampling of the transition time begins at t 0 when the element is in a safe state after sampling the state transition from safe to failed occurs and the time is recorded on a timeline when failure occurs in the element its next transition happens exactly at the completion of the required repair this process is repeated until the next transition time does not exceed the lifetime of the element the monte carlo simulation then generates a random walk of the element from one configuration to another at successive times the simulation is implemented a specified number of times m if we let a i be the availability of the element in the i th random walk where i 1 2 m the final availability a is given as the mean of the individual random walks rausand and hoyland 2003 as in equation 39 after all trials of the monte carlo simulation 39 a i 1 m a i m 3 4 exemplary calculation on longitudinal stiffener using monte carlo simulation regarding the longitudinal stiffener in section 2 3 and its yield and bucking strength combined structural availability based on the time dependent deterioration

the failure model expressed in equation 23 and is determined by using the time variant failure probability function this example considers the three corrosion models explained in section 3 2 such as guedes qin and paik models and corresponding failure probability functions as presented in equations 30 32 the resultant failure rates and failure models based on the time variant structural degradation along the corrosion progression are shown in equations 40 45 where t is the yearly unit information of the stiffener operation and maintenance which is required for availability

is identical to the initial state of a structure before marine corrosion occurs the combined failure probability is approximately 4 302x10 12 per sle as mentioned earlier and the subsequent structural availability is estimated at approximately 99 9998 for all kinds of operation times equation 46 shows the structural availability calculation in an analytical manner which is nearly the same as the

5 which are virtual trend lines derived from the data obtained by monte carlo simulation using the time variant structural failure model it is obvious that a decrease in the structural availability of the longitudinal stiffener exists in accordance with an increase in corrosion wastage over time even though the reduction rates are small as a result from this exemplary calculation we can understand the features of structural availability as follows the availability of a structure can be decreased by its structural deterioration the time variant availability of a structure can be quantified provided that a failure model is established as a specific time function based on its structural deterioration over time and structural availability based on a failure model that varies with time can be calculated by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation 4 conclusion in a recent study by choung and chang 2018 the structural availability quantification method was proposed for the yield strength of beam elements subjected to long term periodic random loads and its application to risk based structural design was also discussed this article describes subsequent research to this previous study which reveals the potential of structural availability to be utilized in the structural design process as a novel design criterion regarding the two different subjects covered in this study the first one in section 2 demonstrates that the buckling strength of beam elements can be evaluated in terms of structural availability derived by using the same method as previously proposed for the beam s yield strength and gives a related example calculation on the longitudinal bottom stiffeners of a ship for the actual design implementation of a beam there exist several failure modes such as yielding and buckling that must be considered simultaneously this section also shows the combined structural availability of a beam based on the two failure modes using a reliability block diagram in section 3 which contains the second research subject structural availability based on a time dependent structural failure model is explored most structures experience structural deterioration over time in real operations thus time varying strength degradation is a crucial issue in structural design in this regard this study proposes a general form of the structural failure model that covers strength degradation over time and is expressed with an exponential distribution section 3 shows a relevant structural availability calculation by means of monte carlo simulation for the same stiffener example design covered in section 2 here one of the existing marine corrosion wastage models is applied to the time variant failure model definition from the calculation results of the stiffener example the followings are determined the structural availability of structures whose strength varies over time can be quantified by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation provided that their failure model is defined as a time function and the availability of a structure subjected to structural deterioration decreases gradually with operating time production or operation availability is widely utilized in the design and engineering of large and complex systems such as oil and gas processing petrochemicals power plants etc since it can quantitatively indicate overall system performance in consideration of various maintenance policies as well as inherent failure characteristics applying the availability concept in structural design as a new design measure it is anticipated that we can achieve an optimal design based on the features related to structural operation and maintenance and contribute to implementing risk based structural design lastly for the practical application of structural availability in the actual ship structural design process it is believed that further studies on the followings need to be conducted in the future structural availability evaluation criteria probabilistic modelling of structural repairs fatigue failure mode of a beam element new yielding and buckling formula of the latest

22741,based on the existing structural and system reliability analysis methods structural availability was recently proposed for the yield strength of beam elements subjected to external random loads structural availability has the potential to deal with the features of operation and the maintenance of structures as well as structural integrity in a quantitative manner this paper reports another investigation on structural availability following previous research among the two different themes of this study one is the structural availability estimation on the buckling strength of beams using the same method that was previously proposed for yield strength and the other is to formulate a general failure model that covers structural deterioration over time and then to compute the structural availability based on the failure model by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation relevant examples are also included in this article this study is expected to help further understand the feasibility of structural availability application in the actual design process and the risk based design of structures keywords structural availability structural failure model buckling strength structural deterioration risk based design 1 introduction availability which is standardized as the ability of a system to be in a state to perform a required function under given conditions at a given moment in time iec 2001 is an essential measure of the engineering integrity of large and complex systems such as oil and gas processing petrochemicals and power plants in combination with reliability maintainability and safety stapelberg 2009 availability is essentially a function of how often a system fails and how long it takes to restore the system to an operational condition after failure occurrence rac 2004 availability provides a quantitative assessment of the overall system performance at the system level taking various maintenance policies as well as inherent failure characteristics into account by applying availability in a system development and related decision making a more optimized design and its maintenance planning can be achieved since it is capable of covering even unintended operation stops such as equipment failure and subsequent repair works as well as intended operation stops such as a planned preventive maintenance in a systematic manner choung and chang 2018 demonstrated that for a slender beam element subjected to long term external random and periodic loads such as waves or winds the availability of yield strength for the lifetime can be quantitatively estimated by means of combining the conventional structural and system reliability analysis methods structural availability implies the actual utilization rate of a structural element for a given period and is defined by the probability that a structural element under loads is fully functional at any specific time for a specific time interval given that it is as good as a new one at time zero they quantitatively formulated the structural availability based on a structural failure model that was derived by the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation after simplifying the long term real operation of a structure into a sequential series of numerous idealized events called sles single load event subsequently for verifying that the structural availability of yield strength is applicable to the actual beam design process the availabilities of two example cases were investigated as well as the related cost effectiveness for the purpose of clearly understanding the feasibility of structural availability applications in the actual design process this research tackles two separate topics first structural availability associated with the buckling strength of a slender beam element is described in section 2 of this paper as a follow up to the previous study choung and chang 2018 buckling is another fundamental failure mode that must be prevented in the design of beam structures in combination with yielding failure according to timoshenko and gere 1961 the buckling of a compressive stressed structure is a structural stability problem that causes structural damage with a sudden sideway deflection even though the stress in the structure is below the elastic limit of the material used in this regard taking the buckling formula of iacs common structural rules for double hull oil tankers iacs 2010 into consideration the quantification of the structural availability of a beam element is formulated and related exemplary calculations using the design data of the previous study are also performed second this article presents a study on the derivation of a structural failure model that can reflect the time variant degradation characteristics and then proposes a general form of the structural failure model in section 3 most structures operate for long periods of time and suffer from strength degradation over time in the case of ships and offshore structures an issc report issc 2009 describes the aging situation of hulls and the related structural degradation in detail it is not easy to quantify the structural availability in an analytical manner when using a structural failure model involving time varying strength degradation for this reason this study applies a monte carlo simulation which is widely used in various reliability engineering to the example stiffener discussed in section 2 3 for estimating the structural availability based on a time dependent structural failure model 2 structural availability of beam s buckling strength as a follow up to the study of choung and chang 2018 which described the structural availability of slender beam s yield strength this section presents the structural availability estimation on a beam element in terms of the buckling strength in the case of hull design of ships slender beams such as stiffeners are typical elements for structural reinforcement and their buckling strength is as essential of a criterion as yield strength for decision making in this section we first ascertain that the structural availability method proposed for the yield strength of a beam is also applicable to the beam s buckling strength second for an example calculation on the structural availability of the buckling strength which is based on the same design data used in the previous study choung and chang 2018 relevant limit state equations are formulated by means of reconstituting the stiffener buckling formulas in the existing structural rules iacs 2010 third the structural availability of buckling strength is computed for a longitudinal bottom stiffener of an actual ship as an example fourth consideration is given to the combined structural availability based on both the yield and buckling strength lastly using the longitudinal stiffener case as an example a parametric study with 12 design changes is additionally examined 2 1 structural availability quantification for beam s buckling strength while designing a ship structure the buckling failure of a stiffener is an important criterion in the design evaluation and related decision making is made through comparing the buckling utilization factor calculated with the applied loads to the predefined allowable value thus a stiffener design with a buckling utilization factor less than the allowable value is considered safe whereas a design is seen as failed if its calculated factor is larger in this context the stiffener s response to a specific load is said to have dichotomous characteristics when considering the buckling strength as well as the yield strength since the result is one of two states such as safe and failed from this point of view it can be seen that the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation which were already applied to the structural availability estimation on a beam s yield strength by choung and chang 2018 remain in effect for estimating the structural availability of a beam s buckling strength and consequently the structural availability quantification method for the yield strength of a beam is judged to be applicable to the buckling strength of a beam as is 2 2 buckling limit state equations related to hull stiffeners regarding the buckling strength or capacity of hull stiffeners the structural rules of classification societies iacs 2010 define two failure modes such as column buckling and torsional buckling and then suggest relevant formulas for the buckling utilization factor calculation the utilization factor indicates the ratio between the acting loads and the corresponding buckling strength through reinterpreting the rules buckling formulas this study comes forth with two limit state equations equations 1 and 2 show the limit state equations generated for column buckling mode and torsional buckling mode respectively the basic concept of the limit state equations is that the buckling utilization factor based on applied loads is not to be larger than the allowable factor prescribed in the rules detailed explanations for the design variables contained in the buckling limit

study by choung and chang 2018 presented in its second example the structural availability calculation associated with the yield strength of longitudinal bottom stiffeners using actual design data of an aframax oil carrier in addition to the previous study this sub section shows another structural availability calculation involved in the buckling strength of beams the target stiffener and its dimensions are the same as those of the second example in the previous study see fig 1 as are the applied design conditions the effect of hull girder shear forces on the stiffener is however neglected in the buckling utilization factor calculation since the double bottom structure on which the considered stiffener is located is highly robust against shear forces stochastic modelling of the design variables in equations 1 and 2 is performed by referring to the existing literature and the previous study with the details described in table 2 for the variables related to dynamic wave loads such as p wk dyn m wk dyn and c scale in table 1 the same distribution type and parameters as the previous study where the weibull distribution was applied and its scale and shape parameters were determined for each load condition and each wave heading angle using direct load analysis are used in the case of m wk stat the moment values are applied in consideration of the sagging and hogging conditions of hull girder for one sle the failure probabilities of the target stiffener associated with the column and torsional buckling modes are calculated using the limit state equations and random variable modelling this study applies the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation and uses a commercial structural reliability analysis software such as strurel the same concept of failure probability combination as the previous study which deals with each loading condition and each wave heading angle separately is adopted in this example as well the calculation results of the buckling failure probabilities are shown in tables 3 and 4 the buckling utilization factors of the target stiffener which are calculated according to the classification s rule formula iacs 2010 are 0 754 and 0 481 for the column and torsional buckling modes respectively considering that the allowable utilization factor is 0 90 the stiffener s buckling capacity is thought to be quite sufficient in light of this rule based evaluation it is not surprising that the buckling failure probabilities calculated in equations 3 and 4 are highly low values furthermore it is found that the buckling failure probabilities are significantly smaller than the yielding failure probability which was 4 266x10 12 per sle in the previous study 3 p f c o l u m n b u c k 0 6 1 956 10 25 0 4 8 894

buckling strength can be determined quantitatively assumptions on the design life total number of waves over the lifetime and the repair time are same as the second example of the previous study equations 5 and 6 show the estimated failure rates for two buckling modes and equation 7 is the repair rate common for all the bucking modes and corresponds to 30 days of mean time to repair mttr 5 λ

1 m t t r 1 2 592 10 6 3 858 10 7 s 1 consequently the structural availabilities of the stiffener for the buckling strength are estimated at almost 100 as shown in equations 8 and 9 as seen in the second example calculation of the previous study the structural availability for stiffener s yield strength was close to 100 exactly 99 9998 as well thus the actual design of the stiffener is deemed robust against buckling failure as well as yielding failure considering that most of the oil tankers rarely experience yielding and buckling failures of longitudinal bottom stiffeners provided that their designs comply with the structural rules such as iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the calculated structural availabilities close to 100 are considered reasonable 8 a t c o l u m n b u c k λ

against both the yielding failure and the buckling failure simultaneously of course the fatigue failure is also another crucial design criterion but it is beyond the scope of this study thus the structural availability is for further practical usage needed to cover both the yield strength and the buckling strength from the viewpoint of structural design this sub section describes the structural availability based on the combination of the two failure modes for a system that has multiple functions or components that need to be satisfied success or safe can be depicted with a reliability block diagram based on logical relationships of the system functions furthermore a fault tree analysis is generally used for examining the failure of the system in the case of the example stiffener in section 2 3 three functional requirements exist such as yield strength column buckling strength and torsional buckling strength a design option of the stiffener is considered success or safe provided that all the functions of it are fulfilled simultaneously from this reasoning a reliability block diagram of the stiffener is drawn as a simple serial configuration such as that in fig 2 where the three functions are assumed independent of one another this assumption is based on euler s buckling theory which reveals that the buckling capacity of a beam is governed by its geometric characteristics such as slenderness sectional properties etc rather than the yield stress limit of it according to the basic theory of system reliability rausand and hoyland 2003 the probability of failure of an entire system is calculated from the combination of each system function s or component s failure probability the combination method is dependent on the system s logical configuration such as the reliability block diagram or fault tree equation 10 shows the failure probability combination of a system in which the functions are connected in series as a whole accordingly the example stiffener with a reliability block diagram as shown in fig 2 has a total failure probability per sle of 4 302x10 12 such as equation 11 which is slightly larger than the yielding failure probability by approximately 1 the combined failure probability is based on the combination of the yield and buckling strength 10 p f s y s 1 i 1 n 1 p f i 11 p f c o m b i n e d 1 1 p f y i e l d 1 p f c o l u m

in equations 12 and 13 respectively compared to the individual structural availability for the three failure modes it is found that the combined availability decreases slightly 12 λ c o m b i n e d n

availabilities with design changes the previous study choung and chang 2018 showed a parametric study in its second example which had 12 design options for demonstrating the changes of yielding structural availability followed by design modification and a subsequent cost benefit analysis based on the availability in this study for the same design options the buckling structural availability changes are additionally investigated tables 5 and 6 summarize the calculation results of the failure probability and structural availability respectively from the graphs in fig 3 it is understood that the current structural rules of the classification societies iacs 2010 suggest that the structural requirements involve a sufficient level of structural availability from the viewpoint of the buckling strength and yield strength to the hull stiffener moreover it is deemed that the total structural availability is mainly dependent on the yield strength rather than the buckling strength in the case of bottom longitudinal stiffeners of mid sized oil tankers 3 availability in view of structural deterioration in reality most structures that are subjected to numerous external loads and exposed to the natural environment for extended periods of time have gradually declining strength over time thus structural deterioration is one of the most important design issues corrosion is widely regarded as the most critical factor in the degradation of strength especially for hull structures that are continuously exposed to a marine environment for long periods of time this section proposes a general form of the structural failure model that is able to cover the time dependent features of strength degradation and presents a monte carlo simulation that can be used for estimating the structural availability based on the time variant failure model additionally considering that corrosion wastage is one of the essential factors of structural deterioration several existing marine corrosion models are investigated then time variant failure probabilities based on the corrosion models are formulated for the example stiffener in section 2 3 on a trial basis using a monte carlo simulation structural availabilities of the example stiffener are calculated with a time variant failure model in the last sub section 3 1 time variant structural failure model for a slender beam s yield strength involved in external dynamic random loads that repeatedly occur for a long time period choung and chang 2018 presented that the probability of n failure event occurrences for a time interval between zero and t can be described as a kind of hpp homogeneous poisson process as in equation 15 in equation 14 λ denotes the average number of failures occurring per unit time and ν 0 does the average frequency of sles for the entire period that the beam is exposed to the random loads 14 λ n t p f t υ 0 p f 15 p n t n λ t n e x p λ t n n 0 1 2 now let us consider a situation where the beam s yield or buckling strength is changed with the lapse of time structural degradation with time is caused by various factors among which a decrease in the dimensions of the structural elements due to corrosion wear is deemed the most usual form of degradation if we formulate the structural deterioration as a time dependent probability of failure such as p f t the probability model of equation 15 can be rewritten as equation 17 which corresponds to a kind of nhpp non homogeneous poisson process the average number of failure occurrences per unit time λ as shown in equation 16 becomes a function of time based on the probability of failure p f t as well 16 λ t n t p f t t υ 0 p f t 17 p n t n 0 t λ τ d τ n e x p 0 t λ τ d τ n n 0 1 2 regarding a significant load event that randomly occurs with random intensity mori and ellingwood 1993 proposed a simple model for a time varying structural load as in equation 18 the simple model was inferred from the assumption that a time varying load can be regarded as a sequence of randomly occurring pulses in equation 18 λ is the mean occurrence rate of the loads subsequently li et al 2015 contemplated the time dependence of load occurrence and intensity and formulated the probability model with a time varying rate equation 19 presents that significant load occurrence events are described in a probabilistic manner with a time variant occurrence rate of λ t 18 p n 0 t n λ t n e x p λ t n n 0 1 2 19 p n 0 t n 0 t λ τ d τ n e x p 0 t λ τ d τ n n 0 1 2 according to chowdhury 2007 in ocean environments the structural responses of ships to waves can be specified based on the stochastic characteristics of random waves in a probabilistic manner considering the research it is deemed reasonable that the probability models of equations 15 and 17 which are related to structural responses are analogous to the models in equations 18 and 19 which are related to random loads provided that a structural element is subjected to environmental random loads for a long period defining the time that the first failure event occurs as t the probability of the first failure occurrence during the time interval of t t dt is expressed in equation 20 and the probability density function of the first failure event is subsequently formulated in equation 21 regarding the yield or buckling strength of a slender beam subjected to stochastic and periodic long term environmental loads its failure model can be generated by means of the probability density function like equation 21 20 p t t t d t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ d t 21 p t t t d t d t f t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ the general failure model of a slender beam s yield or buckling strength is shown in equations 22 26 and has the form of exponential distribution this failure model contains the feature of time varying degradation of the structure meanwhile the failure model that does not consider structural deterioration over time where the probability of failure is constant was addressed by the previous study in detail 22 f a i l u r e d e n s i t y f u n c t i o n f t λ t exp 0 t λ τ d τ 23 f a i l u r e f u n c t i o n f t 1 exp 0 t λ τ d τ 24 re l i a b i

described above is identical to the general failure model based on the exponential distribution in the system reliability analysis in general hardware reliability may adopt one of two different approaches such as the physical approach and the actuarial approach rausand and hoyland 2003 the structural reliability analysis is mainly based on the physical approach where the strength and the loads of structures are modelled as random variables by contrast the system reliability analysis uses the actuarial approach where various reliability characteristics of an item are directly generated by a specific probability distribution function that covers all information of the item together without explicit modelling of its strength and loads the two approaches have been developed and applied separately in reliability engineering the structural failure model proposed in this study however demonstrates how the structural reliability analysis and the system reliability analysis are utilized together that is it is possible to handle the reliability characteristics of structures with various methods of system reliability analysis if using the structural failure model derived through both stochastic theory and the failure probability from structural reliability analysis 3 2 instances of corrosion model and time varying failure probability for structures exposed to long term natural environmental conditions the initial strength obtained at the stage of structural design or construction is apt to decrease gradually depending on operation times and maintenance schemes hence the structural deterioration over time that is the structural ageing problem is an important issue in the lifetime performance of structures and there exist various studies on the time dependent reliability of structures thus far structural degradation associated with ageing for ships and offshore structures is said to be caused mainly from corrosion and or fatigue in the case of corrosion marine environments are known to be highly corrosive to mild and low alloy carbon steels which are broadly applied to ships and offshore structures and existing accident reports show that many cases of the structural failures of ships are attributed to highly corroded hulls emi et al 1991 while corrosion protection system such as paint coating and cathodic protection are currently applied to ships and offshore structures for preventing or reducing the corrosion effects corrosion is still a major concern in structural design and maintenance there are various marine immersion corrosion models that were suggested from a range of studies over several decades for instance southwell et al 1979 and melchers 1999 proposed linear nonlinear or power models this study considers three empirical models among the corrosion models already developed and attempts to calculate a time varying failure probability of a typical beam element the first corrosion loss model which was proposed by guedes soares and garbatov 1999 represents the time dependent structural deterioration due to general corrosion by using a non linear time function with three parameters as in equation 27 in the formula d is the long term thickness of corrosion wastage τ c is the coating life and τ t stands for the transition time qin and cui 2003 also showed another non linear model of a general uniform corrosion loss in structures subjected to the seawater environment this model has a time function with four parameters such as d t st β and η in equation 28 t st is the instant when pitting corrosion starts and β and η are weibull parameters to be determined by the statistical analysis on corrosion measurement data this is the second model considered here the last is the corrosion model of paik et al 2004 the third model as shown in equation 29 is expressed by a non linear time function with four parameters among which the coefficients c 1 and c 2 closely interact and are determined based on statistics of corrosion measurement data t t is the duration of transition and may be considered to be zero from a conservative viewpoint in equations 27 29 d t is the nominal corrosion depth of plate at time t 27 d t 0 f o r 0 t τ c d t d 1 e x p t τ c τ t f o r τ c t 28 d t 0 f o r 0 t t s t d t d 1 e x p t t s t η β f o r t s t t 29 d t 0 f o r 0 t t c d t c 1 t t c t t c 2 f o r t c t to demonstrate that the structural degradation is described using a time function of the failure probability a typical bottom longitudinal stiffener whose structural availabilities are calculated in section 2 3 is analyzed here on a trial basis for calculating the time dependent marine corrosion wastage based on the above three models the following assumptions on the parameters and coefficients of the models are applied periodic inspection and maintenance are not taken into consideration in this exemplary calculation d 5 50 mm τ c 5 0 years and τ t 4 5 years t c 5 0 years t st 5 0 years and t t 0 year β 1 99 and η 9 19 qin and cui 2003 c 1 0 1469 and c 2 1 0 paik et al 2004 fig 4 presents the calculation results of the change in corrosion wastages over time and associated failure probabilities that are the results of combining the yield strength and the buckling strength according to the method in section 2 4 the probabilities of the example stiffener failure are computed using the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation and a commercial structural reliability analysis software strurel from the calculation it is understood that the failure probability of the structure which is weakened over time due to marine corrosion can be represented by a specific time function as shown in equations 30 and 31 or 32 which are generated with a form of polynomial or exponential functions by a usual regression method the variable t is the yearly unit the initial failure probability based on no corrosion wastage occurrence is 4 302x10 12 per sle and the later failure probability involved in a full corrosion wastage deduction is 1 323x10 5 quedes and qin model or 3 577x10 6 paik model approximately 30 p f t 4 693 10 11 t 4 4 630 10 9 t 3 1 405 10

542 10 7 t 2 1 264 10 6 t 1 487 10 6 f o r p a i k mod e l from the graphs in fig 4 it is found that after approximately 20 years corrosion wastages of the first and second models i e guedes model and qin model cease to increase and begin to remain constant as the operation time passes however the paik model maintains its linear tendency of corrosion wastage increases over time even after 20 years of operation it is presumed that the third model does not consider the effect of corroded material protecting the structure s surface from contact with the corrosive environment while staying attached to the surface guedes soares and garbatov 1999 3 3 structural availability using monte carlo simulation the production or operation availability of a certain system is determined by the difference between the expected numbers of failures and repairs during the time interval from zero to t kumamoto and henley 1996 as shown in equation 33 the expected number of failures and repairs during 0 t which correspond to w 0 t and v 0 t respectively are defined by means of w t and v t 33 a t 1 w 0 t v 0 t 34 w 0 t 0 t w t d t 35 v 0 t 0 t v t d t the unconditional failure intensity w t and the unconditional repair intensity v t are calculated via the iterative numerical integration of equations 36 and 37 provided that the failure and repair density functions f t and g t are known in the case that the density functions have constant failure and repair rates the iterative integral equations can be solved in an analytical way such as with the laplace transform method however if the failure or repair rates are not constant but functions varying with independent variables e g functions of time it is either not easy or not possible to analytically obtain the solutions of equations 36 and 37 depending on the types of f t and g t 36 w t f t 0 t f t u v u d u 37 v t 0 t g t u w u d u in the case of a complex and large scale system the monte carlo simulation approach can be used for the production or operation availability estimation since analytical approaches have limitations verma et al 2010 monte carlo simulation has the advantage of effectively dealing with the reliability analysis including a production availability estimation on a complicated system that consists of a large number of components and involves various operation concepts and failure modes compared to analytical approaches marquez et al 2005 in practice monte carlo simulation is widely applied to reliability engineering for complex system in various fields such as petrochemical industry power plant industry and so forth zio et al 2006 for a structural element in which its failure model is defined as a specific function the structural availability can be calculated in the same way as the method of availability estimation by a direct monte carlo simulation approach chang et al 2010 further details on monte carlo simulation can be found in amstadter 1971 and fishman 1996 a structural element can be assumed to have two states at a certain time safe and failed when accounting for its yielding or buckling failure mode the transition times between the two states are directly sampled using the inverse transform method labeau and zio 2002 through equation 38 based on the failure function in equation 23 in section 3 1 the time t j m is the transition time for the state of the element to change from j to m in this study the transition time involves only the two states of a structural element such as safe and failed the number u j m is generated at that time by random sampling and has a value between zero and one 38 t j m t 0 f 1 u j m w h e r e u j m u 0 1 sampling of the transition time begins at t 0 when the element is in a safe state after sampling the state transition from safe to failed occurs and the time is recorded on a timeline when failure occurs in the element its next transition happens exactly at the completion of the required repair this process is repeated until the next transition time does not exceed the lifetime of the element the monte carlo simulation then generates a random walk of the element from one configuration to another at successive times the simulation is implemented a specified number of times m if we let a i be the availability of the element in the i th random walk where i 1 2 m the final availability a is given as the mean of the individual random walks rausand and hoyland 2003 as in equation 39 after all trials of the monte carlo simulation 39 a i 1 m a i m 3 4 exemplary calculation on longitudinal stiffener using monte carlo simulation regarding the longitudinal stiffener in section 2 3 and its yield and bucking strength combined structural availability based on the time dependent deterioration due to marine corrosion is calculated in this sub section by means of direct monte carlo simulation the stiffener s structural degradation over time is modelled as a specific time function which is the failure model expressed in equation 23 and is determined by using the time variant failure probability function this example considers the three corrosion models explained in section 3 2 such as

5 which are virtual trend lines derived from the data obtained by monte carlo simulation using the time variant structural failure model it is obvious that a decrease in the structural availability of the longitudinal stiffener exists in accordance with an increase in corrosion wastage over time even though the reduction rates are small as a result from this exemplary calculation we can understand the features of structural availability as follows the availability of a structure can be decreased by its structural deterioration the time variant availability of a structure can be quantified provided that a failure model is established as a specific time function based on its structural deterioration over time and structural availability based on a failure model that varies with time can be calculated by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation 4 conclusion in a recent study by choung and chang 2018 the structural availability quantification method was proposed for the yield strength of beam elements subjected to long term periodic random loads and its application to risk based structural design was also discussed this article describes subsequent research to this previous study which reveals the potential of structural availability to be utilized in the structural design process as a novel design criterion regarding the two different subjects covered in this study the first one in section 2 demonstrates that the buckling strength of beam elements can be evaluated in terms of structural availability derived by using the same method as previously proposed for the beam s yield strength and gives a related example calculation on the longitudinal bottom stiffeners of a ship for the actual design implementation of a beam there exist several failure modes such as yielding and buckling that must be considered simultaneously this section also shows the combined structural availability of a beam based on the two failure modes using a reliability block diagram in section 3 which contains the second research subject structural availability based on a time dependent structural failure model is explored most structures experience structural deterioration over time in real operations thus time varying strength degradation is a crucial issue in structural design in this regard this study proposes a general form of the structural failure model that covers strength degradation over time and is expressed with an exponential distribution section 3 shows a relevant structural availability calculation by means of monte carlo simulation for the same stiffener example design covered in section 2 here one of the existing marine corrosion wastage models is applied to the time variant failure model definition from the calculation results of the stiffener example the followings are determined the structural availability of structures whose strength varies over time can be quantified by means of a numerical method such as monte carlo simulation provided that their failure model is defined as a time function and the availability of a structure subjected to structural deterioration decreases gradually with operating time production or operation availability is widely utilized in the design and engineering of large and complex systems such as oil and gas processing petrochemicals power plants etc since it can quantitatively indicate overall system performance in consideration of various maintenance policies as well as inherent failure characteristics applying the availability concept in structural design as a new design measure it is anticipated that we can achieve an optimal design based on the features related to structural operation and maintenance and contribute to implementing risk based structural design lastly for the practical application of structural availability in the actual ship structural design process it is believed that further studies on the followings need to be conducted in the future structural availability evaluation criteria probabilistic modelling of structural repairs fatigue failure mode of a beam element new yielding and buckling formula of the latest

22742,the influences of helical strake geometry and vortex induced vibration viv on the drag coefficients of a long flexible pipe with helical strakes are investigated through uniform flow experiments with the reynolds re number ranging from 1 1 104 to 9 5 104 the strains caused by drag forces of a bare pipe and six different straked pipes are measured by fiber bragg grating fbg sensors according to the inverse analysis method and morison formula the drag forces and coefficients at each section of the pipe models are identified then the mean drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes are compared the results show that helical strakes can effectively stabilize the fluctuation of drag coefficients with re numbers an unexpected phenomenon is that helical strakes with pitches of 5 d can reduce the mean drag coefficients moreover the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes are less sensitive to viv response furthermore an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for straked pipes is proposed which accounts for the viv response and geometry of helical strakes its applicability is well verified via comparison between predicted and experimental results keywords vortex

ocean currents marine risers will undergo significant vortex induced vibration viv in the cross flow cf direction viv can lead to severe fatigue damage to risers and becomes one of the key issues in the engineering of risers to suppress viv two main methods are proposed active control and passive control the main difference between them is that active control needs additional power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not passive control methods have gained much more attention due to their ease in manufacturing and have been previously studied by many researchers allen et al 2006 bearman and owen 1998 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2006 among the various forms of passive control helical strakes have been widely applied in practical projects as a typical device of passive control although helical strakes serve as an effective viv suppression device by altering the separation characteristics over the cross section of the riser as well as in a spanwise direction they can also lead to a significant magnification in mean drag api 1998 as we know the mean drag force is one of the important reasons for the failure of the riser strength in the progressive collapse limit states analysis pls the morison formula is used to calculate the mean drag force and then von mises stress is induced to verify the reliability when using the morison formula to calculate the mean drag force the drag coefficient is a very crucial factor affecting the predicted force based on rigid cylinder towing experiments most specifications give the recommended values of mean drag coefficients for smooth cylinders at high reynolds numbers while no clear recommended mean drag coefficient has been proposed for straked pipes therefore it is necessary to study the mean drag coefficients of flexible straked pipes and their features undergoing viv recently most researches focus on the viv response and the suppression efficiency of the straked pipes few of them pay attention to the drag coefficient of the straked pipes korkischko et al 2007 presented mean drag coefficients for cylinders with different helical strakes and an obvious amplification was observed through the stationary towing experiments which consisted of six different helical strakes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 1 d and 0 2 d within the range of the reynolds number from 2000 to 10000 for the stationary towing test of the rigid cylinders the drag force acting on the cylinder can be easily measured by the force sensor however the towing test of stationary rigid cylinder has not considered the influences of viv response and three dimensional flow hence the experiment conditions are very different from the practical conditions former studies have found that the cross flow vibration can cause a significant amplification on the drag coefficient of the bare flexible pipe blevins 1990 chaplin et al 2005 vandiver 1985 wilde et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 therefore it is more reasonable to study the mean drag coefficients of helical straked flexible pipes by using scaled model tests quen et al 2014 presents experiments of straked flexible pipes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d under uniform flow with re numbers ranging from 1400 to 13800 unexpectedly based on the drag force measured at both ends a phenomena that bare cylinders possess higher drag coefficients than the straked pipes is found which is contrary to beliefs reported by api 1998 thus the effects of helical strakes on drag coefficients are still unclear compared with experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics cfd is an ideal method to study the mechanisms of complex fluid structure interactions fsi problem sarpkaya 2004 however there are few cfd studies due to the complex hydrodynamic shape of straked cylinders and the lower calculation efficiency constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 thiagarajan and constantinides 2005 studied the viv suppression mechanism of helical strakes they found that the strakes can alter shedding separation and prevent interaction between two shear layers these main effects not only suppress viv but also change the pressure distribution downstream of the circular cylinder and amplify the drag force overall studies about the drag force and coefficients with regard to the strake geometry and viv are scarce thus the mean drag force and its features on straked pipes still require further investigation in this paper viv experiments for straked pipes with different geometrical parameters are conducted in uniform flow the strains on the surface of the straked pipe models are measured by a fiber bragg grating fbg sensor using the inverse beam bending theory and the morison formula the drag force and the mean drag coefficient at each cross section along the axial length are calculated compared with bare pipes the drag coefficients of straked pipes in uniform flow are further investigated moreover the influences of helical strake geometry and viv response on drag coefficients are analyzed finally an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for these straked pipes is proposed 2 experimental apparatus the experiments are carried out in a towing tank with 192 m long 10 m wide and 4 2 m deep the flexible pipe model is horizontally mounted on a streamline yoke under the towing carriage at a water depth of 1 5 m the universal joints are used to connect the pipe model and the supported yoke which can freely bend in the inline il plane and cross flow cf plane but prevent the riser from twisting in the axial direction a constant pretension 3000 n is applied on the axis of the pipe model by a tensioner at one end the towing carriage drives the riser model moving to simulate a uniform steady flow with velocity ranging from 0 4 to 3 6 m s where the corresponding reynolds numbers range from 1 1 104 to 9 0 104 fig 1 shows the configuration of the experimental apparatus the test model is a flexible pipe with 30 mm in external diameter and 7 9 m in length the property parameters of the flexible pipe models are listed in table 1 helical strakes fully cover the bare pipe models the key geometric parameters of helical strakes are pitch p height of the strakes h and the start numbers ns which are shown in fig 2 the start numbers of all different helical strakes are kept at a constant of 3 two pitches 5 0 d 17 5 d and four heights 0 10 d 0 15 d 0 25 d and 0 30 d are considered in this experiment the experimental cases of different helical strakes are summarized in table 2 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors are installed on the model surface to measure the strain responses in both the cf and il directions four groups of sensors are spaced over four quadrants as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 3 lines cf a and cf c along the cf direction are symmetrical with respect to the neutral layer of the model while lines il b and il d align with the il direction fifty six strain sensors are uniformly distributed along the length in which 19 fbg strain sensors are used for cf direction and 37 fbg strain sensors are used in il direction the signals are sampled at 250 hz 3 data analysis in uniform flow a time invariant mean drag force acts on the riser model in the il direction which causes a mean deflection in the flow direction time varying forces caused by vortex shedding induce the viv response in the il direction the mean deflection is defined as the initial bending and the corresponding position of the riser is referred to as the equilibrium position the coordinate system and the riser response components in uniform flow are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows the riser model under a pretension t 0 where the riser s axis lies along the z axis and is perpendicular to the incoming flow along the x axis the il plane for the riser is in the xoz plane of the coordinate system and the cf plane is in the yoz plane when the flexible pipe is simplified as a euler beam neglecting torsion the governing equation for the initial bending deformation can be expressed as 1 e i 4 x m b z z 4 t 2 x m b z z 2 f d z where ei is the bending stiffness of the riser x m b z is the displacement at point z due to initial bending t is the mean tension at the two ends of the riser and f d z is the mean drag force at point z under the small deformation assumption the relationship between the displacement and the corresponding bending strain can be expressed as 2 2 x m b z z 2 ε m b z r where r is the radius of the riser and ε m b z is the bending strain at point z caused by the initial bending deformation from eqs 1 and 2 the mean drag force f d z can be obtained 3 f d z e i r 2 ε m b z z 2 t r ε m b z in this study the initial bending strain ε m b z and the mean tension at the two ends of riser t can be obtained by the method proposed by resvanis et al 2012 song et al 2016 2017 the initial bending strain ε m b and time variant bending strain ε v i v for bare and straked pipes at z 3 32 m are shown in fig 5 comparing the strain time histories of the bare pipe with the straked pipes 17 5 d 0 25 d it is obvious that the fluctuating strain amplitude of the straked pipe in the il direction is significantly smaller than that of the bare riser this means that the helical strakes 17 5 d 0 25 d can efficiently suppress viv response in the il direction for a riser model with a hydrodynamic diameter of d the drag coefficient of each cross section c d z can be expressed as 4 c d z 2 f d z ρ d u z u z where ρ is the fluid density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and u z is the fluid velocity at point z it should be noted that the hydrodynamic diameters of helical straked pipes share the same value as the bare pipe the form of the u z u z term indicates that the drag force acts in the same direction as the incoming current the mean drag coefficient c d can be obtained by averaging the drag coefficients cd z over the length of the flexible pipe 5 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z where l is the length of the pipe model 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean drag force distribution fig 6 shows the distribution of the normalized root mean square of viv displacement y r m s d in the cf direction and the mean drag force f d z along the axial direction of the bare and straked pipes 17 5 d 0 25 d compared with straked pipe bare pipe has the significant viv displacement response the dominant modes for viv displacement in the cf direction of bare pipes are 2nd 3rd and 4th at flow velocities of 0 8 m s 1 6 m s and 2 4 m s respectively while only the 1st mode can be observed for the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d this indicates that the helical strakes suppress viv response and effectively prevent higher order vibration the mean drag force f d z is symmetrical about the midpoint of the model and increases with flow velocities as shown in fig 6 b compared with the bare pipe the mean drag force distribution of the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d are in the same level for the towing speeds of 0 8 m s and 1 6 m s although the two mean drag forces are in the same level the reasons of the drag amplification mechanism are different for bare pipes the drag force is amplified due to the viv response for the straked pipe it is induced by the increased hydrodynamic diameter and altered wake however a slight larger drag force is observed under u 2 4 m s for the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d than the bare one this may be attributed to that the vibration mode of bare pipe increases as the flow velocity which causes the incident flow area decreases slightly it can be concluded that the magnified effect of drag force by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for straked pipe is not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in cf direction for bare pipe to verify the mean drag force identification method in our study a finite element model of the pipe model is built with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 by using ansys 12 5 the initial bending strain ε m b of the straked pipe is calculated using the identified drag force at flow velocities of 1 6 m s and 2 4 m s as shown in fig 7 comparing the measured initial bending strain with calculated strain the results show that the two strains are in good agreement which prove that the mean drag coefficient calculation method is reliable 4 2 mean drag coefficient distribution after obtaining the drag force the drag coefficients at each cross section of the model can be calculated by using eq 4 then the mean drag coefficient under different reynolds re numbers can be further obtained through eq 5 fig 8 shows the mean drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes for different reynolds numbers the results show that mean drag coefficients of the bare pipes decrease significantly as the reynolds number increases i e c d decreases from 2 4 to 1 3 when re increasing from 104 to 108 vandiver 1985 found that the cd was larger than 3 0 when re 2 2 104 in the lock in condition chaplin et al 2005 presented that cd varied within the range of 1 6 and 2 7 when re ranged from 2 8 103 to 2 8 104 the present results are in agreement with the results proposed by previous researchers which demonstrates the credibility of this identification method and our data processing different from the bare pipe the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes are stable with re numbers as shown in fig 8 the mean drag coefficients of shorter pitch helical straked pipes are stable at 1 32 1 36 and 1 46 for 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d and 5 d 0 25 d straked pipes respectively while for longer pitches c d values are stable at 1 6 1 7 1 9 for 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d straked pipes respectively the magnification of drag coefficients for helical strakes with a longer pitch of 17 5 d is observed with high re numbers re 40000 an unexpected phenomenon is that the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes with a shorter pitch 5d are significantly lower than those of bare pipes which is in contrast with the results reported by api 1998 the potential reasons for these phenomena will be discussed in the next paragraph to verify the reliability of the identified drag coefficients of the straked pipes some results from a rigid cylinder with helical strakes are selected korkischko et al 2007 found that the values of cd are 1 2 and 1 4 corresponding to straked pipes of 5 d 0 10 d and 5 d 0 20 d respectively which are in agreement with the present results the mean drag coefficients of the flexible pipe with helical strakes are slightly larger than those of the rigid cylinders which may be affected by the viv response of flexible pipes as several studies report the viv responses can have significant influences on the drag force and drag coefficients chaplin et al 2005 vandiver 1985 the main influence of the viv responses on drag force and coefficients is that viv responses change the incident flow area and make the drag force and coefficients varied under different re numbers we delve further whether the change phenomenon of drag coefficients for bare and straked pipes is caused by viv responses or not the viv response should be given here fig 9 and fig 10 illustrate the dominant mode numbers and maximum root mean square values of viv displacement responses under different flow velocities for both bare and straked pipes as these figures show the dominant mode changes of the bare pipe are more obvious in respect to towing velocity t han those for the straked pipes in addition the root mean square of displacement response y rms d of the bare pipe is obviously larger than it for the straked one this means the helical strakes can not only suppress viv responses but also reduce the dominant response frequency after obtaining the viv responses under each case the incident flow area s enclosed by the yrms d envelope can be calculated the incident flow area s is defined as 6 s 0 l y r m s z d z fig 11 shows the incident flow area of the bare and straked pipes for different re numbers the results show that the incident flow area of the bare pipe decreases significantly as the re number increases this trend is the same as that for mean drag coefficients of the bare pipe it is also consistent with the empirical prediction of mean drag coefficients proposed by song et al 2016 thus the drag coefficients of the bare pipe are controlled by both viv response amplitudes and mode numbers compared to the bare pipe significant changes of the incident flow area for some straked pipes 5 d 0 10 d and 5 d 0 15 d are also observed although more fluctuating incident areas of these straked pipes 5d 0 10d 5d 0 15d are observed as compared to other straked pipes the drag coefficients of the straked pipes are more stable than those of the bare pipe moreover the flow areas of the pipes with different helical strakes are not much different but the drag coefficients are quite different magnification and reduction of mean drag coefficients all appear for different straked pipes this result means the drag coefficients of the straked pipes are not only influenced by changes in the incident flow area but are also more related to the wake changed by the helical strake geometry to further validate the above conclusions a direct method is to observe vortex modes for the flexible pipe with different helical strakes unfortunately this commonly used method known as particle image velocimetry piv is difficult to apply due to the large length and vibration of flexible pipes it is impossible to obtain vortex shedding modes along the flexible pipe directly from an indirect point the vibration frequency components caused by more turbulent vortices should be correspondingly complicated therefore the spectrum of viv responses can reflect the severity of turbulence to some extent here we introduce a general frequency to find the frequency components of bare pipe and straked pipes the general frequency spectrum is defined as 7 f f ω i 1 19 f f i ω where f f i ω is the result based on fft at the ith gauging point and is a function of strain amplitude with respect to response frequency f f ω is the general amplitude frequency spectrum calculated by summing the strain amplitudes at the same frequency components for all 19 gauging points the general frequency spectra and the corresponding dominant frequencies of the bare and the straked pipes 5 d 0 25 d 17 5 d 0 25 d under a flow velocity of u 1 6 m s are illustrated in fig 12 from fig 12 the dominant frequencies of the straked pipes in both the cf and il directions are significantly decreased these results are also found by gao et al 2014 2015 2016 this can be attributed to the mechanism by which strakes can prevent the interaction between two shear layers as reported by constantinides and oakley 2006 in addition the viv response frequency components of the pipe fitted with different helical strakes are not the same through comparing the results of the 5 d 0 25 d straked pipe with the 17 5 d 0 25 d straked pipe more frequency components are observed in the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d both in the il and cf directions this result indicates that the geometry including height and pitch of the strake affects the vortex shedding modes and the severity of vortex structure turbulence furthermore ranjith et al 2016 found that helical strakes could also strongly affect pressure distribution at the downstream side of the circular cylinder by controlling the shear layer separation through cfd simulation then leading to increases of drag coefficients combining the present frequency spectra results of flexible pipes with different helical strakes and the mechanism reported by ranjith et al 2016 the amplification or reduction of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes might be attributed to the effects of helical strake geometry parameters on shear layer separation more systematic and insight researches are still needed in the future 4 3 predicted drag coefficients for different helical strakes the relationship between the mean drag coefficients and the viv responses of the bare pipe have been previously studied by chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 based on the experimental results in which the highest re numbers were in the order of 104 vandiver 1985 proposed an equation for predicting the mean drag coefficient of a flexible smooth pipe 8 c d c d 0 1 1 043 2 y r m s d 0 65 with similar ranges of re numbers for stepped flows chaplin et al 2005 modified the predicted formula as 9 c d c d 0 1 2 3 2 y r m s d 1 7 2 y r m s d 2 where c d0 is the drag coefficient for a stationary cylinder which is usually taken to be 1 2 in the subcritical re regime the two predicted equations are proposed under low re numbers re 10000 however when the reynolds number increases the vortex structure gradually becomes turbulent and a higher mode number will occur blevins and saunders 1977 sumer and fredsøe 1988 thus the drag coefficients of a bare pipe will be different under high reynolds numbers song et al 2016 proposed an empirical prediction formula for high re numbers re 105 which considers the dominant modes re number and dominant frequency among other factors as opposed to the smooth bare pipe the helical strakes can break the vortex and alter flow separation the vortex structure is turbulent and disorderly which may have a weak relation to re numbers in the same region constantinides and oakley 2006 korkischko et al 2007 pinto et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 a concise prediction formula for mean drag coefficient is proposed as 10 c d c d 0 1 k 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c d0 and k are pending parameters through the least squares method lsm lines for mean drag coefficients and 2y rms d 0 65 for different straked pipes are fitted and shown in fig 13 the curve fitting parameters are shown in table 3 from our study we can see that all values of k are positive it indicates that the drag coefficients increase with response amplitudes it is found that k is equal to 0 5818 0 1769 and 0 1714 for 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d and 5 d 0 25 d straked pipes respectively and k is equal to 0 5769 0 4375 and 0 8235 for 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d straked pipes respectively compared to the bare pipe the fitting parameters k of the straked pipes are significantly smaller than that of the bare one which is 1 043 as reported by vandiver 1985 this means that the helical strakes can reduce the sensitivity of the mean drag coefficients to viv responses moreover the k value of the straked pipe with a 5 d pitch is obviously less than that of the 17 5 d pitch straked pipe therefore the sensitivity of the drag coefficients to viv responses is highly affected by the p d the longer the pitch of the helical strake the more sensitive the drag coefficients are to viv responses the reason for this might be attributed to the effects of vortex structure for straked pipes with different pitches as previously mentioned the basic mean drag coefficient cd0 is affected by both the pitch and height as illustrated in table 3 cd0 changes with the pitch and height of the strake to further discuss the effects of the strake geometry parameters we fit the cd0 with the strake height as shown in fig 14 a robust linear relationship is observed between basic mean drag coefficient and height especially for strakes of a 17 5 d pitch combining eq 10 the predicted drag coefficient formula is proposed to be 11 c d c d s p 1 j p h d 1 h p h 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c ds and j p are the functions of the strake pitch h p h is the function of both the strake pitch and height c ds is equal to 0 9 and 0 96 when p is equal to 5 d and 17 5 d respectively in addition j p 2 3 2 7 for p 5 d 17 5 d respectively h p h is the parameter k as shown in table 3 since j p is not equal to 2 it means that the magnification of drag coefficients for straked pipe is not only affected by increasing the hydrodynamic diameters but also related with altering wake although the present predicted formula cannot predict drag coefficients for all types of helical strakes it might be deemed as a preliminary attempt to predict the drag coefficients for straked pipes to verify the applicability of the predicted drag coefficient formula for straked pipes fig 15 shows the predicted and measured drag coefficients of different helical strakes through these figures we can see the predicted drag coefficients agree well with the measured drag coefficients it indicates that the predicted formula is reasonable to some extent to give a general drag coefficient predicted formula for all types of helical strakes more straked flexible pipe experiments with different geometric parameters should be conducted in the future in addition then the possible simple function of c ds p j p and h p h could be established it will be helpful for ocean engineering application 5 conclusions the present study investigates the mean drag forces and mean drag coefficients of helical strakes in uniform flow with re numbers up to 1 1 105 six configurations of straked pipe 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d 5 d 0 25 d 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d and bare pipe models are tested the il strains of the pipe as measured by fbg sensors are used to calculate the drag force at each section through a beam bending inverse analysis method compared to the bare pipe the characteristics and distributions of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes are investigated furthermore an empirical prediction formula for mean drag coefficients of straked pipes is proposed the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 helical strakes can effectively reduce drag fluctuation and the magnification of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes with a pitch equal to 17 5 d is observed when the re number reaches 1 105 2 the reduction of mean drag coefficients for a shorter pitch straked pipe 5 d are observed when re 1 105 which might be attributed to the effects of helical strakes on changing the wake shedding mode 3 the helical strakes can reduce the sensitivity of mean drag coefficients to viv responses especially for helical strakes with a shorter pitch 4 based on the experimental results an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for straked pipes which accounts for viv response and the geometry of

22742,the influences of helical strake geometry and vortex induced vibration viv on the drag coefficients of a long flexible pipe with helical strakes are investigated through uniform flow experiments with the reynolds re number ranging from 1 1 104 to 9 5 104 the strains caused by drag forces of a bare pipe and six different straked pipes are measured by fiber bragg grating fbg sensors according to the inverse analysis method and morison formula the drag forces and coefficients at each section of the pipe models are identified then the mean drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes are compared the results show that helical strakes can effectively stabilize the fluctuation of drag coefficients with re numbers an unexpected phenomenon is that helical strakes with pitches of 5 d can reduce the mean drag coefficients moreover the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes are less sensitive to viv response furthermore an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for straked pipes is proposed which accounts for the viv response and geometry of helical strakes its applicability is well verified via comparison between predicted and experimental results keywords vortex

ocean currents marine risers will undergo significant vortex induced vibration viv in the cross flow cf direction viv can lead to severe fatigue damage to risers and becomes one of the key issues in the engineering of risers to suppress viv two main methods are proposed active control and passive control the main difference between them is that active control needs additional power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not passive control methods have gained much more attention due to their ease in manufacturing and have been previously studied by many researchers allen et al 2006 bearman and owen 1998 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2006 among the various forms of passive control helical strakes have been widely applied in practical projects as a typical device of passive control although helical strakes serve as an effective viv suppression device by altering the separation characteristics over the cross section of the riser as well as in a spanwise direction they can also lead to a significant magnification in mean drag api 1998 as we know the mean drag force is one of the important reasons for the failure of the riser strength in the progressive collapse limit states analysis pls the morison formula is used to calculate the mean drag force and then von mises stress is induced to verify the reliability when using the morison formula to calculate the mean drag force the drag coefficient is a very crucial factor affecting the predicted force based on rigid cylinder towing experiments most specifications give the recommended values of mean drag coefficients for smooth cylinders at high reynolds numbers while no clear recommended mean drag coefficient has been proposed for straked pipes therefore it is necessary to study the mean drag coefficients of flexible straked pipes and their features undergoing viv recently most researches focus on the viv response and the suppression efficiency of the straked pipes few of them pay attention to the drag coefficient of the straked pipes korkischko et al 2007 presented mean drag coefficients for cylinders with different helical strakes and an obvious amplification was observed through the stationary towing experiments which consisted of six different helical strakes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 1 d and 0 2 d within the range of the reynolds number from 2000 to 10000 for the stationary towing test of the rigid cylinders the drag force acting on the cylinder can be easily measured by the force sensor however the towing test of stationary rigid cylinder has not considered the influences of viv response and three dimensional flow hence the experiment conditions are very different from the practical conditions former studies have found that the cross flow vibration can cause a significant amplification on the drag coefficient of the bare flexible pipe blevins 1990 chaplin et al 2005 vandiver 1985 wilde et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 therefore it is more reasonable to study the mean drag coefficients of helical straked flexible pipes by using scaled model tests quen et al 2014 presents experiments of straked flexible pipes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d under uniform flow with re numbers ranging from 1400 to 13800 unexpectedly based on the drag force measured at both ends a phenomena that bare cylinders possess higher drag coefficients than the straked pipes is found which is contrary to beliefs reported by api 1998 thus the effects of helical strakes on drag coefficients are still unclear compared with experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics cfd is an ideal method to study the mechanisms of complex fluid structure interactions fsi problem sarpkaya 2004 however there are few cfd studies due to the complex hydrodynamic shape of straked cylinders and the lower calculation efficiency constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 thiagarajan and constantinides 2005 studied the viv suppression mechanism of helical strakes they found that the strakes can alter shedding separation and prevent interaction between two shear layers these main effects not only suppress viv but also change the pressure distribution downstream of the circular cylinder and amplify the drag force overall studies about the drag force and coefficients with regard to the strake geometry and viv are scarce thus the mean drag force and its features on straked pipes still require further investigation in this paper viv experiments for straked pipes with different geometrical parameters are conducted in uniform flow the strains on the surface of the straked pipe models are measured by a fiber bragg grating fbg sensor using the inverse beam bending theory and the morison formula the drag force and the mean drag coefficient at each cross section along the axial length are calculated compared with bare pipes the drag coefficients of straked pipes in uniform flow are further investigated moreover the influences of helical strake geometry and viv response on drag coefficients are analyzed finally an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for these straked pipes is proposed 2 experimental apparatus the experiments are carried out in a towing tank with 192 m long 10 m wide and 4 2 m deep the flexible pipe model is horizontally mounted on a streamline yoke under the towing carriage at a water depth of 1 5 m the universal joints are used to connect the pipe model and the supported yoke which can freely bend in the inline il plane and cross flow cf plane but prevent the riser from twisting in the axial direction a constant pretension 3000 n is applied on the axis of the pipe model by a tensioner at one end the towing carriage drives the riser model moving to simulate a uniform steady flow with velocity ranging from 0 4 to 3 6 m s where the corresponding reynolds numbers range from 1 1 104 to 9 0 104 fig 1 shows the configuration of the experimental apparatus the test model is a flexible pipe with 30 mm in external diameter and 7 9 m in length the property parameters of the flexible pipe models are listed in table 1 helical strakes fully cover the bare pipe models the key geometric parameters of helical strakes are pitch p height of the strakes h and the start numbers ns which are shown in fig 2 the start numbers of all different helical strakes are kept at a constant of 3 two pitches 5 0 d 17 5 d and four heights 0 10 d 0 15 d 0 25 d and 0 30 d are considered in this experiment the experimental cases of different helical strakes are summarized in table 2 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors are installed on the model surface to measure the strain responses in both the cf and il directions four groups of sensors are spaced over four quadrants as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 3 lines cf a and cf c along the cf direction are symmetrical with respect to the neutral layer of the model while lines il b and il d align with the il direction fifty six strain sensors are uniformly distributed along the length in which 19 fbg strain sensors are used for cf direction and 37 fbg strain sensors are used in il direction the signals are sampled at 250 hz 3 data analysis in uniform flow a time invariant mean drag force acts on the riser model in the il direction which causes a mean deflection in the flow direction time varying forces caused by vortex shedding induce the viv response in the il direction the mean deflection is defined as the initial bending and the corresponding position of the riser is referred to as the equilibrium position the coordinate system and the riser response components in uniform flow are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows the riser model under a pretension t 0 where the riser s axis lies along the z axis and is perpendicular to the incoming flow along the x axis the il plane for the riser is in the xoz plane of the coordinate system and the cf plane is in the yoz plane when the flexible pipe is simplified as a euler beam neglecting torsion the governing equation for the initial bending deformation can be expressed as 1 e i 4 x m b z z 4 t 2 x m b z z 2 f d z where ei is the bending stiffness of the riser x m b z is the displacement at point z due to initial bending t is the mean tension at the two ends of the riser and f d z is the mean drag force at point z under the small deformation assumption the relationship between the displacement and the corresponding bending strain can be expressed as 2 2 x m b z z 2 ε m b z r where r is the radius of the riser and ε m b z is the bending strain at point z caused by the initial bending deformation from eqs 1 and 2 the mean drag force f d z can be obtained 3 f d z e i r 2 ε m b z z 2 t r ε m b z in this study the initial bending strain ε m b z and the mean tension at the two ends of riser t can be obtained by the method proposed by resvanis et al 2012 song et al 2016 2017 the initial bending strain ε m b and time variant bending strain ε v i v for bare and straked pipes at z 3 32 m are shown in fig 5 comparing the strain time histories of the bare pipe with the straked pipes 17 5 d 0 25 d it is obvious that the fluctuating strain amplitude of the straked pipe in the il direction is significantly smaller than that of the bare riser this means that the helical strakes 17 5 d 0 25 d can efficiently suppress viv response in the il direction for a riser model with a hydrodynamic diameter of d the drag coefficient of each cross section c d z can be expressed as 4 c d z 2 f d z ρ d u z u z where ρ is the fluid density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and u z is the fluid velocity at point z it should be noted that the hydrodynamic diameters of helical straked pipes share the same value as the bare pipe the form of the u z u z term indicates that the drag force acts in the same direction as the incoming current the mean drag coefficient c d can be obtained by averaging the drag coefficients cd z over the length of the flexible pipe 5 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z where l is the length of the pipe model 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean drag force distribution fig 6 shows the distribution of the normalized root mean square of viv displacement y r m s d in the cf direction and the mean drag force f d z along the axial direction of the bare and straked pipes 17 5 d 0 25 d compared with straked pipe bare pipe has the significant viv displacement response the dominant modes for viv displacement in the cf direction of bare pipes are 2nd 3rd and 4th at flow velocities of 0 8 m s 1 6 m s and 2 4 m s respectively while only the 1st mode can be observed for the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d this indicates that the helical strakes suppress viv response and effectively prevent higher order vibration the mean drag force f d z is symmetrical about the midpoint of the model and increases with flow velocities as shown in fig 6 b compared with the bare pipe the mean drag force distribution of the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d are in the same level for the towing speeds of 0 8 m s and 1 6 m s although the two mean drag forces are in the same level the reasons of the drag amplification mechanism are different for bare pipes the drag force is amplified due to the viv response for the straked pipe it is induced by the increased hydrodynamic diameter and altered wake however a slight larger drag force is observed under u 2 4 m s for the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d than the bare one this may be attributed to that the vibration mode of bare pipe increases as the flow velocity which causes the incident flow area decreases slightly it can be concluded that the magnified effect of drag force by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for straked pipe is not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in cf direction for bare pipe to verify the mean drag force identification method in our study a finite element model of the pipe model is built with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 by using ansys 12 5 the initial bending strain ε m b of the straked pipe is calculated using the identified drag force at flow velocities of 1 6 m s and 2 4 m s as shown in fig 7 comparing the measured initial bending strain with calculated strain the results show that the two strains are in good agreement which prove that the mean drag coefficient calculation method is reliable 4 2 mean drag coefficient distribution after obtaining the drag force the drag coefficients at each cross section of the model can be calculated by using eq 4 then the mean drag coefficient under different reynolds re numbers can be further obtained through eq 5 fig 8 shows the mean drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes for different reynolds numbers the results show that mean drag coefficients of the bare pipes decrease significantly as the reynolds number increases i e c d decreases from 2 4 to 1 3 when re increasing from 104 to 108 vandiver 1985 found that the cd was larger than 3 0 when re 2 2 104 in the lock in condition chaplin et al 2005 presented that cd varied within the range of 1 6 and 2 7 when re ranged from 2 8 103 to 2 8 104 the present results are in agreement with the results proposed by previous researchers which demonstrates the credibility of this identification method and our data processing different from the bare pipe the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes are stable with re numbers as shown in fig 8 the mean drag coefficients of shorter pitch helical straked pipes are stable at 1 32 1 36 and 1 46 for 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d and 5 d 0 25 d straked pipes respectively while for longer pitches c d values are stable at 1 6 1 7 1 9 for 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d straked pipes respectively the magnification of drag coefficients for helical strakes with a longer pitch of 17 5 d is observed with high re numbers re 40000 an unexpected phenomenon is that the mean drag coefficients of straked pipes with a shorter pitch 5d are significantly lower than those of bare pipes which is in contrast with the results reported by api 1998 the potential reasons for these phenomena will be discussed in the next paragraph to verify the reliability of the identified drag coefficients of the straked pipes some results from a rigid cylinder with helical strakes are selected korkischko et al 2007 found that the values of cd are 1 2 and 1 4 corresponding to straked pipes of 5 d 0 10 d and 5 d 0 20 d respectively which are in agreement with the present results the mean drag coefficients of the flexible pipe with helical strakes are slightly larger than those of the rigid cylinders which may be affected by the viv response of flexible pipes as several studies report the viv responses can have significant influences on the drag force and drag coefficients chaplin et al 2005 vandiver 1985 the main influence of the viv responses on drag force and coefficients is that viv responses change the incident flow area and make the drag force and coefficients varied under different re numbers we delve further whether the change phenomenon of drag coefficients for bare and straked pipes is caused by viv responses or not the viv response should be given here fig 9 and fig 10 illustrate the dominant mode numbers and maximum root mean square values of viv displacement responses under different flow velocities for both bare and straked pipes as these figures show the dominant mode changes of the bare pipe are more obvious in respect to towing velocity t han those for the straked pipes in addition the root mean square of displacement response y rms d of the bare pipe is obviously larger than it for the straked one this means the helical strakes can not only suppress viv responses but also reduce the dominant response frequency after obtaining the viv responses under each case the incident flow area s enclosed by the yrms d envelope can be calculated the incident flow area s is defined as 6 s 0 l y r m s z d z fig 11 shows the incident flow area of the bare and straked pipes for different re numbers the results show that the incident flow area of the bare pipe decreases significantly as the re number increases this trend is the same as that for mean drag coefficients of the bare pipe it is also consistent with the empirical prediction of mean drag coefficients proposed by song et al 2016 thus the drag coefficients of the bare pipe are controlled by both viv response amplitudes and mode numbers compared to the bare pipe significant changes of the incident flow area for some straked pipes 5 d 0 10 d and 5 d 0 15 d are also observed although more fluctuating incident areas of these straked pipes 5d 0 10d 5d 0 15d are observed as compared to other straked pipes the drag coefficients of the straked pipes are more stable than those of the bare pipe moreover the flow areas of the pipes with different helical strakes are not much different but the drag coefficients are quite different magnification and reduction of mean drag coefficients all appear for different straked pipes this result means the drag coefficients of the straked pipes are not only influenced by changes in the incident flow area but are also more related to the wake changed by the helical strake geometry to further validate the above conclusions a direct method is to observe vortex modes for the flexible pipe with different helical strakes unfortunately this commonly used method known as particle image velocimetry piv is difficult to apply due to the large length and vibration of flexible pipes it is impossible to obtain vortex shedding modes along the flexible pipe directly from an indirect point the vibration frequency components caused by more turbulent vortices should be correspondingly complicated therefore the spectrum of viv responses can reflect the severity of turbulence to some extent here we introduce a general frequency to find the frequency components of bare pipe and straked pipes the general frequency spectrum is defined as 7 f f ω i 1 19 f f i ω where f f i ω is the result based on fft at the ith gauging point and is a function of strain amplitude with respect to response frequency f f ω is the general amplitude frequency spectrum calculated by summing the strain amplitudes at the same frequency components for all 19 gauging points the general frequency spectra and the corresponding dominant frequencies of the bare and the straked pipes 5 d 0 25 d 17 5 d 0 25 d under a flow velocity of u 1 6 m s are illustrated in fig 12 from fig 12 the dominant frequencies of the straked pipes in both the cf and il directions are significantly decreased these results are also found by gao et al 2014 2015 2016 this can be attributed to the mechanism by which strakes can prevent the interaction between two shear layers as reported by constantinides and oakley 2006 in addition the viv response frequency components of the pipe fitted with different helical strakes are not the same through comparing the results of the 5 d 0 25 d straked pipe with the 17 5 d 0 25 d straked pipe more frequency components are observed in the straked pipe 17 5 d 0 25 d both in the il and cf directions this result indicates that the geometry including height and pitch of the strake affects the vortex shedding modes and the severity of vortex structure turbulence furthermore ranjith et al 2016 found that helical strakes could also strongly affect pressure distribution at the downstream side of the circular cylinder by controlling the shear layer separation through cfd simulation then leading to increases of drag coefficients combining the present frequency spectra results of flexible pipes with different helical strakes and the mechanism reported by ranjith et al 2016 the amplification or reduction of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes might be attributed to the effects of helical strake geometry parameters on shear layer separation more systematic and insight researches are still needed in the future 4 3 predicted drag coefficients for different helical strakes the relationship between the mean drag coefficients and the viv responses of the bare pipe have been previously studied by chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 based on the experimental results in which the highest re numbers were in the order of 104 vandiver 1985 proposed an equation for predicting the mean drag coefficient of a flexible smooth pipe 8 c d c d 0 1 1 043 2 y r m s d 0 65 with similar ranges of re numbers for stepped flows chaplin et al 2005 modified the predicted formula as 9 c d c d 0 1 2 3 2 y r m s d 1 7 2 y r m s d 2 where c d0 is the drag coefficient for a stationary cylinder which is usually taken to be 1 2 in the subcritical re regime the two predicted equations are proposed under low re numbers re 10000 however when the reynolds number increases the vortex structure gradually becomes turbulent and a higher mode number will occur blevins and saunders 1977 sumer and fredsøe 1988 thus the drag coefficients of a bare pipe will be different under high reynolds numbers song et al 2016 proposed an empirical prediction formula for high re numbers re 105 which considers the dominant modes re number and dominant frequency among other factors as opposed to the smooth bare pipe the helical strakes can break the vortex and alter flow separation the vortex structure is turbulent and disorderly which may have a weak relation to re numbers in the same region constantinides and oakley 2006 korkischko et al 2007 pinto et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 a concise prediction formula for mean drag coefficient is proposed as 10 c d c d 0 1 k 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c d0 and k are pending parameters through the least squares method lsm lines for mean drag coefficients and 2y rms d 0 65 for different straked pipes are fitted and shown in fig 13 the curve fitting parameters are shown in table 3 from our study we can see that all values of k are positive it indicates that the drag coefficients increase with response amplitudes it is found that k is equal to 0 5818 0 1769 and 0 1714 for 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d and 5 d 0 25 d straked pipes respectively and k is equal to 0 5769 0 4375 and 0 8235 for 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d straked pipes respectively compared to the bare pipe the fitting parameters k of the straked pipes are significantly smaller than that of the bare one which is 1 043 as reported by vandiver 1985 this means that the helical strakes can reduce the sensitivity of the mean drag coefficients to viv responses moreover the k value of the straked pipe with a 5 d pitch is obviously less than that of the 17 5 d pitch straked pipe therefore the sensitivity of the drag coefficients to viv responses is highly affected by the p d the longer the pitch of the helical strake the more sensitive the drag coefficients are to viv responses the reason for this might be attributed to the effects of vortex structure for straked pipes with different pitches as previously mentioned the basic mean drag coefficient cd0 is affected by both the pitch and height as illustrated in table 3 cd0 changes with the pitch and height of the strake to further discuss the effects of the strake geometry parameters we fit the cd0 with the strake height as shown in fig 14 a robust linear relationship is observed between basic mean drag coefficient and height especially for strakes of a 17 5 d pitch combining eq 10 the predicted drag coefficient formula is proposed to be 11 c d c d s p 1 j p h d 1 h p h 2 y r m s d 0 65 where c ds and j p are the functions of the strake pitch h p h is the function of both the strake pitch and height c ds is equal to 0 9 and 0 96 when p is equal to 5 d and 17 5 d respectively in addition j p 2 3 2 7 for p 5 d 17 5 d respectively h p h is the parameter k as shown in table 3 since j p is not equal to 2 it means that the magnification of drag coefficients for straked pipe is not only affected by increasing the hydrodynamic diameters but also related with altering wake although the present predicted formula cannot predict drag coefficients for all types of helical strakes it might be deemed as a preliminary attempt to predict the drag coefficients for straked pipes to verify the applicability of the predicted drag coefficient formula for straked pipes fig 15 shows the predicted and measured drag coefficients of different helical strakes through these figures we can see the predicted drag coefficients agree well with the measured drag coefficients it indicates that the predicted formula is reasonable to some extent to give a general drag coefficient predicted formula for all types of helical strakes more straked flexible pipe experiments with different geometric parameters should be conducted in the future in addition then the possible simple function of c ds p j p and h p h could be established it will be helpful for ocean engineering application 5 conclusions the present study investigates the mean drag forces and mean drag coefficients of helical strakes in uniform flow with re numbers up to 1 1 105 six configurations of straked pipe 5 d 0 10 d 5 d 0 15 d 5 d 0 25 d 17 5 d 0 15 d 17 5 d 0 25 d and 17 5 d 0 30 d and bare pipe models are tested the il strains of the pipe as measured by fbg sensors are used to calculate the drag force at each section through a beam bending inverse analysis method compared to the bare pipe the characteristics and distributions of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes are investigated furthermore an empirical prediction formula for mean drag coefficients of straked pipes is proposed the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 helical strakes can effectively reduce drag fluctuation and the magnification of mean drag coefficients for straked pipes with a pitch equal to 17 5 d is observed when the re number reaches 1 105 2 the reduction of mean drag coefficients for a shorter pitch straked pipe 5 d are observed when re 1 105 which might be attributed to the effects of helical strakes on changing the wake shedding mode 3 the helical strakes can reduce the sensitivity of mean drag coefficients to viv responses especially for helical strakes with a shorter pitch 4 based on the experimental results an empirical mean drag coefficient prediction formula for straked pipes which accounts for viv response and the geometry of the helical strake is proposed comparing the measured results and predicted results the application of this prediction formula is well verified it will provide a good reference for the prediction of the mean drag coefficients of helical straked pipes acknowledgments this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51490674 the national science fund for

22743,the bahamas or lucayan archipelago located in the western north atlantic ocean is highly susceptible to impact of hurricanes considering its location along the major pathways of atlantic hurricanes and increased storminess in the atlantic basin the hydrodynamics of the narrow and steep carbonate continental shelf of bahamas archipelago provides a stark contrast to the east coast of the united states by means of distinct interaction of shelves with hurricane induced waves storm tide and currents the present study implements a coupled adcirc swan model to investigate the surge and wave dynamics along the coasts of bahamas archipelago during hurricane joaquin using multiple reanalyzed wind products the analysis is focused on the hydrodynamic response of the archipelago considering its varying coastal bathymetry slope and arching coastlines model computed a maximum significant wave height of 15 m storm surge 1 5 m and coastal currents of 4 m s during hurricane joaquin moreover validation study also shows very good agreement with the buoy observations from the region spatio temporal variability of storm tide and waves along with nonlinear impacts of wave setup and setdown highlights the dominance of waves with moderate influence of storm tides along the coastal zone of the island chain the study also evaluated interaction of coastal currents with the arching coastlines of the bahamas in addition wave parameters attributed to the sinking of the cargo ship el faro during the hurricane joaquin have been examined significant wave heights exceeding 12 5 m with wave period of 12 5 s and the reversing wave direction during hurricane joaquin might have resulted in the capsize of the cargo ship keywords bahamas hurricane joaquin coupled adcirc swan wave setup coastal morphology arching coastline 1 introduction the bahamas archipelago straddling the tropic of cancer in the western atlantic ocean is observed to be vulnerable to increased storminess and climate change the archipelago encounters regular strike of hurricanes due to its position along the major pathway of hurricanes originating in the caribbean and tropical atlantic basin reading 1990 this region also experiences uneven annual rainfall pattern most of which occurred during the atlantic hurricane season dalman and park 2012 gamble et al 2008 in addition reading 1990 observed an increased tropical storm activity in the bahamas region closely following the decadal trend in the atlantic basin the cone of uncertainty and the level of risk are augmented for the archipelago with increasing intensity and frequency of hurricanes in the atlantic basin which can be linked with emerging climate change scenarios the san salvador island of the bahamas archipelago alone contributes to a landfall probability of 0 21 annually dalman and park 2012 in the recent past several bahamian districts were also adversely affected by hurricane induced storm tide and waves during hurricane floyd 1999 jeanne 2004 irene 2011 and joaquin 2015 back to back hurricanes irma and maria caused widespread havoc in the bahamas during september 2017 the governmental sources estimated the devastation of approximately eighty million bahamian dollars from the landfall of hurricane joaquin 2015 alone and surprisingly 33 lives and a cargo ship were reported to be lost during the hurricane activity in an era of advanced weather forecast and broadcast frequent hurricane activities low lying morphology 80 of the land elevation is 1 m above sea level and the persistent threat of sea level rise 0 3 m during past two decades elevated the vulnerability of the archipelago to storm surge and coastal inundation the study by sealy and strobl 2017 indicates that the bahamas archipelago is more susceptible towards hurricane storm surge and high energy waves than the impacts of hurricane wind exposure in addition heightened hurricane activity has been observed from this region with alteration in the regional climate system hengstum et al 2013 in this respect a detailed study on the dynamics of hurricane induced storm surge and waves and their interaction with the shallow carbonate reefs in and around the bahamas archipelago is highly essential especially in the context of heavy reliance of country s economy on beach tourism and agriculture surprisingly very few published studies are available on vulnerability of the bahamas archipelago to past hurricanes records of storm surge during hurricane frances which made landfall on the san salvador island was reported by dick and cartright 2011 but characterization of tide surge and wave impacts on the archipelago itself is limited in that study a detailed analysis on the modulation of individual vulnerability parameters such as storm surge tide and waves and their non linear interaction mechanism during a hurricane is the best approach to assess the vulnerability of this low lying archipelago to future hurricane landfalls especially in the context of rising sea level in such a scenario study using a tightly coupled hydrodynamic and wave model is highly recommended also a comprehensive database such as surgedat in situ records of storm surge from landfall of hurricanes from all possible directions and a spectrum of intensity by needham and keim 2012 would be useful for developing coastal zone management policies as well as for supporting further scientific research numerical evaluation of storm surge and extreme waves with the help of synthetic storm tracks which are created by statistically combining past hurricanes that made landfall in the area would have its potential towards coastal zone management recently sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 numerically developed a similar comprehensive dataset for the east coast of india which comprises information on surge tide and coastal inundation for varying cyclone parameters in the bay of bengal basin the bahamas archipelago is distinct in many respect from the north american mainland because of its geographic location carbonate deposition origin and coastal geomorphological features climatologically the bahamas is considered to be in the subtropical zone with a maritime climate sealey 1994 coastal flooding is a serious problem in the region as 80 topography of the island is merely one meter above the mean sea level the major distinguishable contrast between the bahamas archipelago and the american continent is the difference in width and slope of continental shelves of the two landmasses the archipelago is bordered by very narrow and steep continental shelf compared to the east coast of the united states the bahamian islands are found to have continental shelf of 1 2 km width along their eastern seaboard and maximum up to 25 km width at the western edge while the average width of continental shelf of the neighboring american mainland is around 65 km considering the physics of shallow water wave transformation and tide surge amplification over continental shelf very high spatio temporal variability in waves and surge tide is expected for this island chain especially during a hurricane event this study performed a detailed investigation on the wave and surge modulation over the narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamian islands in the context of a land falling hurricane for advancing our research we used a coupled adcirc swan model dietrich et al 2011a b and implemented it for hurricane joaquin as a case study hurricane joaquin was a category 4 hurricane pronounced to be a rare and major hurricane in the atlantic basin during the 2015 hurricane season the hurricane devastated several islands in the bahamas archipelago after making multiple landfalls along its looped trajectory joaquin caused extensive destruction for five southeastern islands during 2015 and the total damage estimated was 104 8 million idb report the hurricane was detected as a weak mid upper tropospheric low on 8th september 2015 over west southwest of the canary islands in the atlantic ocean basin evolving from a non tropical low the system moved west north westward and transforming into a well marked tropical depression on 28th september 2015 and finally reached a stage of category 4 hurricane on 1st october 2015 by moving over warm waters off central north atlantic joaquin made landfall over multiple islands in the archipelago viz rum cay san salvador islands and moved over crooked island long cay and long island interestingly the hurricane repeatedly intensified after multiple landfalls and its trajectory over the archipelago is shown in fig 1 it has been reported that the deep layer low at the eastern united states prevented the hurricane from following the major hurricane track national hurricane center tropical cyclone report joaquin 2015 and instead it moved east northward against the coriolis effect tropical cyclone report for hurricane joaquin berg 2016 recorded the maximum sustained wind speed and the minimum pressure during the hurricane joaquin to be 135 knots and 934 mb respectively bahamas department of meteorology estimated 5 10 inches of rainfall in the bahamas region around 70 of the crooked island was reported to be inundated with 5 ft of water and 12 15 ft water level reported from rum cay and crooked island the report also admits that hurricane joaquin was a poorly forecasted hurricane multiple landfalls and rapid intensification caused enormous devastation in the archipelago the focus of this study is to numerically evaluate the extreme storm surge and wave conditions that these low lying islands have been exposed to during hurricane joaquin and its implication on the geomorphological resilience of the island chain the multiple landfalls and re intensification of the hurricane after each landfall provided us a rare opportunity to study the prolonged storm surge and hurricane wave impacts on the bahamas and their spatio temporal variability over a sufficiently long period of time 2 data and methodology a series of numerical experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the model stability and accuracy for the study area with respect to various hydrological and meteorological initial and boundary conditions in the following section a brief account on the details of model implementation is provided which includes the domain dimensions forcing parameters and the suit of physical and numerical parametrizations implemented 2 1 coupled adcirc swan model coupled adcirc swan model is widely used for hindcast and forecast of storm surge and waves due to its accuracy and robustness the model is flexible in adopting various hurricane forcing parameters and complex coastal geomorphological features the architecture of the coupled adcirc swan model allows both models to mutually exchange hydrodynamics and wave information so as to retain the nonlinear interaction between the two phenomena hence coupled adcirc swan model has been widely implemented to define the wave transformation and tidal modulation in the shelf and coastal region throughout the world successful implementation of coupled adcirc swan model was pioneered by dietrich et al 2011a b for the hindcast of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico also coupled modeling approach has significantly improved storm surge prediction for the coastal zone of south carolina bender et al 2012 similar study by xie et al 2016 applied coupled adcirc swan model to predict the storm tide and waves in the gulf of maine mao and xia 2017 studied the wave current surge interactions in lake michigan using coupled adcirc swan model performance of adcirc swan model was validated for the east coast of india for hindcasting storm surge from recent intense tropical cyclones viz thane phailin and hudhud see bhaskaran et al 2013 murty et al 2014 murty et al 2016 however coupled model has been rarely used for wave generation and propagation around an island chain in a deep ocean setting especially for studying wave simulation from an intense hurricane activity in the open ocean conditions objective of our study was to implement a coupled adcirc swan model for the bahamas region and numerically evaluating the non linear interaction of waves and storm tide over the steep and shallow carbonate shelves of the bahamas archipelago the study also investigated the hurricane generated waves and storm surge in the deep ocean environment surrounding the island chain as well as for the neighboring florida coast 2 2 experimental setup the model domain lies in the 100 w 55 w longitude bands and 6 n 46 n latitude bands fig 1a the domain encompasses the east coast of north america the gulf of mexico with the bahamas archipelago at the center fig 1b a depth following flexible finite element computational mesh was generated using the sms surface modelling system software emrl 2006 the mesh has a 200 m spatial resolution along the coastal region and that progressively relaxes up to 40 km resolution along the offshore boundary a cold start simulation for 55 days 29th july 2015 to 22 september 2015 was performed using standalone adcirc simulation to stabilize the model for tidal constituents initial values of which were extracted from the le provost database le provost et al 1995 further a five days simulation 22nd september 27th september 2015 was performed using the coupled adcirc swan model forced with era5 ensemble three hourly wind products and tidal information from the previous 55 day cold start simulation this five day simulation would help the swan model to stabilize and also to avoid any potential spin up errors during the actual hurricane simulation the hot start files from this 5 day simulation were used in the coupled adcirc swan model for simulating the storm tide and waves during the hurricane joaquin episode from 27th september 2015 to 5th october 2015 meteorological inputs such as wind vectors and mean sea level pressure from reanalyzed products viz era5 and hwind datasets were blended and used for forcing the hurricane model details on the era5 and hwind datasets and the blending techniques that were used are provided in the following section the adcirc model was found to be stable for 5 s time step and it would pass the information of water level and currents to swan model on an hourly interval which is identical to the swan time step the swan model computes the significant wave height wave period wave direction and wave radiation stress and passes the wave radiation stress data to adcirc model at an hourly interval more details pertaining to the model implementation experimental details and the model setup are provided in table 1 the study uses various wave parameterization schemes such as komen and janssen formulations for wind wave growth by cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 depth induced wave breaking by battjes and janssen 1978 with varying breaking index jonswap and madsen bottom frictions by hasselmann et al 1973 and madsen et al 1988 to identify the best suit of swan source terms for the bahamas region the study used limiters to avoid inadequate and spurious wave growth due to sharp gradients in the bathymetry dietrich et al 2013 2 2 1 details of wind forcing after a detailed evaluation of ecmwf re analyzed wind products such as narr era interim and era5 our study found era5 to yield the best performance when used for forcing coupled adcirc swan model era5 wind and pressure data are available at 30 km horizontal resolution with 137 atmosphere levels from surface to a height of 80 km and at a temporal resolution of 3 h the study extracted u and v components of wind at 10 m height from sea level and surface level pressure for the study domain shown in fig 1 in addition high resolution hwind product also was used in the coupled adcirc swan model to simulate the peak storm surge and wind waves associated with asymmetric wind structure of the hurricane core precisely hwind is a reanalyzed and standardized product of complex wind analysis system that integrates 40 different observational sources gathered from marine buoy networks satellite observations aerial vehicle records radiosonde dropped into hurricane from hurricane hunters land based networks c man records and ship reports powell et al 2010 powel and houston 1996 current version of hwind provides guidance to forecasters on the magnitude extent and the projected path of tropical storm and hurricane force winds risk management solutions inc rms provided the hwind data as a 1000 km 1000 km moving grid centred at the hurricane eye with an approximate spatial and temporal resolution of 0 0625 and 3 h respectively advantage of using hwind data is the well captured asymmetric structure of the hurricane wind field 2 2 2 methodology used to blend hwind and era5 wind data areal extent of the hwind data is confined only to the size of hurricane and the performance of the wind vectors towards the boundary of this dataset is found to be unsatisfactory in some cases it is noticed that era5 wind data shows the radius of maximum wind extended up to 150 km whereas the hwind data shows realistic radius of maximum wind around 45 km from the eye of the hurricane along the periphery of the hwind domain era5 wind showed better consistency when compared with ndbc buoy observations these limitations of hwind and era5 dataset prompted us to blend both the wind datasets to maintain accuracy and availability of wind data throughout the domain extracted wind components u and v vectors from both hwind and era5 were first interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and temporal resolution of 3 h to maintain consistency in the datasets the 3 hourly hwind boxes were then merged with era5 domain wide winds using a weight that retains the hwind data within its data boundary and smoothly meshes with the era5 wind beyond that boundary blended data was further smoothed to avoid any sharp gradients along the boundary of the hwind box freeman et al 2015 also implemented similar techniques to blend hrd wind with narr wind data for gulf of mexico storm surge modeling using blended wind data for forcing hydrodynamic and wave models showed satisfactory performance dietrich et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 atmospheric pressure data at sea level was provided from the era5 along with the blended wind to skill assess the simulated hurricane generated waves statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient bias and rmse root mean square error were used the mathematical formulation for these terms are listed in equations 1 3 symbols y bi and y mi in the equations refer the buoy observation and the data obtained from ensemble models or satellite resources 1 c o r r e

response of low lying islands of the bahamas is influenced by sea level rise in the region and the coastal geomorphologic features of the island chain including the slope and width of the continental shelf this section investigates the interaction of continental shelf with hurricane generated waves and currents the narrow and steep carbonate platform surrounding the archipelago would facilitate non linear interaction between energetic waves and the storm tide and that would result in extensive coastal erosion over wash breaching or even some cases of prolonged coastal inundation considering the location and the alignment of the islands of the bahamas archipelago we would expect a sharp contrast in morphologic response of islands on either flanks of a hurricane path and that motivated us to evaluate region specific evolution of storm surge and waves and the associated coastal flooding during hurricane joaquin 3 1 results this section is organized as i modelling and validation of wind waves and storm tide ii spatio temporal variability of storm tide and significant wave heights for the bahamas archipelago during hurricane joaquin event based on tolman 1998 a 10 error in wind data can lead to 20 error in the wave height prediction the study compared performance of coupled adcirc swan model with various wind data such as the holland parametric wind generated using hurdat hurricane track database reanalyzed ensemble wind data such as era5 ecmwf and hwind data blended with era5 wind data simulations using holland parametric wind formulations was constrained to provide surge and wave components for a larger domain considered in this study however coupled adcirc swan model simulated realistic storm tide and wave components using era5 and blended wind datasets the study validated the wind as well as the model results with the ndbc buoy observations from the western atlantic see fig 1a for the buoy locations the correlation coefficients r1 and r2 in fig 2 provided a qualitative comparison of different wind datasets with the buoy observations validation for ndbc buoys 41048 41047 and 41046 shows good correlation with the blended hwind data whereas the blended wind speed shows least correlation with the far field buoys viz 41002 41425 41043 era5 wind data from ecmwf is also found to follow similar trend as the blended hwind era5 wind speed except for the buoy 41043 buoy observation at this location shows 92 agreement with the era5 wind speed whereas 72 correlation is found in case of blended era5 hwind data the buoys 41002 41425 41043 are located far away from the hurricane s field of influence and error in spatial interpolation could be the reason for bad correlation of era5 and hwind datasets with the buoy observation for those far field locations observed anomaly in the wind data is well reflected in the simulated wave parameters from the coupled adcirc swan model fig 3 a provides validation of coupled adcirc swan model using buoy observation during hurricane joaquin coupled adcirc swan model was forced with era5 wind and the blended era5 hwind data to simulate storm tide and wave components the simulation using blended winds showed a regression coefficient greater than 0 95 at buoys 41048 41047 and 41047 however coupled model highly overestimated the significant wave height at buoy locations 41002 41425 41043 closely following the quality of wind at those far field locations similar observations were obtained in simulations performed using era5 wind dataset except at ndbc buoy location 41043 considering the excellent performance of the coupled adcirc swan model within the field of influence of hurricane joaquin it can be inferred that the overestimation of waves at far field locations hardly influence the simulated wave field for the bahamas archipelago which was located within close vicinity of the hurricane track hence rest of the discussion is focused on analyzing storm tide and wave characteristics of bahamas archipelago and its surrounding environment in the case of model simulations using blended era5 hwind the dominant positive bias value illustrates the overestimation of wave heights by the coupled model at the same time the era5 wind consistently shows underestimation of wave height at most of the buoy locations the wave heights obtained using hwind era5 blended data shows consistent rmse and bias values fig 3b the simulations using era5 alone showed a good correlation with buoy observation but showed extended ranges for bias and rmse for bahamas region we evaluated the wave source term parameterization schemes table 2 suggested by dietrich at al 2011 and the siadatmousavi et al 2016 the coupled model outputs show insignificant variation to varying model physics for the bahamas region the inter comparison between significant wave heights obtained from both schemes showed a 98 correlation fig 4 a the rmse and bias estimated with respect to the ndbc buoy observation fig 4b however did not provide a clear pattern to pick up the best physics with optimized performance for the region due to unavailability of any tide gauge data or current data the study was not able to validate the simulated storm tide from hurricane joaquin however our comparison of simulated storm surge with visually observed data collected by bahamian meteorological department and a research team from the united states michael savarese personal communication showed good agreement particularly for the san salvador island simulated maximum storm tide and maximum significant wave heights around the bahamas archipelago and the florida coast are presented in fig 5 marginal rise of storm surge could be noticed along the coastal zone of the bahamas including the sheltered side of joaquin track on the contrary high wave activity was noticed all along the coast of bahamas major islands of the archipelago encountered 2 7 m of wave height and a maximum storm tide of 2 m during the hurricane event coupled adcirc swan computed the maximum wave height up to 18 m at a water depth of 10 m off the crooked island and san salvador island see fig 5b in addition far field influence of hurricane joaquin was noticed with an increase in water level of 0 5 1 0 m along the east coast of florida however the florida coast experienced a mild wave impact from hurricane joaquin 3 2 discussion the modeling effort using joaquin as a test case revealed the non linear interaction of storm tide and energetic waves from hurricane occurred along the narrow and steep continental shelf of the archipelago especially along the open atlantic side of the island chain and it resulted in extensive coastal erosion and infrastructure damage further discussion on our findings is provided under the following sub headings i spatio temporal variability of storm tide and significant wave height during joaquin episode ii wave and storm surge transformation over narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamas iii wave setup setdown and coastal currents around the archipelago and iv deep water wave modelling and forecast for navigation purpose and offshore activities revisiting sinking of el faro during hurricane joaquin 3 2 1 spatio temporal variability in storm tide and significant wave height for bahamas archipelago fig 5 depicts the spatial variability of maximum storm tide and significant wave height along the islands of bahamas and the florida coast during joaquin episode fig 6 shows the time series of combined wave surge impacts for the bahamas archipelago as well as for locations away from the direct influence of hurricane forced wind field along the united states coastal locations of fort pierce cape canaveral and fwyf1 elevated wave heights computed for the bahamas region during hurricane joaquin clearly demonstrates the vulnerability of this low lying archipelago to meteorological events especially those associated with tropical and extra tropical storms hurricane joaquin made multiple landfalls over the southern islands of rum cay san salvador and had direct influence on crooked island long cay and long island most of these elongated islands have a width of 15 km which is much less than the wind fetch asscoaited with a hurricane during the landfall the western side of the islands were affected by the right front quadrant of the hurricane wind hence both eastern and western sides of the islands were equally affected by the storm tide and waves however the islands such as grand bahamas great abaco and the eastern seaboard of north america were the least affected by waves from hurricane joaquin long island san salvador island rum cay and samana cay see fig 1b had experienced 7 10 m wave height during the multiple landfall of hurricane fig 6 the unusual looped trajectory of the hurricane resulted in double peak wave profiles at rum cay and south of san salvador island surprisingly impact of hurricane waves persisted for around 72 h due to this peculiar trajectory of the hurricane crooked island rum cay and san salvador islands positioned at the right front of the hurricane track after the initial landfall the hurricane moved eastward post landfall and continued to sustain the impacts from high wind and swell waves influence of surge tide propagating from the hurricane activity has been recorded even at locations along the eastern seaboard of the united states figs 5 and 6 marginal wave activity during the hurricane was recorded at this coast the united states coastal zone was observed to be least impacted during hurricane joaquin due to the sheltering effect of bahamas islands 3 2 2 wave and storm surge characteristic over narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamas recent study by sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 describes the increment in storm surge height with decrease in continental shelf slope when hurricane entered shallow waters of the continental shelf it would slow down from its interaction with the shallow depth and bottom friction kinetic energy of the system is transformed into potential energy which results in higher storm surge depending on the shelf slope wind speed and the nature of the bottom substrate assuming η as surge height at the coast l as the continental shelf width h as the total water depth w as the wind speed and c the constant that combines gravity density and empirical drag pugh et al 1987 expressed the surge height using the empirical expression η lcw 2 h where the l h ratio is referred as the shelf slope the expression clearly suggests higher vulnerability for coasts bordering shallow and wider continental shelf in the case of bahamas the narrow and steep continental shelf protects the archipelago from higher storm surge and prevented the surge water to inundate the coastal territories in fact most of the islands in the archipelago are adapted to significant storm surge during atlantic hurricanes on the other hand host of literature reported on the growth of hurricane forced wave height as a consequence to rapid change in continental shelf slope and water depth schulz et al 2012 the sensitivity study by parvathy and bhaskaran 2017 demonstrated the faster attenuation of waves in the case of gently sloped coastal environment whereas larger wave heights are experienced for a steep continental shelf slope most of the bahamas archipelago boarders a steep and narrow continental slope which makes the archipelago vulnerable from the impact of high incident waves during the passage of both extra tropical winter storms and hurricane episodes the continental shelf width varies from 1 to 25 km for the bahamian islands while the average shelf width is 65 km for the east coast of the united states the continental shelf slope around the bahamas archipelago is in the range of 60 90 whereas the gebco global bathymetry data provided slope angle to be 30 for most of the eastern coast of the united states interestingly during hurricanes katrina and rita which made landfall along northern gulf of mexico east coast of usa maximum wave heights of 1 5 2 m and 2 5 3 m respectively were reported over the shallow shoals along the coast dietrich et al 2011a b conversely steep and narrow coasts of bahamas witnessed 7 10 m of wave heights during the joaquin episode the coupled model outputs show maximum surge height of 1 5 2 m for the bahamas coasts during hurricane joaquin while 7 8 m of storm surge was recorded along mississippi coast during hurricane katrina bender et al 2010 dietrich et al 2010 3 2 3 wave setup set down and currents during hurricane joaquin wave radiation stress from enhanced wave activity along the coast of bahamas resulted in variations in the water level known as the wave setup and setdown readers can refer fema 2005 for the concepts of wave setup and setdown fig 7 shows the computed water level from coupled adcirc swan model and the adcirc only simulations at various locations along the archipelago along with the wave setup and set down during the joaquin episode the wave setup and set down can be prominently noticed during the time interval 100 150 h in fig 7 a simulated maximum wave setup up of 0 9 m was observed during this event elevated water levels were found at rum cay san salvador island and long island due to wave setup whereas the wave set down resulted from decrease in water level was observed at crooked island rum cay and the sheltered side of long island post passage of the joaquin track although the generation of wave setup and set down especially during a high energy atmospheric event is a complex phenomenon the study by hsu et al 2006 argues that the breaking angle and shoreline profile govern the wave radiation stress which follows variations in the local sea level the study by mcdougal and hudspeth 1983 emphasize the dependence of nearshore bottom profile on the coastal wave setup the coastal flood hazard analysis and mapping guidelines by fema 2005 illustrate the significant occurrence of wave setup along semi enclosed bays barrier islands and coastline curvature with the influence of frontward direction of wind during joaquin consistent wave set down was observed offshore of the breaker zone and wave setup for the inshore zone depending on the bathymetric gradients coastline curvature and the direction of hurricane wind however the wave setup was not found to be consistently uniform for the entire archipelago the inconsistency could be explained with the spatial variability in the nearshore current profile during hurricane joaquin investigation on the nearshore current profile reflects higher current speed surrounding the arching coastlines of the islands the main islands such as crooked island long island cat island eleuthera and great abaco has arching curvatures along the western side see fig 1 higher current speed was noticed along the coasts having sharp curvature fig 8 a geographically most of these islands border shallow and wider continental shelf surrounded by the concave shaped shorelines at the west whereas a narrow continental shelf at the east fig 8a illustrates the maximum current speed around the islands with respect to the shelf width and depth during the hurricane the marginal shelf width and the eastern boundary current along the eastern flank of the archipelago make the coast vulnerable to amplified coastal currents during extreme meteorological events which also could cause intense coastal erosion and shoreline changes on the other hand the wider shelf safeguards the west coast of the archipelago from the impact of hurricane generated currents fig 8b represents the time series of simulated current speed along east and west coasts of the archipelago during hurricane joaquin 3 2 4 sinking of cargo ship el faro el faro the us flagged cargo vessel traveling from florida to puerto rico was grounded during the hurricane joaquin at 11 40 utc on 1st october 2015 along with its 33 crew members fig 9a represents the navigation path of el faro vessel and the location where the vessel was grounded the figure points out that the vessel was to be at the leeward side of joaquin trajectory just before sinking and the recorded wind speed was around 64 knots 32 9 m s fig 9 a a wwiii based modeling study by fedele et al 2017a b reported that significant wave height was around 10 m at this location during the final moments of the ship based on the report by the national transportation safety board ntsb the ship s proximity to the hurricane was the underlying cause of the accident design code for ship building in practice is based on significant wave heights less than 11 m smith 2007 the code also stipulates that hazardous conditions could develop if the bulk wave parameters exceed the following limit predominant wave periods of 7 18 s wave lengths of 50 250 m wave heights of 10 30 m and wave crest velocities of 10 35 m s our study analyzed the coupled adcirc swan model outputs to better understand the hydrodynamic conditions that led to sinking of vessel el faro and also evaluated the rapid changes in wave direction due to the hairpin structure of joaquin track fig 9b provides the wind and wave parameters at the location 23 38584 n 73 91021w where el faro lost its communication on 1st october 2015 which coincided with time step 107 in the figure outputs from the coupled adcirc swan model showed a significant wave height of 12 55 m and peak wave frequency of 12 5 s at the time step 107 which illustrates that the cargo ship had undergone extreme wave conditions beyond the stipulated safety benchmarks high energy swell waves from the hurricane along with 50 m s wind caused the capsizing of this cargo ship fedele et al 2017a b suspected that sinking of el faro to be due to the presence of rouge waves during the passage of hurricane incidents of capsizing of big oil tankers and other ships due to freak or rouge waves have been reported from many places around the world on this interest coupled adcirc swan model performance in deep water was examined in the present study as discussed in section 3 1 more than 85 of correlation is obtained for significant wave heights at the deep water ndbc buoys 41046 41047 and 41048 in addition the time series plots fig 9b shows rapid change in the wave direction occurred at 100 h the analysis showed that peak wave period and the significant wave height attained its peak at the reported time of ship capsizing also the peak wave direction dramatically changed at this time and that also would have contributed to the destruction of the ship the analysis showed that coupled adcirc swan would be an efficient tool for supporting shipping navigation especially during extreme weather conditions 4 conclusion coastal hydrodynamics of the bahamas archipelago in the atlantic ocean basin is predominantly governed by its unique shape of its coastline and the coastal morphodynamics the present study implemented a two way coupled adcirc swan model for the hurricane joaquin to investigate the impacts of storm surge and hurricane induced waves around the archiepago and their interaction with shallow and steep shelf the results show greater than 95 agreement with the ndbc buoy observation depending on the quality of available atmospheric forcing the numerical experiments obtained maximum significant wave height of 15 m storm tide of 1 5 m and current speed of 4 m s along the bahamas shelf during hurricane joaquin however the spatio temporal variability of storm tide hurricane waves wave setup and setdown were significant and this would result in differential vulnerability along the coast the narrow and steep continental shelf boarding the archipelago is found to accelerate the wave current activity in the inner shelf region on the other hand the coastal morphology safeguards the coast from impact of storm tide and associated coastal flooding the supremacy of waves accelerates the rate of wave setup and setdown depending upon the direction of currents and coastline alignment the eastern seaboard of the archipelago is noticed to be exposed to impacts of higher wave heights and coastal currents on the other hand the west coasts are sheltered from energetic waves and currents elongated and arching shape of some of the islands facilitate increased coastal erosion and shoreline changes with a focused wave and current activity observed along the sharp bends of the islands in addition the study also attempted deep water wave modelling for simulating the bulk wave parameters that resulted in sinking of the cargo ship el faro significant wave heights greater than 11 m with wave period greater than 7 s and the reversing wave direction during hurricane joaquin were suspected to cause the capsizing of the cargo ship along with thirty three lives on board acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank the

22743,the bahamas or lucayan archipelago located in the western north atlantic ocean is highly susceptible to impact of hurricanes considering its location along the major pathways of atlantic hurricanes and increased storminess in the atlantic basin the hydrodynamics of the narrow and steep carbonate continental shelf of bahamas archipelago provides a stark contrast to the east coast of the united states by means of distinct interaction of shelves with hurricane induced waves storm tide and currents the present study implements a coupled adcirc swan model to investigate the surge and wave dynamics along the coasts of bahamas archipelago during hurricane joaquin using multiple reanalyzed wind products the analysis is focused on the hydrodynamic response of the archipelago considering its varying coastal bathymetry slope and arching coastlines model computed a maximum significant wave height of 15 m storm surge 1 5 m and coastal currents of 4 m s during hurricane joaquin moreover validation study also shows very good agreement with the buoy observations from the region spatio temporal variability of storm tide and waves along with nonlinear impacts of wave setup and setdown highlights the dominance of waves with moderate influence of storm tides along the coastal zone of the island chain the study also evaluated interaction of coastal currents with the arching coastlines of the bahamas in addition wave parameters attributed to the sinking of the cargo ship el faro during the hurricane joaquin have been examined significant wave heights exceeding 12 5 m with wave period of 12 5 s and the reversing wave direction during hurricane joaquin might have resulted in the capsize of the cargo ship keywords bahamas hurricane joaquin coupled adcirc swan wave setup coastal morphology arching coastline 1 introduction the bahamas archipelago straddling the tropic of cancer in the western atlantic ocean is observed to be vulnerable to increased storminess and climate change the archipelago encounters regular strike of hurricanes due to its position along the major pathway of hurricanes originating in the caribbean and tropical atlantic basin reading 1990 this region also experiences uneven annual rainfall pattern most of which occurred during the atlantic hurricane season dalman and park 2012 gamble et al 2008 in addition reading 1990 observed an increased tropical storm activity in the bahamas region closely following the decadal trend in the atlantic basin the cone of uncertainty and the level of risk are augmented for the archipelago with increasing intensity and frequency of hurricanes in the atlantic basin which can be linked with emerging climate change scenarios the san salvador island of the bahamas archipelago alone contributes to a landfall probability of 0 21 annually dalman and park 2012 in the recent past several bahamian districts were also adversely affected by hurricane induced storm tide and waves during hurricane floyd 1999 jeanne 2004 irene 2011 and joaquin 2015 back to back hurricanes irma and maria caused widespread havoc in the bahamas during september 2017 the governmental sources estimated the devastation of approximately eighty million bahamian dollars from the landfall of hurricane joaquin 2015 alone and surprisingly 33 lives and a cargo ship were reported to be lost during the hurricane activity in an era of advanced weather forecast and broadcast frequent hurricane activities low lying morphology 80 of the land elevation is 1 m above sea level and the persistent threat of sea level rise 0 3 m during past two decades elevated the vulnerability of the archipelago to storm surge and coastal inundation the study by sealy and strobl 2017 indicates that the bahamas archipelago is more susceptible towards hurricane storm surge and high energy waves than the impacts of hurricane wind exposure in addition heightened hurricane activity has been observed from this region with alteration in the regional climate system hengstum et al 2013 in this respect a detailed study on the dynamics of hurricane induced storm surge and waves and their interaction with the shallow carbonate reefs in and around the bahamas archipelago is highly essential especially in the context of heavy reliance of country s economy on beach tourism and agriculture surprisingly very few published studies are available on vulnerability of the bahamas archipelago to past hurricanes records of storm surge during hurricane frances which made landfall on the san salvador island was reported by dick and cartright 2011 but characterization of tide surge and wave impacts on the archipelago itself is limited in that study a detailed analysis on the modulation of individual vulnerability parameters such as storm surge tide and waves and their non linear interaction mechanism during a hurricane is the best approach to assess the vulnerability of this low lying archipelago to future hurricane landfalls especially in the context of rising sea level in such a scenario study using a tightly coupled hydrodynamic and wave model is highly recommended also a comprehensive database such as surgedat in situ records of storm surge from landfall of hurricanes from all possible directions and a spectrum of intensity by needham and keim 2012 would be useful for developing coastal zone management policies as well as for supporting further scientific research numerical evaluation of storm surge and extreme waves with the help of synthetic storm tracks which are created by statistically combining past hurricanes that made landfall in the area would have its potential towards coastal zone management recently sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 numerically developed a similar comprehensive dataset for the east coast of india which comprises information on surge tide and coastal inundation for varying cyclone parameters in the bay of bengal basin the bahamas archipelago is distinct in many respect from the north american mainland because of its geographic location carbonate deposition origin and coastal geomorphological features climatologically the bahamas is considered to be in the subtropical zone with a maritime climate sealey 1994 coastal flooding is a serious problem in the region as 80 topography of the island is merely one meter above the mean sea level the major distinguishable contrast between the bahamas archipelago and the american continent is the difference in width and slope of continental shelves of the two landmasses the archipelago is bordered by very narrow and steep continental shelf compared to the east coast of the united states the bahamian islands are found to have continental shelf of 1 2 km width along their eastern seaboard and maximum up to 25 km width at the western edge while the average width of continental shelf of the neighboring american mainland is around 65 km considering the physics of shallow water wave transformation and tide surge amplification over continental shelf very high spatio temporal variability in waves and surge tide is expected for this island chain especially during a hurricane event this study performed a detailed investigation on the wave and surge modulation over the narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamian islands in the context of a land falling hurricane for advancing our research we used a coupled adcirc swan model dietrich et al 2011a b and implemented it for hurricane joaquin as a case study hurricane joaquin was a category 4 hurricane pronounced to be a rare and major hurricane in the atlantic basin during the 2015 hurricane season the hurricane devastated several islands in the bahamas archipelago after making multiple landfalls along its looped trajectory joaquin caused extensive destruction for five southeastern islands during 2015 and the total damage estimated was 104 8 million idb report the hurricane was detected as a weak mid upper tropospheric low on 8th september 2015 over west southwest of the canary islands in the atlantic ocean basin evolving from a non tropical low the system moved west north westward and transforming into a well marked tropical depression on 28th september 2015 and finally reached a stage of category 4 hurricane on 1st october 2015 by moving over warm waters off central north atlantic joaquin made landfall over multiple islands in the archipelago viz rum cay san salvador islands and moved over crooked island long cay and long island interestingly the hurricane repeatedly intensified after multiple landfalls and its trajectory over the archipelago is shown in fig 1 it has been reported that the deep layer low at the eastern united states prevented the hurricane from following the major hurricane track national hurricane center tropical cyclone report joaquin 2015 and instead it moved east northward against the coriolis effect tropical cyclone report for hurricane joaquin berg 2016 recorded the maximum sustained wind speed and the minimum pressure during the hurricane joaquin to be 135 knots and 934 mb respectively bahamas department of meteorology estimated 5 10 inches of rainfall in the bahamas region around 70 of the crooked island was reported to be inundated with 5 ft of water and 12 15 ft water level reported from rum cay and crooked island the report also admits that hurricane joaquin was a poorly forecasted hurricane multiple landfalls and rapid intensification caused enormous devastation in the archipelago the focus of this study is to numerically evaluate the extreme storm surge and wave conditions that these low lying islands have been exposed to during hurricane joaquin and its implication on the geomorphological resilience of the island chain the multiple landfalls and re intensification of the hurricane after each landfall provided us a rare opportunity to study the prolonged storm surge and hurricane wave impacts on the bahamas and their spatio temporal variability over a sufficiently long period of time 2 data and methodology a series of numerical experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the model stability and accuracy for the study area with respect to various hydrological and meteorological initial and boundary conditions in the following section a brief account on the details of model implementation is provided which includes the domain dimensions forcing parameters and the suit of physical and numerical parametrizations implemented 2 1 coupled adcirc swan model coupled adcirc swan model is widely used for hindcast and forecast of storm surge and waves due to its accuracy and robustness the model is flexible in adopting various hurricane forcing parameters and complex coastal geomorphological features the architecture of the coupled adcirc swan model allows both models to mutually exchange hydrodynamics and wave information so as to retain the nonlinear interaction between the two phenomena hence coupled adcirc swan model has been widely implemented to define the wave transformation and tidal modulation in the shelf and coastal region throughout the world successful implementation of coupled adcirc swan model was pioneered by dietrich et al 2011a b for the hindcast of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico also coupled modeling approach has significantly improved storm surge prediction for the coastal zone of south carolina bender et al 2012 similar study by xie et al 2016 applied coupled adcirc swan model to predict the storm tide and waves in the gulf of maine mao and xia 2017 studied the wave current surge interactions in lake michigan using coupled adcirc swan model performance of adcirc swan model was validated for the east coast of india for hindcasting storm surge from recent intense tropical cyclones viz thane phailin and hudhud see bhaskaran et al 2013 murty et al 2014 murty et al 2016 however coupled model has been rarely used for wave generation and propagation around an island chain in a deep ocean setting especially for studying wave simulation from an intense hurricane activity in the open ocean conditions objective of our study was to implement a coupled adcirc swan model for the bahamas region and numerically evaluating the non linear interaction of waves and storm tide over the steep and shallow carbonate shelves of the bahamas archipelago the study also investigated the hurricane generated waves and storm surge in the deep ocean environment surrounding the island chain as well as for the neighboring florida coast 2 2 experimental setup the model domain lies in the 100 w 55 w longitude bands and 6 n 46 n latitude bands fig 1a the domain encompasses the east coast of north america the gulf of mexico with the bahamas archipelago at the center fig 1b a depth following flexible finite element computational mesh was generated using the sms surface modelling system software emrl 2006 the mesh has a 200 m spatial resolution along the coastal region and that progressively relaxes up to 40 km resolution along the offshore boundary a cold start simulation for 55 days 29th july 2015 to 22 september 2015 was performed using standalone adcirc simulation to stabilize the model for tidal constituents initial values of which were extracted from the le provost database le provost et al 1995 further a five days simulation 22nd september 27th september 2015 was performed using the coupled adcirc swan model forced with era5 ensemble three hourly wind products and tidal information from the previous 55 day cold start simulation this five day simulation would help the swan model to stabilize and also to avoid any potential spin up errors during the actual hurricane simulation the hot start files from this 5 day simulation were used in the coupled adcirc swan model for simulating the storm tide and waves during the hurricane joaquin episode from 27th september 2015 to 5th october 2015 meteorological inputs such as wind vectors and mean sea level pressure from reanalyzed products viz era5 and hwind datasets were blended and used for forcing the hurricane model details on the era5 and hwind datasets and the blending techniques that were used are provided in the following section the adcirc model was found to be stable for 5 s time step and it would pass the information of water level and currents to swan model on an hourly interval which is identical to the swan time step the swan model computes the significant wave height wave period wave direction and wave radiation stress and passes the wave radiation stress data to adcirc model at an hourly interval more details pertaining to the model implementation experimental details and the model setup are provided in table 1 the study uses various wave parameterization schemes such as komen and janssen formulations for wind wave growth by cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 depth induced wave breaking by battjes and janssen 1978 with varying breaking index jonswap and madsen bottom frictions by hasselmann et al 1973 and madsen et al 1988 to identify the best suit of swan source terms for the bahamas region the study used limiters to avoid inadequate and spurious wave growth due to sharp gradients in the bathymetry dietrich et al 2013 2 2 1 details of wind forcing after a detailed evaluation of ecmwf re analyzed wind products such as narr era interim and era5 our study found era5 to yield the best performance when used for forcing coupled adcirc swan model era5 wind and pressure data are available at 30 km horizontal resolution with 137 atmosphere levels from surface to a height of 80 km and at a temporal resolution of 3 h the study extracted u and v components of wind at 10 m height from sea level and surface level pressure for the study domain shown in fig 1 in addition high resolution hwind product also was used in the coupled adcirc swan model to simulate the peak storm surge and wind waves associated with asymmetric wind structure of the hurricane core precisely hwind is a reanalyzed and standardized product of complex wind analysis system that integrates 40 different observational sources gathered from marine buoy networks satellite observations aerial vehicle records radiosonde dropped into hurricane from hurricane hunters land based networks c man records and ship reports powell et al 2010 powel and houston 1996 current version of hwind provides guidance to forecasters on the magnitude extent and the projected path of tropical storm and hurricane force winds risk management solutions inc rms provided the hwind data as a 1000 km 1000 km moving grid centred at the hurricane eye with an approximate spatial and temporal resolution of 0 0625 and 3 h respectively advantage of using hwind data is the well captured asymmetric structure of the hurricane wind field 2 2 2 methodology used to blend hwind and era5 wind data areal extent of the hwind data is confined only to the size of hurricane and the performance of the wind vectors towards the boundary of this dataset is found to be unsatisfactory in some cases it is noticed that era5 wind data shows the radius of maximum wind extended up to 150 km whereas the hwind data shows realistic radius of maximum wind around 45 km from the eye of the hurricane along the periphery of the hwind domain era5 wind showed better consistency when compared with ndbc buoy observations these limitations of hwind and era5 dataset prompted us to blend both the wind datasets to maintain accuracy and availability of wind data throughout the domain extracted wind components u and v vectors from both hwind and era5 were first interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and temporal resolution of 3 h to maintain consistency in the datasets the 3 hourly hwind boxes were then merged with era5 domain wide winds using a weight that retains the hwind data within its data boundary and smoothly meshes with the era5 wind beyond that boundary blended data was further smoothed to avoid any sharp gradients along the boundary of the hwind box freeman et al 2015 also implemented similar techniques to blend hrd wind with narr wind data for gulf of mexico storm surge modeling using blended wind data for forcing hydrodynamic and wave models showed satisfactory performance dietrich et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 atmospheric pressure data at sea level was provided from the era5 along with the blended wind to skill assess the simulated hurricane generated waves statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient bias and rmse root mean square error were used the mathematical formulation for these terms are listed in equations 1 3 symbols y bi and y mi in the equations refer the buoy observation and the data obtained from ensemble models or satellite resources 1 c o r r e

response of low lying islands of the bahamas is influenced by sea level rise in the region and the coastal geomorphologic features of the island chain including the slope and width of the continental shelf this section investigates the interaction of continental shelf with hurricane generated waves and currents the narrow and steep carbonate platform surrounding the archipelago would facilitate non linear interaction between energetic waves and the storm tide and that would result in extensive coastal erosion over wash breaching or even some cases of prolonged coastal inundation considering the location and the alignment of the islands of the bahamas archipelago we would expect a sharp contrast in morphologic response of islands on either flanks of a hurricane path and that motivated us to evaluate region specific evolution of storm surge and waves and the associated coastal flooding during hurricane joaquin 3 1 results this section is organized as i modelling and validation of wind waves and storm tide ii spatio temporal variability of storm tide and significant wave heights for the bahamas archipelago during hurricane joaquin event based on tolman 1998 a 10 error in wind data can lead to 20 error in the wave height prediction the study compared performance of coupled adcirc swan model with various wind data such as the holland parametric wind generated using hurdat hurricane track database reanalyzed ensemble wind data such as era5 ecmwf and hwind data blended with era5 wind data simulations using holland parametric wind formulations was constrained to provide surge and wave components for a larger domain considered in this study however coupled adcirc swan model simulated realistic storm tide and wave components using era5 and blended wind datasets the study validated the wind as well as the model results with the ndbc buoy observations from the western atlantic see fig 1a for the buoy locations the correlation coefficients r1 and r2 in fig 2 provided a qualitative comparison of different wind datasets with the buoy observations validation for ndbc buoys 41048 41047 and 41046 shows good correlation with the blended hwind data whereas the blended wind speed shows least correlation with the far field buoys viz 41002 41425 41043 era5 wind data from ecmwf is also found to follow similar trend as the blended hwind era5 wind speed except for the buoy 41043 buoy observation at this location shows 92 agreement with the era5 wind speed whereas 72 correlation is found in case of blended era5 hwind data the buoys 41002 41425 41043 are located far away from the hurricane s field of influence and error in spatial interpolation could be the reason for bad correlation of era5 and hwind datasets with the buoy observation for those far field locations observed anomaly in the wind data is well reflected in the simulated wave parameters from the coupled adcirc swan model fig 3 a provides validation of coupled adcirc swan model using buoy observation during hurricane joaquin coupled adcirc swan model was forced with era5 wind and the blended era5 hwind data to simulate storm tide and wave components the simulation using blended winds showed a regression coefficient greater than 0 95 at buoys 41048 41047 and 41047 however coupled model highly overestimated the significant wave height at buoy locations 41002 41425 41043 closely following the quality of wind at those far field locations similar observations were obtained in simulations performed using era5 wind dataset except at ndbc buoy location 41043 considering the excellent performance of the coupled adcirc swan model within the field of influence of hurricane joaquin it can be inferred that the overestimation of waves at far field locations hardly influence the simulated wave field for the bahamas archipelago which was located within close vicinity of the hurricane track hence rest of the discussion is focused on analyzing storm tide and wave characteristics of bahamas archipelago and its surrounding environment in the case of model simulations using blended era5 hwind the dominant positive bias value illustrates the overestimation of wave heights by the coupled model at the same time the era5 wind consistently shows underestimation of wave height at most of the buoy locations the wave heights obtained using hwind era5 blended data shows consistent rmse and bias values fig 3b the simulations using era5 alone showed a good correlation with buoy observation but showed extended ranges for bias and rmse for bahamas region we evaluated the wave source term parameterization schemes table 2 suggested by dietrich at al 2011 and the siadatmousavi et al 2016 the coupled model outputs show insignificant variation to varying model physics for the bahamas region the inter comparison between significant wave heights obtained from both schemes showed a 98 correlation fig 4 a the rmse and bias estimated with respect to the ndbc buoy observation fig 4b however did not provide a clear pattern to pick up the best physics with optimized performance for the region due to unavailability of any tide gauge data or current data the study was not able to validate the simulated storm tide from hurricane joaquin however our comparison of simulated storm surge with visually observed data collected by bahamian meteorological department and a research team from the united states michael savarese personal communication showed good agreement particularly for the san salvador island simulated maximum storm tide and maximum significant wave heights around the bahamas archipelago and the florida coast are presented in fig 5 marginal rise of storm surge could be noticed along the coastal zone of the bahamas including the sheltered side of joaquin track on the contrary high wave activity was noticed all along the coast of bahamas major islands of the archipelago encountered 2 7 m of wave height and a maximum storm tide of 2 m during the hurricane event coupled adcirc swan computed the maximum wave height up to 18 m at a water depth of 10 m off the crooked island and san salvador island see fig 5b in addition far field influence of hurricane joaquin was noticed with an increase in water level of 0 5 1 0 m along the east coast of florida however the florida coast experienced a mild wave impact from hurricane joaquin 3 2 discussion the modeling effort using joaquin as a test case revealed the non linear interaction of storm tide and energetic waves from hurricane occurred along the narrow and steep continental shelf of the archipelago especially along the open atlantic side of the island chain and it resulted in extensive coastal erosion and infrastructure damage further discussion on our findings is provided under the following sub headings i spatio temporal variability of storm tide and significant wave height during joaquin episode ii wave and storm surge transformation over narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamas iii wave setup setdown and coastal currents around the archipelago and iv deep water wave modelling and forecast for navigation purpose and offshore activities revisiting sinking of el faro during hurricane joaquin 3 2 1 spatio temporal variability in storm tide and significant wave height for bahamas archipelago fig 5 depicts the spatial variability of maximum storm tide and significant wave height along the islands of bahamas and the florida coast during joaquin episode fig 6 shows the time series of combined wave surge impacts for the bahamas archipelago as well as for locations away from the direct influence of hurricane forced wind field along the united states coastal locations of fort pierce cape canaveral and fwyf1 elevated wave heights computed for the bahamas region during hurricane joaquin clearly demonstrates the vulnerability of this low lying archipelago to meteorological events especially those associated with tropical and extra tropical storms hurricane joaquin made multiple landfalls over the southern islands of rum cay san salvador and had direct influence on crooked island long cay and long island most of these elongated islands have a width of 15 km which is much less than the wind fetch asscoaited with a hurricane during the landfall the western side of the islands were affected by the right front quadrant of the hurricane wind hence both eastern and western sides of the islands were equally affected by the storm tide and waves however the islands such as grand bahamas great abaco and the eastern seaboard of north america were the least affected by waves from hurricane joaquin long island san salvador island rum cay and samana cay see fig 1b had experienced 7 10 m wave height during the multiple landfall of hurricane fig 6 the unusual looped trajectory of the hurricane resulted in double peak wave profiles at rum cay and south of san salvador island surprisingly impact of hurricane waves persisted for around 72 h due to this peculiar trajectory of the hurricane crooked island rum cay and san salvador islands positioned at the right front of the hurricane track after the initial landfall the hurricane moved eastward post landfall and continued to sustain the impacts from high wind and swell waves influence of surge tide propagating from the hurricane activity has been recorded even at locations along the eastern seaboard of the united states figs 5 and 6 marginal wave activity during the hurricane was recorded at this coast the united states coastal zone was observed to be least impacted during hurricane joaquin due to the sheltering effect of bahamas islands 3 2 2 wave and storm surge characteristic over narrow and steep continental shelf of the bahamas recent study by sahoo and bhaskaran 2017 describes the increment in storm surge height with decrease in continental shelf slope when hurricane entered shallow waters of the continental shelf it would slow down from its interaction with the shallow depth and bottom friction kinetic energy of the system is transformed into potential energy which results in higher storm surge depending on the shelf slope wind speed and the nature of the bottom substrate assuming η as surge height at the coast l as the continental shelf width h as the total water depth w as the wind speed and c the constant that combines gravity density and empirical drag pugh et al 1987 expressed the surge height using the empirical expression η lcw 2 h where the l h ratio is referred as the shelf slope the expression clearly suggests higher vulnerability for coasts bordering shallow and wider continental shelf in the case of bahamas the narrow and steep continental shelf protects the archipelago from higher storm surge and prevented the surge water to inundate the coastal territories in fact most of the islands in the archipelago are adapted to significant storm surge during atlantic hurricanes on the other hand host of literature reported on the growth of hurricane forced wave height as a consequence to rapid change in continental shelf slope and water depth schulz et al 2012 the sensitivity study by parvathy and bhaskaran 2017 demonstrated the faster attenuation of waves in the case of gently sloped coastal environment whereas larger wave heights are experienced for a steep continental shelf slope most of the bahamas archipelago boarders a steep and narrow continental slope which makes the archipelago vulnerable from the impact of high incident waves during the passage of both extra tropical winter storms and hurricane episodes the continental shelf width varies from 1 to 25 km for the bahamian islands while the average shelf width is 65 km for the east coast of the united states the continental shelf slope around the bahamas archipelago is in the range of 60 90 whereas the gebco global bathymetry data provided slope angle to be 30 for most of the eastern coast of the united states interestingly during hurricanes katrina and rita which made landfall along northern gulf of mexico east coast of usa maximum wave heights of 1 5 2 m and 2 5 3 m respectively were reported over the shallow shoals along the coast dietrich et al 2011a b conversely steep and narrow coasts of bahamas witnessed 7 10 m of wave heights during the joaquin episode the coupled model outputs show maximum surge height of 1 5 2 m for the bahamas coasts during hurricane joaquin while 7 8 m of storm surge was recorded along mississippi coast during hurricane katrina bender et al 2010 dietrich et al 2010 3 2 3 wave setup set down and currents during hurricane joaquin wave radiation stress from enhanced wave activity along the coast of bahamas resulted in variations in the water level known as the wave setup and setdown readers can refer fema 2005 for the concepts of wave setup and setdown fig 7 shows the computed water level from coupled adcirc swan model and the adcirc only simulations at various locations along the archipelago along with the wave setup and set down during the joaquin episode the wave setup and set down can be prominently noticed during the time interval 100 150 h in fig 7 a simulated maximum wave setup up of 0 9 m was observed during this event elevated water levels were found at rum cay san salvador island and long island due to wave setup whereas the wave set down resulted from decrease in water level was observed at crooked island rum cay and the sheltered side of long island post passage of the joaquin track although the generation of wave setup and set down especially during a high energy atmospheric event is a complex phenomenon the study by hsu et al 2006 argues that the breaking angle and shoreline profile govern the wave radiation stress which follows variations in the local sea level the study by mcdougal and hudspeth 1983 emphasize the dependence of nearshore bottom profile on the coastal wave setup the coastal flood hazard analysis and mapping guidelines by fema 2005 illustrate the significant occurrence of wave setup along semi enclosed bays barrier islands and coastline curvature with the influence of frontward direction of wind during joaquin consistent wave set down was observed offshore of the breaker zone and wave setup for the inshore zone depending on the bathymetric gradients coastline curvature and the direction of hurricane wind however the wave setup was not found to be consistently uniform for the entire archipelago the inconsistency could be explained with the spatial variability in the nearshore current profile during hurricane joaquin investigation on the nearshore current profile reflects higher current speed surrounding the arching coastlines of the islands the main islands such as crooked island long island cat island eleuthera and great abaco has arching curvatures along the western side see fig 1 higher current speed was noticed along the coasts having sharp curvature fig 8 a geographically most of these islands border shallow and wider continental shelf surrounded by the concave shaped shorelines at the west whereas a narrow continental shelf at the east fig 8a illustrates the maximum current speed around the islands with respect to the shelf width and depth during the hurricane the marginal shelf width and the eastern boundary current along the eastern flank of the archipelago make the coast vulnerable to amplified coastal currents during extreme meteorological events which also could cause intense coastal erosion and shoreline changes on the other hand the wider shelf safeguards the west coast of the archipelago from the impact of hurricane generated currents fig 8b represents the time series of simulated current speed along east and west coasts of the archipelago during hurricane joaquin 3 2 4 sinking of cargo ship el faro el faro the us flagged cargo vessel traveling from florida to puerto rico was grounded during the hurricane joaquin at 11 40 utc on 1st october 2015 along with its 33 crew members fig 9a represents the navigation path of el faro vessel and the location where the vessel was grounded the figure points out that the vessel was to be at the leeward side of joaquin trajectory just before sinking and the recorded wind speed was around 64 knots 32 9 m s fig 9 a a wwiii based modeling study by fedele et al 2017a b reported that significant wave height was around 10 m at this location during the final moments of the ship based on the report by the national transportation safety board ntsb the ship s proximity to the hurricane was the underlying cause of the accident design code for ship building in practice is based on significant wave heights less than 11 m smith 2007 the code also stipulates that hazardous conditions could develop if the bulk wave parameters exceed the following limit predominant wave periods of 7 18 s wave lengths of 50 250 m wave heights of 10 30 m and wave crest velocities of 10 35 m s our study analyzed the coupled adcirc swan model outputs to better understand the hydrodynamic conditions that led to sinking of vessel el faro and also evaluated the rapid changes in wave direction due to the hairpin structure of joaquin track fig 9b provides the wind and wave parameters at the location 23 38584 n 73 91021w where el faro lost its communication on 1st october 2015 which coincided with time step 107 in the figure outputs from the coupled adcirc swan model showed a significant wave height of 12 55 m and peak wave frequency of 12 5 s at the time step 107 which illustrates that the cargo ship had undergone extreme wave conditions beyond the stipulated safety benchmarks high energy swell waves from the hurricane along with 50 m s wind caused the capsizing of this cargo ship fedele et al 2017a b suspected that sinking of el faro to be due to the presence of rouge waves during the passage of hurricane incidents of capsizing of big oil tankers and other ships due to freak or rouge waves have been reported from many places around the world on this interest coupled adcirc swan model performance in deep water was examined in the present study as discussed in section 3 1 more than 85 of correlation is obtained for significant wave heights at the deep water ndbc buoys 41046 41047 and 41048 in addition the time series plots fig 9b shows rapid change in the wave direction occurred at 100 h the analysis showed that peak wave period and the significant wave height attained its peak at the reported time of ship capsizing also the peak wave direction dramatically changed at this time and that also would have contributed to the destruction of the ship the analysis showed that coupled adcirc swan would be an efficient tool for supporting shipping navigation especially during extreme weather conditions 4 conclusion coastal hydrodynamics of the bahamas archipelago in the atlantic ocean basin is predominantly governed by its unique shape of its coastline and the coastal morphodynamics the present study implemented a two way coupled adcirc swan model for the hurricane joaquin to investigate the impacts of storm surge and hurricane induced waves around the archiepago and their interaction with shallow and steep shelf the results show greater than 95 agreement with the ndbc buoy observation depending on the quality of available atmospheric forcing the numerical experiments obtained maximum significant wave height of 15 m storm tide of 1 5 m and current speed of 4 m s along the bahamas shelf during hurricane joaquin however the spatio temporal variability of storm tide hurricane waves wave setup and setdown were significant and this would result in differential vulnerability along the coast the narrow and steep continental shelf boarding the archipelago is found to accelerate the wave current activity in the inner shelf region on the other hand the coastal morphology safeguards the coast from impact of storm tide and associated coastal flooding the supremacy of waves accelerates the rate of wave setup and setdown depending upon the direction of currents and coastline alignment the eastern seaboard of the archipelago is noticed to be exposed to impacts of higher wave heights and coastal currents on the other hand the west coasts are sheltered from energetic waves and currents elongated and arching shape of some of the islands facilitate increased coastal erosion and shoreline changes with a focused wave and current activity observed along the sharp bends of the islands in addition the study also attempted deep water wave modelling for simulating the bulk wave parameters that resulted in sinking of the cargo ship el faro significant wave heights greater than 11 m with wave period greater than 7 s and the reversing wave direction during hurricane joaquin were suspected to cause the capsizing of the cargo ship along with thirty three lives on board acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank the

22744,a new 3d model is proposed within the framework of openfoam for understanding the physical processes of fluid soil interactions in the vicinity of a mono pile that considers both waves and currents the proposed model consists of a flow sub model and poro elastic seabed sub model the flow sub model combines the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation and k ϵ turbulence model to govern the flow motions the poro elastic seabed sub model employs the u p dynamic approximation to describe the transient seabed response the proposed model was validated against the experimental results of previous studies and applied to exploring the wave current induced pore pressure around a mono pile numerical examples confirmed that wave crossing current interactions can significantly affect the pattern of soil liquefaction around the mono pile keywords wave current interactions mono pile pore pressures soil liquefaction openfoam 1 introduction the seabed stability in the vicinity of offshore infrastructure has recently attracted significant attention in the offshore geotechnical engineering field because of the development of marine energy sources in oceanic environments pile foundations are used to support structures such as fixed type platforms the main function of a pile foundation is to transfer forces from the superstructure to the ground soil environmental loadings that act on a structure include wind waves currents and ices such loadings are a huge threat to the stability of a pile foundation for example an environmental loading can damage the structure where the supporting structure may suffer from the seepage force and lateral earth pressure within the seabed that destabilize the seabed in the literature fluctuations in the dynamic wave pressures on a seabed will induce variations in the pore water pressure in the seabed when the pore pressure becomes excessive and the effective stresses vanish the seabed may liquefy sumer 2014 jeng 2018 once liquefaction occurs soil particles behave as a heavy fluid and may be carried away by environmental loadings furthermore any structure on the liquefied seabed will become unstable and lose its designed function therefore accurately predicting seabed stability is particularly important for the design of marine infrastructure based on biot s poroelastic theory biot 1941 numerous models have been reported to clarify wave seabed interactions yamamoto et al 1978 proposed a closed form analytical solution for the soil response of an infinite seabed to a two dimensional progressive wave loading this framework was later extended to different seabed conditions for three dimensional short crested waves jeng and hsu 1996 several numerical models have been developed for more complicated soil conditions jeng and lin 1996 sui et al 2016 jeng et al 2018 guo et al 2019 qi et al 2019 numerous studies have considered the wave induced pore water pressure around a pile because of the growth of offshore activities li et al 2011 used abaqus to examine the pore pressure around a pile with linear wave loading they only considered a small diameter for the pile and ignored wave diffraction chang and jeng 2014 numerically studied the hydrodynamic loadings and soil response around a high rise platform structure for the donghai offshore wind turbine foundation qi and gao 2014 reported on the relationship between the pore water pressure and local scour around a mono pile based on wave flume experiments sui et al 2016 proposed a numerical model for wave seabed interactions in the vicinity of a mono pile based on a partial dynamic model biot 1956 they considered rocking of the pile and the influence of the pile embedded depth on momentary liquefaction recently lin et al 2017 developed a numerical model for the transient soil response around a pile by using openfoam with a quasi static model biot 1941 zhang et al 2017 examined the wave induced transient pore pressure around an offshore platform with a group of four piles their quasi static model used flow 3d to simulate wave motions and comsol multiphysics to simulate the porous seabed sui et al 2017 studied the effects of seabed consolidation around a structure on the wave induced momentary liquefaction in the vicinity of a mono pile in addition to the oscillatory mechanism zhao et al 2017 investigated the residual liquefaction around a mono pile with the flow 3d and comsol multiphysics models and sui et al 2019 examined the effects of the embedded depth on the residual soil response near a mono pile due to wave loading in oceanic environments waves and currents normally exist simultaneously to consider wave current interactions liu 2008 used openfoam to investigate the residual soil response and local scour around an object due to waves and current recently several studies have been conducted on the wave current induced transient seabed response with quasi static partial dynamic and full dynamic soil behaviors ye and jeng 2012 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2014 liao et al 2015 to the best of the authors knowledge a model of the combined effects of wave and current loadings on the soil response around a pile is not yet available the aim of the present study was to develop an openfoam model poro fssi foam for waves with the crossing current induced seabed response around a mono pile ihfoam was used to simulate the flow motions around the structure and seabedfoam was established to simulate the transient soil response based on the u p approximation the details of poro fssi foam were established then the proposed model was validated and used to examine the influences of the wave current characteristics and pile diameter on the transient soil response finally the distribution of the transient soil liquefaction around a mono pile due to waves with crossing current loadings was determined 2 poro fssi foam in this study poro fssi foam was developed within the framework of openfoam which is an object oriented computational fluid dynamics cfd class programmed in the c language openfoam uses the finite volume method fvm to discretize the partial differential equations and the definition and execution of the class libraries are separated the central theme of the openfoam design is that the solver applications which are written with the openfoam classes have a syntax that closely resembles the following partial equations 1 ρ u t ϕ 1 u ϕ 2 u p where ρ is the density of a fluid u is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are constant values recently openfoam has been widely used to simulate various coastal ocean engineering problems such as waves2foam and ihfoam for wave generation jacobsen et al 2012 higuera et al 2013a wave structure interactions li and teng 2015 higuera et al 2014a b and other coastal engineering processes higuera et al 2013b maza et al 2015 more recently openfoam has been adopted for the wave induced seabed response tang 2014 tang et al 2015 elsafti and oumeraci 2016 2017 lin et al 2017 however previous openfoam models were based on a consolidation model under only wave loading rather than a dynamic model such as the u p approximation under combined wave and current loadings fig 1 presents a schematic of a wave crossing current soil pile interactions where w is the wave flume width l s is the wave flume length θ is the wave current angle d is the water depth h is the seabed thickness e is the pile embedded depth d is the pile diameter and the numbers 1 4 are four points around the mono pile points 1 3 are located along the direction of wave propagation while point 4 is located along the direction of current propagation the distances from points 3 and 4 to the pile center are both twice the pile diameter the distance from point 1 to the pile center is 6 75 m while point 2 is 0 02 m from the upstream mono pile surface first the flow sub model for wave current interactions was established with ihfoam second a porous seabed sub model was developed with openfoam finally the flow and seabed sub models were integrated to form poro fssi foam 2 1 flow model ihfoam higuera et al 2013a is inherited from the interfoam which is a solver for two incompressible isothermal immiscible fluids in this section the basic governing equations and features of ihfoam are outlined the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are generally used to govern the flow motions under the assumption of an incompressible fluid 2 u 0 3 ρ f u t ρ f u u μ e f f u p g ρ f u μ e f f σ κ α where ρ f is the density of a fluid u is the velocity vector p is the pseudo dynamic pressure g is the gravitational acceleration σ is the surface tension coefficient κ α α is the curvature of the interface and α is the indicator function μ e f f is the efficient dynamic viscosity defined by μ e f f μ f ρ f ν t u r b μ f is the molecular dynamic viscosity and ν t u r b is the turbulent kinetic viscosity the indicator function α is defined as 4 α 1 water 0 air 0 α 1 free surface the volume fraction function can be determined by solving an advection equation 5 α t α u α 1 α u c 0 where u c min c α u c max u c which is a relative compression velocity in ihfoam the uniform current velocity u is generated prior to wave generation the wave generation model switches on after the current becomes stable the fifth order wave theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 is used for wave generation and the 3d full absorption boundaries which can provide reasonable fair wave absorption as suggested by higuera et al 2013a are applied to absorb reflected waves wave generation includes setting the values of the velocity and volume of fluid vof function the pressure can be calculated under the buoyant pressure boundary condition which can be used to calculate the normal gradient from the local density gradient in the first time step of the numerical model the wave generation variables are read and the relevant variables are calculated based on the wave theory for details on ihfoam including the numerical code and relevant documentation please refer to higuera et al 2013a 2 2 seabed model seabedfoam a major objective of the study was to develop a seabed sub model within the framework of openfoam this section outlines the basic governing equations and boundary conditions for the seabed sub model 2 2 1 partial dynamic model biot s poroelastic theory biot 1941 1956 is commonly used in 3d fluid soil interaction problems to describe the porous flow in a seabed the governing equations for partially dynamic soil behavior can be written as follows 6 σ p s ρ f 2 u s t 2 7 2 p s γ w n β s k s p s t ρ f 2 ε s t 2 γ w k s u s t where p s is the pore water pressure in the seabed σ is the effective stress vector u s u s v s w s is the soil displacement vector ρ f is the pore fluid density γ w is the unit weight of the pore fluid t is the time n s is the soil porosity and β s is the compressibility of the pore fluid the last is defined as 8 β s 1 k w o 1 s r ρ f g d where s r is the degree of saturation k w o 1 95 1 0 9 n m 2 is the bulk modulus of the pore water and d is the water depth the effective stress vector in 6 is expressed as follows 9 σ σ x τ x y τ x z τ y x σ τ y z τ z x τ z y σ z according to hooke s law the relationship between the stress and strain can be expressed as follows 10 σ x 2 g u s x μ 1 2 μ u s σ y 2 g v s y μ 1 2 μ u s σ z 2 g w s z μ 1 2 μ u s τ x z g u s z w s x τ z x τ y z g v s z w s y τ z y τ x y g u s y v s x τ y x where μ is poisson s ratio and g is the soil shear modulus the above approximations 6 and 7 are termed as the u p approximation zienkiewicz et al 1980 in this study seabedfoam was developed within the openfoam environment based on the u p model 2 2 2 boundary conditions for the flow sub model the left and bottom edges of the computational zone fig 1 were the incident boundary of the wave with the crossing current while the right and upper edges were the absorption boundary the wave pile interface was assumed to be a rigid wall boundary with a no slip condition imposed for velocities with regard to the seabed sub model the following boundary conditions were specified a bbc boundary condition at the bottom z h in general no vertical flow and zero displacement occur at the horizontal bottom 11 u s p s z 0 at z h b sbc boundary conditions at the seabed surface z 0 the pore pressure should be equal to the wave pressure p b and the vertical effective normal stress should vanish at the seabed surface 12 p s x y 0 t p b x y 0 t σ z τ x z τ y z 0 at z 0 where p b can be determined from the flow sub model ihfoam 2 2 3 development of seabedfoam as described previously seabedfoam was developed within the openfoam based on the u p model the detailed codes are provided in appendix a for example the governing equation 6 can be expressed in terms of openfoam code as follows fvm laplacian 2 p a 1 p a 2 u s fvc div p a 1 grad u s t p a 2 i tr grad u s p a 1 p a 2 grad u s fvm d2dt2 ρ u s fvc grad p s where p a 1 p a 2 p a 3 p a 4 and p a 5 are constant values that can be determined from input values including ρ w k s r w n s ρ and β the outputs from the code are the pore pressure p s and soil displacement u s the iteration times and residual errors need to be calibrated during the calculation process as noted previously fvm was applied to discretize the partial differential equations in openfoam to transform the governing equations into a system of algebraic equations the time space and equations were discretized as follows the time was discretized by subdividing the given total time interval into a number of time steps the space was discretized by splitting the spatial domain into a number of polyhedral control volumes cvs that did not overlap and completely filled the domain fig 2 illustrates a typical cv denoted as v p where the computational point node p is at its centroid the face f and centroid n of the neighboring cv sharing that face are also marked the equations were discretized by using the integral form of the governing equations over the computational spatial domain and time individual integral terms in the governing equations were replaced approximated by algebraic expressions concerning nodal values in the spatial domain generally the approximation obtained a second order accuracy when a linear variation of the variables over the cv was assumed 2 3 integration of ihfoam and seabedfoam as noted previously the u p equations were applied to govern the soil dynamic response only the acceleration due to soil displacement was considered and the relative displacement acceleration between the fluid and soil particles was not included therefore poro fssi foam is a one way integrated model rather than a two way coupling model the proposed model consists of flow and seabed sub models the flow sub model ihfoam is responsible for flow simulations while the seabed sub model seabedfoam is responsible for determining the fluid induced transient soil response fig 3 shows the flowchart of the modeling procedure once the wave parameters and current velocity are specified the wave pressures on the seabed surface can be obtained with ihfoam then the dynamic wave pressures are further treated as external loading in the seabed sub model finally the wave with the crossing current induced oscillatory soil response including the pore pressure and soil displacement can be obtained by solving the u p equations 2 4 poro fssi foam model for a pile for the case with a mono pile foundation an additional boundary is required herein the pile is considered to be rigid and the gradient of pore pressure should vanish at the surface of the pile i e 13 p s n 0 the above numerical model named as poro fssi foam was developed by the authors the codes are provided in appendix a and appendix b similar integrated process of flow and seabed models several models have been developed within openfoam environment tang 2014 tang et al 2015 elsafti and oumeraci 2016 2017 in their approaches the dynamic wave pressures at the seabed surface which were obtained from the flow model are exported to a datafile which are read in for the seabed model furthermore these studies only consider wave loading with another openfoam code waves2foam in this study we directly transfer the dynamic wave pressures from the flow model to the seabed model within openfoam environment rather than exporting the output this will speed up the computation furthermore we used ihfoam for the flow simulation as reported in 8 ihfoam performs better in the wave absorption which will reduce the computational domain moreover unlikely previous work we consider wave with crossing current loading in this study recently several numerical models have been developed for fluid seabed pile interactions among which the models developed by zhao et al 2017 and lin et al 2017 are representative the differences between the two representative models lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 and the proposed model are discussed in a later section 2 5 mesh sensitivity analysis for the poro fssi foam model the mesh number of the whole domain was 5 120 000 the maximum mesh length was 2 m and the minimum mesh length was 0 12 m the mesh near the structure was refined to demonstrate the mesh sensitivity of the numerical model fig 4 illustrates the wave variation with the crossing current induced maximum pore pressure p s at point 3 z 1 m with the total mesh number n of the whole domain including the flow sub model and seabed sub model the present mesh system provided sufficient accuracy 3 model validation the proposed model needed to be validated before being applied to a parametric study the model was compared to previous laboratory experiments in the following cases for validation 1 comparison of water surface elevations for wave current interactions umeyama 2011 2 comparison of velocity profiles for wave crossing current interactions musumeci et al 2006 3 comparison of water surface elevations and forces on a pile zang et al 2010 4 comparison of pore water pressures in a seabed chang et al 2007 5 comparison of pore water pressures in a seabed liu et al 2015 6 comparison of pore water pressures around a pile qi and gao 2014 7 comparison with previous numerical models zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2017 cases 1 3 were used to validate the flow sub model and cases 4 7 were used to validate the seabed sub model 3 1 comparison of water surface elevation for wave current interactions the first validation was to compare the numerical results with laboratory experiments conducted by umeyama 2011 for wave current interactions they performed a series of experiments to study ocean waves propagating with a current in a 25 m long wave flume with a 0 7 m width and 1 5 m depth fig 5 compares the free water surface profiles of the proposed model and experimental data the numerical simulation and laboratory experiment showed good agreement 3 2 comparison of velocity profiles for wave crossing current interactions to investigate the flow structure due to wave crossing current interactions musumeci et al 2006 measured the velocity profile with a micro acoustic doppler velocimeter in a wave flume the wave flume was 18 m long 4 m wide and 1 2 m high with a fixed horizontal bottom fig 6 compares the depth integrated time averaged velocities in the wave direction along the current direction for the experiment musumeci et al 2006 and proposed numerical model overall the proposed model agreed with the experimental results musumeci et al 2006 3 3 comparison of water surface elevation and forces on a pile the experimental data of zang et al 2010 were used to validate the proposed model they conducted experiments for the wave vertical cylinder interaction at dhi a schematic of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 7 d for more details on the laboratory experiment please refer to zang et al 2010 fig 7 a and 7 b compare the free water surfaces of the model and experimental data at wave gauge 1 point 1 in fig 1 and wave gauge 2 point 2 in fig 1 respectively overall the proposed model and experimental data agreed except for slight differences fig 7 c compares the simulated and experimental inline forces on the cylinder overall the wave force on the pile predicted by the proposed model agreed with the experimental data 3 4 comparison of the pore water pressures in a seabed wave flume tests the simulated results were compared with previous laboratory experiments in a wave flume chang et al 2007 that was 100 m long 1 5 m wide and 2 m high as shown in fig 8 a for more details on the laboratory experiments please refer to chang et al 2007 fig 8 shows that the pore pressures of the proposed model and experimental data agreed overall at three different locations 3 5 comparison of the pore water pressures in a seabed 1d compression tests rather than conventional wave flume tests liu et al 2015 conducted a series of one dimensional compression tests where they applied harmonic dynamic pressures to a 1 8 m thick soil layer with 10 pore pressure measurement points the advantage of these 1d experiments was that more measurements could be obtained along the vertical direction in a wave flume with a 20 40 cm thick soil layer only three or four measurements can be obtained which may not capture the whole profile fig 9 illustrates the distribution of the maximum pore pressures versus the soil depth the analytical solution with the quasi static approach hsu and jeng 1994 and the proposed numerical model seabedfoam with both quasi static and u p soil behaviors are included overall the proposed model seabedfoam agreed with the experimental data and analytical solution hsu and jeng 1994 3 6 comparison of the pore water pressures around a pile wave flume tests the above two validations of the pore pressure did not include any marine structures and only considered wave loadings the wave flume tests by qi and gao 2014 and qi et al 2019 were selected to validate the proposed model for the pore pressures around a pile subjected to wave and current loadings to the best of the authors knowledge these are the only experimental data available in the literature in this validation the measurements were taken at a section 2 mm away from the pile three points were measured at the seabed surface and 10 cm and 20 cm below the seabed surface as shown in fig 10 d overall the proposed model seabedfoam agreed with the laboratory experimental data as shown in fig 10 a c 3 7 comparison with other numerical models 21 44 this section discusses the differences between two representative numerical models lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 and the proposed model poro fssi foam lin et al 2017 used openfoam to investigate the wave seabed interaction around a piled foundation in their model they used waves2foam to simulate the wave motion and the quadratic spline qs model to simulate the seabed deformation the major differences between the proposed model and work by lin et al 2017 are the usage of waves2foam and ihfoam for the wave sub model and qs and u p approximation for the seabed sub model zhao et al 2017 used flow 3d to simulate the wave motion and comsol to simulate the wave induced residual soil response flow 3d is based on the finite difference method fdm while comsol is based on the finite element model fem connecting the two sub models is not easy moreover their comsol seabed sub mode is based on the qs model while the openfoam sub model in the proposed model is based on the u p approximation according to ulker et al 2009 both the qs model and u p model have their own applicable ranges in this comparison the models used by zhao et al 2017 and lin et al 2017 were compared against the proposed model for two cases as shown in fig 11 the results of the three models were close in case 1 because it was located in the range of qs behavior in case 2 the proposed model and other models showed obvious differences because it was located in the range of partially dynamic soil behavior note that an additional feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of currents the previous works lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 only considered wave loading in this study the dynamic wave pressure could be directly transferred from the flow sub model to the seabed sub model within the openfoam environment rather than being exported to data files to be read by the seabed sub model this increased the computation speed as a demonstration the computational times were compared for the proposed model and conventional model using exported data files for the same case fig 10 the proposed model required 18 3 h while the model with exported data files required 26 9 h the difference in input output i o consumed a large amount of time 4 results and discussions recently the effects of a pile on the wave field and pore pressures around the structure have been investigated in detail sui et al 2016 however previous studies only considered the wave loading even though waves and currents usually coexist in a natural ocean environment a new contribution of the proposed model is the inclusion of wave current interactions in the fluid structures seabed interaction fssi model herein the combined effects of waves currents on the transient soil response were examined because the effects of the soil properties have been widely discussed in other studies on wave only cases zhao et al 2017 they are not discussed here in the following numerical examples the input data refer to table 1 unless otherwise specified in this study the pile gravity which can affect the initial stress near the pile was considered in the liquefaction analysis based on the criterion proposed by zen and yamazaki 1990 if the effects of pre consolidation are considered the modified criterion of liquefaction can be expressed as zhao et al 2017 14 σ 0 p s p b 0 in which p s is pore pressures and p b is dynamic wave pressures at the seabed surface and σ 0 is mean initial effective stresses after pre consolidation which can be defined by 15 σ 0 σ 0 x σ 0 y σ 0 z 3 where σ 0 x σ 0 y and σ 0 z are the initial effective stresses in the x y and z direction respectively based on presented numerical model and the above liquefaction criterion soil liquefaction potential around a mono pile due to combined wave and current loadings can be evaluated 4 1 pore pressures around a mono pile in natural oceanic environments wave reflection may take place when wave propagation is impeded by an offshore structure the flow characteristics in the vicinity of a structure may be affected by a pile because of its blockage effects the changes in the flow characteristics may further influence the transient soil response around the structure to demonstrate the effects of wave crossing current interactions on wave characteristics fig 12 displays the development of an oblique wave in a crossing current without structures and fig 13 illustrates the variation in the free water surface around a mono pile during a complete wave period the wave current interactions significantly affected the distribution of the free water surface unlike the wave only case the wave no longer just propagated along the direction of the incident wave in the presence of a pile fig 14 illustrates the fluid induced pore pressures 1 m below the seabed surface both the maximum and minimum pore pressures occurred along the direction of the incident wave because the wave crest induced a large positive wave pressure and the wave trough induced a large negative wave pressure on the seabed surface these further intensified the maximum and minimum pore pressures respectively within the seabed 4 2 influences of current velocity on transient soil response in vicinity of a mono pile because a major contribution of the present study is the inclusion of currents in the fssi model the effects of the current velocity current velocity value u and wave current angle θ on the transient soil response around the mono pile were examined the pore pressure and effective normal stress are two key factors that determine the transient soil liquefaction thus waves with the crossing current induced pore pressures and effective normal stresses in the vicinity of the mono pile due to different current velocities were investigated the current velocity value u was increased from 0 2 m s to 0 8 m s in increments of 0 2 m s and the wave current angle θ was increased from 0 to 90 in increments of 30 to demonstrate the effects of the current velocity value u on transient soil response around the mono pile fig 15 a and b illustrate the distribution of the maximum pore pressures p s ρ w g d for various current velocities with θ 3 0 o at points 3 and 4 respectively fig 16 a and b illustrate the distribution of the maximum vertical effective normal stresses σ z ρ w g d at different current velocities as shown in fig 15 a and b the maximum pore pressures along the vertical line through point 3 were greater than those through point 4 because the wave pressures were greater at point 3 than at point 4 when the current velocity was less than 0 6 m s the maximum pore pressures and vertical effective normal stresses along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 decreased with the current velocity value u however the variation in the soil response from the case with a current velocity of 0 6 m s to the case with a current velocity of 0 8 m s was more obvious than when the current velocity was no more than 0 6 m s for the sake of clarity fig 17 displays the variation in the wave pressure distribution at the seabed surface with the current velocity as the current velocity increased the wave pressure on the seabed surface along the direction of the incident wave decreased slightly when the current velocity was less than 0 6 m s while the wave pressure decreased quickly when the current velocity was varied from 0 6 m s to 0 8 m s thus a critical current velocity that can cause the variation in the soil response with the current velocity to mutate should exist under certain wave conditions in addition to the current velocity value u the wave current angle θ is another important factor that affects the transient soil response in the vicinity of the mono pile therefore the effects of the wave current angle θ were also considered to better demonstrate the effects of the wave current angle θ on the transient soil response around a mono pile fig 18 illustrates the distribution of a wave with the crossing current induced maximum pore pressure p s ρ w g d along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 for different wave current angles θ fig 19 illustrates the maximum vertical effective normal stresses σ z ρ w g d for various wave current angles θ as shown in fig 18 the maximum pore pressure increased with θ from 0 to 60 and the maximum pore pressure decreased when θ increased from 60 to 90 this is because the wave current angle can affect the wave crossing current induced soil response by affecting the wave pressure at the seabed surface in other words the wave pressure at the seabed surface increases with θ when θ varies from 0 to 60 and decreases with increasing θ from 60 to 90 in addition point 3 was along the direction of the wave propagation and point 4 was along the direction of the current propagation thus the maximum wave pressure at the seabed surface should be greater at point 3 than at point 4 therefore the wave with the crossing current induced maximum soil response was greater at point 3 than at point 4 at the same seabed depth regardless of the wave current angle θ this agrees with the results in figs 18 and 19 4 3 influences of wave characteristics on transient soil response around a mono pile the wave characteristics usually play an important role in determining the seabed response around a mono pile the parameters include the wave height h wave period t and water depth d thus the effects of these three wave parameters on the wave crossing current induced transient soil response around a mono pile were examined in detail the wave height h was increased from 1 m to 3 m in increments of 1 m the wave period t was increased from 6 s to 10 s in increments of 2 s and the water depth d was increased from 8 m to 16 m in increments of 4 m to demonstrate the effects of the wave characteristics on the transient soil response due to wave crossing current loadings figs 20 22 illustrate the distribution of the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 for different wave parameters where u 0 4 m s θ 30 and d 4 m the maximum pore pressures increased with both the wave height h and wave period t but decreased with an increasing water depth d at both points 3 and 4 the variations in the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressure with the wave crossing current angle θ were hardly affected by the wave characteristics moreover the wave crossing current angle θ also had a small effect on the variations in the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressure 4 4 effects of pile diameter on transient soil response in vicinity of a mono pile as noted previously the variation in the pile diameter can affect the wave induced soil response around the mono pile the maximum pile diameter of an offshore wind turbine can be up to 8 m in real engineering practice thus the pile diameter was increased from 4 m to 8 m in increments of 2 m to investigate the effects of the pile diameter on the transient soil response around the structure fig 23 displays the distribution of the maximum pore pressures p s ρ w g d along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 where h 2 m t 6 s d 8 m u 0 4 m s and θ 30 the maximum pore pressures at point 3 were greater than those at point 4 regardless of the pile diameter d the pile diameter d had a greater effect on the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures at point 3 than at point 4 the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures increased with the pile diameter regardless of the wave current angle 4 5 transient soil liquefaction in vicinity of a mono pile due to wave with crossing current loading the main purpose of investigating the wave crossing current induced transient soil response around a mono pile was to provide some references for predicting the seabed stability around the structure the liquefaction development around a mono pile due to wave and crossing current loadings was examined then the effects of the wave crossing current angle on the soil liquefaction distribution were considered in order to demonstrate the liquefaction development fig 24 illustrates the distribution of the seabed liquefaction around the mono pile due to the wave crossing current loading at four typical times b shows the case where the structure was at the wave crest and d shows the case where the structure was at the wave trough fig 25 plots a 2 d line for the liquefaction depth around the mono pile at the same times shown in fig 24 d the maximum liquefaction depth was clearly greater along the direction of the incident wave than along the direction of the current which was consistent with the pore pressure distribution in addition the liquefaction development with the wave crossing current case was similar to that of the wave only case to clarify the effects of the wave crossing current angle θ on the transient soil liquefaction around the structure fig 26 gives the distribution of the transient soil liquefaction around the mono pile for four different wave crossing current angles θ when the structure was at the wave trough the wave current angle was found to greatly affect the soil liquefaction range and maximum liquefaction depth around the mono pile 5 conclusions in this study a 3 d integrated model poro fssi foam was developed within the framework of openfoam in addition to including the u p approximation the proposed model also considers crossing currents based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed numerical model poro fssi foam within the framework of openfoam can predict the transient soil response to waves and currents with sufficient accuracy 2 the wave crossing current angle influences not only the pore pressure distribution within the seabed but also the maximum soil liquefaction depth around the mono pile both the maximum transient pore pressure and liquefaction depth occur along the direction of the incident wave 3 the wave characteristics i e wave height wave period and water depth have similar effects on the wave crossing current induced transient soil response and the wave only case 4 both the wave characteristics and transient soil response can be affected by the mono pile the wave crossing current induced pore pressures around the mono pile increase with the increase of the pile diameter note that in u p approximation only the acceleration due soil displacement is considered but the relative displacement between fluid and soil particle is not included this is the reason why the present model cannot couple fluid displacement within the seabed and flow to achieve the coupling between fluid particles in both flow and seabed models the full dynamic model u w approximation is required to the authors best knowledge only sui et al 2017 have considered full dynamic model for wave seabed interactions around mono pile however they did not couple the fluid displacement in the seabed with the fluid velocity in the wave domain this requires further development in the future appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at http dx doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 05 024 appendix a supplementary data the following is

22744,a new 3d model is proposed within the framework of openfoam for understanding the physical processes of fluid soil interactions in the vicinity of a mono pile that considers both waves and currents the proposed model consists of a flow sub model and poro elastic seabed sub model the flow sub model combines the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation and k ϵ turbulence model to govern the flow motions the poro elastic seabed sub model employs the u p dynamic approximation to describe the transient seabed response the proposed model was validated against the experimental results of previous studies and applied to exploring the wave current induced pore pressure around a mono pile numerical examples confirmed that wave crossing current interactions can significantly affect the pattern of soil liquefaction around the mono pile keywords wave current interactions mono pile pore pressures soil liquefaction openfoam 1 introduction the seabed stability in the vicinity of offshore infrastructure has recently attracted significant attention in the offshore geotechnical engineering field because of the development of marine energy sources in oceanic environments pile foundations are used to support structures such as fixed type platforms the main function of a pile foundation is to transfer forces from the superstructure to the ground soil environmental loadings that act on a structure include wind waves currents and ices such loadings are a huge threat to the stability of a pile foundation for example an environmental loading can damage the structure where the supporting structure may suffer from the seepage force and lateral earth pressure within the seabed that destabilize the seabed in the literature fluctuations in the dynamic wave pressures on a seabed will induce variations in the pore water pressure in the seabed when the pore pressure becomes excessive and the effective stresses vanish the seabed may liquefy sumer 2014 jeng 2018 once liquefaction occurs soil particles behave as a heavy fluid and may be carried away by environmental loadings furthermore any structure on the liquefied seabed will become unstable and lose its designed function therefore accurately predicting seabed stability is particularly important for the design of marine infrastructure based on biot s poroelastic theory biot 1941 numerous models have been reported to clarify wave seabed interactions yamamoto et al 1978 proposed a closed form analytical solution for the soil response of an infinite seabed to a two dimensional progressive wave loading this framework was later extended to different seabed conditions for three dimensional short crested waves jeng and hsu 1996 several numerical models have been developed for more complicated soil conditions jeng and lin 1996 sui et al 2016 jeng et al 2018 guo et al 2019 qi et al 2019 numerous studies have considered the wave induced pore water pressure around a pile because of the growth of offshore activities li et al 2011 used abaqus to examine the pore pressure around a pile with linear wave loading they only considered a small diameter for the pile and ignored wave diffraction chang and jeng 2014 numerically studied the hydrodynamic loadings and soil response around a high rise platform structure for the donghai offshore wind turbine foundation qi and gao 2014 reported on the relationship between the pore water pressure and local scour around a mono pile based on wave flume experiments sui et al 2016 proposed a numerical model for wave seabed interactions in the vicinity of a mono pile based on a partial dynamic model biot 1956 they considered rocking of the pile and the influence of the pile embedded depth on momentary liquefaction recently lin et al 2017 developed a numerical model for the transient soil response around a pile by using openfoam with a quasi static model biot 1941 zhang et al 2017 examined the wave induced transient pore pressure around an offshore platform with a group of four piles their quasi static model used flow 3d to simulate wave motions and comsol multiphysics to simulate the porous seabed sui et al 2017 studied the effects of seabed consolidation around a structure on the wave induced momentary liquefaction in the vicinity of a mono pile in addition to the oscillatory mechanism zhao et al 2017 investigated the residual liquefaction around a mono pile with the flow 3d and comsol multiphysics models and sui et al 2019 examined the effects of the embedded depth on the residual soil response near a mono pile due to wave loading in oceanic environments waves and currents normally exist simultaneously to consider wave current interactions liu 2008 used openfoam to investigate the residual soil response and local scour around an object due to waves and current recently several studies have been conducted on the wave current induced transient seabed response with quasi static partial dynamic and full dynamic soil behaviors ye and jeng 2012 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2014 liao et al 2015 to the best of the authors knowledge a model of the combined effects of wave and current loadings on the soil response around a pile is not yet available the aim of the present study was to develop an openfoam model poro fssi foam for waves with the crossing current induced seabed response around a mono pile ihfoam was used to simulate the flow motions around the structure and seabedfoam was established to simulate the transient soil response based on the u p approximation the details of poro fssi foam were established then the proposed model was validated and used to examine the influences of the wave current characteristics and pile diameter on the transient soil response finally the distribution of the transient soil liquefaction around a mono pile due to waves with crossing current loadings was determined 2 poro fssi foam in this study poro fssi foam was developed within the framework of openfoam which is an object oriented computational fluid dynamics cfd class programmed in the c language openfoam uses the finite volume method fvm to discretize the partial differential equations and the definition and execution of the class libraries are separated the central theme of the openfoam design is that the solver applications which are written with the openfoam classes have a syntax that closely resembles the following partial equations 1 ρ u t ϕ 1 u ϕ 2 u p where ρ is the density of a fluid u is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are constant values recently openfoam has been widely used to simulate various coastal ocean engineering problems such as waves2foam and ihfoam for wave generation jacobsen et al 2012 higuera et al 2013a wave structure interactions li and teng 2015 higuera et al 2014a b and other coastal engineering processes higuera et al 2013b maza et al 2015 more recently openfoam has been adopted for the wave induced seabed response tang 2014 tang et al 2015 elsafti and oumeraci 2016 2017 lin et al 2017 however previous openfoam models were based on a consolidation model under only wave loading rather than a dynamic model such as the u p approximation under combined wave and current loadings fig 1 presents a schematic of a wave crossing current soil pile interactions where w is the wave flume width l s is the wave flume length θ is the wave current angle d is the water depth h is the seabed thickness e is the pile embedded depth d is the pile diameter and the numbers 1 4 are four points around the mono pile points 1 3 are located along the direction of wave propagation while point 4 is located along the direction of current propagation the distances from points 3 and 4 to the pile center are both twice the pile diameter the distance from point 1 to the pile center is 6 75 m while point 2 is 0 02 m from the upstream mono pile surface first the flow sub model for wave current interactions was established with ihfoam second a porous seabed sub model was developed with openfoam finally the flow and seabed sub models were integrated to form poro fssi foam 2 1 flow model ihfoam higuera et al 2013a is inherited from the interfoam which is a solver for two incompressible isothermal immiscible fluids in this section the basic governing equations and features of ihfoam are outlined the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are generally used to govern the flow motions under the assumption of an incompressible fluid 2 u 0 3 ρ f u t ρ f u u μ e f f u p g ρ f u μ e f f σ κ α where ρ f is the density

is a relative compression velocity in ihfoam the uniform current velocity u is generated prior to wave generation the wave generation model switches on after the current becomes stable the fifth order wave theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 is used for wave generation and the 3d full absorption boundaries which can provide reasonable fair wave absorption as suggested by higuera et al 2013a are applied to absorb reflected waves wave generation includes setting the values of the velocity and volume of fluid vof function the pressure can be calculated under the buoyant pressure boundary condition which can be used to calculate the normal gradient from the local density gradient in the first time step of the numerical model the wave generation variables are read and the relevant variables are calculated based on the wave theory for details on ihfoam including the numerical code and relevant documentation please refer to higuera et al 2013a 2 2 seabed model seabedfoam a major objective of the study was to develop a seabed sub model within the framework of openfoam this section outlines the basic governing equations and boundary conditions for the seabed sub model 2 2 1 partial dynamic model biot s poroelastic theory biot 1941 1956 is commonly used in 3d fluid soil interaction problems to describe the porous flow in a seabed the governing equations for partially dynamic soil behavior can be written as follows 6 σ p s ρ f 2 u s t 2 7 2 p s γ w n β s k s p s t ρ f 2 ε s t 2 γ w k s u s t where p s is the pore water pressure in the seabed σ is the effective stress vector u s u s v s w s is the soil displacement vector ρ f is the pore fluid density γ w is the unit weight of the pore fluid t is the time n s is the soil porosity and β s is the compressibility of the pore fluid the last is defined as 8 β s 1 k w o 1 s r ρ f g d where s r is the degree of saturation k w o 1 95 1 0 9 n m 2 is the bulk modulus of the pore water and d is the water depth the effective stress vector in 6 is expressed as follows 9 σ σ x τ x y τ x z τ y x σ τ y z τ z x τ z y σ z according to hooke s law the relationship between the stress and strain can be expressed as follows 10 σ x 2 g u s x μ 1 2 μ u s σ y 2 g v s y μ 1 2 μ u s σ z 2 g w s z μ 1 2 μ u s τ x z g u s z w s x τ z x τ y z g v s z w s y τ z y τ x y g u s y v s x τ y x where μ is poisson s ratio and g is the soil shear modulus the above approximations 6 and 7 are termed as the u p approximation zienkiewicz et al 1980 in this study seabedfoam was developed within the openfoam environment based on the u p model 2 2 2 boundary conditions for the flow sub model the left and bottom edges of the computational zone fig 1 were the incident boundary of the wave with the crossing current while the right and upper edges were the absorption boundary the wave pile interface was assumed to be a rigid wall boundary with a no slip condition imposed for velocities with regard to the seabed sub model the following boundary conditions were specified a bbc boundary condition at the bottom z h in general no vertical flow and zero displacement occur at the horizontal bottom 11 u s p s z 0 at z h b sbc boundary conditions at the seabed surface z 0 the pore pressure should be equal to the wave pressure p b and the vertical effective normal stress should vanish at the seabed surface 12 p s x y 0 t p b x y 0 t σ z τ x z τ y z 0 at z 0 where p b can be determined from the flow sub model ihfoam 2 2 3 development of seabedfoam as described previously seabedfoam was developed within the openfoam based on the u p model the detailed codes are provided in appendix a for example the governing equation 6 can be expressed in terms of openfoam code as follows fvm laplacian 2 p a 1 p a 2 u s fvc div p a 1 grad u s t p a 2 i tr grad u s p a 1 p a 2 grad u s fvm d2dt2 ρ u s fvc grad p s where p a 1 p a 2 p a 3 p a 4 and p a 5 are constant values that can be determined from input values including ρ w k s r w n s ρ and β the outputs from the code are the pore pressure p s and soil displacement u s the iteration times and residual errors need to be calibrated during the calculation process as noted previously fvm was applied to discretize the partial differential equations in openfoam to transform the governing equations into a system of algebraic equations the time space and equations were discretized as follows the time was discretized by subdividing the given total time interval into a number of time steps the space was discretized by splitting the spatial domain into a number of polyhedral control volumes cvs that did not overlap and completely filled the domain fig 2 illustrates a typical cv denoted as v p where the computational point node p is at its centroid the face f and centroid n of the neighboring cv sharing that face are also marked the equations were discretized by using the integral form of the governing equations over the computational spatial domain and time individual integral terms in the governing equations were replaced approximated by algebraic expressions concerning nodal values in the spatial domain generally the approximation obtained a second order accuracy when a linear variation of the variables over the cv was assumed 2 3 integration of ihfoam and seabedfoam as noted previously the u p equations were applied to govern the soil dynamic response only the acceleration due to soil displacement was considered and the relative displacement acceleration between the fluid and soil particles was not included therefore poro fssi foam is a one way integrated model rather than a two way coupling model the proposed model consists of flow and seabed sub models the flow sub model ihfoam is responsible for flow simulations while the seabed sub model seabedfoam is responsible for determining the fluid induced transient soil response fig 3 shows the flowchart of the modeling procedure once the wave parameters and current velocity are specified the wave pressures on the seabed surface can be obtained with ihfoam then the dynamic wave pressures are further treated as external loading in the seabed sub model finally the wave with the crossing current induced oscillatory soil response including the pore pressure and soil displacement can be obtained by solving the u p equations 2 4 poro fssi foam model for a pile for the case with a mono pile foundation an additional boundary is required herein the pile is considered to be rigid and the gradient of pore pressure should vanish at the surface of the pile i e 13 p s n 0 the above numerical model named as poro fssi foam was developed by the authors the codes are provided in appendix a and appendix b similar integrated process of flow and seabed models several models have been developed within openfoam environment tang 2014 tang et al 2015 elsafti and oumeraci 2016 2017 in their approaches the dynamic wave pressures at the seabed surface which were obtained from the flow model are exported to a datafile which are read in for the seabed model furthermore these studies only consider wave loading with another openfoam code waves2foam in this study we directly transfer the dynamic wave pressures from the flow model to the seabed model within openfoam environment rather than exporting the output this will speed up the computation furthermore we used ihfoam for the flow simulation as reported in 8 ihfoam performs better in the wave absorption which will reduce the computational domain moreover unlikely previous work we consider wave with crossing current loading in this study recently several numerical models have been developed for fluid seabed pile interactions among which the models developed by zhao et al 2017 and lin et al 2017 are representative the differences between the two representative models lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 and the proposed model are discussed in a later section 2 5 mesh sensitivity analysis for the poro fssi foam model the mesh number of the whole domain was 5 120 000 the maximum mesh length was 2 m and the minimum mesh length was 0 12 m the mesh near the structure was refined to demonstrate the mesh sensitivity of the numerical model fig 4 illustrates the wave variation with the crossing current induced maximum pore pressure p s at point 3 z 1 m with the total mesh number n of the whole domain including the flow sub model and seabed sub model the present mesh system provided sufficient accuracy 3 model validation the proposed model needed to be validated before being applied to a parametric study the model was compared to previous laboratory experiments in the following cases for validation 1 comparison of water surface elevations for wave current interactions umeyama 2011 2 comparison of velocity profiles for wave crossing current interactions musumeci et al 2006 3 comparison of water surface elevations and forces on a pile zang et al 2010 4 comparison of pore water pressures in a seabed chang et al 2007 5 comparison of pore water pressures in a seabed liu et al 2015 6 comparison of pore water pressures around a pile qi and gao 2014 7 comparison with previous numerical models zhao et al 2017 lin et al 2017 cases 1 3 were used to validate the flow sub model and cases 4 7 were used to validate the seabed sub model 3 1 comparison of water surface elevation for wave current interactions the first validation was to compare the numerical results with laboratory experiments conducted by umeyama 2011 for wave current interactions they performed a series of experiments to study ocean waves propagating with a current in a 25 m long wave flume with a 0 7 m width and 1 5 m depth fig 5 compares the free water surface profiles of the proposed model and experimental data the numerical simulation and laboratory experiment showed good agreement 3 2 comparison of velocity profiles for wave crossing current interactions to investigate the flow structure due to wave crossing current interactions musumeci et al 2006 measured the velocity profile with a micro acoustic doppler velocimeter in a wave flume the wave flume was 18 m long 4 m wide and 1 2 m high with a fixed horizontal bottom fig 6 compares the depth integrated time averaged velocities in the wave direction along the current direction for the experiment musumeci et al 2006 and proposed numerical model overall the proposed model agreed with the experimental results musumeci et al 2006 3 3 comparison of water surface elevation and forces on a pile the experimental data of zang et al 2010 were used to validate the proposed model they conducted experiments for the wave vertical cylinder interaction at dhi a schematic of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 7 d for more details on the laboratory experiment please refer to zang et al 2010 fig 7 a and 7 b compare the free water surfaces of the model and experimental data at wave gauge 1 point 1 in fig 1 and wave gauge 2 point 2 in fig 1 respectively overall the proposed model and experimental data agreed except for slight differences fig 7 c compares the simulated and experimental inline forces on the cylinder overall the wave force on the pile predicted by the proposed model agreed with the experimental data 3 4 comparison of the pore water pressures in a seabed wave flume tests the simulated results were compared with previous laboratory experiments in a wave flume chang et al 2007 that was 100 m long 1 5 m wide and 2 m high as shown in fig 8 a for more details on the laboratory experiments please refer to chang et al 2007 fig 8 shows that the pore pressures of the proposed model and experimental data agreed overall at three different locations 3 5 comparison of the pore water pressures in a seabed 1d compression tests rather than conventional wave flume tests liu et al 2015 conducted a series of one dimensional compression tests where they applied harmonic dynamic pressures to a 1 8 m thick soil layer with 10 pore pressure measurement points the advantage of these 1d experiments was that more measurements could be obtained along the vertical direction in a wave flume with a 20 40 cm thick soil layer only three or four measurements can be obtained which may not capture the whole profile fig 9 illustrates the distribution of the maximum pore pressures versus the soil depth the analytical solution with the quasi static approach hsu and jeng 1994 and the proposed numerical model seabedfoam with both quasi static and u p soil behaviors are included overall the proposed model seabedfoam agreed with the experimental data and analytical solution hsu and jeng 1994 3 6 comparison of the pore water pressures around a pile wave flume tests the above two validations of the pore pressure did not include any marine structures and only considered wave loadings the wave flume tests by qi and gao 2014 and qi et al 2019 were selected to validate the proposed model for the pore pressures around a pile subjected to wave and current loadings to the best of the authors knowledge these are the only experimental data available in the literature in this validation the measurements were taken at a section 2 mm away from the pile three points were measured at the seabed surface and 10 cm and 20 cm below the seabed surface as shown in fig 10 d overall the proposed model seabedfoam agreed with the laboratory experimental data as shown in fig 10 a c 3 7 comparison with other numerical models 21 44 this section discusses the differences between two representative numerical models lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 and the proposed model poro fssi foam lin et al 2017 used openfoam to investigate the wave seabed interaction around a piled foundation in their model they used waves2foam to simulate the wave motion and the quadratic spline qs model to simulate the seabed deformation the major differences between the proposed model and work by lin et al 2017 are the usage of waves2foam and ihfoam for the wave sub model and qs and u p approximation for the seabed sub model zhao et al 2017 used flow 3d to simulate the wave motion and comsol to simulate the wave induced residual soil response flow 3d is based on the finite difference method fdm while comsol is based on the finite element model fem connecting the two sub models is not easy moreover their comsol seabed sub mode is based on the qs model while the openfoam sub model in the proposed model is based on the u p approximation according to ulker et al 2009 both the qs model and u p model have their own applicable ranges in this comparison the models used by zhao et al 2017 and lin et al 2017 were compared against the proposed model for two cases as shown in fig 11 the results of the three models were close in case 1 because it was located in the range of qs behavior in case 2 the proposed model and other models showed obvious differences because it was located in the range of partially dynamic soil behavior note that an additional feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of currents the previous works lin et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 only considered wave loading in this study the dynamic wave pressure could be directly transferred from the flow sub model to the seabed sub model within the openfoam environment rather than being exported to data files to be read by the seabed sub model this increased the computation speed as a demonstration the computational times were compared for the proposed model and conventional model using exported data files for the same case fig 10 the proposed model required 18 3 h while the model with exported data files required 26 9 h the difference in input output i o consumed a large amount of time 4 results and discussions recently the effects of a pile on the wave field and pore pressures around the structure have been investigated in detail sui et al 2016 however previous studies only considered the wave loading even though waves and currents usually coexist in a natural ocean environment a new contribution of the proposed model is the inclusion of wave current interactions in the fluid structures seabed interaction fssi model herein the combined effects of waves currents on the transient soil response were examined because the effects of the soil properties have been widely discussed in other studies on wave only cases zhao et al 2017 they are not discussed here in the following numerical examples the input data refer to table 1 unless otherwise specified in this study the pile gravity which can affect the initial stress near the pile was considered in the liquefaction analysis based on the criterion proposed by zen and yamazaki 1990 if the effects of pre consolidation are considered the modified criterion of liquefaction can be expressed as zhao et al 2017 14 σ 0 p s p b 0 in which p s is pore pressures and p b is dynamic wave pressures at the seabed surface and σ 0 is mean initial effective stresses after pre consolidation which can be defined by 15 σ 0 σ 0 x σ 0 y σ 0 z 3 where σ 0 x σ 0 y and σ 0 z are the initial effective stresses in the x y and z direction respectively based on presented numerical model and the above liquefaction criterion soil liquefaction potential around a mono pile due to combined wave and current loadings can be evaluated 4 1 pore pressures around a mono pile in natural oceanic environments wave reflection may take place when wave propagation is impeded by an offshore structure the flow characteristics in the vicinity of a structure may be affected by a pile because of its blockage effects the changes in the flow characteristics may further influence the transient soil response around the structure to demonstrate the effects of wave crossing current interactions on wave characteristics fig 12 displays the development of an oblique wave in a crossing current without structures and fig 13 illustrates the variation in the free water surface around a mono pile during a complete wave period the wave current interactions significantly affected the distribution of the free water surface unlike the wave only case the wave no longer just propagated along the direction of the incident wave in the presence of a pile fig 14 illustrates the fluid induced pore pressures 1 m below the seabed surface both the maximum and minimum pore pressures occurred along the direction of the incident wave because the wave crest induced a large positive wave pressure and the wave trough induced a large negative wave pressure on the seabed surface these further intensified the maximum and minimum pore pressures respectively within the seabed 4 2 influences of current velocity on transient soil response in vicinity of a mono pile because a major contribution of the present study is the inclusion of currents in the fssi model the effects of the current velocity current velocity value u and wave current angle θ on the transient soil response around the mono pile were examined the pore pressure and effective normal stress are two key factors that determine the transient soil liquefaction thus waves with the crossing current induced pore pressures and effective normal stresses in the vicinity of the mono pile due to different current velocities were investigated the current velocity value u was increased from 0 2 m s to 0 8 m s in increments of 0 2 m s and the wave current angle θ was increased from 0 to 90 in increments of 30 to demonstrate the effects of the current velocity value u on transient soil response around the mono pile fig 15 a and b illustrate the distribution of the maximum pore pressures p s ρ w g d for various current velocities with θ 3 0 o at points 3 and 4 respectively fig 16 a and b illustrate the distribution of the maximum vertical effective normal stresses σ z ρ w g d at different current velocities as shown in fig 15 a and b the maximum pore pressures along the vertical line through point 3 were greater than those through point 4 because the wave pressures were greater at point 3 than at point 4 when the current velocity was less than 0 6 m s the maximum pore pressures and vertical effective normal stresses along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 decreased with the current velocity value u however the variation in the soil response from the case with a current velocity of 0 6 m s to the case with a current velocity of 0 8 m s was more obvious than when the current velocity was no more than 0 6 m s for the sake of clarity fig 17 displays the variation in the wave pressure distribution at the seabed surface with the current velocity as the current velocity increased the wave pressure on the seabed surface along the direction of the incident wave decreased slightly when the current velocity was less than 0 6 m s while the wave pressure decreased quickly when the current velocity was varied from 0 6 m s to 0 8 m s thus a critical current velocity that can cause the variation in the soil response with the current velocity to mutate should exist under certain wave conditions in addition to the current velocity value u the wave current angle θ is another important factor that affects the transient soil response in the vicinity of the mono pile therefore the effects of the wave current angle θ were also considered to better demonstrate the effects of the wave current angle θ on the transient soil response around a mono pile fig 18 illustrates the distribution of a wave with the crossing current induced maximum pore pressure p s ρ w g d along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 for different wave current angles θ fig 19 illustrates the maximum vertical effective normal stresses σ z ρ w g d for various wave current angles θ as shown in fig 18 the maximum pore pressure increased with θ from 0 to 60 and the maximum pore pressure decreased when θ increased from 60 to 90 this is because the wave current angle can affect the wave crossing current induced soil response by affecting the wave pressure at the seabed surface in other words the wave pressure at the seabed surface increases with θ when θ varies from 0 to 60 and decreases with increasing θ from 60 to 90 in addition point 3 was along the direction of the wave propagation and point 4 was along the direction of the current propagation thus the maximum wave pressure at the seabed surface should be greater at point 3 than at point 4 therefore the wave with the crossing current induced maximum soil response was greater at point 3 than at point 4 at the same seabed depth regardless of the wave current angle θ this agrees with the results in figs 18 and 19 4 3 influences of wave characteristics on transient soil response around a mono pile the wave characteristics usually play an important role in determining the seabed response around a mono pile the parameters include the wave height h wave period t and water depth d thus the effects of these three wave parameters on the wave crossing current induced transient soil response around a mono pile were examined in detail the wave height h was increased from 1 m to 3 m in increments of 1 m the wave period t was increased from 6 s to 10 s in increments of 2 s and the water depth d was increased from 8 m to 16 m in increments of 4 m to demonstrate the effects of the wave characteristics on the transient soil response due to wave crossing current loadings figs 20 22 illustrate the distribution of the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 for different wave parameters where u 0 4 m s θ 30 and d 4 m the maximum pore pressures increased with both the wave height h and wave period t but decreased with an increasing water depth d at both points 3 and 4 the variations in the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressure with the wave crossing current angle θ were hardly affected by the wave characteristics moreover the wave crossing current angle θ also had a small effect on the variations in the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressure 4 4 effects of pile diameter on transient soil response in vicinity of a mono pile as noted previously the variation in the pile diameter can affect the wave induced soil response around the mono pile the maximum pile diameter of an offshore wind turbine can be up to 8 m in real engineering practice thus the pile diameter was increased from 4 m to 8 m in increments of 2 m to investigate the effects of the pile diameter on the transient soil response around the structure fig 23 displays the distribution of the maximum pore pressures p s ρ w g d along the vertical line through points 3 and 4 where h 2 m t 6 s d 8 m u 0 4 m s and θ 30 the maximum pore pressures at point 3 were greater than those at point 4 regardless of the pile diameter d the pile diameter d had a greater effect on the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures at point 3 than at point 4 the wave crossing current induced maximum pore pressures increased with the pile diameter regardless of the wave current angle 4 5 transient soil liquefaction in vicinity of a mono pile due to wave with crossing current loading the main purpose of investigating the wave crossing current induced transient soil response around a mono pile was to provide some references for predicting the seabed stability around the structure the liquefaction development around a mono pile due to wave and crossing current loadings was examined then the effects of the wave crossing current angle on the soil liquefaction distribution were considered in order to demonstrate the liquefaction development fig 24 illustrates the distribution of the seabed liquefaction around the mono pile due to the wave crossing current loading at four typical times b shows the case where the structure was at the wave crest and d shows the case where the structure was at the wave trough fig 25 plots a 2 d line for the liquefaction depth around the mono pile at the same times shown in fig 24 d the maximum liquefaction depth was clearly greater along the direction of the incident wave than along the direction of the current which was consistent with the pore pressure distribution in addition the liquefaction development with the wave crossing current case was similar to that of the wave only case to clarify the effects of the wave crossing current angle θ on the transient soil liquefaction around the structure fig 26 gives the distribution of the transient soil liquefaction around the mono pile for four different wave crossing current angles θ when the structure was at the wave trough the wave current angle was found to greatly affect the soil liquefaction range and maximum liquefaction depth around the mono pile 5 conclusions in this study a 3 d integrated model poro fssi foam was developed within the framework of openfoam in addition to including the u p approximation the proposed model also considers crossing currents based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed numerical model poro fssi foam within the framework of openfoam can predict the transient soil response to waves and currents with sufficient accuracy 2 the wave crossing current angle influences not only the pore pressure distribution within the seabed but also the maximum soil liquefaction depth around the mono pile both the maximum transient pore pressure and liquefaction depth occur along the direction of the incident wave 3 the wave characteristics i e wave height wave period and water depth have similar effects on the wave crossing current induced transient soil response and the wave only case 4 both the wave characteristics and transient soil response can be affected by the mono pile the wave crossing current induced pore pressures around the mono pile increase with the increase of the pile diameter note that in u p approximation only the acceleration due soil displacement is considered but the relative displacement between fluid and soil particle is not included this is the reason why the present model cannot couple fluid displacement within the seabed and flow to achieve the coupling between fluid particles in both flow and seabed models the full dynamic model u w approximation is required to the authors best knowledge only sui et al 2017 have considered full dynamic model for wave seabed interactions around mono pile however they did not couple the fluid displacement in the seabed with the fluid velocity in the wave domain this requires further development in the
