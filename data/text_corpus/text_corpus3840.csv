19200,the emergence of resistance to antibacterial drugs and pesticides in water is unprecedented this may have adverse consequences to human health and ecological systems this paper first sought the identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in two secondary effluent wastewaters sew of different quality characteristics followed by their removal by ferrate vi fe vi feo4 2 screening for 22 pharmaceuticals and 32 pesticides revealed that 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides in sew of plant a and 14 pharmaceuticals and 5 pesticides in sew of plant b were present at concentrations higher than the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method quantitation limit the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and pesticides ranged from 0 15 ng l 413 03 ng l investigation of the removal of these pharmaceuticals and pesticides by fe vi showed that some had recalcitrant activity towards their oxidation acid activated fe vi resulted in enhanced oxidation 12 6 56 2 degradation efficiency of 6 and 7 pharmaceuticals in sew of plant a and plant b respectively at a shorter time than fe vi without activation i e 3 5 min versus 15 30 min the degradation of 1 and 3 pesticides in sew of plant a and plant b respectively has also been enhanced by activating fe vi 13 8 86 2 degradation efficiency results on testing of organic matter characterization of treated sew with and without acid activated fe vi treatment are also presented acid activated fe vi treatment has potential in enhancing the removal of micropollutants in real wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrate vi activation enhanced oxidation wastewater micropollutants 1 introduction population growth and industrialization resulted in the use of many synthetic and natural compounds to meet the needs of the modern society several million tons of pharmaceuticals and pesticides are used in consumer and industrial products and in fertilizers coors et al 2018 nsenga kumwimba et al 2018 these chemicals that potentially end up in surface waters include a wide range of pollutants such as emerging organic contaminants eocs e g endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products pesticides etc gago ferrero et al 2017 klatte et al 2017 most of the eocs persist in the environment and may accumulate in the food web e g drinking water with unknown short and long term effects on human health aquatic life and wildlife jepson and law 2016 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2017 ye et al 2017 the continuous release of pharmaceuticals and pesticides to the environment may have undesired harmful effects on ecological species and could pose major risk to human health through the long term consumption of contaminated water kalliora et al 2018 sophia and lima 2018 it is of utmost importance that these eocs are surveyed in effluent waters the present paper thus initially focuses on identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in secondary effluent waters many eocs also known as micropollutants are not easily removed by conventional biological wastewater treatment processes as indicated by their presence in drinking water ebele et al 2017 sharma and feng 2017 thus different technologies such as physical processes e g filtration and adsorption and chemical oxidation processes are investigated as alternatives or additions to the existing wastewater treatment processes to remove eocs feng et al 2018 sophia and lima 2018 tayo et al 2018 von gunten 2018 particularly light driven e g ultraviolet uv and radical based e g hydroxyl and sulfate processes are being proposed to remove micropollutants from water and wastewater luo et al 2018a 2018b 2017 xiao et al 2018 the present paper seeks efficient and enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in wastewater by high valent iron based green oxidant known as ferrate vi fe vi fevio4 2 in recent years fe vi has received great attention as a multipurpose water treatment chemical due to its oxidation and disinfection properties leaving nontoxic fe iii oxides hydroxides after its application initiating the process of coagulation fan et al 2018 goodwill et al 2015 jiang 2015 jiang et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 shin et al 2018 sun et al 2016 2018a recent studies emphasized on the oxidation of eocs by fe vi karlesa et al 2014 sharma et al 2016 yang et al 2012 despite the efficient elimination of most of the studied contaminants fe vi had low reactivity with some eocs sharma et al 2016 there has been an increasing interest in activating fe vi to enhance the oxidation of micropollutants we recently demonstrated the activation of fe vi by acid e g hcl and solid material i e silica gel to enhance the oxidative transformation of eocs i e caffeine atenolol and acesulfame potassium at environmentally relevant slightly basic ph manoli et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the activation of fe vi by ammonia peroxymonosulfate sulfur iv hyposulfite s2o4 2 pyrosulfite s2o5 2 and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts has also been reported dong et al 2017 feng et al 2017a 2017b feng and sharma 2018 sun et al 2018b significantly these studies were carried out in deionized water and none of the aforementioned activation methods have yet been applied to degrade multiple micropollutants in real wastewater the present study investigates for the first time the applicability of the acid activated fe vi oxidation process to degrade pharmaceuticals and pesticides under real wastewater treatment conditions the objectives of the present paper are to i identify and quantify pharmaceuticals and pesticides at their natural concentration ng l in secondary effluent wastewaters sew collected from two wastewater treatment plants plant a and plant b with varied solid and organic contents ii investigate the oxidation of the quantified contaminants by fe vi nonactivated and iii demonstrate the enhanced degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew by acid activated fe vi 2 materials and methods 2 1 degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides by fe vi and acid activated fe vi details related to the chemicals and sew used in the study are given in text s1 and table s1 the experiments were conducted in 1 l beaker the solutions were rapidly mixed using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 23 2 c the reactions were initiated by adding a certain amount of the solid fe vi in 550 ml of sew after the addition of fe vi the ph stabilized within 1 min was defined as the initial ph ph 1 then in the case of acid activated fe vi the desired amount of hcl was added dropwise within 30 s to the mixed solution and the lowest ph observed during the addition of hcl was noted ph 2 importantly the ph decrease due to addition of acid was only 0 1 0 3 ph units table s2 the ph of the acid mixed samples were measured at 10 20 and 30 min and noted as ph 3 ph 4 and ph 5 respectively when the characteristic purple color of fe vi fully disappeared fe vi decay time the reaction was considered complete the generated fe iii particulate was removed by filtration filtration time and the ph was noted as the final ph ph 6 the experimental conditions variation of the ph and fe vi decay time are shown in table s2 extraction and processing of samples are detailed in text s2 2 2 analytical methods uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu

detailed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew initially the untreated sew samples from plant a and plant b were screened for hundreds of compounds a recently developed method allowed confident detection based on accurate mass retention time and fragmentation patterns renaud et al 2017 in this study 29 detected compounds were analyzed using the prm method described in text s4 of the targeted analytes 3 pharmaceuticals and 22 pesticides were not detected above the method detection limit mdl in neither sew of plant a or plant b during method development multiple samples were analyzed to determine accurate recoveries for each compound and to take into consideration any instrument differences spe deviations etc 3 1 1 pharmaceuticals ractopamine rac spiramycin spa sulfamethazine smz cycloheximide hex miconazole mic salinomycin sal and monensin mon were only detected in the sew of plant b table 1 however the concentrations of rac spa hex mic and mon were below the method quantitation limit mql table 1 although gliclazide gli was detected in the sew of both plants its concentration was higher than the mql only in the sew of plant b tylosin tyl and diclofenac dfc were identified in both plant a and plant b sew at concentrations lower than the mql table 1 hence the degradation of these micropollutants i e concentrations below mql could not be investigated in the sew of plant a 11 pharmaceuticals i e albuterol abtr ranitidine rtnd lincomycin lin thiabendazole tbdz azithromycin azt sulfamethoxazole smx nortriptyline ntp amitriptyline ath clarithromycin cla sertraline stl and warfarin warf were found at concentrations ranging from 0 88 to 348 94 ng l table 1 warf and smx had the lowest and highest concentrations respectively the concentrations of rtnd and azt were at the same order of magnitude with smx table 1 abtr tbdz and ntp were detected at relatively low concentrations 10 00 ng l table 1 the concentrations of lin ath cla and stl in plant a sew ranged from 12 55 to 60 18 ng l in the sew of plant b 3 additional pharmaceuticals i e sulfamethazine smz gliclazide gli and salinomycin sal were detected at concentrations higher than the mql table 1 the concentrations of the 14 pharmaceuticals ranged from 1 04 to 413 03 ng l table 1 ntp and smx had the lowest and highest concentrations respectively rtnd was found at a concentration of the same order of magnitude with smx abtr smz stl gli warf and sal were detected at relatively low concentrations 10 00 ng l table 1 the concentrations of lin tbdz azt ath and cla in plant b sew ranged from 9 40 to 21 42 ng l the structures of the detected pharmaceuticals are given in table s5 the concentrations of pharmaceuticals found in the sew can lead to serious adverse effects from acute and chronic exposure for example it is vital to remove antibiotics such as smx and azt present in the sew as it has been shown their presence in the environment can lead to bacteria adaption and the development of resistance daughton and ternes 1999 3 1 2 pesticides ten pesticides i e cyromazine cyrine schradan schdan atraton trnt thiacloprid tcp imazalil imalil 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol tcpy cyprodinil cypnil azoxystrobin azobin buprofezin bupine and trifloxystrobin trifbin were detected in at least one of the sew samples used in the study table 2 cyrine schdan tcp bupine and trifbin were only detected in sew of plant b however the concentrations of cyrine schdan tcp and trifbin were below the mql hence quantitation of these micropollutants was not possible table 2 trnt was detected in both sew but its concentration was higher than mql only in plant b 0 21 ng l this is consistent with our observations in the case of pharmaceuticals where more compounds were detected in sew of plant b than of plant a tables 1 and 2 cypnil was detected in both sew at a lower concentration than mql the concentrations of imalil and azobin in the 2 sew were similar table 2 tcpy was found at higher concentration in sew of plant b 5 31 ng l than plant a 2 19 ng l the structures of the detected pesticides are given in table s6 many pesticides have been linked directly to adverse effects when administered to non targeted species from acute and chronic exposure for example a recent study found the chronic exposure of azobin affected biomass and reproduction in aquatic invertebrates kunz et al 2017 there has been evidence that there can be synergistic effects when multiple pesticides are combined qin et al 2018 it is important to limit the presence of these pesticides in sew to prevent dangers to both human and non targeted insect plant and animal health 3 2 degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides fe vi in the initial set of experiments the degradation of quantified pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew of plant a and plant b by fe vi nonactivated has been investigated the applied concentration of fe vi was 5 mg l as fe and the degradation efficiencies were determined complete removal 95 0 of abtr rtnd lin and warf in sew of plant a by fe vi was achieved table s7 no information related to the oxidation of the aforementioned micropollutants by fe vi is available in the literature abtr also known as salbutamol is a β agonist widely used for the treatment of respiratory diseases e g bronchial asthma zhou et al 2017 its oxidation by permanganate was initiated by an attack of the oxidant to the aromatic ring of abtr rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 the chlorination of abtr resulted in the formation of chlorinated intermediates via electrophilic aromatic substitution quintana et al 2012 the high reactivity of fe vi with abtr observed in the present study may be explained by the electron rich phenolic moiety of abtr table s5 this is in agreement with previously reported studies which showed that fe vi reacts preferentially with electron rich organic moieties including phenols lee et al 2009 rtnd is a histamine h2 receptor antagonist used as gastrointestinal drug latch et al 2003 lin belongs to the family of lincosamide antibiotics and is used worldwide in human and veterinary medicine to inhibit the gram positive bacteria growth bautitz and nogueira 2010 wang et al 2018 the ozonation of lin may likely initiated by an attack of the chemical oxidant at the sulfur atom of lin andreozzi et al 2006 significantly fe vi has shown high reactivity with organosulfur compounds sharma et al 2011 high removal efficiencies of abtr rtnd and lin of 96 6 99 7 and 89 9 by 5 mg fe vi l were observed in the sew of plant b as well table s7 however the degradation efficiency of warf by fe vi was much lower in sew of plant b 42 0 than the 95 7 observed for plant a table s7 complete degradation of gli in the sew of plant b by fe vi was also observed gli is a second generation sulfonylurea used as an antidiabetic drug to stimulate the secretion of insulin radi et al 1999 the oxidation of gli has been investigated only in sew of plant b due to its low concentration i e mql in the sew of plant a table 1 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with gli abtr rtnd lin and warf tbdz azt smx ntp ath and stl in the sew of plant a could not be removed efficiently by fe vi 65 0 degradation efficiency while no reaction of fe vi with cla was seen table s7 in the sew of plant b low elimination efficiencies of ntp ath cla and stl by fe vi were observed 35 0 interestingly fe vi did not react with tbdz azt smz and smx in the sew of plant b table s7 the oxidation of the three pesticides detected in the sew of plant a at concentrations higher than the mql by fe vi was investigated table 2 high degradation efficiencies of imalil and azobin by fe vi were achieved i e 98 0 table s7 limited information related to the oxidation of pesticides by fe vi in aqueous solution has been reported so far sun et al 2018 imalil also known as enilconazole is a pesticide used as a broad spectrum systemic imidazole fungicide in agriculture applications e g fruits and vegetables genena et al 2011 a study on the ozonation proposed an initial attack of the oxidant at the highest electron density exocyclic aliphatic carbon double bond moiety of the pesticide genena et al 2011 azobin is the largest selling fungicide globally with high toxicity to aquatic organisms hence its removal from water is important tabakoglu and karaca 2015 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with imalil and azobin the degradation of tcpy in the sew of plant a by fe vi was not high 60 0 fe vi did not react with these pesticides i e imalil azobin and tcpy in the sew of plant b table s7 due to a higher degree of complexity in the matrix table s1 the oxidation of bupine and trnt by fe vi was investigated only in the sew of plant b due to low levels in plant a table 2 bupine is an insecticide intensively used to control insect pests on vegetable crops hence it is found in various waters including surface and wet weather waters errami et al 2013 complete elimination of bupine by fe vi has been observed table s7 fe vi had high reactivity with trnt as well 91 7 degradation efficiency table s7 trnt is a widely used herbicide with high environmental persistence rebelo et al 2009 interestingly hydrogen peroxide could not oxidize trnt in water and the employment of a catalyst was required for its complete removal rebelo et al 2009 overall only 4 pharmaceuticals in both sew of plants a and b were almost completely removed by fe vi while fe vi did not react with 1 pharmaceutical in sew of plant a and 5 pharmaceuticals in sew of plant b table s7 although fe vi oxidized 6 and 5 pharmaceuticals in sew of plants a and b respectively the observed degradation efficiencies were low in the case of pesticides 1 pesticide in the sew of plant a was not removed efficiently while fe vi did not react with 3 pesticides in the sew of plant b table s7 the results of no reaction or low removal efficiency of some pharmaceuticals and pesticides by fe vi suggest that activation of fe vi is required to efficiently remove these recalcitrant micropollutants from sew 3 3 degradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and pesticides acid activated fe vi 3 3 1 pharmaceuticals because of the insufficient degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants in sew by fe vi additional set of experiments were conducted by activating fe vi using acid i e hcl two concentrations of fe vi were applied i e 5 mg l and 10 mg l as fe a molar ratio of hcl to fe vi of 1 5 was used for both fe vi concentrations the degradation efficiencies of the recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in both sew of plants a and b by acid activated fe vi were determined and compared with those achieved by fe vi without activation importantly the ph was similar with and without activation hence the observed enhancement of the degradation of micropollutants is due to activation of the oxidant table s2 the different water quality characteristics of sew of plant a and plant b enabled the evaluation of the applicability of acid activated fe vi for different water quality conditions table s1 in the sew of plant a the degradation efficiencies of azt and smx by 5 mg l of fe vi were 39 9 and 64 0 respectively hence higher concentration of the oxidant 10 mg l was required to remove these micropollutants 95 0 degradation efficiency without activation fig 1 a and b importantly acid activated fe vi could almost completely oxidized azt 96 1 degradation at a fe vi concentration of 5 mg l fig 1a the present study is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with azt a semi synthetic macrolide antibiotic used as antimicrobial agent for infectious diseases in both humans and animals tong et al 2011 enhanced oxidation of smx by acid activated fe vi 5 mg l was also observed 77 6 degradation efficiency fig 1a in the case of fe vi smx reaction second order rate constants were reported as 8 46 102 m 1 s 1 and 1 35 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 and ph 9 1 respectively at 25 c sharma et al 2006a 2006b different reaction pathways were proposed i e sn bond cleavage ring opening of isoxazole moiety oxidation of aromatic amine and the hydroxylation of the benzene ring kim et al 2015 resulting in most likely less toxic oxidized products of smx by fe vi sharma et al 2006a although fe vi could almost completely remove smx in the sew of plant a at 10 mg l of fe vi fig 1b it did not react with this micropollutant in sew of plant b fig 1c and d interestingly acid activated fe vi reacted with smx in the sew of plant b resulting in 31 5 smx degradation efficiency fig 1d fe vi did not react with azt at 5 mg l with or without activation in the sew of plant b at 10 mg l of fe vi the oxidation of azt in sew of plant b slightly increased from 92 3 to 100 0 when fe vi was activated fig 1d at 5 mg l of fe vi no elimination of smz was observed with or without activation in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of smz increased significantly from 45 9 nonactivated fe vi to 93 3 by acid activated fe vi at 10 mg fe vi l fig 1d the reaction of fe vi with smz has been studied and second order rate constants were reported as 8 69 102 m 1 s 1 and 1 47 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and ph 9 1 respectively at 25 c which are similar with the rate constants of the reaction of fe vi with smx sharma et al 2006a fe vi did not react with cla another macrolide antibiotic in the sew of plant a at 5 mg fe vi l with or without activation however almost complete elimination of cla 97 0 was achieved by both fe vi and acid activated fe vi when 10 mg l of oxidant were applied fig 1a and b this is the first report regarding the reactivity of fe vi with cla the elimination efficiency of cla in sew of plant b by fe vi was 25 0 and 30 0 at 5 mg l and 10 mg l of fe vi respectively with or without activation tbdz removal by fe vi was similar 20 0 at both fe vi concentrations i e 5 and 10 mg l applied in the sew of plant a the degradation of tbdz increased slightly from 20 0 to 30 0 by acid activated fe vi at 5 mg l but no further enhancement has been achieved at higher fe vi concentration fig 1a and b in the sew of plant b fe vi did not react with tbdz without activation at both fe vi concentrations a reaction of fe vi with tbdz in the sew of plant b was observed only at 10 mg l of fe vi upon activation but the elimination efficiency was low 13 5 fig 1d at a concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l the degradation of ntp and ath in the sew of plant a increased from 37 8 to 45 2 and from 22 2 to 63 0 respectively by acid activated fe vi compared to fe vi fig 1a higher concentration of fe vi of 10 mg l without activation resulted in 72 7 and 78 7 elimination efficiencies of ntp and ath respectively fig 1b significantly enhanced oxidation of both ntp and ath 90 0 degradation efficiency by acid activated fe vi was achieved fig 1b the oxidation of ntp and ath by fe vi has been investigated and it was proposed that the reaction was initiated by oxidation of the exocyclic double bond of the molecules chen et al 2016 the degradation efficiency of ntp and ath by fe vi 5 mg l and 10 mg l and acid activated fe vi 5 mg l in the sew of plant b was around 10 0 which is lower that what was observed in the sew of plant a fig 1 higher removals of both ntp and ath of 30 3 and 25 4 respectively have been achieved by acid activated fe vi at the highest concentration of fe vi fig 1d the degradation efficiency of another antidepressant stl by fe vi was 45 6 and 89 0 at fe vi concentration of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively in the sew of plant a importantly enhanced oxidation of stl by acid activated fe vi was achieved i e 59 2 and 100 0 degradation efficiencies at 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively fig 1a and b in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of stl increased slightly from 31 8 to 38 0 and from 42 9 to 49 4 by acid activated fe vi compared to fe vi at concentrations of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively fig 1c and d in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of warf by fe vi nonactivated decreased significantly to 42 0 and 73 5 at concentrations of fe vi of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively compared to plant a fig 1c and d table s7 importantly the complete removal of warf in the sew of plant b could only be achieved by acid activated fe vi fig 1d sal did not react with fe vi 5 mg l with or without activation however enhanced oxidation of sal by acid activated fe vi has been observed at 10 mg fe vi l i e 5 5 and 22 3 sal degradation efficiencies by fe vi and acid activated fe vi respectively fig 1d sal is an ionophore antibiotic widely used as a veterinary pharmaceutical sun et al 2013 limited information regarding its degradation in water by treatment processes is available 3 3 2 pesticides in the sew of plant a the degradation of tcpy increased significantly from 57 7 fe vi to 82 9 acid activated fe vi at the lowest concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l fig 2 a at 10 mg fe vi l almost complete degradation of tcpy by fe vi with or without activation has been observed fig 2b the tcpy compound found in both plant a and b is the main hydrolytic metabolite of the broad spectrum organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos žabar et al 2016 chlorpyrifos has been banned in the eu and has been linked to many health risks meeker et al 2006 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with tcpy fe vi did not react with imalil and tcpy in the sew of plant b fig 2a and b importantly acid activated fe vi could oxidize both imalil and tcpy i e degradation efficiencies of 88 2 and 60 9 respectively at a concentration of fe vi of 10 mg l fig 2b the degradation efficiency of azobin increased from 80 9 to 94 7 due to activation of the oxidant at 10 mg l of fe vi fig 2b figs 1 and 2 show that higher degradation efficiencies of recalcitrant micropollutants were achieved in sew of plant a than plant b this was expected due to the different water quality characteristics of the 2 sew used in the study table s1 recently it was shown that an initial loss of fe vi due to self decomposition and instant reactions of fe vi with components of natural organic matter was in direct proportion with doc of water deng et al 2018 as a result less amount of the oxidant is available to react with recalcitrant micropollutants significantly the increased oxidation capacity of fe vi upon activation by simple acid was more obvious in the sew of plant b than plant a moreover the enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi has been achieved at similar ph conditions to nonactivated fe vi i e initial ph of 8 0 and final ph of 8 5 and lower fe vi decay time than the one observed without activation i e 5 10 min vs 20 30 min for plant a and 3 min vs 10 15 min for plant b table s2 a possible reason for the enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi is the increased formation of highly reactive iron based intermediate species i e fe v and fe iv at a short time scale manoli et al 2017b the involvement of fe v and fe iv results in more electron equivalents being available per mole of fe vi during oxidative elimination of micropollutants in sew i e increased oxidative capacity of fe vi upon activation at a short time scale manoli et al 2017a the formation of fe v and fe iv most likely occur via the following reactions i direct reduction of fe vi upon activation through 1 electron 2 electron transfer steps yielding intermediate fe v fe iv and eventually fe iii fe ii as final products e g fe vi fe v fe iii and fe vi fe iv fe ii ii reduction of fe vi by organics inorganics present in sew iii fe vi and fe v self decompositions and iv reactions between iron based species i e fe vi fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and or oxygen related species e g h2o2 formed from self decompositions e g fe vi fe ii fe v fe iii fe vi fe iii fe v fe iv and fe ii fe iii o2 h2o2 fe iv fe v manoli et al 2017b sharma et al 2015 it is possible that all of the aforementioned reactions take place simultaneously during oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi it is known in literature that fe v and fe iv are much more reactive than fe vi sharma et al 2015 thus enhanced oxidative elimination of micropollutants in sew by acid activated fe vi was observed 3 4 characteristics of treated sew in the sew of plant a no removal of doc by fe vi without activation was seen table s8 the removal of uv400 absorbance of sew at 400 nm by fe vi was 6 3 and 12 5 for 5 mg l and 10 mg l of fe vi respectively the uv254 absorbance of sew at 254 nm decreased from 0 119 cm 1 untreated sew of plant a to 0 099 cm 1 16 1 removal and 0 094 cm 1 21 0 removal by fe vi at 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively table s8 acid activated fe vi could mineralize organic compounds in the sew of plant a but the removal of doc was low 5 0 significantly higher removal efficiencies of uv254 and uv400 were achieved by acid activated fe vi than fe vi i e up to 40 1 and 56 3 respectively table s8 the uv254 is an indicator of organic content in sew acid activated fe vi was more efficient in removing color of sew indicated by the uv400 removal efficiencies achieved no removal of doc by fe vi was observed for the sew of plant b the doc removal by acid activated fe vi in sew of plant b was even lower than that seen in the sew of plant a the uv254 decreased slightly from 0 226 cm 1 to 0 219 cm 1 by fe vi with or without activation at a concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l table s8 at 10 mg fe vi l the uv254 removal efficiencies of sew of plant b were lower than the ones achieved for sew of plant a i e 15 9 and 8 8 with and without activation respectively the same removal of uv400 by fe vi at both fe vi concentrations applied was observed which was the same with the removal observed by acid activated fe vi at 5 mg l the highest uv400 removal efficiency of 62 5 has been achieved by acid activated fe vi at 10 mg l table s8 4 conclusions in the sew of plant a 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides were detected at concentrations higher than the mql in sew of plant b 3 additional pharmaceuticals total of 14 and 2 pesticides total of 5 were detected enhanced oxidation of 6 pharmaceuticals i e tbdz azt smx ntp ath and stl and 1 pesticide i e tcpy in the sew of plant a and 7 pharmaceuticals i e tbdz smz smx ntp ath warf and sal and 3 pesticides i e imalil tcpy and azobin in the sew of plant b by acid activated fe vi has been demonstrated the enhancement in degradation efficiency ranged from 12 6 to 86 2 the increased oxidation capacity of fe vi upon activation was more obvious in the sew of plant b than plant a due to their different water quality characteristics results showed clearly the applicability of acid activated fe vi in real wastewaters to enhance the oxidation of micropollutants at mild alkaline

19200,the emergence of resistance to antibacterial drugs and pesticides in water is unprecedented this may have adverse consequences to human health and ecological systems this paper first sought the identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in two secondary effluent wastewaters sew of different quality characteristics followed by their removal by ferrate vi fe vi feo4 2 screening for 22 pharmaceuticals and 32 pesticides revealed that 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides in sew of plant a and 14 pharmaceuticals and 5 pesticides in sew of plant b were present at concentrations higher than the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method quantitation limit the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and pesticides ranged from 0 15 ng l 413 03 ng l investigation of

meet the needs of the modern society several million tons of pharmaceuticals and pesticides are used in consumer and industrial products and in fertilizers coors et al 2018 nsenga kumwimba et al 2018 these chemicals that potentially end up in surface waters include a wide range of pollutants such as emerging organic contaminants eocs e g endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products pesticides etc gago ferrero et al 2017 klatte et al 2017 most of the eocs persist in the environment and may accumulate in the food web e g drinking water with unknown short and long term effects on human health aquatic life and wildlife jepson and law 2016 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2017 ye et al 2017 the continuous release of pharmaceuticals and pesticides to the environment may have undesired harmful effects on ecological species and could pose major risk to human health through the long term consumption of contaminated water kalliora et al 2018 sophia and lima 2018 it is of utmost importance that these eocs are surveyed in effluent waters the present paper thus initially focuses on identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in secondary effluent

pharmaceuticals and pesticides in wastewater by high valent iron based green oxidant known as ferrate vi fe vi fevio4 2 in recent years fe vi has received great attention as a multipurpose water

despite the efficient elimination of most of the studied contaminants fe vi had low reactivity with some eocs sharma et al 2016 there has been an increasing interest in activating fe vi to enhance the

out in deionized water and none of the aforementioned activation methods have yet been applied to degrade multiple micropollutants in real wastewater the present study investigates for the first time the applicability of the acid activated fe vi oxidation process to degrade pharmaceuticals and pesticides under real wastewater treatment conditions the objectives of the present paper are to i identify and quantify pharmaceuticals and pesticides at their natural concentration ng l in secondary effluent wastewaters sew collected from two wastewater treatment plants plant a and plant b with varied solid and organic contents ii investigate the oxidation of the quantified contaminants by fe vi nonactivated and iii demonstrate the enhanced degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew by acid activated fe vi 2 materials and methods 2 1 degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides by fe vi and acid activated fe vi details related to the chemicals and sew used in the study are given in text s1 and table s1 the experiments were conducted in 1 l beaker the solutions were rapidly mixed using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 23 2 c the reactions were initiated by adding a certain amount of the solid fe vi in 550 ml of sew after the addition of fe vi the ph stabilized within 1 min was defined as the initial ph ph 1 then in the case of acid activated fe vi the desired amount of hcl was added dropwise within 30 s to the mixed solution and the lowest ph observed during the addition of hcl was noted ph 2 importantly the ph decrease due to addition of acid was only 0 1

detailed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew initially the untreated sew samples from plant a and plant b were screened for hundreds of compounds a recently developed method allowed confident detection based on accurate mass retention time and fragmentation patterns renaud et al 2017 in this study 29 detected compounds were analyzed using the prm method described in text s4 of the targeted analytes 3 pharmaceuticals and 22 pesticides were not detected above the method detection limit mdl in neither sew of plant a or plant b during method development multiple samples were analyzed to determine accurate recoveries for each compound and to take into consideration any instrument differences spe deviations etc 3 1 1 pharmaceuticals ractopamine rac spiramycin spa sulfamethazine smz cycloheximide hex miconazole mic salinomycin sal and monensin mon were only detected in the sew of plant b table 1 however the concentrations of rac spa hex mic and mon were below the method quantitation limit mql table 1 although gliclazide gli was detected in the sew of both plants its concentration was higher than the mql only in the sew of plant b tylosin tyl and diclofenac dfc were identified in both plant a and plant b sew at concentrations lower than the mql table 1 hence the degradation of these micropollutants i e concentrations below mql could not be investigated in the sew of plant a 11 pharmaceuticals i e albuterol abtr ranitidine rtnd lincomycin lin thiabendazole tbdz azithromycin azt sulfamethoxazole smx nortriptyline ntp amitriptyline ath clarithromycin cla sertraline stl and warfarin warf were found at concentrations ranging from 0 88 to 348 94 ng l table 1 warf and smx had the lowest and highest concentrations respectively the concentrations of rtnd and azt were at the same order of magnitude with smx table 1 abtr tbdz and ntp were detected at relatively low concentrations 10 00 ng l table 1 the concentrations of lin ath cla and stl in plant a sew ranged from 12 55 to 60 18 ng l in the sew of plant b 3 additional pharmaceuticals i e sulfamethazine smz gliclazide gli and salinomycin sal were detected at concentrations higher than the mql table 1 the concentrations of the 14 pharmaceuticals ranged from 1 04 to 413 03 ng l table 1 ntp and smx had the lowest and highest concentrations respectively rtnd was found at a concentration of the same order of magnitude with smx abtr smz stl gli warf and sal were detected at relatively low concentrations 10 00 ng l table 1 the concentrations of lin tbdz azt ath and cla in plant b sew ranged from 9 40 to 21 42 ng l the structures of the detected pharmaceuticals are given in table s5 the concentrations of pharmaceuticals found in the sew can lead to serious adverse effects from acute and chronic exposure for example it is vital to remove antibiotics such as smx and azt present in the sew as it has been shown their presence in the environment can lead to bacteria adaption and the development of resistance daughton and ternes 1999 3 1 2 pesticides ten pesticides i e cyromazine cyrine schradan schdan atraton trnt thiacloprid tcp imazalil imalil 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol tcpy cyprodinil cypnil azoxystrobin azobin buprofezin bupine and trifloxystrobin trifbin were detected in at least one of the sew samples used in the study table 2 cyrine schdan tcp bupine and trifbin were only detected in sew of plant b however the concentrations of cyrine schdan tcp and trifbin were below the mql hence quantitation of these micropollutants was not possible table 2 trnt was detected in both sew but its concentration was higher than mql only in plant b 0 21 ng l this is consistent with our observations in the case of pharmaceuticals where more compounds were detected in sew of plant b than of plant a tables 1 and 2 cypnil was detected in both sew at a lower concentration than mql the concentrations of imalil and azobin in the 2 sew were similar table 2 tcpy was found at higher concentration in sew of plant b 5 31 ng l than plant a 2 19 ng l the structures of the detected pesticides are given in table s6 many pesticides have been linked directly to adverse effects when administered to non targeted species from acute and chronic exposure for example a recent study found the chronic exposure of azobin affected biomass and reproduction in aquatic invertebrates kunz et al 2017 there has been evidence that there can be synergistic effects when multiple pesticides are combined qin et al 2018 it is important to limit the presence of these pesticides in sew to prevent dangers to both human and non targeted insect plant and animal health 3 2 degradation of pharmaceuticals and pesticides fe vi in the initial set of experiments the degradation of quantified pharmaceuticals and pesticides in sew of plant a and plant b by fe vi nonactivated has been investigated the applied concentration of fe vi was 5 mg l as fe and the degradation efficiencies were determined complete removal 95 0 of abtr rtnd lin and warf in sew of plant a by fe vi was achieved table s7 no information related to the oxidation of the aforementioned micropollutants by fe vi is available in the literature abtr also known as salbutamol is a β agonist widely used for the treatment of respiratory diseases e g bronchial asthma zhou et al 2017 its oxidation by permanganate was initiated by an attack of the oxidant to the aromatic ring of abtr rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 the chlorination of abtr resulted in the formation of chlorinated intermediates via electrophilic aromatic substitution quintana et al 2012 the high reactivity of fe vi with abtr observed in the present study may be explained by the electron rich phenolic moiety of abtr table s5 this is in agreement with previously reported studies which showed that fe vi reacts preferentially with electron rich organic moieties including phenols lee et al 2009 rtnd is a histamine h2 receptor antagonist used as gastrointestinal drug latch et al 2003 lin belongs to the family of lincosamide antibiotics and is used worldwide in human and veterinary medicine to inhibit the gram positive bacteria growth bautitz and nogueira 2010 wang et al 2018 the ozonation of lin may likely initiated by an attack of the chemical oxidant at the sulfur atom of lin andreozzi et al 2006 significantly fe vi has shown high reactivity with organosulfur compounds sharma et al 2011 high removal efficiencies of abtr rtnd and lin of 96 6 99 7 and 89 9 by 5 mg fe vi l were observed in the sew of plant b as well table s7 however the degradation efficiency of warf by fe vi was much lower in sew of plant b 42 0 than the 95 7 observed for plant a table s7 complete degradation of gli in the sew of plant b by fe vi was also observed gli is a second generation sulfonylurea used as an antidiabetic drug to stimulate the secretion of insulin radi et al 1999 the oxidation of gli has been investigated only in sew of plant b due to its low concentration i e mql in the sew of plant a table 1 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with gli abtr rtnd lin and warf tbdz azt smx ntp ath and stl in the sew of plant a could not be removed efficiently by fe vi 65 0 degradation efficiency while no reaction of fe vi with cla was seen table s7 in the sew of plant b low elimination efficiencies of ntp ath cla and stl by fe vi were observed 35 0 interestingly fe vi did not react with tbdz azt smz and smx in the sew of plant b table s7 the oxidation of the three pesticides detected in the sew of plant a at concentrations higher than the mql by fe vi was investigated table 2 high degradation efficiencies of imalil and azobin by fe vi were achieved i e 98 0 table s7 limited information related to the oxidation of pesticides by fe vi in aqueous solution has been reported so far sun et al 2018 imalil also known as enilconazole is a pesticide used as a broad spectrum systemic imidazole fungicide in agriculture applications e g fruits and vegetables genena et al 2011 a study on the ozonation proposed an initial attack of the oxidant at the highest electron density exocyclic aliphatic carbon double bond moiety of the pesticide genena et al 2011 azobin is the largest selling fungicide globally with high toxicity to aquatic organisms hence its removal from water is important tabakoglu and karaca 2015 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with imalil and azobin the degradation of tcpy in the sew of plant a by fe vi was not high 60 0 fe vi did not react with these pesticides i e imalil azobin and tcpy in the sew of plant b table s7 due to a higher degree of complexity in the matrix table s1 the oxidation of bupine and trnt by fe vi was investigated only in the sew of plant b due to low levels in plant a table 2 bupine is an insecticide intensively used to control insect pests on vegetable crops hence it is found in various waters including surface and wet weather waters errami et al 2013 complete elimination of bupine by fe vi has been observed table s7 fe vi had high reactivity with trnt as well 91 7 degradation efficiency table s7 trnt is a widely used herbicide with high environmental persistence rebelo et al 2009 interestingly hydrogen peroxide could not oxidize trnt in water and the employment of a catalyst was required for its complete removal rebelo et al 2009 overall only 4 pharmaceuticals in both sew of plants a and b were almost completely removed by fe vi while fe vi did not react with 1 pharmaceutical in sew of plant a and 5 pharmaceuticals in sew of plant b table s7 although fe vi oxidized 6 and 5 pharmaceuticals in sew of plants a and b respectively the observed degradation efficiencies were low in the case of pesticides 1 pesticide in the sew of plant a was not removed efficiently while fe vi did not react with 3 pesticides in the sew of plant b table s7 the results of no reaction or low removal efficiency of some pharmaceuticals and pesticides by fe vi suggest that activation of fe vi is required to efficiently remove these recalcitrant micropollutants from sew 3 3 degradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and pesticides acid activated fe vi 3 3 1 pharmaceuticals because of the insufficient degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants in sew by fe vi additional set of experiments were conducted by activating fe vi using acid i e hcl two concentrations of fe vi were applied i e 5 mg l and 10 mg l as fe a molar ratio of hcl to fe vi of 1 5 was used for both fe vi concentrations the degradation efficiencies of the recalcitrant pharmaceuticals in both sew of plants a and b by acid activated fe vi were determined and compared with those achieved by fe vi without activation importantly the ph was similar with and without activation hence the observed enhancement of the degradation of micropollutants is due to activation of the oxidant table s2 the different water quality characteristics of sew of plant a and plant b enabled the evaluation of the applicability of acid activated fe vi for different water quality conditions table s1 in the sew of plant a the degradation efficiencies of azt and smx by 5 mg l of fe vi were 39 9 and 64 0 respectively hence higher concentration of the oxidant 10 mg l was required to remove these micropollutants 95 0 degradation efficiency without activation fig 1 a and b importantly acid activated fe vi could almost completely oxidized azt 96 1 degradation at a fe vi concentration of 5 mg l fig 1a the present study is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with azt a semi synthetic macrolide antibiotic used as antimicrobial agent for infectious diseases in both humans and animals tong et al 2011 enhanced oxidation of smx by acid activated fe vi 5 mg l was also observed 77 6 degradation efficiency fig 1a in the case of fe vi smx reaction second order rate constants were reported as 8 46 102 m 1 s 1 and 1 35 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 and ph 9 1 respectively at 25 c sharma et al 2006a 2006b different reaction pathways were proposed i e sn bond cleavage ring opening of isoxazole moiety oxidation of aromatic amine and the hydroxylation of the benzene ring kim et al 2015 resulting in most likely less toxic oxidized products of smx by fe vi sharma et al 2006a although fe vi could almost completely remove smx in the sew of plant a at 10 mg l of fe vi fig 1b it did not react with this micropollutant in sew of plant b fig 1c and d interestingly acid activated fe vi reacted with smx in the sew of plant b resulting in 31 5 smx degradation efficiency fig 1d fe vi did not react with azt at 5 mg l with or without activation in the sew of plant b at 10 mg l of fe vi the oxidation of azt in sew of plant b slightly increased from 92 3 to 100 0 when fe vi was activated fig 1d at 5 mg l of fe vi no elimination of smz was observed with or without activation in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of smz increased significantly from 45 9 nonactivated fe vi to 93 3 by acid activated fe vi at 10 mg fe vi l fig 1d the reaction of fe vi with smz has been studied and second order rate constants were reported as 8 69 102 m 1 s 1 and 1 47 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and ph 9 1 respectively at 25 c which are similar with the rate constants of the reaction of fe vi with smx sharma et al 2006a fe vi did not react with cla another macrolide antibiotic in the sew of plant a at 5 mg fe vi l with or without activation however almost complete elimination of cla 97 0 was achieved by both fe vi and acid activated fe vi when 10 mg l of oxidant were applied fig 1a and b this is the first report regarding the reactivity of fe vi with cla the elimination efficiency of cla in sew of plant b by fe vi was 25 0 and 30 0 at 5 mg l and 10 mg l of fe vi respectively with or without activation tbdz removal by fe vi was similar 20 0 at both fe vi concentrations i e 5 and 10 mg l applied in the sew of plant a the degradation of tbdz increased slightly from 20 0 to 30 0 by acid activated fe vi at 5 mg l but no further enhancement has been achieved at higher fe vi concentration fig 1a and b in the sew of plant b fe vi did not react with tbdz without activation at both fe vi concentrations a reaction of fe vi with tbdz in the sew of plant b was observed only at 10 mg l of fe vi upon activation but the elimination efficiency was low 13 5 fig 1d at a concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l the degradation of ntp and ath in the sew of plant a increased from 37 8 to 45 2 and from 22 2 to 63 0 respectively by acid activated fe vi compared to fe vi fig 1a higher concentration of fe vi of 10 mg l without activation resulted in 72 7 and 78 7 elimination efficiencies of ntp and ath respectively fig 1b significantly enhanced oxidation of both ntp and ath 90 0 degradation efficiency by acid activated fe vi was achieved fig 1b the oxidation of ntp and ath by fe vi has been investigated and it was proposed that the reaction was initiated by oxidation of the exocyclic double bond of the molecules chen et al 2016 the degradation efficiency of ntp and ath by fe vi 5 mg l and 10 mg l and acid activated fe vi 5 mg l in the sew of plant b was around 10 0 which is lower that what was observed in the sew of plant a fig 1 higher removals of both ntp and ath of 30 3 and 25 4 respectively have been achieved by acid activated fe vi at the highest concentration of fe vi fig 1d the degradation efficiency of another antidepressant stl by fe vi was 45 6 and 89 0 at fe vi concentration of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively in the sew of plant a importantly enhanced oxidation of stl by acid activated fe vi was achieved i e 59 2 and 100 0 degradation efficiencies at 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively fig 1a and b in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of stl increased slightly from 31 8 to 38 0 and from 42 9 to 49 4 by acid activated fe vi compared to fe vi at concentrations of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively fig 1c and d in the sew of plant b the degradation efficiency of warf by fe vi nonactivated decreased significantly to 42 0 and 73 5 at concentrations of fe vi of 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively compared to plant a fig 1c and d table s7 importantly the complete removal of warf in the sew of plant b could only be achieved by acid activated fe vi fig 1d sal did not react with fe vi 5 mg l with or without activation however enhanced oxidation of sal by acid activated fe vi has been observed at 10 mg fe vi l i e 5 5 and 22 3 sal degradation efficiencies by fe vi and acid activated fe vi respectively fig 1d sal is an ionophore antibiotic widely used as a veterinary pharmaceutical sun et al 2013 limited information regarding its degradation in water by treatment processes is available 3 3 2 pesticides in the sew of plant a the degradation of tcpy increased significantly from 57 7 fe vi to 82 9 acid activated fe vi at the lowest concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l fig 2 a at 10 mg fe vi l almost complete degradation of tcpy by fe vi with or without activation has been observed fig 2b the tcpy compound found in both plant a and b is the main hydrolytic metabolite of the broad spectrum organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos žabar et al 2016 chlorpyrifos has been banned in the eu and has been linked to many health risks meeker et al 2006 significantly this is the first report on the reactivity of fe vi with tcpy fe vi did not react with imalil and tcpy in the sew of plant b fig 2a and b importantly acid activated fe vi could oxidize both imalil and tcpy i e degradation efficiencies of 88 2 and 60 9 respectively at a concentration of fe vi of 10 mg l fig 2b the degradation efficiency of azobin increased from 80 9 to 94 7 due to activation of the oxidant at 10 mg l of fe vi fig 2b figs 1 and 2 show that higher degradation efficiencies of recalcitrant micropollutants were achieved in sew of plant a than plant b this was expected due to the different water quality characteristics of the 2 sew used in the study table s1 recently it was shown that an initial loss of fe vi due to self decomposition and instant reactions of fe vi with components of natural organic matter was in direct proportion with doc of water deng et al 2018 as a result less amount of the oxidant is available to react with recalcitrant micropollutants significantly the increased oxidation capacity of fe vi upon activation by simple acid was more obvious in the sew of plant b than plant a moreover the enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi has been achieved at similar ph conditions to nonactivated fe vi i e initial ph of 8 0 and final ph of 8 5 and lower fe vi decay time than the one observed without activation i e 5 10 min vs 20 30 min for plant a and 3 min vs 10 15 min for plant b table s2 a possible reason for the enhanced oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi is the increased formation of highly reactive iron based intermediate species i e fe v and fe iv at a short time scale manoli et al 2017b the involvement of fe v and fe iv results in more electron equivalents being available per mole of fe vi during oxidative elimination of micropollutants in sew i e increased oxidative capacity of fe vi upon activation at a short time scale manoli et al 2017a the formation of fe v and fe iv most likely occur via the following reactions i direct reduction of fe vi upon activation through 1 electron 2 electron transfer steps yielding intermediate fe v fe iv and eventually fe iii fe ii as final products e g fe vi fe v fe iii and fe vi fe iv fe ii ii reduction of fe vi by organics inorganics present in sew iii fe vi and fe v self decompositions and iv reactions between iron based species i e fe vi fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and or oxygen related species e g h2o2 formed from self decompositions e g fe vi fe ii fe v fe iii fe vi fe iii fe v fe iv and fe ii fe iii o2 h2o2 fe iv fe v manoli et al 2017b sharma et al 2015 it is possible that all of the aforementioned reactions take place simultaneously during oxidation of micropollutants by acid activated fe vi it is known in literature that fe v and fe iv are much more reactive than fe vi sharma et al 2015 thus enhanced oxidative elimination of micropollutants in sew by acid activated fe vi was observed 3 4 characteristics of treated sew in the sew of plant a no removal of doc by fe vi without activation was seen table s8 the removal of uv400 absorbance of sew at 400 nm by fe vi was 6 3 and 12 5 for 5 mg l and 10 mg l of fe vi respectively the uv254 absorbance of sew at 254 nm decreased from 0 119 cm 1 untreated sew of plant a to 0 099 cm 1 16 1 removal and 0 094 cm 1 21 0 removal by fe vi at 5 mg l and 10 mg l respectively table s8 acid activated fe vi could mineralize organic compounds in the sew of plant a but the removal of doc was low 5 0 significantly higher removal efficiencies of uv254 and uv400 were achieved by acid activated fe vi than fe vi i e up to 40 1 and 56 3 respectively table s8 the uv254 is an indicator of organic content in sew acid activated fe vi was more efficient in removing color of sew indicated by the uv400 removal efficiencies achieved no removal of doc by fe vi was observed for the sew of plant b the doc removal by acid activated fe vi in sew of plant b was even lower than that seen in the sew of plant a the uv254 decreased slightly from 0 226 cm 1 to 0 219 cm 1 by fe vi with or without activation at a concentration of fe vi of 5 mg l table s8 at 10 mg fe vi l the uv254 removal efficiencies of sew of plant b were lower than the ones achieved for sew of plant a i e 15 9 and 8 8 with and without activation respectively the same removal of uv400 by fe vi at both fe vi concentrations applied was observed which was the same with the removal observed by acid activated fe vi at 5 mg l the highest uv400 removal efficiency of 62 5 has been achieved by acid activated fe vi at 10 mg l table s8 4 conclusions in the sew of plant a 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides were detected at concentrations higher than the mql in sew of plant b 3 additional pharmaceuticals total of 14 and 2 pesticides total of 5 were detected enhanced oxidation of 6 pharmaceuticals i e tbdz azt smx ntp ath and stl and 1 pesticide i e tcpy in the sew of plant a and 7 pharmaceuticals i e tbdz smz smx ntp ath warf and sal and 3 pesticides i e imalil tcpy and azobin in the sew of plant b by acid activated fe vi has been demonstrated the enhancement in degradation efficiency ranged from 12 6 to 86 2 the increased oxidation capacity of fe vi upon activation was more obvious in the sew of plant b than plant a due to their different water quality characteristics results showed clearly the applicability of acid activated fe vi in real wastewaters to enhance the oxidation of micropollutants at mild alkaline

19201,glycerol is presently being generated in surplus with the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry and seeks ways to be upcycled rather than to be treated with costs glycerol for the co production of 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo and caproate has a great prospect yet its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of caproate productivity which requires the presence of ethanol as a co substrate and necessitates the co existence of functional microbes for glycerol fermentation and chain elongation this study successfully achieved 6 38 mm c 1 3 pdo d 1 and 2 95 mm c caproate d 1 in a 2 l mixed cultured semi continuous fermenter with a glycerol ethanol acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4 3 1 such conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of eubacterium limosum clostridium kluyveri and massilibacterium senegalense with such a synergistic microbiome the co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was achieved from glycerol without ethanol addition based on metagenomics e limosum is capable of converting glycerol to 1 3 pdo ethanol and h2 and also redirecting the electron potential of h2 into acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway which is then used for chain elongation c kluyveri worked synergistically with e limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production m senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate facilitating the generation of these intermediates for c kluyveri elongation to caproate during the transition between fermentation and elongation an unexpected observation of poly β hydroxybutyrate phb formation

introduction the rapidly growing biodiesel industry generates glycerol as a major waste product it would be beneficial to upcycle it rather than to treat with costs based on anaerobic microbiology glycerol can be theoretically converted into two commercially valuable compounds 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo and caproate some microbial fermenters in the genera klebsiella clostridium and citrobacter can convert glycerol to 1 3 pdo fatty acids i e acetate and butyrate and ethanol barbirato et al 1998 biebl 2001 boenigk et al 1993 jarvis et al 1997 menzel et al 1997 other fermentative bacteria could oxidize ethanol and drive fatty acids condensation into caproate agler et al 2012 seedorf et al 2008 steinbusch et al 2011 previously we have demonstrated that the two processes can be coupled but caproate production was much lower than anticipated leng et al 2017 dams and collaborators improved caproate production through bioaugmentation with clostidium acetobutylicum atcc 824 which directly increased butyrate formation from glycerol for biosynthesis of caproate via chain elongation dams et al 2018 it indicated that a combination of metabolic pathways in multiple species of microorganisms acting in synergism can achieve an efficient co production our next step is to uncover the biological relationship between 1 3 pdo and caproate production and to enrich a microbial community capable of optimizing the two processes in one rector our previous study using batch experiments did not produce enough ethanol to support desirable caproate production leng et al 2017 efficient caproate production requires the balance between i production of 1 3 pdo and ethanol from glycerol fermentation and ii the glycerol degraders and ethanol oxidizing caproate producers based on fermentation balance stoichiometry of reverse β oxidation angenent et al 2016 spirito et al 2014 and an assumption that glycerol derived ethanol and acetate are completely converted into caproate 58 3 of glycerol can be funneled into 1 3 pdo 0 583 mol c 1 3 pdo per mol c glycerol while 27 8 of glycerol can be channeled towards ethanol and acetate production ultimately yielding a maximum of 0 278 mol c caproate formation per mol c glycerol although the highest proportion of glycerol that can be funneled into caproate via ethanol is 33 3 resulting in 0 417 mol c caproate formation per mol c glycerol and 0 500 mol c 1 3 pdo per mol c glycerol the caproate production requires acetate exogenously supplied details of the theoretical scenarios are shown in supplementary information experimental validation of aforementioned scenarios is a milestone beyond our previous study but the challenge lies in the enrichment of a microbial community with the co dominance of 1 3 pdo ethanol and caproate producers for example ethanol and 1 3 pdo both of which are products of glycerol fermentation may have opposing effects on caproate producers ethanol is an effective electron donor of clostridium kluyveri for caproate production seedorf et al 2008 while 1 3 pdo suppresses the chain elongation activity of clostridium spp szymanowska powaowska and kubiak 2015 in this study we design a bioreactor to enrich for glycerol degraders with higher ethanol producing capacities and caproate producers with ethanol consuming capacities which is capable of decreasing the byproducts created during the glycerol fermentation to 1 3 pdo reducing the amount of energy required for chemical recovery and producing an additional value added chemical caproate which can be used by various industries ethanol producers are usually tolerant of high ethanol concentrations so we transit the operation of a reactor with glycerol as feed to a mixed feed of glycerol and ethanol and gradually decrease the glycerol loading we hypothesize that the conditions would 1 improve the ethanol producing capacities of glycerol degraders 2 reduce the suppression pressure of 1 3 pdo on caproate producers and 3 ultimately select for a microbial community capable of coupling glycerol disproportionation to ethanol and 1 3 pdo and ethanol oxidation to caproate the details of how 1 3 pdo and caproate are co produced from glycerol without ethanol addition and how the microorganisms accomplish this metabolic fate were explored through analyzing the electron flow of fermentation metabolic pathways of key microbes and the interactions of microbial community the microbial community analyses and metagenomics were employed to elucidate the microbiology underpinning the new bioprocess the findings on a successful increment in caproate production while maintaining 1 3 pdo generation can be applied to the recovery of two value added chemicals from crude glycerol or glycerol containing wastewater creating a new revenue for

continuous reactor the microbial community was first enriched in a semi continuous fermenter in three stages stage 1 3 with a gradual increase of glycerol and a constant amount of acetate in the influent fig 1 a at stage 3 a stable yield of 1 3 pdo 13 90 mm c d 1 butyrate 5 48 mm c d 1 and acetate net 4 06 mm c d 1 with a glycerol feed of 45 mm c d 1 fig 1b was achieved the conversion rates of 1 3 pdo and butyrate were 0 31 mol mol glycerol and 0 10 mol mol glycerol respectively and approximately 60 of glycerol was catabolized into 1 3 pdo butyrate and acetate the 16s rrna gene targeting microbial community analysis showed that eubacterium limosum 100 identity based on blastn proteiniphilum acetatigenes 100 actinomyces sp md1 100 and anaerostipes caccae 100 were observed as the major microbial constituents in stage 1 3 fig 1c metagenomic approach was applied to confirm the metabolic capacity of recovered draft genome bins i e confirming whether the genes for particular metabolic function are completed in a bin it does not disclose the genes are expressed or the corresponding pathway works in situ based on the metabolic capacities found in the recovered bins e limosum s3 bin001 is capable of converting glycerol to acetate oxidatively via glda dhal k and 1 3 pdo via pduc d e dhat reductively lin 1976 while a caccae s3 bin003 encodes for glycerol oxidation to butyrate via glda dhal k cat2 3 fig 4 louis and flint 2009 the annotated genes and pathways of recovered genome bins associated with the proteiniphilum s3 bin013 and actinomyces s3 bin002 are also demonstrated in fig 4 and described with details in supplementary information surprisingly the commonly known 1 3 pdo producing bacteria clostridium butyricum and klebsiella pneumoniae constituted an insignificant proportion of the microbial community at stage 3 instead c butyricum dominated at stage 1 with a high relative abundance of 34 06 38 64 when the influent glycerol was significantly higher 102 mm c d 1 fig 1a and c nevertheless such a high glycerol load could not be completely consumed instead k pneumoniae was prevalent in the first half of stage 2 at a high relative abundance of 12 68 17 86 consistently resulting in a high 1 3 pdo yield of 14 97 mm c d 1 from 30 mm c d 1 of glycerol however the fermentation became inefficient in the second half of stage 2 accumulating a large amount of glycerol due to the fluctuations in the fermenter operation in general a stable microbial community effectively facilitating glycerol dissimilation to 1 3 pdo butyrate and acetate was enriched in these three stages however caproate was at undetectable levels between stage 1 and 3 fig 1b indicating the absence of chain elongation activity this observation also coincided with the absence of ethanol in these 3 stages fig 1b caproate production could have been suppressed either due to the antagonistic effect of 1 3 pdo the absence of electron donor ethanol or a combination of both factors questions remain as to how the fermenter microbiota could be manipulated to achieve a concurrent chain elongation of acetate and butyrate to caproate and how the microorganisms interact to accomplish such metabolisms while 1 3 pdo remains in high yield 3 2 effect of substrates on caproate and 1 3 pdo formation in order to estimate the effects of ethanol on 1 3 pdo production and glycerol on caproate formation batch tests employing ad sludge samples under three different combinations of substrate were performed glycerol and acetate case 1 glycerol ethanol and acetate case 2 and ethanol and acetate case 3 the substrate loading and stoichiometric molar ratios were selected based on the optimized parameters from our previous study leng et al 2017 using glycerol and acetate in the feed butyrate production was lower but 1 3 pdo yield was higher in case 1 the batch tests fig 2 a compared to stage 3 the semi continuous fermenter fig 1b in case 1 glycerol was completely consumed within 3 days resulting in a high conversion of 1 3 pdo 0 54 mol c mol c glycerol and an insignificant formation of acetate butyrate and ethanol after glycerol depletion ethanol was immediately consumed with a small yield of butyrate 0 08 mol c mol c glycerol and caproate 0 03 mol c mol c glycerol in the following days two h2 formation peaks were accompanied with glycerol dissimilation as well as butyrate and 1 3 pdo degradation an organism associated with k pneumoniae 100 predominated on day 2 which was possibly related to a high 1 3 pdo production from glycerol fig 3 on day 6 two organisms uncultured desulfovibrio sp 100 and megasphaera elsdenii 100 increased slightly m elsdenii was feasibly associated with butyrate and low levels of caproate production marounek et al 1989 chain elongation for caproate production was achieved in case 2 fig 2b illustrates two phase fermentation in case 2 in the first phase within the first 3 days glycerol consumption occurred rapidly resulting in the release of a large amount of 1 3 pdo 0 60 mol c mol c glycerol and low amounts of acetate butyrate and ethanol achieving successful glycerol fermentation in the second phase from day 4 to day 12 ethanol and acetate were converted to butyrate 0 45 0 56 mol c mol c ethanol and caproate 0 50 mol c mol c ethanol implying successful chain elongation using glycerol formation byproducts and ethanol the h2 formation increased with continued glycerol fermentation and remained levelled until ethanol declined to a low concentration correspondingly the microbial community structure on day 2 mainly consisted of k pneumoniae 100 and escherichia coli 100 fig 3 in this case k pneumoniae likely facilitated 1 3 pdo production from glycerol the slight ethanol production was probably caused by e coli murarka et al 2008 on day 8 the second phase m elsdenii 100 increased considerably and meanwhile c kluyveri also showed a small increase during the butyrate and caproate formation however the chain elongation process came to a halt after day 12 resulting in residual ethanol and acetate microbial community on day 30 showed that the abundance of m elsdenii significantly declined which was consistent with the cessation of ethanol consumption and caproate formation this is reflective of the findings of miyazaki et al 1991 that ethanol exhibits inhibitory effect on the growth of m elsdenii under weakly acidic neutral conditions ph 6 0 to 6 8 nevertheless a co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was successfully achieved with glycerol ethanol and acetate and the ethanol addition did not repress 1 3 pdo production the results of case 2 suggest that ethanol addition enables efficient glycerol fermentation and chain elongation integration as expected in case 3 figs 2c 1 3 pdo was not generated owing to the absence of glycerol in the medium but caproate was effectively produced from ethanol elongation was initiated on day 3 and reached the peak conversion rates of 0 13 mol c butyrate mol c ethanol and 0 71 mol c caproate mol c ethanol respectively on day 12 in comparison with case 2 the chain elongation occurred more promptly and a complete utilization of ethanol and acetate was achieved at similar influent ethanol and acetate levels the higher caproate production over butyrate in case 3 than that in case 2 coincided with a higher h2 formation indicating a higher reducing potential i e more electrons donated in the system notably c kluyveri predominated on day 6 as a major caproate producer fig 3 the comparison between case 2 and case 3 on caproate production is reflective of an antagonistic effect of glycerol on chain elongation a substantial difference responsible for elongation observed is the dominance of m elsdenii and c kluyveri in case 2 and 3 respectively the reason why m elsdenii was selectively enriched in the presence of glycerol is crucial in coupling caproate production with glycerol fermentation m elsdenii cannot metabolize glycerol marounek et al 1989 and hence its proliferation is not directly stimulated by glycerol on day 3 in case 2 and day 0 in case 3 the ethanol and acetate levels were very similar suggesting it was not substrate availability the only apparent difference was the generation of 1 3 pdo from glycerol degradation between day 1 3 in case 2 collectively these observations suggest that 1 3 pdo toxicity may be a major factor driving the selection of the chain elongating organism the highest concentration of 1 3 pdo in case 2 the batch tests and stage 3 the semi continuous fermenter was close to and above 10 g l respectively which was at a level inhibitory for clostridium spp 10 15 g l 1 3 pdo szymanowska powaowska and kubiak 2015 it also supports the notion that the inhibitory effect of 1 3 pdo created a selective pressure against c kluyveri while favoring the enrichment of m elsdenii this suggests that an optimal glycerol acetate ratio is needed to control 1 3 pdo at a non inhibitory level for the growth of 1 3 pdo sensitve chain elongation bacteria such as c kluyveri an alternative solution would be the production of less 1 3 pdo from glycerol while converting more glycerol to ethanol and generating more h2 to consume excess reducing power for maximizing the use of glycerol derived energy this approach is also beneficial as it could potentially eliminate the need for external ethanol dosing eventually 3 3 fermenter microbiome enrichment and physiological performance with an ethanol addition on the basis of the batch test findings ethanol addition with a gradual decrease of influent glycerol loading was applied for the operation of semi continuous fermenter stage 4 6 fig 1a so as to enrich ethanol tolerant producing glycerol degraders and ethanol consuming caproate producer at the beginning of the ethanol enrichment process stages 4 and 5 incomplete ethanol consumption was observed along with a negligible caproate production but an increased in butyrate production fig 1b during these two stages a marked increase in the abundance of clostridium intestinale 100 fig 1c was observed c intestinale is a concurrent butyrate and h2 producer that grows on saccharides and glycerol but not ethanol gossner et al 2006 kalia 2016 moscoviz et al 2016 viana et al 2014 in stage 6 at a glycerol ethanol acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4 3 1 an optimized co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was finally achieved with complete ethanol utilization albeit a lower 1 3 pdo production resulted from the reduced glycerol loading fig 1b the fermentation achieved the optimized function of 1 3 pdo and caproate co production the complete assimilation of glycerol 20 mm c d 1 and ethanol 10 mm c d 1 resulted in 6 38 and 2 95 mm c d 1 of 1 3 pdo and caproate respectively table 1 the increased caproate production did not reduce the conversion rate of 1 3 pdo instead 1 3 pdo conversion rate increased from an average of 0 26 mol mol glycerol in stage 3 to an average of 0 32 mol mol glycerol in stage 6 the most abundant organisms detected in stage 6 were e limosum and c kluyveri as well as massilibacterium senegalense formerly known as bacillaceae bacterium mt8 fig 1c based on the recovered genome bins from metagenomics sequencing fig 4 e limosum s6 bin003 is capable of converting glycerol via glda dhal k to 1 3 pdo via pduc d e dhat ethanol via adhe and adh2 and h2 it is also able to oxidize h2 to acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway which redirects the energy of h2 back into chain elongation the gene annotation results of genome bin s6 bin012 were consistent with the well known pathway of c kluyveri utilizing ethanol and acetate for butyrate and caproate generation via cat2 m senegalense s6 bin004 encodes for ethanol oxidation via adh2 yiay and aldh to acetate via pta and acka and butyrate via atod likely capable of facilitating carboxylate chain elongation of c kluyveri notably in contrast to case 2 of the batch tests the enrichment of microorganisms in the semi continuous fermenter in stage 6 i e e limosum c kluyveri and m senegalense selectively excluded facultative pathogens such as e coli and k pneumoniae and successfully accomplished the 1 3 pdo and caproate co production with an integration of glycerol fermentation and chain elongation these findings indicate that the successful co production process was mainly facilitated with 1 the enrichment of e limosum 2 the predominance of c kluyveri allowed by a concomitant enrichment of e limosum and a gradual decrease of glycerol loading 3 efficient chain elongation accomplished by c kluyveri ethanol consuming caproate producer with the stimulation of m senegalense nonetheless whether the enriched versatile glycerol degrader e limosum could further convert glycerol derived energy to ethanol and h2 in a balance with 1 3 pdo and acetate and redirect the energy of h2 back into chain elongation needs further evidence an investigation on electron flux of glycerol fermentation and chain elongation with ethanol self sufficiency inoculated by the now enriched microbial community could help answer the question 3 4 co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate from glycerol with enriched microbial community to answer the above questions an additional batch test inoculated with the enriched culture from stage 6 and fed with glycerol and acetate was conducted case 4 the physiological performance and microbial communities are shown in figs 2d and 3 respectively compared with a similar case of our previous study leng et al 2017 the caproate production rate was improved from 0 006 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 21 mol c per mol c glycerol although 1 3 pdo production rate decreased from 0 36 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 19 mol c per mol c glycerol this is one milestone for the co production because in our previous study glycerol fermentation could only either produced 1 3 pdo or caproate as a major product four phases p1p4 of metabolism and their corresponding electron flux are shown in table 2 in p1 days 0 4 more ethanol reaction no 2 as shown in table 2 hereafter abbreviated as r2 and h2 r6 and less 1 3 pdo r1 were produced with glycerol consumption compared to case 1 fed with the same substrates since a low consumption of acetate and delayed butyrate production also occurred it is postulated that some acetate was converted to butyrate reductively and the butyrate was temporarily stored in the cells and released slowly into the solution r9 the predominated e limosum s6 bin003 in this phase probably converts glycerol to ethanol acetate and butyrate oxidatively and to 1 3 pdo and h2 reductively following a transition phase p2 days 4 12 the produced ethanol and the acetate in the system were used for caproate and butyrate formation and the chain elongation metabolism ceased when ethanol was depleted in p3 days 12 15 its corresponding reactions included r5 r6 r9 and r10 table 2 c kluyveri became abundant during this phase and performed chain elongation to butyrate and caproate facilitated by medium chain specific coa transferase cat2 m senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate likely facilitating carboxylate chain elongation of c kluyveri in p4 days 15 23 a second h2 decrease correlated to a slight increase of acetate r7 and r8 in short this glycerol and acetate fed batch test showed that higher ethanol production from glycerol dissimilation could be achieved and further used as an intermediate metabolite to stimulate chain elongation for caproate production importantly this test also demonstrated that the collective metabolisms of e limosum c kluyveri and m senegalense enabled interspecies metabolic interactions to support glycerol transformation to 1 3 pdo and caproate through self sufficient ethanol exchange fig 5 which could not otherwise be accomplished in non enriched communities the underlying reasons driving ethanol production over 1 3 pdo from glycerol in case 4 compared with case 1 included a favorable glycerol acetate stoichiometric ratio for ethanol production rather than 1 3 pdo production from glycerol leng et al 2017 temudo et al 2008 and the co dominance of ethanol utilization bacteria m senegalense and c kluyveri which cooperated with e limosum for ethanol production the electron flux analysis in the batch test case 4 further elucidated the synergistic metabolic network of the dominant microorganisms in p1 the sum of these four reactions r1 r2 r6 and r9 shows that a significant amount of reductive reactions 42 38 mm e and some acetate consumption 2 50 mm were not accounted for table 2 a possible explanation is the acetate and electrons were stored temporarily in some compounds such as poly β hydroxybutyrate phb in the recovered genome bin associated with the predominated m senegalense s6 bin004 in this phase fig 3 three genes related to phb production utilization were detected these genes include an acetyl coa acetyltransferase gene atob phaa a 3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase gene phbb and a poly beta hydroxybutyrate polymerase gene phbc table s2 sieber et al 2015 these enzymes can catalyze the conversion of acetyl coa to phb through acetoacetyl coa and r 3 hydroxybutanoyl coa therefore it is proposed that glycerol oxidation to acetate and co2 r3 reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb production r11 concurrently occurred to balance the electron and acetate in p1 table 2 e limosum can redirect electrons back to acetate with co2 indeed in p2 days 4 12 ethanol oxidation to acetate r5 h2 oxidation r7 and acetate reduction to butyrate r9 were detected the electron flow analysis matches the electron flow balance of the reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb consumption r12 subsequently the phb production and utilization in p1 and p2 respectively facilitated the redirection of excess electrons donated from glycerol back into acetate and butyrate for chain elongation in p3 reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb production r12 probably occurred to balance the electron flow one hypothesis to address why phb was produced rather than generating more butyrate during glycerol fermentation is that the high accumulation of acetate and h2 need to be stored in a temporary sink i e phb in order to promote a thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation m senegalense could appropriately exploit ethanol oxidation phb production and butyrate production for the electron balance this phb formation and reutilization by m senegalense was further supported by the detection of phb at 1 94 cell dry mass cdm in phase 3 of stage 6 seed culture of case 4 whereas it was not detected in the culture without the dominance of m senegalense i e phase 2 of stage 2 as a reference 4 conclusions the caproate production rate of the co production system was improved from 0 006 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 21 mol c per mol c glycerol compared to our previous study this was achieved by the enrichment of a microbial community capable of coupling glycerol disproportionation to ethanol and 1 3 pdo and ethanol oxidation to caproate by observing the microbial community dynamics and behavior of the multistage bioreactor performance the relationship between 1 3 pdo and caproate production was uncovered including a glycerol degrading and 1 3 pdo and ethanol producing bacterium e limosum an ethanol consuming and acetate and butyrate producing bacterium m senegalanse and a caproate producer c kluyveri the reactor feed was switched from glycerol to a mixture of glycerol and ethanol and a gradual decrease in glycerol loading to support such a community the increased ethanol and decreased 1 3 pdo stimulate chain elongation by providing more substrate and alleviating inhibition respectively this novel operation scheme could facilitate the efficient chain elongation activity attributed to the selectively enriched c kluyveri in the bioreactor in conclusion combined bioreactor operation and microbial community analysis demonstrate that ethanol selection followed by glycerol feed enrichment is an effective approach to adapting a bioreactor in a synergistic fermentation process capable of efficiently converting glycerol to 1 3 pdo and caproate our newly developed approach for circumventing inherent challenges associated with 1 3 pdo and caproate co production provides an attractive revenue generating option for biodiesel waste glycerol upcycling prior to industrial application the carbon recovery of this process needs to be improved with in line caproate extraction and the stability and resilience of the microbiome to withstand operating upset needs to be tested conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare

19201,glycerol is presently being generated in surplus with the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry and seeks ways to be upcycled rather than to be treated with costs glycerol for the co production of 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo and caproate has a great prospect yet its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of caproate productivity which requires the presence of ethanol as a co substrate and necessitates the co existence of functional microbes for glycerol fermentation and chain elongation this study successfully achieved 6 38 mm c 1 3 pdo d 1 and 2 95 mm c caproate d 1 in a 2 l mixed cultured semi continuous fermenter with a glycerol ethanol acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4 3 1 such conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of eubacterium limosum clostridium kluyveri and massilibacterium senegalense with such a synergistic microbiome the co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was achieved from glycerol without ethanol addition based on metagenomics e limosum is capable of converting glycerol to 1 3 pdo ethanol and h2 and also redirecting the electron potential of h2 into acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway which is then used for chain elongation c kluyveri worked synergistically with e limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production m senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate facilitating the generation of these intermediates for c kluyveri elongation to caproate during the transition between fermentation and elongation an unexpected observation of poly β hydroxybutyrate phb formation and reutilization by m senegalense may be associated with butyrate formation for further caproate generation the knowledge gleaned from the substrate constitute microbial consortium and their

introduction the rapidly growing biodiesel industry generates glycerol as a major waste product it would be beneficial to upcycle it rather than to treat with costs based on anaerobic microbiology glycerol can be theoretically converted into two commercially valuable compounds 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo and caproate some microbial fermenters in the genera klebsiella clostridium and citrobacter can convert glycerol to 1 3 pdo fatty acids i e acetate and butyrate and ethanol barbirato et al 1998 biebl 2001 boenigk et al 1993 jarvis et al 1997 menzel et al 1997 other fermentative bacteria could oxidize ethanol and drive fatty acids condensation into caproate agler et al 2012 seedorf et al 2008 steinbusch et al 2011 previously we have demonstrated that the two processes can be coupled but caproate production was much lower than anticipated leng et al 2017 dams and collaborators improved caproate production through bioaugmentation with clostidium acetobutylicum atcc 824 which directly increased butyrate formation from glycerol for biosynthesis of caproate via chain elongation dams et al 2018 it indicated that a combination of metabolic pathways in multiple species of microorganisms acting in synergism can achieve an efficient co production our next step is to uncover the biological relationship between 1 3 pdo and caproate production and to enrich a microbial community capable of optimizing the two processes in one rector our previous study using batch experiments did not produce enough ethanol to support desirable caproate production leng et al 2017 efficient caproate production requires the balance between i production of 1 3 pdo and ethanol from glycerol fermentation and ii the glycerol degraders and ethanol oxidizing caproate producers based on fermentation balance stoichiometry of reverse β oxidation angenent et al 2016 spirito et al 2014 and an assumption that glycerol derived ethanol and acetate are completely converted into caproate 58 3 of glycerol can be funneled into 1 3 pdo 0 583 mol c 1 3 pdo per mol c glycerol while 27 8 of glycerol can be channeled towards ethanol and acetate production ultimately yielding a maximum of 0 278 mol c caproate formation per mol c glycerol although the highest proportion of glycerol that can be funneled into caproate via ethanol is 33 3 resulting in 0 417 mol c caproate formation per mol c glycerol and 0 500 mol c 1 3 pdo per mol c glycerol the caproate production requires acetate exogenously supplied details of the theoretical scenarios are shown in supplementary information experimental validation of aforementioned scenarios is a milestone beyond our previous study but the challenge lies in the enrichment of a microbial community with the co dominance of 1 3 pdo ethanol and caproate producers for example ethanol and 1 3 pdo both of which are products of glycerol fermentation may have opposing effects on caproate producers ethanol is an effective electron donor of clostridium kluyveri for caproate production seedorf et al 2008 while 1 3 pdo suppresses the chain elongation activity of clostridium spp szymanowska powaowska and kubiak 2015 in this study we design a bioreactor to enrich for glycerol degraders with higher ethanol producing capacities and caproate producers with ethanol consuming capacities which is capable of decreasing the byproducts created during the glycerol fermentation to 1 3 pdo reducing the amount of energy required for chemical recovery and producing an additional value added chemical caproate which can be used by various industries ethanol producers are usually tolerant of high ethanol concentrations so we transit the operation of a reactor with glycerol as feed to a mixed feed of glycerol and ethanol and gradually decrease the glycerol loading we hypothesize that the conditions would 1 improve the ethanol producing capacities of glycerol degraders 2 reduce the suppression pressure of 1 3 pdo on caproate producers and 3 ultimately select for a microbial community capable of coupling glycerol disproportionation to ethanol and 1 3 pdo and ethanol oxidation to caproate the details of how 1 3 pdo and caproate are co produced from glycerol without ethanol addition and how the microorganisms accomplish this metabolic fate were explored through analyzing the electron flow of fermentation metabolic pathways of key microbes and the interactions of microbial community the microbial community analyses and metagenomics were employed to elucidate the microbiology underpinning the new bioprocess the findings on a successful increment in caproate production while maintaining 1 3 pdo generation can be applied to the recovery of two value added chemicals from crude glycerol or glycerol containing wastewater creating a new revenue for the biodiesel industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and medium an inoculum of 10 volume working volume v v anaerobic digestion ad sludge was collected from shek wu hui sewage treatment works

continuous reactor the microbial community was first enriched in a semi continuous fermenter in three stages stage 1 3 with a gradual increase of glycerol and a constant amount of acetate in the influent fig 1 a at stage 3 a stable yield of 1 3 pdo 13 90 mm c d 1 butyrate 5 48 mm c d 1 and acetate net 4 06 mm c d 1 with a glycerol feed of 45 mm c d 1 fig 1b was achieved the conversion rates of 1 3 pdo and butyrate were 0 31 mol mol glycerol and 0 10 mol mol glycerol respectively and approximately 60 of glycerol was catabolized into 1 3 pdo butyrate and acetate the 16s rrna gene targeting microbial community analysis showed that eubacterium limosum 100 identity based on blastn proteiniphilum acetatigenes 100 actinomyces sp md1 100 and anaerostipes caccae 100 were observed as the major microbial constituents in stage 1 3 fig 1c metagenomic approach was applied to confirm the metabolic capacity of recovered draft genome bins i e confirming whether the genes for particular metabolic function are completed in a bin it does not disclose the genes are expressed or the corresponding pathway works in situ based on the metabolic capacities found in the recovered bins e limosum s3 bin001 is capable of converting glycerol to acetate oxidatively via glda dhal k and 1 3 pdo via pduc d e dhat reductively lin 1976 while a caccae s3 bin003 encodes for glycerol oxidation to butyrate via glda dhal k cat2 3 fig 4 louis and flint 2009 the annotated genes and pathways of recovered genome bins associated with the proteiniphilum s3 bin013 and actinomyces s3 bin002 are also demonstrated in fig 4 and described with details in supplementary information surprisingly the commonly known 1 3 pdo producing bacteria clostridium butyricum and klebsiella pneumoniae constituted an insignificant proportion of the microbial community at stage 3 instead c butyricum dominated at stage 1 with a high relative abundance of 34 06 38 64 when the influent glycerol was significantly higher 102 mm c d 1 fig 1a and c nevertheless such a high glycerol load could not be completely consumed instead k pneumoniae was prevalent in the first half of stage 2 at a high relative abundance of 12 68 17 86 consistently resulting in a high 1 3 pdo yield of 14 97 mm c d 1 from 30 mm c d 1 of glycerol however the fermentation became inefficient in the second half of stage 2 accumulating a large amount of glycerol due to the fluctuations in the fermenter operation in general a stable microbial community effectively facilitating glycerol dissimilation to 1 3 pdo butyrate and acetate was enriched in these three stages however caproate was at undetectable levels between stage 1 and 3 fig 1b indicating the absence of chain elongation activity this observation also coincided with the absence of ethanol in these 3 stages fig 1b caproate production could have been suppressed either due to the antagonistic effect of 1 3 pdo the absence of electron donor ethanol or a combination of both factors questions remain as to how the fermenter microbiota could be manipulated to achieve a concurrent chain elongation of acetate and butyrate to caproate and how the microorganisms interact to accomplish such metabolisms while 1 3 pdo remains in high yield 3 2 effect of substrates on caproate and 1 3 pdo formation in order to estimate the effects of ethanol on 1 3 pdo production and glycerol on caproate formation batch tests employing ad sludge samples under three different combinations of substrate were performed glycerol and acetate case 1 glycerol ethanol and acetate case 2 and ethanol and acetate case 3 the substrate loading and stoichiometric molar ratios were selected based on the optimized parameters from our previous study leng et al 2017 using glycerol and acetate in the feed butyrate production was lower but 1 3 pdo yield was higher in case 1 the batch tests fig 2 a compared to stage 3 the semi continuous fermenter fig 1b in case 1 glycerol was completely consumed within 3 days resulting in a high conversion of 1 3 pdo 0 54 mol c mol c glycerol and an insignificant formation of acetate butyrate and ethanol after glycerol depletion ethanol was immediately consumed with a small yield of butyrate 0 08 mol c mol c glycerol and caproate 0 03 mol c mol c glycerol in the following days two h2 formation peaks were accompanied with glycerol dissimilation as well as butyrate and 1 3 pdo degradation an organism associated with k pneumoniae 100 predominated on day 2 which was possibly related to a high 1 3 pdo production from glycerol fig 3 on day 6 two organisms uncultured desulfovibrio sp 100 and megasphaera elsdenii 100 increased slightly m elsdenii was feasibly associated with butyrate and low levels of caproate production marounek et al 1989 chain elongation for caproate production was achieved in case 2 fig 2b illustrates two phase fermentation in case 2 in the first phase within the first 3 days glycerol consumption occurred rapidly resulting in the release of a large amount of 1 3 pdo 0 60 mol c mol c glycerol and low amounts of acetate butyrate and ethanol achieving successful glycerol fermentation in the second phase from day 4 to day 12 ethanol and acetate were converted to butyrate 0 45 0 56 mol c mol c ethanol and caproate 0 50 mol c mol c ethanol implying successful chain elongation using glycerol formation byproducts and ethanol the h2 formation increased with continued glycerol fermentation and remained levelled until ethanol declined to a low concentration correspondingly the microbial community structure on day 2 mainly consisted of k pneumoniae 100 and escherichia coli 100 fig 3 in this case k pneumoniae likely facilitated 1 3 pdo production from glycerol the slight ethanol production was probably caused by e coli murarka et al 2008 on day 8 the second phase m elsdenii 100 increased considerably and meanwhile c kluyveri also showed a small increase during the butyrate and caproate formation however the chain elongation process came to a halt after day 12 resulting in residual ethanol and acetate microbial community on day 30 showed that the abundance of m elsdenii significantly declined which was consistent with the cessation of ethanol consumption and caproate formation this is reflective of the findings of miyazaki et al 1991 that ethanol exhibits inhibitory effect on the growth of m elsdenii under weakly acidic neutral conditions ph 6 0 to 6 8 nevertheless a co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was successfully achieved with glycerol ethanol and acetate and the ethanol addition did not repress 1 3 pdo production the results of case 2 suggest that ethanol addition enables efficient glycerol fermentation and chain elongation integration as expected in case 3 figs 2c 1 3 pdo was not generated owing to the absence of glycerol in the medium but caproate was effectively produced from ethanol elongation was initiated on day 3 and reached the peak conversion rates of 0 13 mol c butyrate mol c ethanol and 0 71 mol c caproate mol c ethanol respectively on day 12 in comparison with case 2 the chain elongation occurred more promptly and a complete utilization of ethanol and acetate was achieved at similar influent ethanol and acetate levels the higher caproate production over butyrate in case 3 than that in case 2 coincided with a higher h2 formation indicating a higher reducing potential i e more electrons donated in the system notably c kluyveri predominated on day 6 as a major caproate producer fig 3 the comparison between case 2 and case 3 on caproate production is reflective of an antagonistic effect of glycerol on chain elongation a substantial difference responsible for elongation observed is the dominance of m elsdenii and c kluyveri in case 2 and 3 respectively the reason why m elsdenii was selectively enriched in the presence of glycerol is crucial in coupling caproate production with glycerol fermentation m elsdenii cannot metabolize glycerol marounek et al 1989 and hence its proliferation is not directly stimulated by glycerol on day 3 in case 2 and day 0 in case 3 the ethanol and acetate levels were very similar suggesting it was not substrate availability the only apparent difference was the generation of 1 3 pdo from glycerol degradation between day 1 3 in case 2 collectively these observations suggest that 1 3 pdo toxicity may be a major factor driving the selection of the chain elongating organism the highest concentration of 1 3 pdo in case 2 the batch tests and stage 3 the semi continuous fermenter was close to and above 10 g l respectively which was at a level inhibitory for clostridium spp 10 15 g l 1 3 pdo szymanowska powaowska and kubiak 2015 it also supports the notion that the inhibitory effect of 1 3 pdo created a selective pressure against c kluyveri while favoring the enrichment of m elsdenii this suggests that an optimal glycerol acetate ratio is needed to control 1 3 pdo at a non inhibitory level for the growth of 1 3 pdo sensitve chain elongation bacteria such as c kluyveri an alternative solution would be the production of less 1 3 pdo from glycerol while converting more glycerol to ethanol and generating more h2 to consume excess reducing power for maximizing the use of glycerol derived energy this approach is also beneficial as it could potentially eliminate the need for external ethanol dosing eventually 3 3 fermenter microbiome enrichment and physiological performance with an ethanol addition on the basis of the batch test findings ethanol addition with a gradual decrease of influent glycerol loading was applied for the operation of semi continuous fermenter stage 4 6 fig 1a so as to enrich ethanol tolerant producing glycerol degraders and ethanol consuming caproate producer at the beginning of the ethanol enrichment process stages 4 and 5 incomplete ethanol consumption was observed along with a negligible caproate production but an increased in butyrate production fig 1b during these two stages a marked increase in the abundance of clostridium intestinale 100 fig 1c was observed c intestinale is a concurrent butyrate and h2 producer that grows on saccharides and glycerol but not ethanol gossner et al 2006 kalia 2016 moscoviz et al 2016 viana et al 2014 in stage 6 at a glycerol ethanol acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4 3 1 an optimized co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate was finally achieved with complete ethanol utilization albeit a lower 1 3 pdo production resulted from the reduced glycerol loading fig 1b the fermentation achieved the optimized function of 1 3 pdo and caproate co production the complete assimilation of glycerol 20 mm c d 1 and ethanol 10 mm c d 1 resulted in 6 38 and 2 95 mm c d 1 of 1 3 pdo and caproate respectively table 1 the increased caproate production did not reduce the conversion rate of 1 3 pdo instead 1 3 pdo conversion rate increased from an average of 0 26 mol mol glycerol in stage 3 to an average of 0 32 mol mol glycerol in stage 6 the most abundant organisms detected in stage 6 were e limosum and c kluyveri as well as massilibacterium senegalense formerly known as bacillaceae bacterium mt8 fig 1c based on the recovered genome bins from metagenomics sequencing fig 4 e limosum s6 bin003 is capable of converting glycerol via glda dhal k to 1 3 pdo via pduc d e dhat ethanol via adhe and adh2 and h2 it is also able to oxidize h2 to acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway which redirects the energy of h2 back into chain elongation the gene annotation results of genome bin s6 bin012 were consistent with the well known pathway of c kluyveri utilizing ethanol and acetate for butyrate and caproate generation via cat2 m senegalense s6 bin004 encodes for ethanol oxidation via adh2 yiay and aldh to acetate via pta and acka and butyrate via atod likely capable of facilitating carboxylate chain elongation of c kluyveri notably in contrast to case 2 of the batch tests the enrichment of microorganisms in the semi continuous fermenter in stage 6 i e e limosum c kluyveri and m senegalense selectively excluded facultative pathogens such as e coli and k pneumoniae and successfully accomplished the 1 3 pdo and caproate co production with an integration of glycerol fermentation and chain elongation these findings indicate that the successful co production process was mainly facilitated with 1 the enrichment of e limosum 2 the predominance of c kluyveri allowed by a concomitant enrichment of e limosum and a gradual decrease of glycerol loading 3 efficient chain elongation accomplished by c kluyveri ethanol consuming caproate producer with the stimulation of m senegalense nonetheless whether the enriched versatile glycerol degrader e limosum could further convert glycerol derived energy to ethanol and h2 in a balance with 1 3 pdo and acetate and redirect the energy of h2 back into chain elongation needs further evidence an investigation on electron flux of glycerol fermentation and chain elongation with ethanol self sufficiency inoculated by the now enriched microbial community could help answer the question 3 4 co production of 1 3 pdo and caproate from glycerol with enriched microbial community to answer the above questions an additional batch test inoculated with the enriched culture from stage 6 and fed with glycerol and acetate was conducted case 4 the physiological performance and microbial communities are shown in figs 2d and 3 respectively compared with a similar case of our previous study leng et al 2017 the caproate production rate was improved from 0 006 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 21 mol c per mol c glycerol although 1 3 pdo production rate decreased from 0 36 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 19 mol c per mol c glycerol this is one milestone for the co production because in our previous study glycerol fermentation could only either produced 1 3 pdo or caproate as a major product four phases p1p4 of metabolism and their corresponding electron flux are shown in table 2 in p1 days 0 4 more ethanol reaction no 2 as shown in table 2 hereafter abbreviated as r2 and h2 r6 and less 1 3 pdo r1 were produced with glycerol consumption compared to case 1 fed with the same substrates since a low consumption of acetate and delayed butyrate production also occurred it is postulated that some acetate was converted to butyrate reductively and the butyrate was temporarily stored in the cells and released slowly into the solution r9 the predominated e limosum s6 bin003 in this phase probably converts glycerol to ethanol acetate and butyrate oxidatively and to 1 3 pdo and h2 reductively following a transition phase p2 days 4 12 the produced ethanol and the acetate in the system were used for caproate and butyrate formation and the chain elongation metabolism ceased when ethanol was depleted in p3 days 12 15 its corresponding reactions included r5 r6 r9 and r10 table 2 c kluyveri became abundant during this phase and performed chain elongation to butyrate and caproate facilitated by medium chain specific coa transferase cat2 m senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate likely facilitating carboxylate chain elongation of c kluyveri in p4 days 15 23 a second h2 decrease correlated to a slight increase of acetate r7 and r8 in short this glycerol and acetate fed batch test showed that higher ethanol production from glycerol dissimilation could be achieved and further used as an intermediate metabolite to stimulate chain elongation for caproate production importantly this test also demonstrated that the collective metabolisms of e limosum c kluyveri and m senegalense enabled interspecies metabolic interactions to support glycerol transformation to 1 3 pdo and caproate through self sufficient ethanol exchange fig 5 which could not otherwise be accomplished in non enriched communities the underlying reasons driving ethanol production over 1 3 pdo from glycerol in case 4 compared with case 1 included a favorable glycerol acetate stoichiometric ratio for ethanol production rather than 1 3 pdo production from glycerol leng et al 2017 temudo et al 2008 and the co dominance of ethanol utilization bacteria m senegalense and c kluyveri which cooperated with e limosum for ethanol production the electron flux analysis in the batch test case 4 further elucidated the synergistic metabolic network of the dominant microorganisms in p1 the sum of these four reactions r1 r2 r6 and r9 shows that a significant amount of reductive reactions 42 38 mm e and some acetate consumption 2 50 mm were not accounted for table 2 a possible explanation is the acetate and electrons were stored temporarily in some compounds such as poly β hydroxybutyrate phb in the recovered genome bin associated with the predominated m senegalense s6 bin004 in this phase fig 3 three genes related to phb production utilization were detected these genes include an acetyl coa acetyltransferase gene atob phaa a 3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase gene phbb and a poly beta hydroxybutyrate polymerase gene phbc table s2 sieber et al 2015 these enzymes can catalyze the conversion of acetyl coa to phb through acetoacetyl coa and r 3 hydroxybutanoyl coa therefore it is proposed that glycerol oxidation to acetate and co2 r3 reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb production r11 concurrently occurred to balance the electron and acetate in p1 table 2 e limosum can redirect electrons back to acetate with co2 indeed in p2 days 4 12 ethanol oxidation to acetate r5 h2 oxidation r7 and acetate reduction to butyrate r9 were detected the electron flow analysis matches the electron flow balance of the reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb consumption r12 subsequently the phb production and utilization in p1 and p2 respectively facilitated the redirection of excess electrons donated from glycerol back into acetate and butyrate for chain elongation in p3 reduction of co2 to acetate r8 and phb production r12 probably occurred to balance the electron flow one hypothesis to address why phb was produced rather than generating more butyrate during glycerol fermentation is that the high accumulation of acetate and h2 need to be stored in a temporary sink i e phb in order to promote a thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation m senegalense could appropriately exploit ethanol oxidation phb production and butyrate production for the electron balance this phb formation and reutilization by m senegalense was further supported by the detection of phb at 1 94 cell dry mass cdm in phase 3 of stage 6 seed culture of case 4 whereas it was not detected in the culture without the dominance of m senegalense i e phase 2 of stage 2 as a reference 4 conclusions the caproate production rate of the co production system was improved from 0 006 mol c per mol c glycerol to 0 21 mol c per mol c glycerol compared to our previous study this was achieved by the enrichment of a microbial community capable of coupling glycerol disproportionation to ethanol and 1 3 pdo and ethanol oxidation to caproate by observing the microbial community dynamics and behavior of the multistage bioreactor performance the relationship between 1 3 pdo and caproate production was uncovered including a glycerol degrading and 1 3 pdo and ethanol producing bacterium e limosum an ethanol consuming and acetate and butyrate producing bacterium m senegalanse and a caproate producer c kluyveri the reactor feed was switched from glycerol to a mixture of glycerol and ethanol and a gradual decrease in glycerol loading to support such a community the increased ethanol and decreased 1 3 pdo stimulate chain elongation by providing more substrate and alleviating inhibition respectively this novel operation scheme could facilitate the efficient chain elongation activity attributed to the selectively enriched c kluyveri in the bioreactor in conclusion combined bioreactor operation and microbial community analysis demonstrate that ethanol selection followed by glycerol feed enrichment is an effective approach to adapting a bioreactor in a synergistic fermentation process capable of efficiently converting glycerol to 1 3 pdo and caproate our newly developed approach for circumventing inherent challenges associated with 1 3 pdo and caproate co production provides an attractive revenue generating option for biodiesel waste glycerol upcycling prior to industrial application the carbon recovery of this process needs to be improved with in line caproate extraction and the stability and resilience of the microbiome to withstand operating upset needs to be tested conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare

19202,number of populations industry and economic activities in indonesia are growing rapidly and these impacts on natural environments raise awareness about water quality issue over the country bandung basin one of the most growing rapidity urban areas in indonesia was assessed for no3 contamination in groundwater systems and its controlling factors and driving mechanisms were investigated with the aim to demonstrate novelty on the use of combination of parameters of stable isotope ratios in nitrate δ15n and δ18o in no3 groundwater age using cfc 12 age tracer and socioeconomic parameters land use population and economic database groundwater no3 concentrations at present time did not exceed hwo limit for all the analyzed samples 3 00 mg l in average with maximum value of 20 69 mg l n 102 dual stable isotopic analysis together with cfc 12 groundwater age determination suggest that anthropogenic activities are the major causes for increasing no3 concentrations in groundwater those activities under respective land use are industrial and domestic wastes for urban areas and chemical fertilizers for paddy and plantations areas in general shallow unconfined aquifer is more vulnerable to no3 contamination compared with deep confined aquifer because denitrification partly occurs in deep anoxic aquifer and this led attenuation of no3 pollution in groundwater flowing however it seems likely at groundwater depression cones in urban areas that more concentrated waters are transported from shallow aquifer into deep aquifer system through downward vertical fluxes due to excessive pumping principal component analysis pca on no3 concentrations with socioeconomic parameters indicated that industrial and population growths are the main factors related to groundwater no3 contamination this result corresponds to cfc age dating which shows younger more recently recharged groundwaters as being more contaminated than older ones do our study implies that no3 contamination in this area may become more severe in future with a lack of necessary controls and treatment for human induced nitrogen sources proposed approach is useful to understand how the no3 contaminant behaves in large basin aquifer system under urban environments and might be applicable in other developing regions too because increasing populations may be associated with increasing nitrogen loadings graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater nitrate contamination cfc age dating principal component analysis developing region bandung basin 1 introduction increase of dissolved nitrate no3 in aquatic system is now a widespread concern and a particularly important ongoing environmental problem foster and chlton 2003 rivett et al 2008 it has been shown in several studies that human activities such as nitrogen fertilizer and animal manure overuse domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and activities that cause increased precipitation of nitrogen compounds are the primary causes of increased no3 concentrations in groundwater e g kendall 1998 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the no3 contamination of groundwater poses risks to human health steffen et al 2015 and can also cause many ecological and environmental problems e g rockstrom et al 2009 li et al 2010 2013 in this regard the world health organization has set an upper no3 concentration limit of 50 mg l for drinking water who 2017 but limit of 10 mg l is used in indonesia where this study was performed permenkes 2017 comprehensive studies on determination of no3 sources and pathways in subsurface environments have initially been performed in europe and north america referred to as western countries using multiple isotope tracers δ15nno3 with other isotope ratios of the elements such as δ11b δ18ono3 δ13c dic δ34sso4 2 and δ18oso4 2 böttcher et al 1990 böhlke and denver 1995 wassenaar 1995 aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 widory et al 2004 2005 singleton et al 2007 otero et al 2009 and successfully applied by followed studies in many part of the worlds including asian region liu et al 2006 umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2009a 2010 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 and references cited previously it has already argued in the previous review on groundwater no3 pollution status among asian megacities umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2011c that presence of the nitrogen form and its attenuation processes depend particularly on in situ hydrogeological setting and controlled by redox condition within aquifer systems not due to the differences in developing stage among the cities however the previous studies have not yet sought deeply the possibility of pollution status transition hara 2006 taniguchi et al 2008 that may be able to identified within particular study site with a set of key information for comparison groundwater age and socioeconomic archives to achieve this attempt nowadays the population in indonesia is growing significantly and it will increase progressively in the next quarter century while half the population was already living in urban areas in 2015 this is expected to reach two thirds by 2035 by 2035 90 per cent of those living in java island will be urban dwellers this massive urban population will concentrate in the twin mega urban regions jakarta and bandung jones 2010 it is therefore that the bandung basin is one of ideal study target area to assess how such rapid urbanization effects on subsurface environments in order to reconstruct historical trend of the groundwater no3 contamination groundwater residence time determining from cfcs and fs6 age tracers busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 can be used as a time marker together with no3 concentration of the same water hypothesized that contaminants were infiltered in recharge time and transported along the groundwater flows in aquifer systems in fact this concept has successfully been applied in small scale catchment e g gooddy et al 2006 and to other target material transportations ako et al 2013 ide et al 2018 although much applications have not seen for regional groundwater flow systems moreover age constraint groundwater can be used to further discuss a tendency and driving force of contamination in comparison with socioeconomic parameters available motivated from current observations on increase in nitrogen loadings singh et al 1995 kumar 2013 associated with population increases in large asian cities it is worth to test if proposed approach will be applicable to our study area in indonesia there are several areas where groundwater no3 concentrations exceed the world health organization limit umezawa et al 2008 kagabu et al 2010 hosono et al 2009a 2009b 2009c 2011a b c on the shallow groundwater in jakarta groundwater samples collected near dry agricultural fields area displayed no3 contamination that is sourced from the agricultural activities and were more largely attributed to wastewaters from domestic leakage near city area umezawa et al 2008 kagabu et al 2010 hosono et al 2011a b c in jogjakarta it was reported that the no3 concentrations in groundwater range from 0 09 to 74 80 mg l n 43 and identified the highest anomaly of the presence of fecal coli bacteria in shallow groundwater under the urban areas souvannachith et al 2017 however there are no comprehensive publications reporting groundwater no3 contamination in bandung basin this paper is the first comprehensive study reporting no3 contamination of groundwater in bandung basin that treads for both shallow unconfined and deep confined aquifers first the current no3 contamination status will be assessed and compared with land use type to put constraint on their source then the source of contaminations will be further discussed in detail with combination dataset of dual isotope ratios δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 multiple chemical components major ions and field measurements and chlorofluorocarbon 12 cfc 12 ages finally the relationships between no3 concentrations and socioeconomic parameters will be compared to test if there would detect the relationships between no3 concentrations in groundwater and socioeconomic development parameters the results and proposed approach could be a base for understand the ways of mitigating no3 contamination in the near future 2 study area the bandung basin is situated in the center of west java indonesia fig 1 bandung is the capital of west java province which is the most densely populated province in indonesia and the center of the indonesian textile industry the bandung basin covers about 2300 km2 and has five administrative areas and a current population of more than 7 million the basin is an intramontane basin consisting of late tertiary and quaternary volcanic deposits and is surrounded by mountains up to 2400 m high the mean annual temperature in the basin is about 23 7 c the annual precipitation is from 1500 to 2500 mm year and the potential evapotranspiration is 1606 mm year nurliana 2009 this basin has two seasons the dry season for during april to august and the wet season for during september to march with a peak rainfall usually occurs in january throughout the region iwaco waseco 1990 the surface land of the bandung basin is mostly in three land use fig 1 urban including industrial activities paddy fields and plantation areas the urban areas have expanded rapidly since the 1970s as the population and industrial sector have grown wagner and sukrisno 1998 land use patterns in the bandung basin have been changing for decades for instance many of the lands for cultivations plantation areas and paddies have shifted to urban and industrial areas permana and wijaya 2017 in 2015 proportions for each land use in total basin are paddy fields 33 11 urban areas 28 34 plantation areas 16 16 forests 12 36 reservoirs and rivers 10 02 the three main land uses paddy fields urban areas and plantation areas and their surrounding environments will be studied here these land uses are from higher to lower elevations plantation areas dominated by tea and coffee plantation urban areas residential area office buildings and industrial complexes and paddy rice growing fields from a hydrostratigraphical viewpoint the bandung basin can be divided into two groundwater systems a shallow groundwater system and a deep groundwater system the most recent study of the groundwater flow system of the bandung basin was done by sunarwan 2014 using descriptions of cuttings drilling well logs resistivity logs major ions and stable isotopes hydrostratigrapically the bandung basin can be divided into two main systems of aquifer an unconfined and confined aquifer the unconfined aquifer is composed of three facieses sandy tuff clayey sand and silty clay in this study the groundwater in this aquifer is called shallow groundwater this water can be accessed via dug wells with a depth of 10 20 m meanwhile the confined aquifer is alteration layer composed of tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous breccia which contains deep groundwater this water is obtained from borehole wells with a depth of 80 150 m spring waters are distributed in mountain slope 3 methodology spring and groundwater samples were collected over bandung basin fig 1 during the dry season from may to july in 2015 under the assumption that samples are least affected by dilution processes from precipitations and would sustain highest solute concentrations during a year in total of 10 of spring waters were collected from the mountainous foots where plantation areas widely distribute we obtained these samples as hypothesized these waters are affected by agricultural activities fig 1a 28 shallow groundwater samples were collected from dug wells at different land uses urban areas and paddy fields as to be able to put a constraint regarding possible source of nitrate contaminations fig 1a the access to obtain shallow groundwater was limited in paddy fields and we have collected only few representative samples from dug wells appendix 1 66 deep groundwater samples were obtained both from drilled wells mostly from private wells and observation wells government monitoring well in the bandung basin most of data for field measurement major ion concentrations cfc 12 concentrations and stable isotope ratios of nitrogen δ15nno3 and oxygen δ18ono3 in no3 were supplied partly in previous reported papers with analytical procedures taufiq et al 2018a 2018b summary of results and a set of complete data are provided in table 1 and appendix 1 respectively briefly field measurements were monitored continually using a portable meter d 54 horiba japan and the concentrations of the major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl and nitrogenous nutrients no3 no2 and nh4 were determined using an ion chromatograph compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland respectively chlorofluorocarbons cfcs concentrations were determined using a closed system purge and trap gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan but in this study only the cfc 12 concentration was used as a marker of young groundwater to calculate apparent groundwater residence time appendix 1 because cfc 12 is relatively stable in the subsurface environment than other compounds plummer et al 1998 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were determined applying the denitrifier method presented by sigman et al 2001 and casciotti et al 2002 followed laboratory routine in the kumamoto university hosono et al 2013 2014 the analytical precisions for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively in this study the no3 concentrations in spring and shallow ground waters will be assessed taking the type of land uses into accounts as has been previously demonstrated for its effectiveness lockhart et al 2013 qin et al 2013 in contrast direct contributions of pollutants from just above surface lands seem to be unlikely for deep groundwater with longer lateral flow paths considering regional groundwater flow dynamics except in an area of depression zones taufiq et al 2018a 2018b in this regard the deep groundwater could be classified mainly into two types older groundwater the groundwater with cfc 12 concentrations undetectable and recharge periods estimated as to be before 1950 and younger groundwater the groundwater with cfc 12 concentrations detectable and recharge periods estimated as to be after 1950 appendix 1 socioeconomic data for the basin for the period from 1953 to 1991 were compiled and used in the study the annual data of the bandung basin were taken from book of west java province bps 2016 and were compiled in appendix 2 such as permanent population pp in number of people population density pd in people km2 average monthly gross domestic product gdp in indonesian rupiah idr industrial growth ig in number of industries built up urban areas bua in ha green areas of agriculture plantation and forests ga in ha and amount of use of chemical fertilizers cf in ton this period is somehow matching to groundwater age determined by cfc 12 concentration from 1953 to 1991 taufiq et al 2018a see appendix 1 an understanding of the mechanisms controlling the current no3 groundwater contamination status was gained by performing several statistical analyses using spss version 23 0 software spss il usa differences in no3 concentrations in groundwater from areas with different land uses were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and the mann whitney u test the degrees to which groundwater no3 concentrations and socioeconomic parameters were associated were determined by performing regression analyses the main mechanisms driving groundwater no3 concentrations were identified by performing principle component analysis pca 4 results 4 1 concentrations for dissolved inorganic nitrogen among three different forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen no3 no2 and nh4 no3 and nh4 consist of the major forms of nitrogen compounds in the studied groundwaters but no2 is less important as its concentration is very low ranging from 1 52 μmol to 1 09 μmol for shallow and deep groundwater respectively table 1 and appendix 1 concentrations of no3 and nh4 vary 333 71 μmol and 260 53 μmol for shallow groundwater and 106 29 μmol and 152 44 μmol for deep groundwater respectively for shallow groundwater no3 concentrations tend to increase with decreasing of nh4 concentrations and vice versa appendix 1 suggesting input sources of nitrogen partly stay as being ammonium ion form but not be nitrified probably due to the presence of anoxic conditions similar phenomenon as identified in other asian aquifer systems umezawa et al 2008 such tendency is less obvious for deep groundwater appendix 1 probably because of the mixing of shallow and deep groundwater taufiq et al 2018a 2018b as partly discussed later concentrations of nh4 are comparable to those of no3 and undoubtfully important to discuss for their sources and fates however this paper focus on no3 concentrations since nitrogen in nitrate form is threat for human health there are more groundwaters in shallow aquifer with higher no3 concentrations than the deep groundwater figs 2 and 3 the no3 concentrations are from detection limit to 20 69 mg l for all studied groundwaters and do not exceed the world health organization limit of 50 mg l in any sample but exceed the indonesian standard 10 mg l s3 s6 s30 in some samples although the current no3 concentrations seem to be acceptable the concentrations are likely to increase with time fig 4 and threaten drinking water supplies in the future this will be discussed in section 5 2 the effects of human activities on groundwater contamination were investigated further by comparing the no3 concentrations in the shallow groundwater by different land uses the mean of no3 concentrations in different land uses were different but the differences were not significant p 0 05 except in urban area higher mean no3 concentration 5 04 4 68 mg l was observed for the urban areas compared for plantation areas 3 39 1 94 mg l and paddy fields 3 36 1 94 mg l the mean no3 concentrations for older and younger groundwater were 2 42 1 92 mg l and 1 69 1 49 mg l respectively these concentrations are lower than shallow groundwater 4 2 stable isotope ratios of nitrate the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were determined to allow possible sources of dissolved nitrate no3 analytical results are summarized in table 1 and all data are supplied in appendix 1 and compositional relationships between δ15nno3 and no3 concentrations and dual isotope ratios are plotted in figs 5 and 6 for shallow and deep groundwater respectively overall either shallow or deep groundwater show wide compositional ranges figs 5b and 6b from 5 to 50 for δ15nno3 and from 10 to 40 for δ18ono3 suggesting variabilities in their source characteristics and occurrences of microbiological reactions majority of samples both shallow and deep groundwaters show dissolved oxygen concentrations more than 2 0 mg l fig 2c and d and only 3 samples showed the value less than 2 0 mg l it is generally accepted that nitrate microbial reduction could occur under anoxic condition typically dissolved oxygen concentrations 2 0 mg l hosono et al 2013 and references therein in fact decline of no3 concentrations seems not to be associated with increasing in δ15nno3 fig 5a and b while no3 concentrations rather tend to increase with increasing in δ15nno3 for the samples with its value 20 implying the samples may inherit dual isotopic compositions as indicating their source characteristics except ones have elevated δ15nno3 values 20 for shallow groundwater the samples from plantation areas tend to have lower δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions compared to those from urban areas and paddy field fig 5b source of no3 n in groundwaters could be estimated from their isotopic compositions together with land use constraint chemical fertilizers for plantation areas septic waste for urban areas and manure and or septic waste for paddy fields in rural area details are discussed in later part for deep groundwater majority of younger groundwater recharge age after 1950 shows isotopic compositions fig 5b those indicate a source mixture among chemical fertilizers septic waste and manures implying multiple pathways of nitrate transportations on the contrary older groundwater tend to show more elevated δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions than younger groundwater fig 5b partly reflecting the occurrence of denitrification along groundwater flows with longer paths for the samples with δ15nno3 values 20 other samples show distinct isotopic compositions from 10 to 20 for both isotope ratios δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 perhaps indicating nitrogen source from septic waste or application of manure in agriculture but this is not clear because there are no favorite conditions that may support this scenario from other aspects such as sociological background 4 3 nitrate concentrations and socioeconomic development as explained earlier deep groundwater could be divided into two younger groundwater recharged after the year 1950 and older groundwater recharged before the year 1950 therefore no3 contaminations of age dated younger groundwater can compare with time serious of the socioeconomic parameters appendix 2 similarly the cfc 12 concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples covered a wide range from 12 2 to 540 8 pptv and recharge ages were estimated for these groundwaters that range from 1953 to 1991 appendix 1 the no3 contaminations of these shallow groundwaters can also be used for comparison with socioeconomic parameters appendix 2 by obtaining time series of both groundwater recharge age and socioeconomic parameters groundwater no3 contaminations at known recharge time can be compared with socioeconomic data of the same year fig 7 then the relationships between the groundwater no3 concentrations and annual data of several socioeconomic parameters were analyzed by performing regression analyses the increases of no3 concentrations in both shallow and deep younger groundwaters are weakly correlated p 0 01 with increase of permanent population in number of people pp population density in people km2 pd average monthly gross domestic product in idr gdp industrial growth in number of industries ig built up urban areas in ha bua and amount of use of chemical fertilizers in ton cf but with decrease of green areas of agriculture plantation and forests in ha ga 5 discussion at present no3 contamination in groundwater does not appear to threaten human health in the study area however it is still essential to gain an understanding of the factors that control and the mechanisms that drive the no3 concentrations in groundwater to allow measures to be taken to prevent contamination in the area becoming more severe 5 1 factors controlling nitrate contamination 5 1 1 source of nitrate contamination for shallow unconfined groundwater it has been previously investigated that nitrogen loads from the surface of particular land uses imprint their sources in groundwaters lockhart et al 2013 qin et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 thus descriptions for land uses are important to study the no3 contamination in groundwater system the controlling factors of no3 contaminations in groundwaters were identified by assessing isotopic fingerprinting together with land uses analysis because no3 enters subsurface system through several pathways that depend strongly on the type of land uses elevated no3 concentrations in groundwaters spring waters triangle symbol in fig 2a from plantation areas would be transported from vegetable and livestock farms which are distributed around the periphery of the basin these concentrations tend to decrease with increase in δ15nno3 fig 5a and this tendency may be explained by the occurrence of denitrification kendall 1998 however all groundwater samples from the plantation areas showed dissolved oxygen concentrations 6 mg l fig 2b it is commonly assumed that denitrification will not occur at such dissolved oxygen concentrations spalding and exner 1993 mccallum et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 and thus occurrence of denitrification is unlikely for nitrate dissolved in these waters from isotopic fingerprinting evidence fig 5b it can be concluded that no3 n in groundwaters from plantation areas is attributed to applications of chemical fertilizers böhlke and denver 1995 it is commonly understood that leakage of sewage waters from sewage pits or pipes are important factors affecting groundwater recharge and nutrient contamination in urban areas lerner 2002 wakida and lerner 2005 this may contribute to shallow groundwater in urban areas of the bandung basin as well as partly suggested by previous report nurliana 2009 most parts of the urban areas are underlain by poorly porous fine clay in old lake deposits and overlain by asphalt this may lead subsurface condition to be anoxic favoring denitrification relative to the subsurface in the volcanic fan this scenario could partly be applied for the groundwaters with high δ15nno3 20 but low to moderate no3 concentrations fig 5a however the effect of denitrification looks sporadic because there is no clear negative trend between the concentrations and δ15nno3 values fig 5a and most of the groundwaters are characterized by do 2 0 mg l it is therefore reasonable from isotopic comparison fig 5b to think that no3 in shallow groundwater in urban areas is the dominant nutrient released from domestic wastewater and that denitrification may remove no3 but just too some extent it is interest to further describe that the groundwaters where near to sewage treatment plants in industrial complexes such as at points s3 and s6 in the cmhi area and s30 in the rck area see fig 1 contain relatively high no3 10 mg l treated wastewaters at these points may directly infiltrate the shallow groundwater from the leakage pathways it has recently been reported that inappropriate on site sanitation is becoming an issue for an environmental degradation at all big cities of indonesia safitri et al 2010 for instance fecal coli bacteria are detected in shallow groundwater in jogjakarta souvannachith et al 2017 it seems to be reasonable to conclude that the no3 in groundwater in this area is partly supplied by wastewater derived from sewage and partly by industrial wastewater the concentrations of nitrogen compounds at the atmosphere in southeast asia including indonesia have increased because of human activities that could supply no3 in rainwater that could enter the shallow groundwater in urban areas boring et al 1988 streets et al 2001 2003 some of the water samples from the urban areas e g at site s12 see fig 5 had particularly high δ18ono3 value 33 10 suggesting the contribution of atmospheric no3 the contributions of atmospheric deposition may partly elevate no3 concentrations in surface and subsurface water campbell et al 2002 in limited areas in the bandung basin the paddy fields are widely distributed in the center of the basin fig 2 the do concentrations in this area are no less than 2 mg l fig 2b at which condition denitrification will not commonly occur spalding and exner 1993 cey et al 1999 mccallum et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 however very high δ15nno3 value observed for one sample site s24 see fig 5 strongly suggest the occurrence of denitrification in fact the paddy fields are in the lowlands in the basin center and are often water saturated so the groundwater will be in a reducing environment that will favor denitrification the denitrification may therefore be able to occur in the paddy fields but the number of the samples 4 samples see fig 5 is too small expanding this aspect as for general conclusion as mentioned in result section rest of 3 samples show isotopically distinct as these sources corresponding to manures and septic wastes but not as originated of chemical fertilizers fig 5b therefore it could be possible that nitrogen was derived from wastewater infiltering from wastewater pits in rural houses umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2011b alternatively an effect of application of manure to paddy should be considered in fact paddy fields in indonesia using organic management system i e only manure being applied cover only 0 09 of whole paddy fields in 2003 takada et al 2004 umezawa et al 2008 and synthetic fertilizers are major applied fertilizers thus the possibility of no3 contaminations due to the application of manure is unlikely and leaking of wastewaters are the most probable cause of elevated no3 concentrations although the effects of the use of chemical fertilizers and subsequent denitrification could not completely be eliminated nevertheless difference in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions between the groundwaters from plantation areas and paddy fields may suggest the difference in their source characteristics 5 1 2 source of nitrate and its attenuation processes for deep confined groundwater the source of no3 n contaminations and their attenuation processes including deep confined aquifer system are assessed along the groundwater flow systems in bandung basin taufiq et al 2018a using hydrogeological cross section cc fig 8 in recharge area described as zone a in fig 8 the no3 concentrations in shallow groundwaters spring waters are somewhat elevated due to agricultural activities in plantation areas we have discussed it in previous section the no3 concentrations decreased in both shallow and deep groundwaters without increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values at the entrance of basin aquifer system zone b in fig 8 suggesting it might be caused of dispersion and or dilution by infiltrating water in the recharge area but not through denitrification the no3 concentrations then increased as groundwater flows under cmhi groundwater depression area taufiq et al 2018a b for both deep and shallow aquifers with simultaneous increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values especially for deep groundwater fig 8 isotopic compositions for this elevated δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values are corresponding to those for manure and septic wastes fig 6 redox condition under cmhi area is not anoxic as denitrification favorably occurs fig 8 previous studies assessing groundwater mixing between shallow and deep groundwater revealed that shallow waters with contaminant materials are increasingly mixed into deep unpolluted groundwater with time enhancing groundwater contaminations due to excess pumping by the rapid urbanization taufiq et al 2018a 2018b from these observations with flow constrained by previous studies it could be reasonably concludes that nitrate concentrations in deep groundwater increased under cmhi area by increasing mixing of surface contaminants such as urban and septic wastes the no3 concentration in the deep groundwater sustains in the same level after the groundwater flows out of cmhi depression area but the redox condition turned to somewhat anoxic condition as documented previously fig 8 taufiq et al 2018a b the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values for the deep groundwater tended to increase over 20 in the end of topographical slope in the entrance of basin plain fig 8 indicating the occurrence of denitrification particularly at such specific area this tendency can be confirmed in dual isotopic composition diagram fig 6b as some of deep groundwater samples are plotted along denitrification trend in the end of flow the deep groundwaters come under another depression area dhyk area fig 8 interestingly the redox condition turned to more oxic even under stagnant flow regime as anoxic condition might apparently be presented the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values under dhyk area showed similar compositional range found in groundwater under cmhi depression area fig 8 in fact the occurrence of similar groundwater mixing as stated for cmhi area has been argued in the previous studies for dhyk depression area too taufiq et al 2018a 2018b thus similar scenario enhancing no3 contaminations from surface contaminants of urban and septic wastes by groundwater mixing due to excess pumping could be applied for explanation of observed no3 contaminations under this depression area 5 2 mechanisms driving nitrate contamination of groundwater 5 2 1 nitrate concentrations versus regional socioeconomic development it is important to identify the mechanisms driving no3 contamination to help develop ways of regulating groundwater no3 contamination the relationships between the no3 concentrations and socioeconomic development parameters and groundwater age were assessed here we will discuss more deeply for previously mentioned results positive correlation p 0 01 between no3 concentrations and pd pp bua gdp ig and cf and negative correlation p 0 01 between same concentrations and ga fig 7 higher urbanization levels indicated by pp and pd appear to be causing large amounts of domestic wastewater into the aquatic environment resulting in increase in nitrogen concentrations in groundwater bilsborough and mann 2006 stated that the per capita supply of nitrogen in human excreta will be stable because the basic protein requirement of humans is stable it was therefore expected that no3 concentration in groundwater would strongly correlate with the pd if the nitrogen removal reactions could be neglected such as denitrification the positive correlations p 0 01 were found between the no3 concentration in groundwaters and the bua but the negative correlations were found between the no3 concentration and the ga for both shallow and deep aquifers the bua and ga are indices that reflect the degree of urbanization the larger the built up area bua or the less of the green area ga link to the larger population therefore it could be accommodated that the more potential for these domestic wastewater productions enhances no3 contamination in groundwater a similar positive correlations p 0 01 were found between the no3 concentration in groundwater and the gdp and ig too this is quite reasonable because the economy of the bandung basin area is somehow reliant on industrial activity relatively large amounts of industrial wastewater may be released from industrial plants and this may cause the no3 concentrations in groundwater to be relatively high it has been argued that shallow groundwater is heavily contaminated close to industrial complexes and argued that huge amounts of untreated industrial wastewater will have directly drained into nearby rivers and may have infiltrated into the groundwater rosadi 2004 the argument was also supported by rivers close to industrial complexes being strongly contaminated with industrial wastewater tohir 2004 that can infiltrate shallow groundwater because of the influent relationships between rivers and shallow aquifers lubis and puradimaja 2005 these observations correspond to our results showing the no3 concentrations in the groundwater were higher in the industrial areas than elsewhere in the study area the no3 concentration in groundwater are correlated p 0 01 with the cf as well indicating that increasing in leaching of nitrogen from chemical fertilizers in plantation areas as a factor of the amounts of applicated fertilizers agricultural activities in plantation areas and possibly in paddy fields may act as non point sources of no3 to groundwater in addition to domestic and industrial wastewater point sources overall it can be summarized that all relationships for both shallow and deep younger groundwater somehow followed the same trends this may support the scenario that the deep groundwater is affected by the shallow groundwater because of vertical fluxes from the shallow to the deep groundwater taufiq et al 2018a 2018b observed correlations were not high probably because of the several complex reasons such as lacking of the considerations for denitrification effects and influence of other nitrogen compounds especially for ammonium nevertheless our trial can shed a light on the effective use of socioeconomic parameters combined with hydrochemistry data of the regional groundwater 5 2 2 driving force for nitrate contamination of the groundwater the main factors driving the groundwater no3 concentrations were identified using pca to further detect key independent factors from seven variables parameters the key independent factor is a set of values that called principle components pc converted from a set of observation in orthogonal transformation of statistical procedure they are wo principal components pc1 and pc2 with eigen values 1 explained 70 19 of the total variance for the shallow groundwater data and explained 75 38 for the deep groundwater data as shown in table 2 the pc1 had strong positive correlation 0 80 between ig gdp pd pp and bua while weak positive 0 30 and strong negative 0 80 correlations between cf and ga respectively the ig gdp pd pp bua and ga had strong correlations indicating that primary industrial and population growth was the primary driving force the ig and gdp indices reflect industrial development meanwhile the pd pp bua and ga indices reflect urbanization or population growth pc1 therefore indicated that anthropogenic activities are the main driving forces for groundwater no3 contamination in the study area this result is similar with the pca that was examined by zhang et al 2015 in southern china that the main driving force is the population growth pc2 explained 19 01 of the total variance for the shallow groundwater and 14 18 for the deep groundwater show strong positive 0 80 correlation between only the cf the cf reflects chemical fertilizer use pc2 therefore indicated that is the secondary driving force of groundwater no3 contamination notably the pca results for shallow and deep younger groundwater were similar meaning that the same driving forces are very important for both shallow and deep groundwater addressing these driving forces should be important to develop means controlling the current no3 contamination in the basin 6 conclusions with the aim to understand the status and primal causes of no3 contamination of the groundwater in the bandung basin isotopic fingerprinting δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 method was applied with combined dataset of groundwater residence time and socioeconomic parameter archive the dissolved no3 concentrations in the bandung basin do not exceed the maximum concentrations specified by the world health organization for both shallow unconfined and deep confined aquifers our results however demonstrate that these concentrations are increasing with time due primary to wastewater leakage in urban areas closely linked with populations and industrial activities increase and secondary to increasing application of chemical fertilizers in rural area these contaminants are transported from shallow aquifers toward uncontaminated deep confined aquifer triggered by vertical groundwater depression accelerated by excess pumping in the urban center it is clear that rapid urbanization in bandung city enhances no3 concentrations in multiple step and this study illustrates how urban groundwater deteriorates its water quality we are lacking the presentation of ammonium loading in this study which should be important to further address nevertheless our trial can propose the importance on the use of hydrochemistry data in combination with groundwater residence time and socioeconomic parameters information from our study is important as a base for protections and preservations of groundwater contaminations appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article appendix 1 data for chemical and isotope ratios of the groundwater samples from shallow and deep aquifers of bandung basin appendix 1 appendix 2 data for the nitrate concentrations and socioeconomic parameters used in this study appendix 2 appendix a supplementary

19202,number of populations industry and economic activities in indonesia are growing rapidly and these impacts on natural environments raise awareness about water quality issue over the country bandung basin one of the most growing rapidity urban areas in indonesia was assessed for no3 contamination in groundwater systems and its controlling factors and driving mechanisms were investigated with the aim to demonstrate novelty on the use of combination of parameters of stable isotope ratios in nitrate δ15n and δ18o in no3 groundwater age using cfc 12 age tracer and socioeconomic parameters land use population and economic database groundwater no3 concentrations at present time did not exceed hwo limit for all the analyzed samples 3 00 mg l in average with maximum value of 20 69 mg l n 102 dual stable isotopic analysis together with cfc 12 groundwater age determination suggest that anthropogenic activities are the major causes for increasing no3 concentrations in groundwater those activities under respective land use are industrial and domestic wastes for urban areas and chemical fertilizers for paddy and plantations areas in general shallow unconfined aquifer is more vulnerable to no3 contamination compared with deep confined aquifer because denitrification partly occurs in deep anoxic aquifer and this led attenuation of no3 pollution in groundwater flowing however it seems likely at groundwater depression cones in urban areas that more concentrated waters are transported from shallow aquifer into deep aquifer system through downward vertical fluxes due to excessive pumping principal component analysis pca on no3 concentrations with socioeconomic parameters indicated that industrial and population growths are the main factors related to groundwater no3 contamination this result corresponds to cfc age dating which shows younger more recently recharged groundwaters as being more contaminated than older ones do our study implies that no3 contamination in this area may become more severe in future with a lack of necessary controls and treatment for human induced nitrogen sources proposed approach is useful to understand how the no3 contaminant behaves in large basin aquifer system under urban environments and might be applicable in other developing regions too because increasing populations may be associated with increasing nitrogen loadings graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater nitrate contamination cfc age dating principal component analysis developing region bandung basin 1 introduction increase of dissolved nitrate no3 in aquatic system is now a widespread concern and a particularly important ongoing environmental problem foster and chlton 2003 rivett et al 2008 it has been shown in several studies that human activities such as nitrogen fertilizer and animal manure overuse domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and activities that cause increased precipitation of nitrogen compounds are the primary causes of increased no3 concentrations in groundwater e g kendall 1998 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the no3 contamination of groundwater poses risks to human health steffen et al 2015 and can also cause many ecological and environmental problems e g rockstrom et al 2009 li et al 2010 2013 in this regard the world health organization has set an upper no3 concentration limit of 50 mg l for drinking water who 2017 but limit of 10 mg l is used in indonesia where this study was performed permenkes 2017 comprehensive studies on determination of no3 sources and pathways in subsurface environments have initially been performed in europe and north america referred to as western countries using multiple isotope tracers δ15nno3 with other isotope ratios of the elements such as δ11b δ18ono3 δ13c dic δ34sso4 2 and δ18oso4 2 böttcher et al 1990 böhlke and denver 1995 wassenaar 1995 aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 widory et al 2004 2005 singleton et al 2007 otero et al 2009 and successfully applied by followed studies in many part of the worlds including asian region liu et al 2006 umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2009a 2010 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 and references cited previously it has already argued in the previous review on groundwater no3 pollution status among asian megacities umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2011c that presence of the nitrogen form and its attenuation processes depend particularly on in situ hydrogeological setting and controlled by redox condition within aquifer systems not due to the differences in developing stage among the cities however the previous studies have not yet sought deeply the possibility of pollution status transition hara 2006 taniguchi et al 2008 that may be able to identified within particular study site with a set of key information for comparison groundwater age and socioeconomic archives to achieve this attempt nowadays the population in indonesia is growing significantly and it will increase progressively in the next quarter century while half the population was already living in urban areas in 2015 this is expected to reach two thirds by 2035 by 2035 90 per cent of those living in java island will be urban dwellers this massive urban population will concentrate in the twin mega urban regions jakarta and bandung jones 2010 it is therefore that the bandung basin is one of ideal study target area to assess how such rapid urbanization effects on subsurface environments in order to reconstruct historical trend of the groundwater no3 contamination groundwater residence time determining from cfcs and fs6 age tracers busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 can be used as a time marker together with no3 concentration of the same water hypothesized that contaminants were infiltered in recharge time and transported along the groundwater flows in aquifer systems in fact this concept has successfully been applied in small scale catchment e g gooddy et al 2006 and to other target material transportations ako et al 2013 ide et al 2018 although much applications have not seen for regional groundwater flow systems moreover age constraint groundwater can be used to further discuss a tendency and driving force of contamination in comparison with socioeconomic parameters available motivated from current observations on increase in nitrogen loadings singh et al 1995 kumar 2013 associated with population increases in large asian cities it is worth to test if proposed approach will be applicable to our study area in indonesia there are several areas where groundwater no3 concentrations exceed the world health organization limit umezawa et al 2008 kagabu et al 2010 hosono et al 2009a 2009b 2009c 2011a b c on the shallow groundwater in jakarta groundwater samples collected near dry agricultural fields area displayed no3 contamination that is sourced from the agricultural activities and were more largely attributed to wastewaters from domestic leakage near city area umezawa et al 2008 kagabu et al 2010 hosono et al 2011a b c in jogjakarta it was reported that the no3 concentrations in groundwater range from 0 09 to 74 80 mg l n 43 and identified the highest anomaly of the presence of fecal coli bacteria in shallow groundwater under the urban areas souvannachith et al 2017 however there are no comprehensive publications reporting groundwater no3 contamination in bandung basin this paper is the first comprehensive study reporting no3 contamination of groundwater in bandung basin that treads for both shallow unconfined and deep confined aquifers first the current no3 contamination status will be assessed and compared with land use type to put constraint on their source then the source of contaminations will be further discussed in detail with combination dataset of dual isotope ratios δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 multiple chemical components major ions and field measurements and chlorofluorocarbon 12 cfc 12 ages finally the relationships between no3 concentrations and socioeconomic parameters will be compared to test if there would detect the relationships between no3 concentrations in groundwater and socioeconomic development parameters the results and proposed approach could be a base for understand the ways of mitigating no3 contamination in the near future 2 study area the bandung basin is situated in the center of west java indonesia fig 1 bandung is the capital of west java province which is the most densely populated province in indonesia and the center of the indonesian textile industry the bandung basin covers about 2300 km2 and has five administrative areas and a current population of more than 7 million the basin is an intramontane basin consisting of late tertiary and quaternary volcanic deposits and is surrounded by mountains up to 2400 m high the mean annual temperature in the basin is about 23 7 c the annual precipitation is from 1500 to 2500 mm year and the potential evapotranspiration is 1606 mm year nurliana 2009 this basin has two seasons the dry season for during april to august and the wet season for during september to march with a peak rainfall usually occurs in january throughout the region iwaco waseco 1990 the surface land of the bandung basin is mostly in three land use fig 1 urban including industrial activities paddy fields and plantation areas the urban areas have expanded rapidly since the 1970s as the population and industrial sector have grown wagner and sukrisno 1998 land use patterns in the bandung basin have been changing for decades for instance many of the lands for cultivations plantation areas and paddies have shifted to urban and industrial areas permana and wijaya 2017 in 2015 proportions for each land use in total basin are paddy fields 33 11 urban areas 28 34 plantation areas 16 16 forests 12 36 reservoirs and rivers 10 02 the three main land uses paddy fields urban areas and plantation areas and their surrounding environments will be studied here these land uses are from higher to lower elevations plantation areas dominated by tea and coffee plantation urban areas residential area office buildings and industrial complexes and paddy rice growing fields from a hydrostratigraphical viewpoint the bandung basin can be divided into two groundwater systems a shallow groundwater system and a deep groundwater system the most recent study of the groundwater flow system of the bandung basin was done by sunarwan 2014 using descriptions of cuttings drilling well logs resistivity logs major ions and stable isotopes hydrostratigrapically the bandung basin can be divided into two main systems of aquifer an unconfined and confined aquifer the unconfined aquifer is composed of three facieses sandy tuff clayey sand and silty clay in this study the groundwater in this aquifer is called shallow groundwater this water can be accessed via dug wells with a depth of 10 20 m meanwhile the confined aquifer is alteration layer composed of tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous breccia which contains deep groundwater this water is obtained from borehole wells with a depth of 80 150 m spring waters are distributed in mountain slope 3 methodology spring and groundwater samples were collected over bandung basin fig 1 during the dry season from may to july in 2015 under the assumption that samples are least affected by dilution processes from precipitations and would sustain highest solute concentrations during a year in total of 10 of spring waters were collected from the mountainous foots where plantation areas widely distribute we obtained these samples as hypothesized these waters are affected by agricultural activities fig 1a 28 shallow groundwater samples were collected from dug wells at different land uses urban areas and paddy fields as to be able to put a constraint regarding possible source of nitrate contaminations fig 1a the access to obtain shallow groundwater was limited in paddy fields and we have collected only few representative samples from dug wells appendix 1 66 deep groundwater samples were obtained both from drilled wells mostly from private wells and observation wells government monitoring well in the bandung basin most of data for field measurement major ion concentrations cfc 12 concentrations and stable isotope ratios of nitrogen δ15nno3 and oxygen δ18ono3 in no3 were supplied partly in previous reported papers with analytical procedures taufiq et al 2018a 2018b summary of results and a set of complete data are provided in table 1 and appendix 1 respectively briefly field measurements were monitored continually using a portable meter d 54 horiba japan and the concentrations of the major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl and nitrogenous nutrients no3 no2 and nh4 were determined using an ion chromatograph compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland respectively chlorofluorocarbons cfcs concentrations were determined using a closed system purge and trap gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan but in this study only the cfc 12 concentration was used as a marker of young groundwater to calculate apparent groundwater residence time appendix 1 because cfc 12 is relatively stable in the subsurface environment than other compounds plummer et al 1998 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were determined applying the denitrifier method presented by sigman et al 2001 and casciotti et al 2002 followed laboratory routine in the kumamoto university hosono et al 2013 2014 the analytical precisions for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively in this study the no3 concentrations in spring and shallow ground waters will be assessed taking the type of land uses into accounts as has been previously demonstrated for its effectiveness lockhart et al 2013 qin et al 2013 in contrast direct contributions of pollutants from just above surface lands seem to be unlikely for deep groundwater with longer lateral flow paths considering regional groundwater flow dynamics except in an area of depression zones taufiq et al 2018a 2018b in this regard the deep groundwater could be classified mainly into two types older groundwater the groundwater with cfc 12 concentrations undetectable and recharge periods estimated as to be before 1950 and younger groundwater the groundwater with cfc 12 concentrations detectable and recharge periods estimated as to be after 1950 appendix 1 socioeconomic data for the basin for the period from 1953 to 1991 were compiled and used in the study the annual data of the bandung basin were taken from book of west java province bps 2016 and were compiled in appendix 2 such as permanent population pp in number of people population density pd in people km2 average monthly gross domestic product gdp in indonesian rupiah idr industrial growth ig in number of industries built up urban areas bua in ha green areas of agriculture plantation and forests ga in ha and amount of use of chemical fertilizers cf in ton this period is somehow matching to groundwater age determined by cfc 12 concentration from 1953 to 1991 taufiq et al 2018a see appendix 1 an understanding of the mechanisms controlling the current no3 groundwater contamination status was gained by performing several statistical analyses using spss version 23 0 software spss il usa differences in no3 concentrations in groundwater from areas with different land uses were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and the mann whitney u test the degrees to which groundwater no3 concentrations and socioeconomic parameters were associated were determined by performing regression analyses the main mechanisms driving groundwater no3 concentrations were identified by performing principle component analysis pca 4 results 4 1 concentrations for dissolved inorganic nitrogen among three different forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen no3 no2 and nh4 no3 and nh4 consist of the major forms of nitrogen compounds in the studied groundwaters but no2 is less important as its concentration is very low ranging from 1 52 μmol to 1 09 μmol for shallow and deep groundwater respectively table 1 and appendix 1 concentrations of no3 and nh4 vary 333 71 μmol and 260 53 μmol for shallow groundwater and 106 29 μmol and 152 44 μmol for deep groundwater respectively for shallow groundwater no3 concentrations tend to increase with decreasing of nh4 concentrations and vice versa appendix 1 suggesting input sources of nitrogen partly stay as being ammonium ion form but not be nitrified probably due to the presence of anoxic conditions similar phenomenon as identified in other asian aquifer systems umezawa et al 2008 such tendency is less obvious for deep groundwater appendix 1 probably because of the mixing of shallow and deep groundwater taufiq et al 2018a 2018b as partly discussed later concentrations of nh4 are comparable to those of no3 and undoubtfully important to discuss for their sources and fates however this paper focus on no3 concentrations since nitrogen in nitrate form is threat for human health there are more groundwaters in shallow aquifer with higher no3 concentrations than the deep groundwater figs 2 and 3 the no3 concentrations are from detection limit to 20 69 mg l for all studied groundwaters and do not exceed the world health organization limit of 50 mg l in any sample but exceed the indonesian standard 10 mg l s3 s6 s30 in some samples although the current no3 concentrations seem to be acceptable the concentrations are likely to increase with time fig 4 and threaten drinking water supplies in the future this will be discussed in section 5 2 the effects of human activities on groundwater contamination were investigated further by comparing the no3 concentrations in the shallow groundwater by different land uses the mean of no3 concentrations in different land uses were different but the differences were not significant p 0 05 except in urban area higher mean no3 concentration 5 04 4 68 mg l was observed for the urban areas compared for plantation areas 3 39 1 94 mg l and paddy fields 3 36 1 94 mg l the mean no3 concentrations for older and younger groundwater were 2 42 1 92 mg l and 1 69 1 49 mg l respectively these concentrations are lower than shallow groundwater 4 2 stable isotope ratios of nitrate the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were determined to allow possible sources of dissolved nitrate no3 analytical results are summarized in table 1 and all data are supplied in appendix 1 and compositional relationships between δ15nno3 and no3 concentrations and dual isotope ratios are plotted in figs 5 and 6 for shallow and deep groundwater respectively overall either shallow or deep groundwater show wide compositional ranges figs 5b and 6b from 5 to 50 for δ15nno3 and from 10 to 40 for δ18ono3 suggesting variabilities in their source characteristics and occurrences of microbiological reactions majority of samples both shallow and deep groundwaters show dissolved oxygen concentrations more than 2 0 mg l fig 2c and d and only 3 samples showed the value less than 2 0 mg l it is generally accepted that nitrate microbial reduction could occur under anoxic condition typically dissolved oxygen concentrations 2 0 mg l hosono et al 2013 and references therein in fact decline of no3 concentrations seems not to be associated with increasing in δ15nno3 fig 5a and b while no3 concentrations rather tend to increase with increasing in δ15nno3 for the samples with its value 20 implying the samples may inherit dual isotopic compositions as indicating their source characteristics except ones have elevated δ15nno3 values 20 for shallow groundwater the samples from plantation areas tend to have lower δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions compared to those from urban areas and paddy field fig 5b source of no3 n in groundwaters could be estimated from their isotopic compositions together with land use constraint chemical fertilizers for plantation areas septic waste for urban areas and manure and or septic waste for paddy fields in rural area details are discussed in later part for deep groundwater majority of younger groundwater recharge age after 1950 shows isotopic compositions fig 5b those indicate a source mixture among chemical fertilizers septic waste and manures implying multiple pathways of nitrate transportations on the contrary older groundwater tend to show more elevated δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions than younger groundwater fig 5b partly reflecting the occurrence of denitrification along groundwater flows with longer paths for the samples with δ15nno3 values 20 other samples show distinct isotopic compositions from 10 to 20 for both isotope ratios δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 perhaps indicating nitrogen source from septic waste or application of manure in agriculture but this is not clear because there are no favorite conditions that may support this scenario from other aspects such as sociological background 4 3 nitrate concentrations and socioeconomic development as explained earlier deep groundwater could be divided into two younger groundwater recharged after the year 1950 and older groundwater recharged before the year 1950 therefore no3 contaminations of age dated younger groundwater can compare with time serious of the socioeconomic parameters appendix 2 similarly the cfc 12 concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples covered a wide range from 12 2 to 540 8 pptv and recharge ages were estimated for these groundwaters that range from 1953 to 1991 appendix 1 the no3 contaminations of these shallow groundwaters can also be used for comparison with socioeconomic parameters appendix 2 by obtaining time series of both groundwater recharge age and socioeconomic parameters groundwater no3 contaminations at known recharge time can be compared with socioeconomic data of the same year fig 7 then the relationships between the groundwater no3 concentrations and annual data of several socioeconomic parameters were analyzed by performing regression analyses the increases of no3 concentrations in both shallow and deep younger groundwaters are weakly correlated p 0 01 with increase of permanent population in number of people pp population density in people km2 pd average monthly gross domestic product in idr gdp industrial growth in number of industries ig built up urban areas in ha bua and amount of use of chemical fertilizers in ton cf but with decrease of green areas of agriculture plantation and forests in ha ga 5 discussion at present no3 contamination in groundwater does not appear to threaten human health in the study area however it is still essential to gain an understanding of the factors that control and the mechanisms that drive the no3 concentrations in groundwater to allow measures to be taken to prevent contamination in the area becoming more severe 5 1 factors controlling nitrate contamination 5 1 1 source of nitrate contamination for shallow unconfined groundwater it has been previously investigated that nitrogen loads from the surface of particular land uses imprint their sources in groundwaters lockhart et al 2013 qin et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 thus descriptions for land uses are important to study the no3 contamination in groundwater system the controlling factors of no3 contaminations in groundwaters were identified by assessing isotopic fingerprinting together with land uses analysis because no3 enters subsurface system through several pathways that depend strongly on the type of land uses elevated no3 concentrations in groundwaters spring waters triangle symbol in fig 2a from plantation areas would be transported from vegetable and livestock farms which are distributed around the periphery of the basin these concentrations tend to decrease with increase in δ15nno3 fig 5a and this tendency may be explained by the occurrence of denitrification kendall 1998 however all groundwater samples from the plantation areas showed dissolved oxygen concentrations 6 mg l fig 2b it is commonly assumed that denitrification will not occur at such dissolved oxygen concentrations spalding and exner 1993 mccallum et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 and thus occurrence of denitrification is unlikely for nitrate dissolved in these waters from isotopic fingerprinting evidence fig 5b it can be concluded that no3 n in groundwaters from plantation areas is attributed to applications of chemical fertilizers böhlke and denver 1995 it is commonly understood that leakage of sewage waters from sewage pits or pipes are important factors affecting groundwater recharge and nutrient contamination in urban areas lerner 2002 wakida and lerner 2005 this may contribute to shallow groundwater in urban areas of the bandung basin as well as partly suggested by previous report nurliana 2009 most parts of the urban areas are underlain by poorly porous fine clay in old lake deposits and overlain by asphalt this may lead subsurface condition to be anoxic favoring denitrification relative to the subsurface in the volcanic fan this scenario could partly be applied for the groundwaters with high δ15nno3 20 but low to moderate no3 concentrations fig 5a however the effect of denitrification looks sporadic because there is no clear negative trend between the concentrations and δ15nno3 values fig 5a and most of the groundwaters are characterized by do 2 0 mg l it is therefore reasonable from isotopic comparison fig 5b to think that no3 in shallow groundwater in urban areas is the dominant nutrient released from domestic wastewater and that denitrification may remove no3 but just too some extent it is interest to further describe that the groundwaters where near to sewage treatment plants in industrial complexes such as at points s3 and s6 in the cmhi area and s30 in the rck area see fig 1 contain relatively high no3 10 mg l treated wastewaters at these points may directly infiltrate the shallow groundwater from the leakage pathways it has recently been reported that inappropriate on site sanitation is becoming an issue for an environmental degradation at all big cities of indonesia safitri et al 2010 for instance fecal coli bacteria are detected in shallow groundwater in jogjakarta souvannachith et al 2017 it seems to be reasonable to conclude that the no3 in groundwater in this area is partly supplied by wastewater derived from sewage and partly by industrial wastewater the concentrations of nitrogen compounds at the atmosphere in southeast asia including indonesia have increased because of human activities that could supply no3 in rainwater that could enter the shallow groundwater in urban areas boring et al 1988 streets et al 2001 2003 some of the water samples from the urban areas e g at site s12 see fig 5 had particularly high δ18ono3 value 33 10 suggesting the contribution of atmospheric no3 the contributions of atmospheric deposition may partly elevate no3 concentrations in surface and subsurface water campbell et al 2002 in limited areas in the bandung basin the paddy fields are widely distributed in the center of the basin fig 2 the do concentrations in this area are no less than 2 mg l fig 2b at which condition denitrification will not commonly occur spalding and exner 1993 cey et al 1999 mccallum et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 however very high δ15nno3 value observed for one sample site s24 see fig 5 strongly suggest the occurrence of denitrification in fact the paddy fields are in the lowlands in the basin center and are often water saturated so the groundwater will be in a reducing environment that will favor denitrification the denitrification may therefore be able to occur in the paddy fields but the number of the samples 4 samples see fig 5 is too small expanding this aspect as for general conclusion as mentioned in result section rest of 3 samples show isotopically distinct as these sources corresponding to manures and septic wastes but not as originated of chemical fertilizers fig 5b therefore it could be possible that nitrogen was derived from wastewater infiltering from wastewater pits in rural houses umezawa et al 2008 hosono et al 2011b alternatively an effect of application of manure to paddy should be considered in fact paddy fields in indonesia using organic management system i e only manure being applied cover only 0 09 of whole paddy fields in 2003 takada et al 2004 umezawa et al 2008 and synthetic fertilizers are major applied fertilizers thus the possibility of no3 contaminations due to the application of manure is unlikely and leaking of wastewaters are the most probable cause of elevated no3 concentrations although the effects of the use of chemical fertilizers and subsequent denitrification could not completely be eliminated nevertheless difference in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 compositions between the groundwaters from plantation areas and paddy fields may suggest the difference in their source characteristics 5 1 2 source of nitrate and its attenuation processes for deep confined groundwater the source of no3 n contaminations and their attenuation processes including deep confined aquifer system are assessed along the groundwater flow systems in bandung basin taufiq et al 2018a using hydrogeological cross section cc fig 8 in recharge area described as zone a in fig 8 the no3 concentrations in shallow groundwaters spring waters are somewhat elevated due to agricultural activities in plantation areas we have discussed it in previous section the no3 concentrations decreased in both shallow and deep groundwaters without increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values at the entrance of basin aquifer system zone b in fig 8 suggesting it might be caused of dispersion and or dilution by infiltrating water in the recharge area but not through denitrification the no3 concentrations then increased as groundwater flows under cmhi groundwater depression area taufiq et al 2018a b for both deep and shallow aquifers with simultaneous increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values especially for deep groundwater fig 8 isotopic compositions for this elevated δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values are corresponding to those for manure and septic wastes fig 6 redox condition under cmhi area is not anoxic as denitrification favorably occurs fig 8 previous studies assessing groundwater mixing between shallow and deep groundwater revealed that shallow waters with contaminant materials are increasingly mixed into deep unpolluted groundwater with time enhancing groundwater contaminations due to excess pumping by the rapid urbanization taufiq et al 2018a 2018b from these observations with flow constrained by previous studies it could be reasonably concludes that nitrate concentrations in deep groundwater increased under cmhi area by increasing mixing of surface contaminants such as urban and septic wastes the no3 concentration in the deep groundwater sustains in the same level after the groundwater flows out of cmhi depression area but the redox condition turned to somewhat anoxic condition as documented previously fig 8 taufiq et al 2018a b the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values for the deep groundwater tended to increase over 20 in the end of topographical slope in the entrance of basin plain fig 8 indicating the occurrence of denitrification particularly at such specific area this tendency can be confirmed in dual isotopic composition diagram fig 6b as some of deep groundwater samples are plotted along denitrification trend in the end of flow the deep groundwaters come under another depression area dhyk area fig 8 interestingly the redox condition turned to more oxic even under stagnant flow regime as anoxic condition might apparently be presented the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values under dhyk area showed similar compositional range found in groundwater under cmhi depression area fig 8 in fact the occurrence of similar groundwater mixing as stated for cmhi area has been argued in the previous studies for dhyk depression area too taufiq et al 2018a 2018b thus similar scenario enhancing no3 contaminations from surface contaminants of urban and septic wastes by groundwater mixing due to excess pumping could be applied for explanation of observed no3 contaminations under this depression area 5 2 mechanisms driving nitrate contamination of groundwater 5 2 1 nitrate concentrations versus regional socioeconomic development it is important to identify the mechanisms driving no3 contamination to help develop ways of regulating groundwater no3 contamination the relationships between the no3 concentrations and socioeconomic development parameters and groundwater age were assessed here we will discuss more deeply for previously mentioned results positive correlation p 0 01 between no3 concentrations and pd pp bua gdp ig and cf and negative correlation p 0 01 between same concentrations and ga fig 7 higher urbanization levels indicated by pp and pd appear to be causing large amounts of domestic wastewater into the aquatic environment resulting in increase in nitrogen concentrations in groundwater bilsborough and mann 2006 stated that the per capita supply of nitrogen in human excreta will be stable because the basic protein requirement of humans is stable it was therefore expected that no3 concentration in groundwater would strongly correlate with the pd if the nitrogen removal reactions could be neglected such as denitrification the positive correlations p 0 01 were found between the no3 concentration in groundwaters and the bua but the negative correlations were found between the no3 concentration and the ga for both shallow and deep aquifers the bua and ga are indices that reflect the degree of urbanization the larger the built up area bua or the less of the green area ga link to the larger population therefore it could be accommodated that the more potential for these domestic wastewater productions enhances no3 contamination in groundwater a similar positive correlations p 0 01 were found between the no3 concentration in groundwater and the gdp and ig too this is quite reasonable because the economy of the bandung basin area is somehow reliant on industrial activity relatively large amounts of industrial wastewater may be released from industrial plants and this may cause the no3 concentrations in groundwater to be relatively high it has been argued that shallow groundwater is heavily contaminated close to industrial complexes and argued that huge amounts of untreated industrial wastewater will have directly drained into nearby rivers and may have infiltrated into the groundwater rosadi 2004 the argument was also supported by rivers close to industrial complexes being strongly contaminated with industrial wastewater tohir 2004 that can infiltrate shallow groundwater because of the influent relationships between rivers and shallow aquifers lubis and puradimaja 2005 these observations correspond to our results showing the no3 concentrations in the groundwater were higher in the industrial areas than elsewhere in the study area the no3 concentration in groundwater are correlated p 0 01 with the cf as well indicating that increasing in leaching of nitrogen from chemical fertilizers in plantation areas as a factor of the amounts of applicated fertilizers agricultural activities in plantation areas and possibly in paddy fields may act as non point sources of no3 to groundwater in addition to domestic and industrial wastewater point sources overall it can be summarized that all relationships for both shallow and deep younger groundwater somehow followed the same trends this may support the scenario that the deep groundwater is affected by the shallow groundwater because of vertical fluxes from the shallow to the deep groundwater taufiq et al 2018a 2018b observed correlations were not high probably because of the several complex reasons such as lacking of the considerations for denitrification effects and influence of other nitrogen compounds especially for ammonium nevertheless our trial can shed a light on the effective use of socioeconomic parameters combined with hydrochemistry data of the regional groundwater 5 2 2 driving force for nitrate contamination of the groundwater the main factors driving the groundwater no3 concentrations were identified using pca to further detect key independent factors from seven variables parameters the key independent factor is a set of values that called principle components pc converted from a set of observation in orthogonal transformation of statistical procedure they are wo principal components pc1 and pc2 with eigen values 1 explained 70 19 of the total variance for the shallow groundwater data and explained 75 38 for the deep groundwater data as shown in table 2 the pc1 had strong positive correlation 0 80 between ig gdp pd pp and bua while weak positive 0 30 and strong negative 0 80 correlations between cf and ga respectively the ig gdp pd pp bua and ga had strong correlations indicating that primary industrial and population growth was the primary driving force the ig and gdp indices reflect industrial development meanwhile the pd pp bua and ga indices reflect urbanization or population growth pc1 therefore indicated that anthropogenic activities are the main driving forces for groundwater no3 contamination in the study area this result is similar with the pca that was examined by zhang et al 2015 in southern china that the main driving force is the population growth pc2 explained 19 01 of the total variance for the shallow groundwater and 14 18 for the deep groundwater show strong positive 0 80 correlation between only the cf the cf reflects chemical fertilizer use pc2 therefore indicated that is the secondary driving force of groundwater no3 contamination notably the pca results for shallow and deep younger groundwater were similar meaning that the same driving forces are very important for both shallow and deep groundwater addressing these driving forces should be important to develop means controlling the current no3 contamination in the basin 6 conclusions with the aim to understand the status and primal causes of no3 contamination of the groundwater in the bandung basin isotopic fingerprinting δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 method was applied with combined dataset of groundwater residence time and socioeconomic parameter archive the dissolved no3 concentrations in the bandung basin do not exceed the maximum concentrations specified by the world health organization for both shallow unconfined and deep confined aquifers our results however demonstrate that these concentrations are increasing with time due primary to wastewater leakage in urban areas closely linked with populations and industrial activities increase and secondary to increasing application of chemical fertilizers in rural area these contaminants are transported from shallow aquifers toward uncontaminated deep confined aquifer triggered by vertical groundwater depression accelerated by excess pumping in the urban center it is clear that rapid urbanization in bandung city enhances no3 concentrations in multiple step and this study illustrates how urban groundwater deteriorates its water quality we are lacking the presentation of ammonium loading in this study which should be important to further address nevertheless our trial can propose the importance on the use of hydrochemistry data in combination with groundwater residence time and socioeconomic parameters information from our study is important as a base for protections and preservations of groundwater contaminations appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article appendix 1 data for chemical and isotope ratios of the groundwater

19203,as potable reuse guidelines and regulations continue to develop the presence of n nitrosamines is a primary concern because of their associated health concerns in this study bench pilot and full scale tests were conducted to focus on the occurrence and treatment of n nitrosomorpholine nmor in united states u s potable reuse systems out of twelve u s wastewater effluents collected ambient nmor was detected in eleven average 20 18 ng l in contrast only two of the thirteen surface water and stormwater samples had nmor across all of these samples maximum formation potential by chloramination produced an average increase of 3 6 1 8 ng l this result underscores the need to understand the sources of nmor as it is not likely a disinfection byproduct and it is not known to be commercially produced within the u s at the pilot scale three potable reuse systems were evaluated for ambient nmor with oxidation i e chlorination and ozonation biofiltration and granular activated carbon gac both pre oxidation and biofiltration were ineffective at mitigating nmor during long term pilot plant operation at least eight months gac adsorbers were the only pilot scale treatment to remove nmor however complete breakthrough occurred rapidly from 2000 to 10 000 bed volumes for comparison a full scale reverse osmosis ro potable reuse system was monitored for a year and confirmed that ro effectively removes nmor systematic bench scale uv advanced oxidation experiments were undertaken to assess the mitigation potential for nmor at a fluence dose of 325 10 mj cm2 uv alone degraded 90 of the nmor present the addition of 5 mg l hydrogen peroxide did not significantly decrease the uv dose required for one log removal these data illustrate that efficient nmor removal from potable reuse systems is limited to ro or uv treatment keywords n nitrosomorpholine potable reuse advanced treatment ozonation biological activated carbon granular activated carbon reverse osmosis uv photolysis 1 introduction recent drought conditions and water shortages have led many drinking water utilities to consider or fully incorporate alternative water supplies such as stormwaters eutrophic waters and advanced treated wastewaters nrc 2012 in these alternative supplies there is an increased risk that trace organic contaminants such as n nitrosamines and their precursors will be present nrc 2012 n nitrosamines are a class of compounds associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic activity when ingested via drinking water u s epa 2017 much of previous work has been dedicated to understanding the formation behavior and mitigation of a specific species n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as it is the most commonly detected species in drinking water systems russell et al 2012 woods et al 2015 and subject to a 10 ng l notification level and guideline in california and massachusetts respectively cdph 2013 massdep 2004 however another n nitrosamine of concern n nitrosomorpholine nmor has received less attention chronic oral exposure of animals to nmor has been shown to result in damages and tumors in the liver and kidneys toxnet 2017 although the united states u s does not currently have regulations guidelines or notification levels for nmor germany has recommended a drinking water guideline of 10 ng l planas et al 2008 and australia has set their drinking water reuse guideline at 1 ng l nhmrc 2008 nmor has been detected as a trace organic compound in an array of waters including wastewaters river waters seawaters and drinking water treatment plant effluents ma et al 2012 bei et al 2016 lee and oh 2016 gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016a 2016b the highest concentrations have been reported in wastewaters with values up to a max of 12 7 μg l krasner et al 2009 but more typical concentrations are in the tens of ng l gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016a 2016b lee and oh 2016 industrially impacted wastewaters have been found to contain significantly higher concentrations of nmor as compared to municipal wastewaters lee and oh 2016 however purely domestic wastewaters have also been found to contain nmor zeng and mitch 2015 drinking water detections have been limited particularly in the us and canada where median values were typically less than 10 ng l woods et al 2015 but concentrations up to 40 ng l were detected in chinese drinking waters and river waters drinking water sources bei et al 2016 nmor detections in drinking water river water and seawater have all been attributed to nearby wastewater discharges or industrial releases nmor has also been characterized as a disinfection byproduct dbp forming from the reaction of the secondary amine morpholine mor and monochloramine at a molar yield of 0 01 or dichloramine at a molar yield of 1 schreibier and mitch 2006 unlike ndma which has numerous chloramine precursors krasner et al 2013 no other nmor precursors have been identified household products potentially containing mor as an impurity include laundry detergents dishwashing soaps and textiles njdep 2009 industrial applications with mor include the production of pharmaceuticals dyes optical brighteners waxes resins for food and paper coatings polishes rubber processing chemicals and corrosion inhibitors for boiling waters njdep 2009 the mor backbone is also used in the production of ionic liquids which are organic salts used as green replacements for volatile organic solvents pham et al 2010 concentrations of mor have been reported in surface waters in china turkey and germany with ranges from 0 15 to 2 5 μg l pietsch et al 2001 akyuz and ata 2006 wang et al 2011 ma et al 2012 in each case the detection of mor was attributed to nearby municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and or nearby coal power plants these data would suggest the possibility of nmor formation during chloramination however the evidence has been limited given that both wastewaters and drinking waters exposed to realistic chloramination conditions had limited 10 ng l or no increase in nmor concentrations zeng and mitch 2015 sakai et al 2016 although the nitrosation of mor during chloramination has not been commonly observed nitrosation can occur within the human body food production industrial processing and amine assisted carbon capture originally mor nitrosation was studied in the context of understanding the formation of n nitrosamines in vivo in the presence of nitrates or nitrites this was found to occur via bacterial catalysis at neutral ph in the presence in human tissue and fluids e g saliva or by a nitrosating agent nitrosium ion n2o3 at low ph optimally 3 4 in the digestive tract e g stomach mirvish 1975 tannenbaum et al 1978 calmels et al 1988 engemann et al 2013 however humans do not excrete detectable levels of nmor krauss et al 2009 zeng and mitch 2015 nmor can also form in the environment or industrial waters through catalytic reactions with anions fluvic acid activated carbon formaldehyde or thiocyanate in the presence of a nitrosating species fan and tannenbaum 1973 keefer and roller 1973 padhye et al 2010 outputs from coal power plants can potentially contaminant surface water or ground waters with nmor poste et al 2014 through the formation of gaseous nitrogen oxides nox which produce the nitrosating agents n2o3 and n2o4 during amine assisted carbon capture chandan et al 2013 dai and mitch 2013 fine et al 2014 once nmor enters drinking water or wastewater treatment it is difficult to remove due to its physicochemical properties i e chemical stability low molecular weight and high solubility in conventional wastewater treatment processes it is more recalcitrant than other n nitrosamines with primary clarification biological treatment activated sludge and sand filtration removing 25 25 50 and 30 respectively krauss et al 2009 the mor backbone is difficult for microorganisms to biodegrade an electrophilic ring with n and o which limits the efficacy of biological wastewater treatment pietsch et al 2001 pitoi et al 2011 pre treatments such as ozonation similarly do not produce significant degradation under typical conditions hollender et al 2009 efficient removal of nmor has been limited to full advanced treatment facilities with ro acting as a barrier for nmor fujioka et al 2013 in cases where nmor was detected in ro effluents post processing with uv aop resulted in degradation to below the detection limit zeng et al 2016b in this paper we attempt to further understand the behavior of nmor in potable reuse by analyzing data from bench scale experiments three pilot scale potable reuse scenarios and one full scale potable reuse treatment facility an analysis of nmor presence and oxidation under chloramination and ozonation from zeng et al 2016a was examined for a range of potential drinking water treatment sources including wastewater effluents surface waters and stormwater runoff in addition three pilot scale advanced treatment systems were monitored to evaluate the impact of oxidation chlorination ozonation biologically active filtration with anthracite and activated carbon media and granular activated carbon gac on the presence of nmor one full scale advanced train with microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was sampled but the uv h2o2 efficiency was unable to be evaluated due to removal by ro therefore bench scale uv h2o2 experiments were undertaken to assess the photochemical degradation of nmor 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water sample collection details of sample collection methods and materials are published in zeng et al 2016a nmor data presented as a part of this study includes aggregated data from treated wastewaters and surface waters the treated wastewaters were collected from various locations within the u s and included conventionally treated nutrient removal and domestic and industrial impacted sites to capture a range of possible effluents types n 12 table s1 supporting information si the surface water samples included dry and wet weather runoff algal bloom waters pristine reservoirs without human impact and drinking water treatment plant reservoirs n 13 surface waters were characterized as pristine sw1 sw4 wastewater impacted sw5 sw9 and stormwater runoff sw10 sw13 sucralose was used as a proxy for municipal wastewater

condensate and washing cars or watering lawns and during a storm event sw10 sw12 was collected from a suburban drainage channel and sw13 was rainwater collected directly nmor was quantified under ambient conditions and after chloramine maximum formation potential clm max fp chloramine uniform formation conditions clm ufc and ozonation formation potential in the clm max fp tests samples were dosed with 140 mg l preformed monochloramine solution buffered at ph 7 with 10 mm phosphate buffer and stored for 10 days in the dark clm ufc tests were dosed with 5 mg l preformed monochloramine solution to target a dose of at least 1 mg l total chlorine at the end of 3 days and buffered at ph of 8 with 2 mm borate buffer at the end of each chloramine test 10 mg l of sodium thiosulfate was added to quench the residual in the sample ozone was applied at a ratio of 0 8 mg o3 mg total organic carbon toc and samples were held for 24 h before quantification to ensure the complete degradation

detection of nmor bench pilot and full scale treatment plant samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles and shipped or brought to the snwa on ice to maintain a temperature of 4 c samples were dosed with sodium azide 1 mg l and sodium thiosulfate 80 mg l for preservation and quenching prior to analysis field blank samples were collected and treated as typical samples to confirm that no on site contamination occurred nmor was analyzed following a modified epa method 521 protocol u s epa 2014 holady et al 2012 marti et al 2015 woods et al 2015 briefly an internal standard nmor d8 was spiked into 0 5 l of sample loaded onto coconut shell based activated carbon cartridges and extracted via automated solid phase extraction with dichloromethane dcm the dcm extracts were concentrated under high purity nitrogen gas and analyzed on a varian walnut creek ca cp 3800 gas chromatograph with db 624 column and coupled with a varian 4000 ion trap mass spectrometer set to monitor in positive chemical ionization the method reporting limit mrl for nmor was 5 ng l statistical significance between data sets was determined by t tests with sigmaplot 12 5 software and p values 0 05 were considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 nmor in source waters surface waters characterized as pristine sw1 sw4 a dry weather runoff sample sw11 and a wet weather suburban runoff sample sw12 had no detections of nmor even under clm max fp conditions surface waters impacted by municipal wastewater sw5 sw9 were found to contain nmor only under clm max fp conditions with an average of 8 6 1 8 ng l only two of the surface water samples had detections of nmor under ambient conditions a rainwater sample sw13 8 1 ng l and a wet weather urban runoff sample sw10 17 ng l the urban runoff sample was collected during a first flush runoff event and also contained 20 ng l 25 ng l and 14 ng l under clm ufc clm max fp and ozonation respectively wastewater treatment plants were divided into those with nutrient removal nitrification and denitrification table s1 ww6 ww12 and those treated via cas table s1 ww1 ww5 ambient detections of conventionally treated wastewaters ranged from below the mrl to 57 2 ng l with an average of 24 22 ng l and nutrient removal ranged from below the mrl to 53 ng l with an average of 14 16 ng l the high variability within each group of wastewaters is probably related to the inputs i e industrial vs domestic received lee and oh 2016 saw that the concentration of nmor in wastewater was tied to the level of industrial vs domestic inputs received specifically the rubber dye and textile manufacturing effluents that are known industrial sources of nmor fajen et al 1979 spiegelhalder and preussmann 1983 de vocht et al 2007 of the two wastewater samples found to be below detection both were primarily fed by domestic inputs student housing complex and small town which further supports the trend of industrial impacts leading to the higher concentrations of nmor the average concentration of nmor in nutrient removal sites was lower than that for conventional sites though not significantly p 0 052 across all waters the average decrease due to ozonation 0 8 mg o3 mg toc ratio was 1 2 3 4 ng l or 7 9 2 with the maximum decrease observed in a nutrient removal wastewater 11 ng l or 39 past work has shown similar results zimmermann et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2015 with a maximum of 36 removal at a 1 16 mg o3 mg toc hollender et al 2009 by comparing the concentrations in clm ufc and ambient waters an average increase of 1 5 1 8 ng l was observed which indicates that likely there were no precursors capable of forming nmor under realistic chloramination conditions clm max fp conditions contained an average concentration of 11 6 4 ng l and by using the mrl or ambient concentration the formation ranged from 1 1 to 8 ng l average of 3 4 2 2 ng l if the largest increase in nmor observed in sw10 were to be attributed to the presence of mor the concentration would have been several μg l assuming the molar yields from schreiber and mitch 2006 and a ph of 7 this level is comparable to the concentrations detected in surface waters in past work akyuz and ata 2006 but cannot be confirmed because mor concentrations were not determined in this study it is possible that this first flush runoff water contained mor associated with rubber deposits from tires but in the other samples the mor source is less clear an alternative explanation is that the increases can be attributed to sample variability this is supported by low level ng l increases under clm ufc and clm max fp and the lack of a statistical difference p 0 093 between ambient and chloraminated samples fig 1 the specific source of nmor in wastewaters is not clear given that it is not produced commercially in the u s however mor is a chemical used in a range of household and industrial products within the u s mor is used during the manufacturing of numerous products including pharmaceuticals dyes optical brighteners waxes resins rubber processing chemicals corrosion inhibitors or ionic liquids njdep 2009 it seems likely that mor is nitrosated either during the industrial manufacturing process or once it is released into the environment which would explain the discrepancy between the consistent detection of nmor in wastewaters and the lack of u s based production 3 2 nmor removal by biological filtration in pilot plants a c the presence of nmor released from wastewater treatment plants will significantly influence sites practicing potable reuse if the potable reuse nmor influent concentrations could potentially range from 7 1 to 57 ng l as shown above nmor would need to be removed or degraded by advanced treatment to prevent detection at levels above what is recommended for drinking water under certain guidelines i e 1 ng l or 10 ng l nhmrc 2008 planas et al 2008 ozone combined with biological filtration has been proposed as a viable alternative to ro based treatment in terms of mitigating the presence of trace organic contaminants reungoat et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 to assess the potential of ozone biofiltration gac based treatment three pilot scale plants were examined by combining results from the three pilot plants nmor samples were collected from the full scale anth sand biofilter effluent approximately monthly over a period of 2 years and found at an average of 13 4 6 ng l n 31 however each of the three different pilot plants had slightly different influent concentrations pilot plant a applied a ratio of 0 3 mg o3 mg toc that resulted in a negligible removal of nmor at 3 2 10 n 4 for both pilot plant b and c the mg o3 mg toc ratio was 0 8 which increased the removal to 16 13 n 15 this agrees with the source water results and the limited removal observed during past work zimmermann et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 the chlorination of nmor in pilot plant c also produced negligible degradation average of 1 4 n 11 which is similar to the behavior of other heterocyclic nitrogen containing compounds and ndma dickenson et al 2009 during the year long operation of biofilters a2 and a3 removals averaged 9 8 8 or 1 5 1 3 ng l and 9 10 or 1 3 1 7 ng l respectively fig 2 this limited removal was consistent with and without ozone and the bac did not illustrate signs of acclimation to nmor biofilters b1 b3 were operated without oxidation for 4 months and subsequently aerated for 2 months during this 6 month period nmor removal was negligible in both the bac and anthracite biofilters b1 b3 with averages of 1 7 2 7 and 2 10 respectively the application of ozone during the final 4 months increased these values to 22 1 for b1 18 3 for b2 and 22 3 for b3 however these percentage values represent changes of 2 2 0 38 ng l for b1 p 0 071 1 8 0 5 ng l for b2 p 0 073 and 2 2 0 32 ng l for b3 p 0 24 which were not statistically significant the removal of nmor by biological filtration in the full scale anth sand biofilter is shown in fig 2 along with biofilters a2 a3 and b1 b3 the full scale anth sand filter provided the only statistically significant p 0 003 n 7 albeit low removal with a range of 15 32 or 1 6 3 7 ng l in contrast comparing the biological filtration influent and effluent concentrations over the course of operation no aeration aeration and ozonation for pilot plants a and b showed no statistically significant removal by combining the data from all the biological filters the concentration of nmor decreased by less than 5 ng l in all cases the limited biodegradation observed in these filters matches other work on the biodegradation of nmor wang et al 2015 specifically wang et al 2015 isolated the active bacteria capable of degrading n nitrosamines in biologically active filters and found that nmor was the most recalcitrant species with only 8 removal of high μg l concentrations these data differ from the high level of removal 50 observed in chuang and mitch 2017 but this mitigation was most likely due to sorption and not biodegradation as the gac was acclimated for 4 months prior to sample collection 3 3 nmor removal by gac in pilot plants a c removal by pilot plants a c gac adsorbers a1 b4 b5 and c1 c3 are shown in fig 3 although the first month or 5000 bed volumes bvs of gac a1 operation offered significant mitigation 55 or δ 12 ng l the average of the remaining 10 months were not different than the removal in biological filters a2 and a3 at 4 16 adsorbers b4 and b5 were fed by the combined effluent of b1 and b2 which meant that the initial concentration was lower than that found in the pilot plant influent at 11 3 9 ng l although b5 was acclimated for 2 year use at a drinking water treatment plant the doc si section s3 and nmor behavior was similar to that of a gac adsorber with sorption capacity likely the drinking water influent did not contain nmor which allowed for its initial adsorption for both the b4 and b5 adsorbers complete breakthrough occurred after approximately 2200 bvs however b4 performed better prior to this point with the first two samples being reduced to less than the mrl fig 3 the adsorbers in pilot plant c had similar behavior exhibiting a low affinity for nmor the three adsorbers c1 c2 and c3 could not be statistically distinguished from one another and are reported as an average in fig 3 however the three are shown individually in si figure s6 during the first sample collection all effluents were reduced to less than the mrl but the next sample had complete breakthrough for c1 at 1270 bvs c2 at 1260 bvs and c3 at 1170 bvs following breakthrough pilots b and c saw increases in the effluent concentration with averages of 1 6 1 7 ng l and 2 1 ng l respectively this trend could potentially be attributed to a desorption of nmor from the filter to meet an equilibrium as has been observed for other compounds with low affinity for gac appleman et al 2013 but it is likely that these limited differences are due to sample variability given its solubility in water 8 61 mol l at 25 c and low kow 0 18 of nmor the low sorption observed during gac operation was not unexpected and has been observed in past work toxnet 2017 ho et al 2011 in this work complete breakthrough was observed at bvs of 10 000 for a1 2200 for b4 and b5 and 1200 for c1 c3 while there was good agreement with pilot plants b and c pilot plant a was an outlier the difference in behavior could be attributed to the different carbons used in each pilot but low concentrations and sampling variability also likely contributed in general these data agree that nmor is not effectively removed by gac 3 4 nmor removal by ro based treatment the full scale treatment plant applied mf ro uv h2o2 and during the year of sampling nmor was detected in the tertiary effluent at 7 3 1 2 ng l mf treatment did not appreciably remove nmor over the year long sample collection with a decrease of 4 3 which was anticipated based on the size of nmor a few angstrom relative to the mf membrane pore size 1000 å ro mitigated nmor to below the mrl with a low removal estimate of 33 using the mrl as the effluent concentration however this value does not necessarily represent the full removal potential and was biased by the low influent concentration and the mrl past work by fujikoa et al 2013 showed that the potential removal of nmor by ro in potable reuse waters was more than 80 the efficacy of uv h2o2 was not able to be evaluated because the influent concentration was below the mrl 3 5 degradation of nmor under lp uv and uv h2o2 the degradation of nmor was traced in deionized lab grade water finished drinking water and tertiary filtered water with lp uv and lp uv combined with 5 mg l of h2o2 the direct photolysis rate measured in the three waters was 7 1 0 2 10 3 mj 1cm2 which corresponds to a nmor 90 removal dose of 325 10 mj cm2 for nmor and a quantum yield in deionized water of 0 29 details of this calculation is shown in section s5 of the si past work by shah et al 2013 had comparable results in deionized water with a dose of 340 mj cm2 required for 90 removal and a quantum yield of 0 29 at ph 8 for the three waters the presence of 5 mg l h2o2 did not significantly enhance the degradation rate and the contribution from direct photolysis was 95 in each water due to a low starting concentration no photolysis byproducts were detected but it is anticipated that nitrate nitrite and morpholine would be formed based on the degradation of other nitrosamines lee et al 2005 the uv dose required for the degradation of nmor is lower than those typically applied during uv aop processes for the reduction of ndma 500 1000 mj cm2 but higher than the 20 120 mj cm2 max of 300 mj cm2 for virus removal required for the inactivation of pathogens hijnen et al 2006 4 conclusions and treatment implications wastewater and surface water results clarified that nmor is primarily a contaminant and infrequently formed as a disinfection byproduct the levels detected at the bench scale were typically at or above the guideline values from germany 10 ng l and australia 1 ng l planas et al 2008 nhmrc 2008 in these waters the source of nmor contamination is not clear as it is not commercially produced nmor s precursor mor is commercially produced but additional research should be devoted to understanding the presence of mor in water and the nitrosation mechanisms in the environment or industrial processing that lead to the release of nmor ozone biofiltration gac based treatment of nmor resulted in limited removal and or degradation in pilot plants a c ozonation and biofiltration bac or anthracite both showed negligible removal of nmor at less than 16 gac adsorbers in pilot plants a c had initial success in removing nmor but complete breakthrough occurred after less than a month of treatment or 10 000 bvs for adsorber a1 and less than 2000 bvs for b4 and b5 as well as c1 c3 in comparison ro based treatment provided complete nmor removal bench scale uv and uv h2o2 photolysis experiments were conducted with uv degradation dominating the removal of nmor at doses lower than those required to mitigate ndma these results suggest that potable reuse systems would need to utilize ro or uv processes to remove nmor to levels below those

19203,as potable reuse guidelines and regulations continue to develop the presence of n nitrosamines is a primary concern because of their associated health concerns in this study bench pilot and full scale tests were conducted to focus on the occurrence and treatment of n nitrosomorpholine nmor in united states u s potable reuse systems out of twelve u s wastewater effluents collected ambient nmor was detected in eleven average 20 18 ng l in contrast only two of the thirteen surface water and stormwater samples had nmor across all of these samples maximum formation potential by chloramination produced an average increase of 3 6 1 8 ng l this result underscores the need to understand the sources of nmor as it is not likely a disinfection byproduct and it is not known to be commercially produced within the u s at the pilot scale three potable reuse systems were evaluated for ambient nmor with oxidation i e chlorination and ozonation biofiltration and granular activated carbon gac both pre oxidation and biofiltration were ineffective at mitigating nmor during long term pilot plant operation at least eight months gac adsorbers were the only pilot scale treatment to remove nmor however complete breakthrough occurred rapidly from 2000 to 10 000 bed volumes for comparison a full scale reverse osmosis ro potable reuse system was monitored for a year and confirmed that ro effectively removes nmor systematic bench scale uv advanced oxidation experiments were undertaken to assess the mitigation potential for nmor at a fluence dose of 325 10 mj cm2 uv alone degraded 90 of the nmor present the addition of 5 mg l hydrogen peroxide did not significantly decrease the uv dose required for one log removal these data illustrate that efficient nmor removal from potable reuse systems is limited to ro or uv treatment keywords n nitrosomorpholine potable reuse advanced treatment ozonation biological activated carbon granular activated carbon reverse osmosis uv photolysis 1 introduction recent drought conditions and water shortages have led many drinking water utilities to consider or fully incorporate alternative water supplies such as stormwaters eutrophic waters and advanced treated wastewaters nrc 2012 in these alternative supplies there is an increased risk that trace organic contaminants such as n nitrosamines and their precursors will be present nrc 2012 n nitrosamines are a class of compounds associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic activity when ingested via drinking water u s epa 2017 much of previous work has been dedicated to understanding the formation behavior and mitigation of a specific species n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as it is the most commonly detected species in drinking water systems russell et al 2012 woods et al 2015 and subject to a 10 ng l notification level and guideline in california and massachusetts respectively cdph 2013 massdep 2004 however another n nitrosamine of concern n nitrosomorpholine nmor has received less attention chronic oral exposure of animals to nmor has been shown to result in damages and tumors in the liver and kidneys toxnet 2017 although the united states u s does not currently have regulations guidelines or notification levels for nmor germany has recommended a drinking water guideline of 10 ng l planas et al 2008 and australia has set their drinking water reuse guideline at 1 ng l nhmrc 2008 nmor has been detected as a trace organic compound in an array of waters including wastewaters river waters seawaters and drinking water treatment plant effluents ma et al 2012 bei et al 2016 lee and oh 2016 gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016a 2016b the highest concentrations have been reported in wastewaters with values up to a max of 12 7 μg l krasner et al 2009 but more typical concentrations are in the tens of ng l gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016a 2016b lee and oh 2016 industrially impacted wastewaters have been found to contain significantly higher concentrations of nmor as compared to municipal wastewaters lee and oh 2016 however purely domestic wastewaters have also been found to contain nmor zeng and mitch 2015 drinking water detections have been limited particularly in the us and canada where median values were typically less than 10 ng l woods et al 2015 but concentrations up to 40 ng l were detected in chinese drinking waters and river waters drinking water sources bei et al 2016 nmor detections in drinking water river water and seawater have all been attributed to nearby wastewater discharges or industrial releases nmor has also been characterized as a disinfection byproduct dbp forming from the reaction of the secondary amine morpholine mor and monochloramine at a molar yield of 0 01 or dichloramine at a molar yield of 1 schreibier and mitch 2006 unlike ndma which has numerous chloramine precursors krasner et al 2013 no other nmor precursors have been identified household products potentially containing mor as an impurity include laundry detergents dishwashing soaps and textiles njdep 2009 industrial applications with mor include the production of pharmaceuticals dyes optical brighteners waxes resins for food and paper coatings polishes rubber processing chemicals and corrosion inhibitors for boiling waters njdep 2009 the mor backbone is also used in the production of ionic liquids which are organic salts used as green replacements for volatile organic solvents pham et al 2010 concentrations of mor have been reported in surface waters in china turkey and germany with ranges from 0 15 to 2 5 μg l pietsch et al 2001 akyuz and ata 2006 wang et al 2011 ma et al 2012 in each case the detection of mor was attributed to nearby municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and or nearby coal power plants these data would suggest the possibility of nmor formation during chloramination however the evidence has been limited given that both wastewaters and drinking waters exposed to realistic chloramination conditions had limited 10 ng l or no increase in nmor concentrations zeng and mitch 2015 sakai et al 2016 although the nitrosation of mor during chloramination has not been commonly observed nitrosation can occur within the human body food production industrial processing and amine assisted carbon capture originally mor nitrosation was studied in the context of understanding the formation of n nitrosamines in vivo in the presence of nitrates or nitrites this was found to occur via bacterial catalysis at neutral ph in the presence in human tissue and fluids e g saliva or by a nitrosating agent nitrosium ion n2o3 at low ph optimally 3 4 in the digestive tract e g stomach mirvish 1975 tannenbaum et al 1978 calmels et al 1988 engemann et al 2013 however humans do not excrete detectable levels of nmor krauss et al 2009 zeng and mitch 2015 nmor can also form in the environment or industrial waters through catalytic reactions with anions fluvic acid activated carbon formaldehyde or thiocyanate in the presence of a nitrosating species fan and tannenbaum 1973 keefer and roller 1973 padhye et al 2010 outputs from coal power plants can potentially contaminant surface water or ground waters with nmor poste et al 2014 through the formation of gaseous nitrogen oxides nox which produce the nitrosating agents n2o3 and n2o4 during amine assisted carbon capture chandan et al 2013 dai and mitch 2013 fine et al 2014 once nmor enters drinking water or wastewater treatment it is difficult to remove due to its physicochemical properties i e chemical stability low molecular weight and high solubility in conventional wastewater treatment processes it is more recalcitrant than other n nitrosamines with primary clarification biological treatment activated sludge and sand filtration removing 25 25 50 and 30 respectively krauss et al 2009 the mor backbone is difficult for microorganisms to biodegrade an electrophilic ring with n and o which limits the efficacy of biological wastewater treatment pietsch et al 2001 pitoi et al 2011 pre treatments such as ozonation similarly do not produce significant degradation under typical conditions hollender et al 2009 efficient removal of nmor has been limited to full advanced treatment facilities with ro acting as a barrier for nmor fujioka et al 2013 in cases where nmor was detected in ro effluents post processing with uv aop resulted in degradation to below the detection limit zeng et al 2016b in this paper we attempt to further understand the behavior of nmor in potable reuse by analyzing data from bench scale experiments three pilot scale potable reuse scenarios and one full scale potable reuse treatment facility an analysis of nmor presence and oxidation under chloramination and ozonation from zeng et al 2016a was examined for a range of potential drinking water treatment sources including wastewater effluents surface waters and stormwater runoff in addition three pilot scale advanced treatment systems were monitored to evaluate the impact of oxidation chlorination ozonation biologically active filtration with anthracite and activated carbon media and granular activated carbon gac on the presence of nmor one full scale advanced train with microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was sampled but the uv h2o2 efficiency was unable to be evaluated due to removal by ro therefore bench scale uv h2o2 experiments were undertaken to assess the photochemical degradation of nmor 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water sample collection details of sample collection methods and materials are published in zeng et al 2016a nmor data presented as a part of this study includes aggregated data from treated wastewaters and surface waters the treated wastewaters were collected from various locations within the u s and included conventionally treated nutrient removal and domestic and industrial impacted sites to capture a range of possible effluents types n 12 table s1 supporting information si the surface water samples included dry and wet weather runoff algal bloom waters pristine reservoirs without human impact and drinking water treatment plant reservoirs n 13 surface waters were characterized as pristine sw1 sw4 wastewater impacted sw5 sw9 and stormwater runoff sw10 sw13 sucralose was used as a proxy for municipal wastewater

condensate and washing cars or watering lawns and during a storm event sw10 sw12 was collected from a suburban drainage channel and sw13 was rainwater collected directly nmor was quantified under ambient conditions and after chloramine maximum formation potential clm max fp chloramine uniform formation conditions clm ufc and ozonation formation potential in the clm max fp tests samples were dosed with 140 mg l preformed monochloramine solution buffered at ph 7 with 10 mm phosphate buffer and stored for 10 days in the dark clm ufc tests were dosed with 5 mg l preformed monochloramine solution to target a dose of at least 1 mg l total chlorine at the end of 3 days and buffered at ph of 8 with 2 mm borate buffer at the end of each chloramine test 10 mg l of sodium thiosulfate was added to quench the residual in the sample ozone was applied at a ratio of 0 8 mg o3 mg total organic carbon toc and samples were held for 24 h before quantification to ensure the complete degradation of ozone 2 2 details of pilot plants a c and full scale ro plant nmor was monitored at specific points during treatment table 1 in three pilot scale treatment plants fed by the same treated wastewater

and uv h2o2 treatment 2 3 bench scale low pressure lp uv experiments photolysis experiments were undertaken to characterize the degradation of nmor through direct lp uv and lp uv h2o2 in three

were conducted in a custom system previously characterized in rosario ortiz et al 2010 and equipped with two philips g15t8 uv lamps uv doses of 100 mj cm2 750 mj cm2 and 1000 mj cm2 were applied and h2o2 was dosed at 5 mg l additional details provided in section s5 of the si from these data photolysis rates molar absorptivity and quantum yield were calculated shown in section s5 of the si 2 4 detection of nmor bench pilot and full scale treatment plant samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles and shipped or brought to the snwa on ice to maintain a temperature of 4 c samples were dosed with sodium azide 1 mg l and sodium thiosulfate 80 mg l for preservation and quenching prior to analysis field blank samples were collected and treated as typical samples to confirm that no on site contamination occurred nmor was analyzed following a modified epa method 521 protocol u s epa 2014 holady et al 2012 marti et al 2015 woods et al 2015 briefly an internal standard nmor d8 was spiked into 0 5 l of sample loaded onto coconut shell based activated carbon cartridges and extracted via automated solid phase extraction with dichloromethane dcm the dcm extracts were concentrated under high purity nitrogen gas and analyzed on a varian walnut creek ca cp 3800 gas chromatograph with db 624 column and coupled with a varian 4000 ion trap mass spectrometer set to monitor in positive chemical ionization the method reporting limit mrl for nmor was 5 ng l statistical significance between data sets was determined by t tests with sigmaplot 12 5 software and p values 0 05 were considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 nmor in source waters surface waters characterized as pristine sw1 sw4 a dry weather runoff sample sw11 and a wet weather suburban runoff sample sw12 had no detections of nmor even under clm max fp conditions surface waters impacted by municipal wastewater sw5 sw9 were found to contain nmor only under clm max fp conditions with an average of 8 6 1 8 ng l only two of the surface water samples had detections of nmor under ambient conditions a rainwater sample sw13 8 1 ng l and a wet weather urban runoff sample sw10 17 ng l the urban runoff sample was collected during a first flush runoff event and also contained 20 ng l 25 ng l and 14 ng l under clm ufc clm max fp and ozonation respectively wastewater treatment plants were divided into those with nutrient removal nitrification and denitrification table s1 ww6 ww12 and those treated via cas table s1 ww1 ww5 ambient detections of conventionally treated wastewaters ranged from below the mrl to 57 2 ng l with an average of 24 22 ng l and nutrient removal ranged from below the mrl to 53 ng l with an average of 14 16 ng l the high variability within each group of wastewaters is probably related to the inputs i e industrial vs domestic received lee and oh 2016 saw that the concentration of nmor in wastewater was tied to the level of industrial vs domestic inputs received specifically the rubber dye and textile manufacturing effluents that are known industrial sources of nmor fajen et al 1979 spiegelhalder and preussmann 1983 de vocht et al 2007 of the two wastewater samples found to be below detection both were primarily fed by domestic inputs student housing complex and small town which further supports the trend of industrial impacts leading to the higher concentrations of nmor the average concentration of nmor in nutrient removal sites was lower than that for conventional sites though not significantly p 0 052 across all waters the average decrease due to ozonation 0 8 mg o3 mg toc ratio was 1 2 3 4 ng l or 7 9 2 with the maximum decrease observed in a nutrient removal wastewater 11 ng l or 39 past work has shown similar results zimmermann et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2015 with a maximum of 36 removal at a 1 16 mg o3 mg toc hollender et al 2009 by comparing the concentrations in clm ufc and ambient waters an average increase of 1 5 1 8 ng l was observed which indicates that likely there were no precursors capable of forming nmor under realistic chloramination conditions clm max fp conditions contained an average concentration of 11 6 4 ng l and by using the mrl or ambient concentration the formation ranged from 1 1 to 8 ng l average of 3 4 2 2 ng l if the largest increase in nmor observed in sw10 were to be attributed to the presence of mor the concentration would have been several μg l assuming the molar yields from schreiber and mitch 2006 and a ph of 7 this level is comparable to the concentrations detected in surface waters in past work akyuz and ata 2006 but cannot be confirmed because mor concentrations were not determined in this study it is possible that this first flush runoff water contained mor associated with rubber deposits from tires but in the other samples the mor source is less clear an alternative explanation is that the increases can be attributed to sample variability this is supported by low level ng l increases under clm ufc and clm max fp and the lack of a statistical difference p 0 093 between ambient and chloraminated samples fig 1 the specific source of nmor in wastewaters is not clear given that it is not produced commercially in the u s however mor is a chemical used in a range of household and industrial products within the u s mor is used during the manufacturing of numerous products including pharmaceuticals dyes optical brighteners waxes resins rubber processing chemicals corrosion inhibitors or ionic liquids njdep 2009 it seems likely that mor is nitrosated either during the industrial manufacturing process or once it is released into the environment which would explain the discrepancy between the consistent detection of nmor in wastewaters and the lack of u s based production 3 2 nmor removal by biological filtration in pilot plants a c the presence of nmor released from wastewater treatment plants will significantly influence sites practicing potable reuse if the potable reuse nmor influent concentrations could potentially range from 7 1 to 57 ng l as shown above nmor would need to be removed or degraded by advanced treatment to prevent detection at levels above what is recommended for drinking water under certain guidelines i e 1 ng l or 10 ng l nhmrc 2008 planas et al 2008 ozone combined with biological filtration has been proposed as a viable alternative to ro based treatment in terms of mitigating the presence of trace organic contaminants reungoat et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 to assess the potential of ozone biofiltration gac based treatment three pilot scale plants were examined by combining results from the three pilot plants nmor samples were collected from the full scale anth sand biofilter effluent approximately monthly over a period of 2 years and found at an average of 13 4 6 ng l n 31 however each of the three different pilot plants had slightly different influent concentrations pilot plant a applied a ratio of 0 3 mg o3 mg toc that resulted in a negligible removal of nmor at 3 2 10 n 4 for both pilot plant b and c the mg o3 mg toc ratio was 0 8 which increased the removal to 16 13 n 15 this agrees with the source water results and the limited removal observed during past work zimmermann et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 the chlorination of nmor in pilot plant c also produced negligible degradation average of 1 4 n 11 which is similar to the behavior of other heterocyclic nitrogen containing compounds and ndma dickenson et al 2009 during the year long operation of biofilters a2 and a3 removals averaged 9 8 8 or 1 5 1 3 ng l and 9 10 or 1 3 1 7 ng l respectively fig 2 this limited removal was consistent with and without ozone and the bac did not illustrate signs of acclimation to nmor biofilters b1 b3 were operated without oxidation for 4 months and subsequently aerated for 2 months during this 6 month period nmor removal was negligible in both the bac and anthracite biofilters b1 b3 with averages of 1 7 2 7 and 2 10 respectively the application of ozone during the final 4 months increased these values to 22 1 for b1 18 3 for b2 and 22 3 for b3 however these percentage values represent changes of 2 2 0 38 ng l for b1 p 0 071 1 8 0 5 ng l for b2 p 0 073 and 2 2 0 32 ng l for b3 p 0 24 which were not statistically significant the removal of nmor by biological filtration in the full scale anth sand biofilter is shown in fig 2 along with biofilters a2 a3 and b1 b3 the full scale anth sand filter provided the only statistically significant p 0 003 n 7 albeit low removal with a range of 15 32 or 1 6 3 7 ng l in contrast comparing the biological filtration influent and effluent concentrations over the course of operation no aeration aeration and ozonation for pilot plants a and b showed no statistically significant removal by combining the data from all the biological filters the concentration of nmor decreased by less than 5 ng l in all cases the limited biodegradation observed in these filters matches other work on the biodegradation of nmor wang et al 2015 specifically wang et al 2015 isolated the active bacteria capable of degrading n nitrosamines in biologically active filters and found that nmor was the most recalcitrant species with only 8 removal of high μg l concentrations these data differ from the high level of removal 50 observed in chuang and mitch 2017 but this mitigation was most likely due to sorption and not biodegradation as the gac was acclimated for 4 months prior to sample collection 3 3 nmor removal by gac in pilot plants a c removal by pilot plants a c gac adsorbers a1 b4 b5 and c1 c3 are shown in fig 3 although the first month or 5000 bed volumes bvs of gac a1 operation offered significant mitigation 55 or δ 12 ng l the average of the remaining 10 months were not different than the removal in biological filters a2 and a3 at 4 16 adsorbers b4 and b5 were fed by the combined effluent of b1 and b2 which meant that the initial concentration was lower than that found in the pilot plant influent at 11 3 9 ng l although b5 was acclimated for 2 year use at a drinking water treatment plant the doc si section s3 and nmor behavior was similar to that of a gac adsorber with sorption capacity likely the drinking water influent did not contain nmor which allowed for its initial adsorption for both the b4 and b5 adsorbers complete breakthrough occurred after approximately 2200 bvs however b4 performed better prior to this point with the first two samples being reduced to less than the mrl fig 3 the adsorbers in pilot plant c had similar behavior exhibiting a low affinity for nmor the three adsorbers c1 c2 and c3 could not be statistically distinguished from one another and are reported as an average in fig 3 however the three are shown individually in si figure s6 during the first sample collection all effluents were reduced to less than the mrl but the next sample had complete breakthrough for c1 at 1270 bvs c2 at 1260 bvs and c3 at 1170 bvs following breakthrough pilots b and c saw increases in the effluent concentration with averages of 1 6 1 7 ng l and 2 1 ng l respectively this trend could potentially be attributed to a desorption of nmor from the filter to meet an equilibrium as has been observed for other compounds with low affinity for gac appleman et al 2013 but it is likely that these limited differences are due to sample variability given its solubility in water 8 61 mol l at 25 c and low kow 0 18 of nmor the low sorption observed during gac operation was not unexpected and has been observed in past work toxnet 2017 ho et al 2011 in this work complete breakthrough was observed at bvs of 10 000 for a1 2200 for b4 and b5 and 1200 for c1 c3 while there was good agreement with pilot plants b and c pilot plant a was an outlier the difference in behavior could be attributed to the different carbons used in each pilot but low concentrations and sampling variability also likely contributed in general these data agree that nmor is not effectively removed by gac 3 4 nmor removal by ro based treatment the full scale treatment plant applied mf ro uv h2o2 and during the year of sampling nmor was detected in the tertiary effluent at 7 3 1 2 ng l mf treatment did not appreciably remove nmor over the year long sample collection with a decrease of 4 3 which was anticipated based on the size of nmor a few angstrom relative to the mf membrane pore size 1000 å ro mitigated nmor to below the mrl with a low removal estimate of 33 using the mrl as the effluent concentration however this value does not necessarily represent the full removal potential and was biased by the low influent concentration and the mrl past work by fujikoa et al 2013 showed that the potential removal of nmor by ro in potable reuse waters was more than 80 the efficacy of uv h2o2 was not able to be evaluated because the influent concentration was below the mrl 3 5 degradation of nmor under lp uv and uv h2o2 the degradation of nmor was traced in deionized lab grade water finished drinking water and tertiary filtered water with lp uv and lp uv combined with 5 mg l of h2o2 the direct photolysis rate measured in the three waters was 7 1 0 2 10 3 mj 1cm2 which corresponds to a nmor 90 removal dose of 325 10 mj cm2 for nmor and a quantum yield in deionized water of 0 29 details of this calculation is shown in section s5 of the si past work by shah et al 2013 had comparable results in deionized water with a dose of 340 mj cm2 required for 90 removal and a quantum yield of 0 29 at ph 8 for the three waters the presence of 5 mg l h2o2 did not significantly enhance the degradation rate and the contribution from direct photolysis was 95 in each water due to a low starting concentration no photolysis byproducts were detected but it is anticipated that nitrate nitrite and morpholine would be formed based on the degradation of other nitrosamines lee et al 2005 the uv dose required for the degradation of nmor is lower than those typically applied during uv aop processes for the reduction of ndma 500 1000 mj cm2 but higher than the 20 120 mj cm2 max of 300 mj cm2 for virus removal required for the inactivation of pathogens hijnen et al 2006 4 conclusions and treatment implications wastewater and surface water results clarified that nmor is primarily a contaminant and infrequently formed as a disinfection byproduct the levels detected at the bench scale were typically at or above the guideline values from germany 10 ng l and

additional research should be devoted to understanding the presence of mor in water and the nitrosation mechanisms in the environment or industrial processing that lead to the release of nmor ozone biofiltration gac based treatment of nmor resulted in limited removal and or degradation in pilot plants a c ozonation and biofiltration bac or anthracite both showed negligible removal of nmor at less than 16 gac adsorbers in pilot plants a c had initial success in removing nmor but complete breakthrough occurred after less than a month of treatment or 10 000 bvs for adsorber a1 and less than 2000 bvs for b4 and b5 as well as c1 c3 in comparison ro based treatment provided complete nmor removal bench scale uv and uv h2o2 photolysis experiments were conducted with uv degradation dominating the removal of nmor at doses lower than those required to mitigate ndma these results suggest that potable reuse systems would need to utilize ro or uv processes to remove nmor to levels below those

19204,etbe is a fuel oxygenate that is synthesized from bio ethanol and fossil based isobutylene and replaces the fossil based mtbe biodegradation of etbe to harmless metabolites or end products can reduce the environmental and human health risks after accidental release in this study an algal bacterial culture enriched from contaminated groundwater was used to i assess the potential for etbe degradation ii resolve the etbe degradation pathway and iii characterize the phylogenetic composition of the bacterial community involved in etbe degradation in contaminated groundwater in an unamended microcosm algal growth was observed after eight weeks when exposed to a day night light cycle in the fed batch reactor oxygen produced by the algae scenedesmus and chlorella was used by bacteria to degrade 50 μm etbe replenishments with a cumulative total of 1250 μm in a day night cycle 650 lux over a period of 913 days the microbial community in the fed batch reactor degraded etbe using a p450 monooxygenase and 2 hydroxyisobutyryl coa mutase to tert butyl alcohol tba ethanol and co2 as determined using 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and gas chromatography stable isotope probing sip with 13c6 labeled etbe in a fed batch vessel showed no significant difference in community profiles of the 13c and 12c enriched dna fractions with representatives of the families halomonadaceae shewanellaceae rhodocyclaceae oxalobacteraceae comamonadaceae sphingomonadaceae hyphomicrobiaceae candidatus moranbacteria omnitrophica anaerolineaceae nocardiaceae and blastocatellaceae this is the first study describing micro oxic degradation of etbe by an algal bacterial culture this algal bacterial culture has advantages compared with conventional aerobic treatments i a lower risk of etbe evaporation and ii no need for external oxygen supply in the presence of light this study provides novel leads towards future possibilities to implement algal bacterial consortia in field scale groundwater or wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro oxic etbe degradation nmr 13c sip algal bacterial culture tba ethanol 1 introduction fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and ethyl tert butyl ether etbe were incorporated into gasoline in the 1970s because of their high octane number and their effect on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions fayolle et al 2001 in europe mtbe is being replaced by etbe to achieve the european regulations of 10 biobased fuel addition in 2020 etbe is a fuel oxygenate synthesized from bio ethanol and isobutylene etbe is increasingly used to replace mtbe with a total etbe consumption of 3 million metric tons in europe and japan in 2011 le digabel et al 2013 from 1999 to 2010 the dominant fuel oxygenate was mtbe whereas from 2010 to 2015 it was etbe babidorics et al 2018 furthermore the etbe concentration in gasoline increased from an average of 0 91 m m for 1999 2009 to an average of 1 67 6 32 m m from 2010 to 2015 fuel oxygenates enter the groundwater through spillages during production distribution and storage due to the high etbe water solubility of 12 g l the poor biodegradation and low odor and taste thresholds in water in the range from 10 to 50 μg l etbe imposes a risk in groundwater babé et al 2007 le digabel et al 2013 despite the increasing etbe consumption little is known regarding its environmental fate in this study anoxic groundwater from a contaminated location was used to determine the microbial degradation potential of etbe there is no data available concerning etbe concentrations and frequency of occurrence in wastewater due to the lack of legislation for allowable concentrations in europe vrom 2008 etbe has a similar molecular structure as mtbe and is produced in a similar way therefore it is expected that fuel spills will occur with europe wide etbe contamination problems like mtbe van wezel et al 2009 a dutch study monitoring 37 groundwater collection areas showed two areas with etbe detected at 0 1 and 1 μg l respectively van wezel et al 2009 partly because of the results of this study the dutch ministry of housing spatial planning and the environment set an etbe remediation value of 1 μg l within drinking water collection areas and 15 μg l outside drinking water collection areas vrom 2008 also in the us several etbe groundwater contaminations were detected because of usage in the past shih et al 2004 etbe concentrations between 0 35 and 7500 μg l were measured in groundwater beneath leaking underground storage tanks there is little information on the biological transformation and removal of etbe in contaminated soils aquifers and wastewater in general etbe is recalcitrant due to its tertiary carbon atom and ether bond bombach et al 2015 a few bacterial strains have been isolated that are able to aerobically degrade etbe fayolle et al 1998 kharoune et al 2001 le digabel et al 2013 aerobic etbe degradation is initiated by cytochrome p450 monooxygenase encoded by the ethrabcd gene cluster found in gram positive etbe utilizing strains of the genera rhodococcus gordonia and mycobacterium beguin et al 2003 chauvaux et al 2001 malandain et al 2010 schuster et al 2013 oxygen however is often rapidly depleted in contaminated groundwater by aerobic micro organisms using easily degradable substrates as electron donor grbić galić 1990 therefore anaerobic etbe degradation in groundwater is highly important a previous study reported lack of anaerobic etbe degradation somsamak et al 2001 however yeh and novak 1994 found anaerobic etbe degradation to tba in soils under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions compound specific stable isotope analysis csia revealed insignificant carbon isotope fractionation but low hydrogen isotope fractionation of up to 14 along an anoxic etbe plume suggesting anaerobic biodegradation of etbe bombach et al 2015 algae and bacteria have coexisted since the early stages of evolution it has been shown that algae and bacteria synergistically affect each other s physiology and metabolism algal bacterial interactions include mutualism commensalism but also parasitism ramanan et al 2016 a previous study indicated the presence of viable algae up to 225 m in the subsurface indicating that algae may be able to survive or thrive in anoxic groundwater sinclair and ghiorse 1989 it was found that a symbiotic algal bacterial system could improve the bacterial mtbe degradation due to higher dissolved oxygen concentrations generated by photosynthesis zhong et al 2011 algal bacterial interactions in wastewater treatment plants have been shown to be effective for treating contaminants such as acetonitrile thiocyanate and atrazine derakhshan et al 2018 muñoz et al 2005 ryu et al 2014 the aims of the present study were to determine the capacity pathway and phylogenetic composition of the microbial population involved in etbe degradation in anoxic groundwater from a contaminated location underneath a gasoline fuelling station the etbe degradation pathway was determined by 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the phylogenetic composition was assessed using generic high throughput analysis of 16s ribosomal rna rrna genes through next generation technology sequencing i e illumina miseq of pcr barcoded amplicons sequencing was done of amplicons obtained from 12c and 13c enriched dna fractions after stable isotope probing sip using a13c6 labeled etbe degrading microbial community in a fed

using the same set up nucleotide sequence data reported are available at the european nucleotide archive ena under accession number prjeb25329 2 7 algae growth experiment to determine the presence of algae the fed batch reactor samples were exposed to daylight diurnal cycles of eight hours daylight and 16 h without light or a lamp 4125 lux continuous light philips 15 w the microcosms were

average daylight of 12 h a 0 1 v v re inoculation in bg 11 broth of this algal enrichment exposed to daylight was made anoxic by flushing with 80 20 n2 co2 v v gas and placed in the dark for determination of ethanol production algae were identified using der kosmos algenführer die wichtigsten süßwasseralgen im mikroskop von berg 2004 2 8 first order degradation rate constant calculation first order degradation rate constants k were calculated according to equation 1 suarez and rifai 1999 1 k log x 1 log x 2 t 2 t 1 where t2 t1 is the time interval in days x1 is the etbe concentration at time t1 and x2 is the etbe concentration at time t2 3 results 3 1 etbe degradation in microcosms under different redox conditions neither growth nor etbe loss was observed in an autoclaved microcosm with 100 mg l hgcl2 and 2 mg l nan3 in dark or light conditions etbe contaminated groundwater from a gasoline fuelling station site unamended control and the microcosms under nitrate reducing chlorate reducing sulphate reducing and ferrihydrite reducing conditions did not show etbe degradation in the dark at 20 c after 870 days degradation less than the coefficient of variation under aerobic conditions etbe was degraded at a rate of 33 6 2 4 μm day in an unamended microcosm algal growth was observed after eight weeks when exposed to a day night light cycle fig s2 morphology suggested that the algae belonged to the genera scenedesmus and chlorella the degradation rate of etbe was 0 8 0 2 μm day in this algal enrichment table 1 oxygen in the headspace increased up to 50 v v fig 1 after 54 days the microcosm was placed in the dark after which the oxygen level in the microcosm decreased and etbe was continuously degraded at a rate of 0 8 0 2 μm day in this microcosm tba concentrations increased stepwise up to 80 μm when three doses of each 50 μm etbe were added to the microcosm the ethanol concentration increased up to 35 μm in 85 days after which it decreased the ethb gene coding for cytochrome p450 monooxygenase was not detected in the unamended aerobic control microcosm degrading etbe 3 2 etbe degradation in a fed batch reactor 3 2 1 etbe degradation rate no etbe loss was observed in the fed batch reactor filled with groundwater from the contaminated location when exposed to ambient day night cycles therefore 0 5 l of defined medium was added to 1 5 l of groundwater after 135 days the liquid in the fed batch reactor had a redox potential between 330 and 368 mv as measured versus a standard hydrogen electrode nitrate in the fed batch reactor remained constant at 25 mg l the oxygen concentration measured in the liquid was 0 1 the microbial community degraded multiple doses of 50 μm etbe with a cumulative total of 1250 μm in a day night cycle 650 lux over a period of 913 days the first order degradation rate for the first three 50 μm etbe dosages was 6 7 1 6 μm day 1 0 3 0 2 day 1 corresponding to a half life of approximately 2 3 days table 1 after three etbe re additions the degradation rate decreased to 1 0 0 2 μm day 1 0 09 0 02 day 1 after exposure of the culture vessel to continuous light 4125 lux the degradation rate increased to 6 8 1 5 μm day 1 0 3 0 03 day 1 under these conditions the oxygen concentration in the liquid phase increased from 0 1 to 10 within 9 days at 400 days after the startup of the fed batch culture and a cumulative dosing of 500 μm etbe 5 hydrogen was added to the headspace of the vessel to ensure strictly anoxic conditions after hydrogen addition etbe degradation stopped subsequently the gas phase was changed back to n2 co2 80 20 v v and etbe degradation was re activated placing the culture in an anoxic gas bag did not affect the etbe degradation rate however after placing the culture in a dark water filled bucket the etbe degradation ceased ethanol and tba were detected in the culture liquid concentrations fluctuated over time between 8 3 to 51 3 μm and 11 7 215 7 μm respectively morphological features observed by microscopy suggested that the liquid in the fed batch reactor contained algae belonging to the genus chlorella fig s3 a microcosm with liquid from the fed batch reactor exposed to daylight day night cycle amended with 100 μg ml cycloheximide and a headspace oxygen concentration of about 5 degraded etbe at a similar rate as before the addition of cycloheximide 4 0 0 5 μm day in contrast the addition of 5 mm metyrapone interrupted the degradation in a microcosm 10 ml containing pbs without metyrapone the microbial community continuously degraded etbe anoxic liquid from the fed batch reactor incubated in the dark at 20 c did not show any degradation after 41 days in a 0 1 v v transfer of the fed batch reactor in bg 11 broth and exposed to daylight day night cycle algal growth was observed green deposit but no ethanol was detected after seven days 4 5 μm 3 2 2 etbe degradation pathway to elucidate the etbe degradation pathway we added 50 μm 13c6 labeled etbe as carbon source to the microbial community in the fed batch reactor 13c labeled nahco3 increased over time fig 2 at day 1 13c labeled tba was below the detection limit of the nmr but 49 μm tba was measured by gc fid equipped with an spme from day 1 the 13c labeled etbe tba ratio increased up to a ratio of 2 2 for the second 13c6 etbe dosage 29 days measured by nmr fig 2 after a third dosage of 13c6 etbe 48 days tba was detected just above the base line of the nmr spectrum 3 2 3 microbial community neither the functional gene mdpa coding for mtbe monooxygenase nor the ethb gene encoding cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit were detected in the fed batch culture in contrast the functional gene hcma was detected at relatively high copy numbers in fed bath reactor samples 20 0 5 7 104 gene copies ml as compared with the total bacterial 16s rrna genes 7 5 2 1 104 gene copies ml fig 3 total archaeal 16s rrna genes in the fed batch reactor were observed at an average of 1 4 0 2 104 gene copies ml sample miseq sequencing of pcr amplified v1 v2 fragments of bacterial 16s rrna genes was used for description of overall bacterial community composition table s1 samples were taken at different time points in the etbe degradation process day night cycle the phylogenetic diversity pd whole tree was similar for all samples with an average of 23 1 4 and the number of observed otus was 203 4 12 6 table s1 miseq community analysis did not show a significant difference in relative abundance of the families in the fed batch reactor between the 12c and 13c fractions over time fig 4 predominant families in the etbe degrading fed batch reactor include in relative abundance halomonadaceae 2 4 2 6 shewanellaceae 2 1 2 1 rhodocyclaceae 3 4 1 7 oxalobacteraceae 2 5 2 5 comamonadaceae 14 4 2 7 sphingomonadaceae 1 1 1 1 hyphomicrobiaceae 3 7 0 7 candidatus moranbacteria 10 4 2 7 candidatus omnitrophica 2 4 0 5 anaerolineaceae 3 3 0 8 nocardiaceae 7 1 1 7 and blastocatellaceae 3 5 0 6 cyanobacteria and phototrophic bacteria such as members of the rhodobacteraceae were present in the microbial community at relative abundances of 1 56 and 2 01 16s rrna gene copies respectively in our system 4 discussion the goals of this study were i to determine the etbe degradation capacity ii to resolve the etbe degradation pathway and iii to characterize the phylogenetic composition of the microbial community involved in etbe degradation in contaminated groundwater in this study it was found that algae play an important role in the etbe loss we therefore hypothesize that the oxygen produced by the algae was used by bacteria to degrade the etbe aerobically fig 5 the presence of algae in the monitoring well of this study might be the result of i percolating rainwater ii surface water recharge from the nearby stream iii contamination by recirculated drilling fluids when the monitoring well was installed or iv growth of algae in the groundwater brad et al 2008 sinclair and ghiorse 1989 a previous study observed a diverse microeukaryotic community at a depth of 1 5 m below the surface in an aquifer polluted with landfill leachate brad et al 2008 this finding is in line with the detection of algae at 2 5 m below the surface in our study 4 1 etbe degradation in microcosms under different redox conditions the microcosms with gasoline contaminated groundwater without any addition of electron acceptor or medium and the microcosms containing groundwater at different redox conditions did not show etbe degradation in the dark the aerobic microbial community in this groundwater degraded the etbe 33 6 2 4 μm day in the lower range of degradation rates as reported previously under aerobic conditions 35 2208 μm day fayolle et al 1998 kharoune et al 2002 le digabel et al 2013 ohkubo and yagi 2012 the higher aerobic etbe degradation rates determined in previous studies might be due to the fact that those cultures were either pure cultures or enrichments obtained with etbe at relatively high oxygen concentrations the microbial community described in our study was obtained from anoxic groundwater containing a mixture of contaminants including etbe and enriched at oxygen concentrations lower than 0 1 the microcosm without electron acceptor and medium addition containing up to 50 oxygen produced by algae in a day night light cycle degraded etbe at a lower rate 0 8 0 1 μm day compared with these previous reported rates this might be due to the fact that this microcosm had been incubated without oxygen in the dark for 872 days before exposure to light to induce oxygen production by the algae scenedesmus and or chlorella in this microcosm containing groundwater without electron acceptor and medium tba was not accumulating over time indicating further degradation of tba after exposure to light wilson et al 2001 4 2 etbe degradation in a fed batch reactor the etbe degradation rates in the fed batch reactor from 1 0 0 2 μm day 1 to 6 7 1 6 μm day 1 are lower than those found in aerobic cultures in microcosms these lower rates could be explained by the fact that the fed batch reactor in this study was micro oxic 0 1 o2 resulting in oxygen limited growth instead of having a sufficiently high oxygen concentration for exponential growth when the fed batch reactor was continuously exposed to light 4125 lux the degradation rate was 6 8 1 5 μm day 1 and the oxygen concentration increased to a value of up to 10 the similar degradation rates under micro oxic and oxic conditions might be due to the fact that the microbial community described in our study was obtained from anoxic groundwater and enriched at oxygen concentrations lower than 0 1 no etbe degradation was observed under anoxic conditions in the dark this result is in line with the hypothesis that microalgae in the groundwater produce oxygen under light conditions which is subsequently used by the bacteria to degrade etbe in addition the cytochrome p450 inhibitor metyrapone interrupted the etbe degradation this result is in line with previous studies suggesting that a cytochrome p450 is involved in the oxidative cleavage of the ether bond chauvaux et al 2001 schuster et al 2013 furthermore the addition of 100 μg ml cycloheximide in the presence of oxygen did not have an effect on the etbe degradation rate suggesting that the eukaryotes microalgae in the groundwater did not degrade the etbe it might be possible that phototrophic bacteria such as members of the rhodobacteraceae degrade the etbe as was suggested for halogenated benzoic acids woude et al 1994 and chlorinated organic compounds bender et al 1995 the ethb gene encoding the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit was not detected in the etbe degrading microbial community this suggests that other mono oxygenase enzymes were active in this community which were not detected by the ethb assay targeting the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit of the ethabcd system of aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 developed by schuster and co workers schuster et al 2013 rosell and co workers showed that in a mixed culture of methylibium sp pm1 and aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 under low oxygen concentrations 2 strain l108 employing ethabcd is more competitive in degrading mtbe compared to strain pm 1 employing mdpa rosell et al 2010 hence the results by rosell et al suggest that an ethabcd system might have a higher affinity for oxygen and thus might be suitable for oxygenate degradation under low oxygen conditions this is in line with our results as introduced a symbiotic algal bacterial system could increase the mtbe degradation rate due to higher dissolved oxygen concentrations as a result of photosynthesis zhong et al 2011 john and co workers found that certain species of algae can produce ethanol during dark anaerobic fermentation john et al 2011 no ethanol was measured in the dark anaerobic microcosm with bg 11 broth suggesting that the algae chlorella and scenedesmus in this study did not produce ethanol therefore the measured ethanol in the fed batch reactor is most likely a metabolite in the etbe degradation pathway possibly ethanol is produced from acetaldehyde when the ethoxy group is released from etbe by the action of p450 monooxygenase as our system is oxygen limited further oxidation of ethanol may be constrained alternatively ethanol may have been produced from tba under micro oxic conditions the initial 13c labeled tba concentrations were too low to be detected by nmr after 24 h 13c tba concentrations increased relatively compared with declining 13c etbe concentrations indicating that tba is indeed a metabolite from etbe degradation this is in line with previous reports suggesting that tba is the main metabolite of etbe degradation kharoune et al 2002 ohkubo and yagi 2012 although 13co2 was detected by nmr we were not sure if complete etbe degradation up to co2 was occurring the high concentrations of the hcma gene 20 0 5 7 104 gene copies ml sample compared to total bacterial 16s rrna gene copies 7 5 2 1 104 gene copies ml sample may suggest that there are multiple hcma gene copies in the dna of bacteria however we cannot rule out the possibility that our hcma primers amplify other genes with high sequence similarity having said that the observed relatively high amount of hcma genes suggests that etbe was degraded via tba and 2 hydroxyisobuyrate according to the metabolic pathway involving 2 hydroxyisobutyryl coa mutase as was suggested previously rohwerder et al 2006 while being beyond the scope of the current study future experiments should include analysis of the hcma gene at the rna level to confirm that this gene is expressed during growth on etbe total archaeal 16s rrna genes were detected at high concentrations of 1 4 0 2 104 gene copies ml sample in the fed batch reactor albeit their role in the etbe degradation is not known analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing profiles revealed a similar phylogenetic diversity and otu number for the pooled 12c and 13c fractions the analysis indicated that total and active members of the communities represented by the light and heavy dna fractions respectively were very similar to each other this similarity between labeled and unlabeled nucleic acids is in agreement with previous studies rettedal and brözel 2015 thomson et al 2013 these studies found that while metabolically inactive bacteria or extracellular dna was present the similarity between labeled and unlabeled dna indicated that most recovered otus had metabolically active representatives in this community it may also be that the 13c etbe concentrations used in this study were not sufficient to measure a change in phylogenetic diversity in the heavy carbon fraction relatively high numbers of comamonadaceae and candidatus moranbacteria were detected in the fed batch reactor this result is in line with a previous study were a strain of comamonas testosteroni was isolated with the ability to degrade etbe as the sole source of carbon and energy kharoune et al 2001 the usage of this algal bacterial culture to degrade etbe might be of interest in groundwater or wastewater treatment plants aboveground the microbial community from the contaminated site degraded etbe at daylight area 50 cm2 650 lux at rates similar to increased light intensity using a lamp 4125 lux groundwater or wastewater treatment aboveground could be achieved using for example basins illuminated by daylight or artificial light in which both algae and bacteria may flourish 5 conclusion this is the first study describing degradation of etbe in an algal bacterial culture in this culture algae i e chlorella or scenedesmus use light to produce oxygen which is consumed by the bacterial community to aerobically degrade etbe the algal bacterial interaction in this study has advantages compared with conventional aerobic treatments firstly this interaction represents a closed system without the need for aeration therefore the risk of etbe evaporation is minimized secondly there is no need for expensive external oxygen supply more research aiming at a better understanding and control of the etbe degradation rates pathway and the responsible microbes is needed to explore the possibilities to implement such algal bacterial consortia in for example groundwater or wastewater treatment declaration of interests none acknowledgement we would like to thank fredericke hannes and miguel dionisio pires deltares utrecht

19204,etbe is a fuel oxygenate that is synthesized from bio ethanol and fossil based isobutylene and replaces the fossil based mtbe biodegradation of etbe to harmless metabolites or end products can reduce the environmental and human health risks after accidental release in this study an algal bacterial culture enriched from contaminated groundwater was used to i assess the potential for etbe degradation ii resolve the etbe degradation pathway and iii characterize the phylogenetic composition of the bacterial community involved in etbe degradation in contaminated groundwater in an unamended microcosm algal growth was observed after eight weeks when exposed to a day night light cycle in the fed batch reactor oxygen produced by the algae scenedesmus and chlorella was used by bacteria to degrade 50 μm etbe replenishments with a cumulative total of 1250 μm in a day night cycle 650 lux over a period of 913 days the microbial community in the fed batch reactor degraded etbe

fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and ethyl tert butyl ether etbe were incorporated into gasoline in the 1970s because of their high octane number and their effect on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions fayolle et al 2001 in europe mtbe is being replaced by etbe to achieve the european regulations of 10 biobased fuel addition in 2020 etbe is a fuel oxygenate synthesized from bio ethanol and isobutylene etbe is increasingly used to replace mtbe with a total etbe consumption of 3 million metric tons in europe and japan in 2011 le digabel et al 2013 from 1999 to 2010 the dominant fuel oxygenate was mtbe whereas from 2010 to 2015 it was etbe babidorics et al 2018 furthermore the etbe concentration in gasoline increased from an average of 0 91 m m for 1999 2009 to an average of 1 67 6 32 m m from 2010 to 2015 fuel oxygenates enter the groundwater through spillages during production distribution and storage due to the high etbe water solubility of 12 g l the poor biodegradation and low odor and taste thresholds in water in the range from 10 to 50 μg l etbe imposes a risk in groundwater babé et al 2007 le digabel et al 2013 despite the increasing etbe consumption little is known regarding its environmental fate in this study anoxic groundwater from a contaminated location was used to determine the microbial degradation potential of etbe there is no data available concerning etbe concentrations and frequency of occurrence in wastewater due to the lack of legislation for allowable concentrations in europe vrom 2008 etbe has a similar molecular structure as mtbe and is produced in a similar way therefore it is expected that fuel spills will occur with europe wide etbe contamination problems like mtbe van wezel et al 2009 a dutch study monitoring 37 groundwater collection areas showed two areas with etbe detected at 0 1 and 1 μg l respectively van wezel et al 2009 partly because of the results of this study the dutch ministry of housing spatial planning and the environment set an etbe remediation value of 1 μg l within drinking water collection areas and 15 μg l outside drinking water collection areas vrom 2008 also in the us several etbe groundwater contaminations were detected because of usage in the past shih et al 2004 etbe concentrations between 0 35 and 7500 μg l were measured in groundwater beneath leaking underground storage tanks there is little information on the biological transformation and removal of etbe in contaminated soils aquifers and wastewater in general etbe is recalcitrant due to its tertiary carbon atom and ether bond bombach et al 2015 a few bacterial strains have been isolated that are able to aerobically degrade etbe fayolle et al 1998 kharoune et al 2001 le digabel et al 2013 aerobic etbe degradation is initiated by cytochrome p450 monooxygenase encoded by the ethrabcd gene cluster found in gram positive etbe utilizing strains of the genera rhodococcus gordonia and mycobacterium beguin et al 2003 chauvaux et al 2001 malandain et al 2010 schuster et al 2013 oxygen however is often rapidly depleted in contaminated groundwater by aerobic micro organisms using easily degradable substrates as electron donor grbić galić 1990 therefore anaerobic etbe degradation in groundwater is highly important a previous study reported lack of anaerobic etbe degradation somsamak et al 2001 however yeh and novak 1994 found anaerobic etbe degradation to tba in soils under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions compound specific stable isotope analysis csia revealed insignificant carbon isotope fractionation but low hydrogen isotope fractionation of up to 14 along an anoxic etbe plume suggesting anaerobic biodegradation of etbe bombach et al 2015 algae and bacteria have coexisted since the early stages of evolution it has been shown that algae and bacteria synergistically affect each other s physiology and metabolism algal bacterial interactions include mutualism commensalism but also parasitism ramanan et al 2016 a previous study indicated the presence of viable algae up to 225 m in the subsurface indicating that algae may be able to survive or thrive in anoxic groundwater sinclair and ghiorse 1989 it was found that a symbiotic algal bacterial system could improve the bacterial mtbe degradation due to higher dissolved oxygen concentrations generated by photosynthesis zhong et al 2011 algal bacterial interactions in wastewater treatment plants have been shown to be effective for treating contaminants such as acetonitrile thiocyanate and atrazine derakhshan et al 2018 muñoz et al 2005 ryu et al 2014 the aims of the present study were to determine the capacity pathway and phylogenetic composition of the microbial population involved in etbe degradation in anoxic groundwater from a contaminated location underneath a gasoline fuelling station the etbe degradation pathway was determined by 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the phylogenetic composition was assessed using generic high throughput analysis of 16s ribosomal rna rrna genes through next generation technology sequencing i e illumina miseq of pcr barcoded amplicons sequencing was done of amplicons obtained from 12c and 13c enriched dna fractions after stable isotope probing sip using a13c6 labeled etbe degrading microbial community in a fed batch reactor in order to identify microbial taxa involved in key catabolic reactions 2 materials and methods anoxic etbe contaminated groundwater from a gasoline fuelling station site in amsterdam

glas col in usa with a continuous n2 co2 flow and closed with tie wraps and iii submerging the fed batch reactor in a dark bucket filled with tap water two experiments were done to determine the algal

ethb gene coding for cytochrome p450 monooxygenase was not detected in the unamended aerobic control microcosm degrading etbe 3 2 etbe degradation in a fed batch reactor 3 2 1 etbe degradation rate no etbe loss was observed in the fed batch reactor filled with groundwater from the contaminated location when exposed to ambient day night cycles therefore 0 5 l of defined medium was added to 1 5 l of groundwater after 135 days the liquid in the fed batch reactor had a redox potential between 330 and 368 mv as measured versus a standard hydrogen electrode nitrate in the fed batch reactor remained constant at 25 mg l the oxygen concentration measured in the liquid was 0 1 the microbial community degraded multiple doses of 50 μm etbe with a cumulative total of 1250 μm in a day night cycle 650

after three etbe re additions the degradation rate decreased to 1 0 0 2 μm day 1 0 09 0 02 day 1 after exposure of the culture vessel to continuous light 4125 lux the degradation rate increased to 6 8 1 5 μm day 1 0 3 0 03 day 1 under these conditions the oxygen concentration in the liquid phase increased from 0 1 to 10 within 9 days at 400 days after the startup of the fed batch culture and a cumulative dosing of 500 μm etbe 5 hydrogen was added to the headspace of the vessel to ensure strictly anoxic conditions after hydrogen addition etbe degradation stopped subsequently the gas phase was changed back to n2 co2 80 20 v v and etbe degradation was re activated placing the culture in an anoxic gas bag did not affect the etbe degradation rate however after placing the culture in a dark water filled bucket the etbe degradation ceased ethanol and tba were detected in the culture liquid concentrations fluctuated over time between 8 3 to 51 3 μm and 11 7 215 7 μm respectively morphological features observed by microscopy suggested that the liquid in the fed batch reactor contained algae belonging to the genus chlorella fig s3 a microcosm with liquid from the fed batch reactor exposed to daylight day night cycle amended with 100 μg ml cycloheximide and a headspace oxygen concentration of about 5 degraded etbe at a similar rate as before the addition of cycloheximide 4 0 0 5 μm day in contrast the addition of 5 mm metyrapone interrupted the degradation in a microcosm 10 ml containing pbs without metyrapone the microbial community continuously degraded etbe anoxic liquid from the fed batch reactor incubated in the dark at 20 c did not show any degradation after 41 days in a 0 1 v v transfer of the fed batch reactor in bg 11 broth and exposed to daylight day night cycle algal growth was observed green deposit but no ethanol was detected after seven days 4 5 μm 3 2 2 etbe degradation pathway to elucidate the etbe degradation pathway we added 50 μm 13c6 labeled etbe as carbon source to the microbial community in the fed batch reactor 13c labeled nahco3 increased over time fig 2 at day 1 13c labeled tba was below the detection limit of the nmr but 49 μm tba was measured by gc fid equipped with an spme from day 1 the 13c labeled etbe tba ratio increased up to a ratio of 2 2 for the second 13c6 etbe dosage 29 days measured by nmr fig 2 after a third dosage of 13c6 etbe 48 days tba was detected just above the base line of the nmr spectrum 3 2 3 microbial community neither the functional gene mdpa coding for mtbe monooxygenase nor the ethb gene encoding cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit were detected in the fed batch culture in contrast the functional gene hcma was detected at relatively high copy numbers in fed bath reactor samples 20 0

copies respectively in our system 4 discussion the goals of this study were i to determine the etbe degradation capacity ii to resolve the etbe degradation pathway and iii to characterize the phylogenetic composition of the microbial community involved in etbe degradation in contaminated groundwater in this study it was found that algae play an important role in the etbe loss we therefore hypothesize that the oxygen produced by the algae was used by bacteria to degrade the etbe aerobically fig 5 the presence of algae in the monitoring well of this study might be the result of i percolating rainwater ii surface water recharge from the nearby stream iii contamination by recirculated drilling fluids when the monitoring well was installed or iv growth of algae in the groundwater brad et al 2008 sinclair and ghiorse 1989 a previous study observed a diverse microeukaryotic community at a depth of 1 5 m below the surface in an aquifer polluted with landfill leachate brad et al 2008 this finding is in line with the detection of algae at 2 5 m below the surface in our study 4 1 etbe degradation in microcosms under different redox conditions the microcosms with gasoline contaminated groundwater without any addition of electron acceptor or medium and the microcosms containing groundwater at different redox conditions did not show etbe degradation in the dark the aerobic microbial community in this groundwater degraded the etbe 33 6 2 4 μm day in the lower range of degradation rates as reported previously under aerobic conditions 35 2208 μm day fayolle et al 1998 kharoune et al 2002 le digabel et al 2013 ohkubo and yagi 2012 the higher aerobic etbe degradation rates determined in previous studies might be due to the fact that those cultures were either pure cultures or enrichments obtained with etbe at relatively high oxygen concentrations the microbial community described in our study was obtained from anoxic groundwater containing a mixture of contaminants including etbe and enriched at oxygen concentrations lower than 0 1 the microcosm without electron acceptor and medium addition containing up to 50 oxygen produced by algae in a day night light cycle degraded etbe at a lower rate 0 8 0 1 μm day compared with these previous reported rates this might be due to the fact that this microcosm had been incubated without oxygen in the dark for 872 days before exposure to light to induce oxygen production by the algae scenedesmus and or chlorella in this microcosm containing groundwater without electron acceptor and medium tba was not accumulating over time indicating further degradation of tba after exposure to light wilson et al 2001 4 2 etbe degradation in a fed batch reactor the etbe degradation rates in the fed batch reactor from 1 0 0 2 μm day 1 to 6 7 1 6 μm day 1 are lower than those found in aerobic cultures in microcosms these lower rates could be explained by the fact that the fed batch reactor in this study was micro oxic 0 1 o2 resulting in oxygen limited growth instead of having a sufficiently high oxygen concentration for exponential growth when the fed batch reactor was continuously exposed to light 4125 lux the degradation rate was 6 8 1 5 μm day 1 and the oxygen concentration increased to a value of up to 10 the similar degradation rates under micro oxic and oxic conditions might be due to the fact that the microbial community described in our study was obtained from anoxic groundwater and enriched at oxygen concentrations lower than 0 1 no etbe degradation was observed under anoxic conditions in the dark this result is in line with the hypothesis that microalgae in the groundwater produce oxygen under light conditions which is subsequently used by the bacteria to degrade etbe in addition the cytochrome p450 inhibitor metyrapone interrupted the etbe degradation this result is in line with previous studies suggesting that a cytochrome p450 is involved in the oxidative cleavage of the ether bond chauvaux et al 2001 schuster et al 2013 furthermore the addition of 100 μg ml cycloheximide in the presence of oxygen did not have an effect on the etbe degradation rate suggesting that the eukaryotes microalgae in the groundwater did not degrade the etbe it might be possible that phototrophic bacteria such as members of the rhodobacteraceae degrade the etbe as was suggested for halogenated benzoic acids woude et al 1994 and chlorinated organic compounds bender et al 1995 the ethb gene encoding the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit was not detected in the etbe degrading microbial community this suggests that other mono oxygenase enzymes were active in this community which were not detected by the ethb assay targeting the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase subunit of the ethabcd system of aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 developed by schuster and co workers schuster et al 2013 rosell and co workers showed that in a mixed culture of methylibium sp pm1 and aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 under low oxygen concentrations 2 strain l108 employing ethabcd is more competitive in degrading mtbe compared to strain pm 1 employing mdpa rosell et al 2010 hence the results by rosell et al suggest that an ethabcd system might have a higher affinity for oxygen and thus might be suitable for oxygenate degradation under low oxygen conditions this is in line with our results as introduced a symbiotic algal bacterial system could increase the mtbe degradation rate due to higher dissolved oxygen concentrations as a result of photosynthesis zhong et al 2011 john and co workers found that certain species of algae can produce ethanol during dark anaerobic fermentation john et al 2011 no ethanol was measured in the dark anaerobic microcosm with bg 11 broth suggesting that the algae chlorella and scenedesmus in this study did not produce ethanol therefore the measured ethanol in the fed batch reactor is most likely a metabolite in the etbe degradation pathway possibly ethanol is produced from acetaldehyde when the ethoxy group is released from etbe by the action of p450 monooxygenase as our system is oxygen limited further oxidation of ethanol may be constrained alternatively ethanol may have been produced from tba under micro oxic conditions the initial 13c labeled tba concentrations were too low to be detected by nmr after 24 h 13c tba concentrations increased relatively compared with declining 13c etbe concentrations indicating that tba is indeed a metabolite from etbe degradation this is in line with previous reports suggesting that tba is the main metabolite of etbe degradation kharoune et al 2002 ohkubo and yagi 2012 although 13co2 was detected by nmr we were not sure if complete etbe degradation up to co2 was occurring the high concentrations of the hcma gene 20 0 5 7 104 gene copies ml sample compared to total bacterial 16s rrna gene copies 7 5 2 1 104 gene copies ml sample may suggest that there are multiple hcma gene copies in the dna of bacteria however we cannot rule out the possibility that our hcma primers amplify other genes with high sequence similarity having said that the observed relatively high amount of hcma genes suggests that etbe was degraded via tba and 2 hydroxyisobuyrate according to the metabolic pathway involving 2 hydroxyisobutyryl coa mutase as was suggested previously rohwerder et al 2006 while being beyond the scope of the current study future experiments should include analysis of the hcma gene at the rna level to confirm that this gene is expressed during growth on etbe total archaeal 16s rrna genes were detected at high concentrations of 1 4 0 2 104 gene copies ml sample in the fed batch reactor albeit their role in the etbe degradation is not known analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing profiles revealed a similar phylogenetic diversity and otu number for the pooled 12c and 13c fractions the analysis indicated that total and active members of the communities represented by the light and heavy dna fractions respectively were very similar to each other this similarity between labeled and unlabeled nucleic acids is in agreement with previous studies rettedal and brözel 2015 thomson et al 2013 these studies found that while metabolically inactive bacteria or extracellular dna was present the similarity between labeled and unlabeled dna indicated that most recovered otus had metabolically active representatives in this community it may also be that the 13c etbe concentrations used in this study were not sufficient to measure a change in phylogenetic diversity in the heavy carbon fraction relatively high numbers of comamonadaceae and candidatus moranbacteria were detected in the fed batch reactor this result is in line with a previous study were a strain of comamonas testosteroni was isolated with the ability to degrade etbe as the sole source of carbon and energy kharoune et al 2001 the usage of this algal bacterial culture to degrade etbe might be of interest in groundwater or wastewater treatment plants aboveground the microbial community from the contaminated site degraded etbe at daylight area 50 cm2 650 lux at rates similar to increased light intensity using a lamp 4125 lux groundwater or wastewater treatment aboveground could be achieved using for example basins illuminated by daylight or artificial light in which both algae and bacteria may flourish 5 conclusion this is the first study describing degradation of etbe in an algal bacterial culture in this culture algae i e chlorella or scenedesmus use light to produce oxygen which is consumed by the bacterial community to aerobically degrade etbe the algal bacterial interaction in this study has advantages compared with conventional aerobic treatments firstly this interaction represents a closed system without the need for aeration therefore the risk of etbe evaporation is minimized secondly there is no need for expensive external oxygen supply more research aiming at a better understanding and control of the etbe degradation rates pathway and the responsible microbes is needed to explore the possibilities to implement such algal bacterial consortia in for example groundwater or wastewater treatment declaration of interests none acknowledgement we would like to thank fredericke hannes and miguel dionisio pires deltares utrecht
