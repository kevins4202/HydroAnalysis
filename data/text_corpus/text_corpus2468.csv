adsorbent in treatment of fluorinated wastewater graphical abstract fx1 keywords defluoridation zeolite naa adsorption studies cost analysis 1 introduction prevalence of excessive amounts of fluoride f ions in water mainly groundwater has been a serious issue since decades fluorine exists as fluoride in minerals like fluorspar caf2 cryolite na3alfpo6 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f etc ghosh et al 2013 fluoride is a protoplasmic toxin which in lesser or higher amounts has adverse effects on human health tor et al 2009 fluoride ions have the tendency to replace the hydroxide isomorphically within the apatite network due to the stable nature of fluorapatite kps 3 16 10 60 and same ionic radii and charge of hydroxide and fluoride anions as a result this hydroxyl apatite binds with the fluoride ions resulting in the formation of a re mineralized veneer with the composition of fluorapatite on the enamel s surface the original hydroxyapatite is comparably less acid resistant than the resulting veneer these surface phenomena are responsible for prevention of cavities which generally occur during and after tooth eruption but when the hydroxyapatite concentration increases excessively it results in skeletal fluorosis and mottling of the enamel hortigüela et al 2013 the permissible concentration of fluoride in drinking water are 1 5 mg l 1 0 mg l 4 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively as prescribed by who world health organization is indian standard usepa u s environment protection agency and eu european union al rimawi et al 2013 who 2006 different concentrations of fluoride have various effects on human health which is presented in table 1 as per reports suggested by bhattacharya and chakrabarti bhattacharya and chakrabarti 2011 fluoride exists as a fluorinated calcium phosphatic compound called apatite earlier experiments corroborate that several factors result in fluoride contamination in the saturated zone of groundwater water from the fluoride bearing rocks dutta et al 2014 the existence of na k ca mg hco3 favouring incessant erosion from the fluoride borne rocks in the alkaline circulating water was confirmed from analysis of water samples subbarao 2011 several technologies are reported for elimination of fluoride from water like reverse osmosis nano filtration electro dialysis precipitation etc rao and karthikeyan 2012 mourabet et al 2015 kut et al 2016 but these methods have several disadvantages which include high initial cost alkaline ph of treated water production of huge amount of chemical and biological sludge etc ghorai and pant 2005 adsorption is a highly preferred technique over others due to its low cost easy operability high efficiency easy accessibility eco friendliness and re usability and regeneration of adsorbents hortigüela et al 2013 jagtap et al 2012 nupearachchi et al 2017 selection and performance of material used as adsorbent greatly determines the effectiveness of the adsorption process eyer et al 2014 the sorptive capability of the adsorbent depends on surface area availability of active sites on the adsorbent ph of solution time required for fluoride uptake probable interaction with other ions and cost effectiveness hortigüela et al 2013 madera parra et al 2015 recently more attention is being paid towards adsorbent preparation from synthetic natural and waste materials for fluoride removal from water various forms of adsorbents are being used in removal of fluoride bhatnagar et al 2011 ferrari et al 2010 some of them being compounds comprising oxygen silica gel zeolites rice husk biochar goswami and kumar 2017 carbon activated carbon graphite halder et al 2015 teutli sequeira et al 2015 hydroxyapatitie nanoparticle maity et al 2018 and polymer viswanathan et al 2013 zeolites are naturally occurring three dimensional crystalline microporous alumina silicates comprising si and al oxide tetrahedral with oxygen at the vertices nano structured zeolites like faujasite x and y naa silicalite 1 and zsm 5 have been prepared by hydrothermal methods in presence of organic templates by employing alumina silicate solutions ghasemi and younesi 2011 but there are various disadvantages of using organic templates such as highly expensive non recyclable and calcinations which lead to pollution associated with the production process wang et al 2000 rice husk has often been utilized as a source compound for silica to produce a beta and zsm 5 zeolites since it is low priced and easily available ghasemi and younesi 2011 as per literature survey removal of fluoride by using synthesized zeolite naa has not been reported yet hence the novelty of the present investigation lies on assessing the defluoridation capability of zeolite naa derived from rice husk ash and calculating the cost involved in adsorbent preparation and water treatment therefore the objectives of the present study involved silica extraction from rice husk and synthesis of a potential zeolite from the extracted silica at room temperature to be used as an adsorbent in the selective uptake of fluoride from simulated wastewater furthermore individual effects of several parametric conditions such as initial f concentration ph temperature contact time and adsorbent dosage on sorptive uptake of fluoride by the sorbent were investigated to determine the optimised conditions of fluoride removal from simulated wastewater the study also gives discusses about the expenses incurred in adsorbent preparation for estimation of its cost effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in

adsorption buffer concentrated hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride varying concentrations of fluoride stock solutions viz 1 5 10 15 and 20 mg l matching the concentration of groundwater were prepared through dissolution of required amounts of sodium fluoride in 1000 ml distilled water due to its less hygroscopic nature naf was opted as source compound of fluoride halder et al 2015 2 2 silica extraction from rice husk the entire procedure of extracting silica from rice husk was followed according to standard procedure mentioned by ghasemi and younesi 2011 rice husks obtained from

then filtered and soaked in 37 of 1 m hcl these were again washed with distilled water dried in air and calcined at 700 c maintaining a continuous heating rate of 10 c min for 6 h ash that was obtained from calcination of rice husk was mixed with98 of 2 m naoh solution and heated for 12 h concentrated hcl was added to the dissolved ash for full precipitation this precipitated solution was filtered then washed several times with distilled water to get rid of chloride ions and finally drying overnight 2 3 zeolite naa synthesis hydrothermal treatment was used in the synthesis of zeolite naa according to procedure mentioned in literature goyal et al 2015 about 50 g l and 80 g l concentrations of fumed silica and naalo2 respectively were dissolved in separate solutions comprising the same quantities of naoh solutions that is 156 g l followed by mixing of these two solutions in a b o d incubator cum shaker bis 12lx lab x india at constant agitation speed of 250 rpm at 25 2 c the effect of ageing time on crystallization and other physical properties were studied where samples were collected at standard intervals between 0 and 72 h the synthesized zeolite particles were centrifuged for 30 min at 17 000 rpm followed by washing with distilled water the particles were then kept in a hot air oven for drying for about 12 h at 110 c 2 4 characterization and instrumental analysis of adsorbent surface area and pore volume of the obtained zeolite naa were analyzed from n2 adsorption desorption measurements using which have been reported in one of our previous works smart sorb 92 93 quantachrome autosorb 1 bet surface area analyzer smart instruments usa was used to measure the surface area and pore volume of the synthesized zeolite proximate analysis of rice husk was determined by following the standard procedure of astm d 121 mukherjee and halder 2016 using muffle furnace servotronics dic 9681 usa scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6360 japan was employed to analyze the zeolite before placing in the microscope prepared zeolite naa was uniformly coated with palladium in order to enhance the sample s conductivity the sample was coated with the help of an auto fine coater jeol jfc 1600 and then dried using ir lamp followed by analysis of the sample the nature of zeolite naa fluoride ion interactions was analyzed by ftir using smart omni transmission is 10 ftir spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa 2 5 point of zero charge analysis the ph drift method was used to measure the ph at point zero charge phpzc of sorbent mukherjee and halder 2016 0 01 mol l sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid was used to adjust ph of the solution dissolved carbon dioxide was eliminated by purging nitrogen gas to the solution at 30 c a wide range of ph was maintained between 1 and 11 and 105 mg best adsorbent dosage of synthesized zeolite naa was added to 50 ml of the solution after stabilization the final ph was obtained and phpzc of the adsorbent was approximately 5 when the zeolite was in solution its ph value was lower than 5 due to the existence of positively charged ions on its surfaces which caused their interaction with negatively charged fluoride ions yalcin et al 2004 2 6 adsorption studies batch adsorption studies were executed in order to analyze the individual effects of initial fluoride concentration ph contact time adsorbent dosage and operating temperature on the fluoride removal efficiency of zeolite naa about 105 mg of zeolite naa was dissolved in 100 ml of varying concentrations of fluoride aqueous solution 1 5 10 15 and 20 mg l and the mixture was agitated in a b o d cum incubator shaker bis 12lx lab x india the experiments were conducted at different ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 and temperature range 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 and 65 c kinetics of adsorption was determined by measuring the quantity of fluoride adsorbed at differing time intervals of 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h respectively isotherm studies were carried out to assess the adsorptive capacity by adding varying doses of adsorbent 15 45 75 105 120 and 150 mg and stirring the mixture for equilibrium time the quantity of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent was determined by measuring the fluoride uptake from adsorbent dissolved fluoride solution using a fluoride ion selective electrode thermo scientific orion star a214 ph and ise benchtop meter usa all the experiments were conducted in triplicates the mean of which was used for conducting further experiments the remaining fluoride concentration in the adsorbent phase q e mg g was estimated by using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e w v where q e represents quantity of fluoride sorbed mg g c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride in solution w g is the weight of the adsorbent and v l is the volume sinha et al 2003 eq 2 was used to measure the percentage of fluoride removal 2 re m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 2 6 1 adsorption equilibrium information about the adsorption data at equilibrium is usually provided by various isotherm models that is the relation between the mass of solute adsorbed per unit mass of sorbent at equilibrium mehdizadeh et al 2014 freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r adsorption isotherm equilibrium models igwe and abia 2007 thakkar et al 2015 were used to investigate the surface coverage either by physisorption or chemisorption of the zeolite fluoride adsorption system the langmuir s adsorption isotherm as given by eq 3 was used to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity q m mg g of the zeolite naa and a constant b which is related to the affinity of the binding sites mg 1 mohan et al 2007 3 1 q e q 1 c e q b q m 1 q m where q e q represents amount of adsorbate mg g that is fluoride adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent and c e q is the concentration of fluoride uptake at equilibrium mg l freundlich s isotherm model determines the non ideal type of adsorption which includes heterogeneous adsorption phenomenon studied by the linearized form of eq 4 4 ln q e q ln k f 1 n ln c e q where k f mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are empirical constants respectively the d r isotherm was used to analyze the porosity of the adsorbent and apparent energy of adsorption linear form the equation is given by eq 5 5 ln q e ln q d 2 b d r t ln 1 1 c e 2 where q e represents the quantity of fluoride adsorbed mg g q d mg g represents the d r isotherm constant related to the degree of fluoride adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent b d mol2 kj 2 is the free energy of the sorption per mole of the adsorbate as it drifts towards the surface of the adsorbent from infinite distance in the solution and c e is the concentration of unadsorbed fluoride in solution mg l ln q e is plotted against r t ln 1 1 c e in order to determine the fit of the isotherm to the sorption study the apparent energy kj mol 1 denoted by e of adsorption is defined as the transfer of one mole of ion in solution from infinity to the adsorbent surface hannachi et al 2014 it is generally used to predict the nature of adsorption which is calculated using eq 6 6 e 1 2 b d 1 2 2 6 2 adsorption kinetics kinetic data of the present study was studied with two kinetic models yang and al duri 2005 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic yalcin et al 2004 the kinetic data obtained were correlated with linear forms of these two models pseudo first order and second order kinetic models presume that sorption is a pseudo chemical reaction where the rate of uptake could be analyzed by the first order and second order reaction rate equations as shown in eqs 7 and 8 respectively bhaumik et al 2013 7 ln q e q t ln q e k a d t 8 t q 1 h 1 q e t 9 h b 2 q e 2 where q e mg l is the solid phase concentration of fluoride at equilibrium q t mg g is the average solid phase concentration at contact time t min k a d min 1 and b 2 g mg min are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order rate constants respectively and h is the initial adsorption rate mg g min 2 6 3 thermodynamics evaluation of thermodynamic parameters of fluoride sorption onto zeolite naa was investigated in terms of thermodynamic properties viz gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs keeping the fluoride concentration contact time ph and adsorbent dose constant as 10 mg l 4 h 5 and 105 mg respectively gibbs free energy at respective temperature was calculated from eq 10 and the change in enthalpy and entropy was calculated from eq 11 10 δ g 0 r t ln b a 11 δ h 0 δ g 0 t δ s 0 where r represents the universal gas constant 8 314 10 3 kj mol 1 k t is the absolute temperature in kelvin k b a is the adsorption constant at equilibrium derived from langmuir s equation at corresponding temperature δh kj mol δs kj mol k and δg kj mol are the enthalpy entropy and gibbs free energy respectively these aforementioned parameters were determined from adsorption data obtained at various temperatures using the above thermodynamic equations to analyze the nature of adsorption process which is strongly dependent on temperature the values of δh and δs can be obtained from the slope and intercept of δg v s 1 t 2 7 error estimation to evaluate the efficiency of used models root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used which were estimated by using the following eqs 12 and 13 hafshejani et al 2015 12 r 2 i 1 n o i o a

of the predicted measurement o ave is mean of the experimental values and p ave is the mean of predicted values 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent proximate analysis of rice husk suggested the presence of 8 26 moisture 72 33 volatile matter 19 92 ash and a fixed carbon content of 7 75 it was seen that surface area and pore volume of the resulting zeolite increased with ageing as reported in one of our papers goyal et al 2015 the surface area of zeolite naa was found to increase from 54 to 76 m2 g as the ageing time was increased from 24 to 72 h which was higher as compared to previous reports waghmare et al 2015 similarly there was increase in the pore volume with increase in ageing time from 0 04 to 0 13 cm3 g 3 2 instrumental characterization fig 1 a and b represents the sem images of the raw and spent adsorbent fig 1 a clearly depicts the crystals of zeolite with smooth surface with the adherence of fluoride ions onto the adsorbent s surface tiny particles appear on its surface as can be seen in fig 1 b fig 2 represents the ftir spectra of the raw and fluoride loaded adsorbent as can be seen from the figure both forms have similar spectra with only slight variations in peaks and transmission intensities in the fluoride loaded zeolite in raw zeolite stretch vibration of zeolite was observed at 2600 cm 1 2500 cm 1 and 2400 cm 1 the strong intensities of the transmittance of peak at 3300 cm 1 in both forms suggest strong c h bonds with alkynyl stretch this peak was not observed in the fluoride loaded zeolite these differences might be due to the uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent a weaker peak at 3400 cm 1 indicated medium n h stretch with primary and tertiary amines and amides as the functional groups characteristic absorption intensities of fluoride loaded zeolite naa at variable stretch at 2400 cm 1 increased after fluoride adsorption which might be because of the interaction among the fluoride ions and the functional groups present on the surface of zeolite naa 3 3 effect of individual parameters on removal percentage the individual effect of each parameter viz ph adsorbent dosage initial concentration temperature and contact time was taken into consideration since the adsorptive capability of an adsorbent is highly enhanced by these properties with each parameter having either similar or different effect mukherjee and halder 2016 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on the fluoride uptake by zeolite naa was studied in the range of 2 8 as can be seen from fig 3 a a gradual increase in the fluoride uptake was observed with rise in ph and highest removal was obtained at ph 5 with initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l and temperature of 45 c but a steep decrease in the adsorption rate was seen when the ph was beyond 5 at acidic ph availability of h ions in the solution is more which formed weakly ionized hydrofluoric acid hf with fluoride as a result the fluoride ions remain dissolved in the solution in the form of hf with increasing ph the number of hydroxyl oh ions increase which lowers the fluoride uptake by the adsorbent since the negatively charged oh ions also compete for the active sites present on the adsorbent 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent dosage required for fluoride removal determines the efficiency of an adsorbent in the present study the adsorbent doses were varied from 15 to 150 mg and the best dose was found to be 105 mg with a maximum fluoride removal of 90 when the initial fluoride concentration was 10 mg l at a temperature of 45 c and a contact time of 4 h fig 3 b represents the effect of adsorbent dose on fluoride adsorption onto zeolite naa it was seen that the removal percentage increased from 20 3 to 90 as the dose of adsorbent was increased from 15 to 105 mg but it was also seen that the removal percentage decreased gradually as the adsorbent dose was further increased beyond 105 mg because of the conglomeration of excessive adsorbent particles wherein the available surface area does not increase leading to lowered f adsorption mukherjee and halder 2016 the initial increase in fluoride uptake with increase in adsorbent dosage might be due to the increase in adsorbent particles therefore more surface area was available for fluoride ion adherence mehdizadeh et al 2014 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration the ability of an adsorbent to reduce or degrade the fluoride concentration at varying concentrations ranging from minimum to maximum enables to determine the potentiality of a substance to be regarded as an effective adsorbent the synthetic fluoride solution in the present study comprised five different concentrations viz 1 5 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively matching the concentrations of contaminated groundwater the adsorbent zeolite naa could effectively reduce the fluoride concentration when the initial concentration was 10 mg l the reason for fluoride uptake at lower concentrations might be because of the availability of active sites which decrease with rise in fluoride concentrations erdem et al 2004 fig 3 c represents the effect of initial concentration on fluoride removal by zeolite naa 3 3 4 effect of temperature temperature is one of the key parameters in an adsorption study which determines the cost effectiveness of an adsorbent that is lowered temperature indicates less consumption of electricity the temperature range was varied from 30 to 65 c fig 3 d represents the effect of temperature on fluoride removal by zeolite naa literature review suggests that the adsorption process in general is enhanced by increase in temperature the reason being higher selectivity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate or increase in the number of active sites coruh and ergun 2009 at elevated temperature the system s energy promotes the binding of the fluoride ions onto the adsorbent s surface arief et al 2008 as can be observed from the graph the optimum temperature was found to be 45 c when the maximum removal was 90 and it slowly decreased when the temperature increased to 65 c this can be attributed to the fact that at low temperature the vander waal s forces are relatively weaker which might lead to lesser interaction between zeolite naa and fluoride ions therefore the interaction was proper at medium temperature due to comparably stronger van der waal s forces whereas at elevated temperature adsorption efficiency decreases as a result of breakage in ionic bond mukherjee and halder 2016 3 3 5 effect of contact time the effect of contact time was determined by varying the time intervals within 0 6 h keeping other parameters constant time taken by an adsorbent to achieve maximum fluoride removal also predicts the efficiency of an adsorbent that is lesser the contact time the higher is the rate of adsorption as shown in fig 3 e uptake of fluoride by zeolite naa was 89 at 4 h the adsorption of fluoride was initially increasing with increase in time which can be due to occurrence of diffusion in the pores present on the adsorbent s surface tripathy et al 2006 further decrease in fluoride removal beyond 4 h might be due to less availability of vacant sites on the adsorbent which caused lowered mass transfer of the fluoride ions to the exterior surface of zeolite naa from the liquid bulk mehdizadeh et al 2014 3 4 adsorption equilibrium fig 4 a b and c represents the langmuir freundlich and d r isothermal plots for the present sorption study a comparative study of the defluoridation capabilities of various zeolites is represented in table 2 table 3 a b and c presents the calculated parameters of the three isotherm models the value of correlation coefficients r 2 obtained for freundlich isotherm 0 9903 was higher in comparison to the one obtained for langmuir isotherm 0 9574 higher rmse values of langmuir 0 1943 and d r isotherms 0 1721 were obtained which indicated the non suitability of the two models higher correlation coefficient and least rmse value 0 0814 of freundlich isotherm suggested the suitability of the model the r 2 value for d r isotherm was 0 9594 which suggested a moderately good fit to the experimental data when compared to freundlich isotherm therefore it can be recommended that the surface of the adsorbent was heterogeneous in nature the maximum adsorption capacity q m and langmuir constant b of zeolite naa were 22 83 mg g and 19 92 mg 1 respectively the apparent energy was 1 284 kj mol 1 and the e value was less than 8 kj mol 1 monika et al 2009 3 5 adsorption kinetics the present sorption study is not explainable by pseudo first order kinetics because the correlation coefficients r2 obtained for each concentration were less than obtained for pseudo second order kinetic model least rmse 0 0677 was also obtained in case of pseudo second order kinetics whereas it was higher 0 1183 for pseudo first order kinetics hence it can be said that the present sorption study obeyed the pseudo second order kinetics the linear plots of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic plots are given in fig 5 a and b and table 4 represents the calculated kinetic parameters of the two models 3 6 thermodynamics the values of δh and δs were obtained from the slope and intercept of δg v s 1 t as shown in fig 6 the values of δh δs and δg are tabulated in table 5 the positive values of enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs indicate the endothermic irreversibility and increased randomness of the sorption process at the solid liquid interface during fluoride uptake it was also observed that the standard free energy change δg of the process decreased with increasing temperature which suggests the spontaneity and feasibility of the process 4 cost analysis adsorbent preparation the efficiency of any removal process employed at commercial level largely depends on the cost involved in adsorbent preparation and the entire removal process the present study involves the use of zeolite naa in fluoride removal silica used in the process was extracted from rice husks instead of buying commercially available silica rice husks are waste products usually thrown away as they are mostly indigestible to humans which was the most important factor governing the choice of adsorbent the rice husks were available from a nearby mill absolutely free of cost in our study we have used 1 7 kg of rice husk from which we obtained 340 g of rice husk ash which yielded 303 g of silica around 1 26 g of silica yields approximately 0 39 g of zeolite naa which corroborated with the results reported by ghasemi and younesi 2011 therefore in our study we obtained 94 g of zeolite naa from 303 g of silica the cost of development of zeolite from rice husk has not been reported yet as per literature review the cost estimation of adsorbent preparation has been done following the methodology mentioned in previous literatures dhawane et al 2016 cost of adsorbent production comprises collection and preparation of adsorbent cost estimation of preparing 94 g of zeolite naa is calculated in united states dollar usd which is as follows cost of rice husk crh 0 0

cost for zeolite naa production crh csr ccrh drh csf cc cec 23 72 usd o v e r h e a d c h arge 10 o f o v e r a l l c o s t 0 1 23 72 2 372 u s d n e t c o s t o f z e o l i t e n a a p r o d u c t i o n 23 72 2 372 26 092 u s d the above cost analysis suggests that the preparation of zeolite naa was a cost effective process since the price of 100 g of commercially available zeolite sigma aldrich is 97 03 usd 94 g of the synthesized zeolite can be used to treat approximately 100 l of wastewater therefore it can be said that the utilization of an agricultural by product in the synthesis of zeolite naa resulted in the development of a high value added product from a useless product 5 conclusions the present study has successfully established the efficiency of zeolite naa in sorption of fluoride from aqueous solution maximum removal of 90 was achieved with an adsorbent dosage of 105 mg when 10 mg l was the fluoride concentration ph of the solution was 5 at a temperature of 45 c and contact time of 4 h the linearized plot of freundlich isotherm model was found to be the best fit to the sorption process higher correlation coefficient of pseudo second order kinetics obtained for each initial concentration suggested that the sorption process obeyed it feasibility spontaneity and randomness of the process were determined from thermodynamic parameters negative value of gibbs free energy suggested the process to be endothermic and irreversible ftir spectra suggested the presence of functional groups like primary and tertiary amines and amides responsible for fluoride adsorption cost analysis also confirmed the cost effectiveness of zeolite naa hence it can be conclusively said that zeolite naa could be an efficient adsorbent in uptake of fluoride due to its cost

adsorbent in treatment of fluorinated wastewater graphical abstract fx1 keywords defluoridation zeolite naa adsorption studies cost analysis 1 introduction prevalence of excessive amounts of fluoride f ions in water mainly groundwater has been a serious issue since decades fluorine exists as fluoride in minerals like fluorspar caf2 cryolite na3alfpo6 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f etc ghosh et al 2013 fluoride is a protoplasmic toxin which in lesser or higher amounts has adverse effects on human health tor et al 2009 fluoride ions have the tendency to replace the hydroxide isomorphically within the apatite network due to the stable nature of fluorapatite kps 3 16 10 60 and same ionic radii and charge of hydroxide and fluoride anions as a result this hydroxyl apatite binds with the fluoride ions resulting in the formation of a re mineralized veneer with the composition of fluorapatite on the enamel s surface the original hydroxyapatite is comparably less acid resistant than the resulting veneer these surface phenomena are responsible for prevention of cavities which generally occur during and after tooth eruption but when the hydroxyapatite concentration increases excessively it results in skeletal fluorosis and mottling of the enamel hortigüela et al 2013 the permissible concentration of fluoride in drinking water are 1 5 mg l 1 0 mg l 4 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively as prescribed by who world health organization is indian standard usepa u s environment protection agency and eu european union al rimawi et al 2013 who 2006 different concentrations of fluoride have various effects on human health which is presented in table 1 as per reports suggested by bhattacharya and chakrabarti bhattacharya and chakrabarti 2011 fluoride exists as a fluorinated calcium phosphatic compound called apatite earlier experiments corroborate that several factors result in fluoride contamination in the saturated zone of groundwater water from the fluoride bearing rocks dutta et al 2014 the existence of na k ca mg hco3 favouring incessant erosion from the fluoride borne rocks in the alkaline circulating water was confirmed from analysis of water samples subbarao 2011 several technologies are reported for elimination of fluoride from water like reverse osmosis nano filtration electro dialysis precipitation etc rao and karthikeyan 2012 mourabet et al 2015 kut et al

the sorptive capability of the adsorbent depends on surface area availability of active sites on the adsorbent ph of solution time required for fluoride uptake probable interaction with other ions and cost effectiveness hortigüela et al 2013 madera parra et al 2015 recently more attention is being paid towards adsorbent preparation from synthetic natural and waste materials for fluoride removal from water various forms of adsorbents are being used in removal of fluoride bhatnagar et al 2011 ferrari et al 2010 some of them being compounds comprising oxygen silica gel zeolites rice husk biochar goswami and kumar 2017 carbon activated carbon graphite halder et al 2015 teutli sequeira et al 2015 hydroxyapatitie nanoparticle maity et al 2018 and polymer viswanathan et al 2013 zeolites are naturally occurring three dimensional crystalline microporous alumina silicates comprising si and al oxide tetrahedral with oxygen at the vertices nano structured zeolites like faujasite x and y naa silicalite 1 and zsm 5 have been prepared by hydrothermal methods in presence of organic templates by employing alumina silicate solutions ghasemi and younesi 2011 but there are various disadvantages of using organic templates such as highly expensive non recyclable and calcinations which lead to pollution associated with the production process wang et al 2000 rice husk has often been utilized as a source compound for silica to produce a beta and zsm 5 zeolites since it is low priced and easily available ghasemi and younesi 2011 as per literature survey removal of fluoride by using synthesized zeolite naa has not been reported yet hence the novelty of the present investigation lies on assessing the defluoridation capability of zeolite naa derived from rice husk ash and calculating the cost involved in adsorbent preparation and water treatment therefore the objectives of the present study involved silica extraction from rice husk and synthesis of a potential zeolite from the extracted silica at room temperature to be used as an adsorbent in the selective uptake of fluoride from simulated wastewater furthermore individual effects of several parametric conditions such as initial f concentration ph temperature contact time and adsorbent dosage on sorptive uptake of fluoride by the sorbent were investigated to determine the optimised conditions of fluoride removal from simulated wastewater the study also gives discusses about the expenses incurred in adsorbent preparation for estimation of its cost effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in

obtained from calcination of rice husk was mixed with98 of 2 m naoh solution and heated for 12 h concentrated hcl was added to the dissolved ash for full precipitation this precipitated solution was filtered then washed several times with distilled water to get rid of chloride ions and finally drying overnight 2 3 zeolite naa synthesis hydrothermal treatment was used in the synthesis of zeolite naa according to procedure mentioned in literature goyal et al 2015 about 50 g l and 80 g l concentrations of fumed silica and naalo2 respectively were dissolved in separate solutions comprising the same quantities of naoh solutions that is 156 g l followed by mixing of these two solutions in a b o d incubator cum shaker bis 12lx lab x india at constant agitation speed of 250 rpm at 25 2 c the effect of ageing time on crystallization and other physical properties were studied where samples were collected at standard intervals between 0 and 72 h the synthesized zeolite particles were centrifuged for 30 min at 17 000 rpm followed by washing with distilled water the particles were then kept in a hot air oven for drying for about 12 h at 110 c 2 4 characterization and instrumental analysis of adsorbent surface area and pore volume of the obtained zeolite naa were analyzed from n2 adsorption desorption measurements using which have been reported in one of our previous works smart sorb 92 93 quantachrome autosorb 1 bet surface area analyzer smart instruments usa was used to measure the surface area and pore volume of the synthesized zeolite proximate analysis of rice husk

auto fine coater jeol jfc 1600 and then dried using ir lamp followed by analysis of the sample the nature of zeolite naa fluoride ion interactions was analyzed by ftir using smart omni transmission is 10 ftir spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa 2 5 point of zero charge analysis the ph drift method was used to measure the ph at point zero charge phpzc of sorbent mukherjee and halder 2016 0 01 mol l sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid was used to adjust ph of the solution dissolved carbon dioxide was eliminated by purging nitrogen gas to the solution at 30 c a wide range of ph was maintained between 1 and 11 and 105 mg best adsorbent dosage of synthesized zeolite naa was added to 50 ml of the solution after stabilization the final ph was obtained and phpzc of the adsorbent was approximately 5 when the zeolite was in solution its ph value was lower than 5 due to the existence of positively charged ions on its surfaces which caused their interaction with negatively charged fluoride ions yalcin et al 2004 2 6 adsorption studies batch adsorption studies were executed in order to analyze the individual effects of initial fluoride concentration ph contact time adsorbent dosage and operating temperature on the fluoride removal efficiency of zeolite naa about 105 mg of zeolite naa was dissolved in 100 ml of varying concentrations of fluoride aqueous solution 1 5 10 15 and 20 mg l and the mixture was agitated in a b o d cum incubator shaker bis 12lx lab x india the experiments were conducted at different ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 and temperature range 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 and 65 c kinetics of adsorption was determined by measuring the quantity of fluoride adsorbed at differing time intervals of 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h respectively isotherm studies were carried out to assess the adsorptive capacity by adding varying doses of adsorbent 15 45 75 105 120 and 150 mg and stirring the mixture for equilibrium time the quantity of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent was determined by measuring the fluoride uptake from adsorbent dissolved fluoride solution using a fluoride ion selective electrode thermo scientific orion star a214 ph and ise benchtop meter usa all the experiments were conducted in triplicates the mean of which was used for conducting further experiments the remaining fluoride concentration in the adsorbent phase q e mg g was estimated by using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e w v where q e represents quantity of fluoride sorbed mg g c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride in solution w g is the weight of the adsorbent and v l is the volume sinha et al 2003 eq 2 was used to measure the percentage of fluoride removal 2 re m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 2 6 1 adsorption equilibrium information about the adsorption data at equilibrium is usually provided by various isotherm models that is the relation between the mass of solute adsorbed per unit mass of sorbent at equilibrium mehdizadeh et al 2014 freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich d r adsorption isotherm equilibrium models igwe and abia 2007 thakkar et al 2015 were used to investigate the surface coverage either by physisorption or chemisorption of the zeolite fluoride adsorption system the langmuir s adsorption isotherm as given by eq 3 was used to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity q m mg g of the zeolite naa and a constant b which is related to the affinity of the binding sites mg 1 mohan et al 2007 3 1 q e q 1 c e q b q m 1 q m where q e q represents amount of adsorbate mg g that is fluoride adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent and c e q is the concentration of fluoride uptake at equilibrium mg l freundlich s isotherm model determines the non ideal type of adsorption which includes heterogeneous adsorption phenomenon studied by the linearized form of eq 4 4 ln q e q ln k f 1 n ln c e q where k f mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are empirical constants respectively the d r isotherm was used to analyze the porosity of the adsorbent and apparent energy of adsorption linear form the equation is given by eq 5 5 ln q e ln q d 2 b d r t ln 1 1 c e 2 where q e represents the quantity of fluoride adsorbed mg g q d mg g represents the d

surface of the adsorbent from infinite distance in the solution and c e is the concentration of unadsorbed fluoride in solution mg l ln q e is plotted against r t ln 1 1 c e in order to determine the fit of the isotherm to the sorption study the apparent energy kj mol 1 denoted by e of adsorption is defined as the transfer of one mole of ion in solution from infinity to the adsorbent surface hannachi et al 2014 it is generally used to predict the nature of adsorption which is calculated using eq 6 6 e 1 2 b d 1 2 2 6 2 adsorption kinetics kinetic data of the present study was studied with two kinetic models yang and al duri 2005 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic yalcin et al 2004 the kinetic data obtained were correlated with linear forms of these two models pseudo first order and second order kinetic models presume that sorption is a pseudo chemical reaction where the rate of uptake could be analyzed by the first order and second order reaction rate equations as shown in eqs 7 and 8 respectively bhaumik et al 2013 7 ln q e q t ln q e k a d t 8 t q 1 h 1 q e t 9 h b 2 q e 2 where q e mg l is the solid phase concentration of fluoride at equilibrium q t mg g

adsorption rate mg g min 2 6 3 thermodynamics evaluation of thermodynamic parameters of fluoride sorption onto zeolite naa was investigated in terms of thermodynamic properties viz gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs keeping the fluoride concentration contact time ph and adsorbent dose constant as 10 mg l 4 h 5 and 105 mg respectively gibbs free energy at respective temperature was calculated from eq 10 and the change in enthalpy and entropy was calculated from eq 11 10 δ g 0 r t ln b a 11 δ h 0 δ g 0 t δ s 0 where r represents the universal gas constant 8 314 10 3 kj mol 1 k t is the absolute temperature in kelvin k b a is the adsorption constant at equilibrium derived from langmuir s equation at corresponding temperature δh kj mol δs kj mol k and δg kj mol are the enthalpy entropy and gibbs free energy respectively these aforementioned parameters were determined from adsorption data obtained at various temperatures using the above thermodynamic equations to analyze the nature of adsorption process which is strongly dependent on temperature the values of δh and δs can be obtained from the slope and intercept of δg v s 1 t 2 7 error estimation to evaluate the efficiency of used models root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used which were estimated by using the following eqs 12 and 13 hafshejani et al 2015 12 r 2 i 1 n o i o a

of the predicted measurement o ave is mean of the experimental values and p ave is the mean of predicted values 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent proximate analysis of rice husk suggested the presence of 8 26 moisture 72 33 volatile matter 19 92 ash and a fixed carbon content of 7 75 it was seen that surface area and pore volume of the resulting zeolite increased with ageing as reported in one of our papers goyal et al 2015 the surface area of zeolite naa was found to increase from 54 to 76 m2 g as the ageing time was increased from 24 to 72 h which was higher as compared to previous reports waghmare et al 2015 similarly there was increase in the pore volume with increase in ageing time from 0 04 to 0 13 cm3 g 3 2 instrumental characterization fig 1 a and b represents the sem images of the raw and spent adsorbent fig 1 a clearly depicts the crystals of zeolite with smooth surface with the adherence of fluoride ions onto the adsorbent s surface tiny particles appear on its surface as can be seen in fig 1 b fig 2 represents the ftir spectra of the raw and fluoride loaded adsorbent as can be seen from the figure both forms have similar spectra with only slight variations in peaks and transmission intensities in the fluoride loaded zeolite in raw zeolite stretch vibration of zeolite was observed at 2600 cm 1 2500 cm 1 and 2400 cm 1 the strong intensities of the transmittance of peak at 3300 cm 1 in both forms suggest strong c h bonds with alkynyl stretch this peak was not observed in the fluoride loaded zeolite these differences might be due to the uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent a weaker peak at 3400 cm 1 indicated medium n h stretch with primary and tertiary amines and amides as the functional groups characteristic absorption intensities of fluoride loaded zeolite naa at variable stretch at 2400 cm 1 increased after fluoride adsorption which might be because of the interaction among the fluoride ions and the functional groups present on the surface of zeolite naa 3 3 effect of individual parameters on removal percentage the individual effect of each parameter viz ph adsorbent dosage initial concentration temperature and contact time was taken into consideration since the adsorptive capability of an adsorbent is highly enhanced by these properties with each parameter having either similar or different effect mukherjee and halder 2016 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on the fluoride uptake by zeolite naa was studied in the range of 2 8 as can be seen from fig 3 a a gradual increase in the fluoride uptake was observed with rise in ph and highest removal was obtained at ph 5 with initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l and temperature of 45 c but a steep decrease in the adsorption rate was seen when the ph was beyond 5 at acidic ph availability of h ions in the solution is more which formed weakly ionized hydrofluoric acid hf with fluoride as a result the fluoride ions remain dissolved in the solution in the form of hf with increasing ph the number of hydroxyl oh ions increase which lowers the fluoride uptake by the adsorbent since the negatively charged oh ions also compete for the active sites present on the adsorbent 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent dosage required for fluoride removal determines the efficiency of an adsorbent in the present study the adsorbent doses were varied from 15 to 150 mg and the best dose was found to be 105 mg with a maximum fluoride removal of 90 when the initial fluoride concentration was 10 mg l at a temperature of 45 c and a contact time of 4 h fig 3 b represents the effect of adsorbent dose on fluoride adsorption onto zeolite naa it was seen that the removal percentage increased from 20 3 to 90 as the dose of adsorbent was increased from 15 to 105 mg but it was also seen that the removal percentage decreased gradually as the adsorbent dose was further increased beyond 105 mg because of the conglomeration of excessive adsorbent particles wherein the available surface area does not increase leading to lowered f adsorption mukherjee and halder 2016 the initial increase in fluoride uptake with increase in adsorbent dosage might be due to the increase in adsorbent particles therefore more surface area was available for fluoride ion adherence mehdizadeh et al 2014 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration the ability of an adsorbent to reduce or degrade the fluoride concentration at varying concentrations ranging from minimum to maximum enables to determine the potentiality of a substance to be regarded as an effective adsorbent the synthetic fluoride solution in the present study comprised five different concentrations viz 1 5 10 15 and 20 mg l respectively matching the concentrations of contaminated groundwater the adsorbent zeolite naa could effectively reduce the fluoride concentration when the initial concentration was 10 mg l the reason for fluoride uptake at lower concentrations might be because of the availability of active sites which decrease with rise in fluoride concentrations erdem et al 2004 fig 3 c represents the effect of initial concentration on fluoride removal by zeolite naa 3 3 4 effect of temperature temperature is one of the key parameters in an adsorption study which determines the cost effectiveness of an adsorbent that is lowered temperature indicates less consumption of electricity the temperature range was varied from 30 to 65 c fig 3 d represents the effect of temperature on fluoride removal by zeolite naa literature review suggests that the adsorption process in general is enhanced by increase in temperature the reason being higher selectivity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate or increase in the number of active sites coruh and ergun 2009 at elevated temperature the system s energy promotes the binding of the fluoride ions onto the adsorbent s surface arief et al 2008 as can be observed from the graph the optimum temperature was found to be 45 c when the maximum removal was 90 and it slowly decreased when the temperature increased to 65 c this can be attributed to the fact that at low temperature the vander waal s forces are relatively weaker which might lead to lesser interaction between zeolite naa and fluoride ions therefore the interaction was proper at medium temperature due to comparably stronger van der waal s forces whereas at elevated temperature adsorption efficiency decreases as a result of breakage in ionic bond mukherjee and halder 2016 3 3 5 effect of contact time the effect of contact time was determined by varying the time intervals within 0 6 h keeping other parameters constant time taken by an adsorbent to achieve maximum fluoride removal also predicts the efficiency of an adsorbent that is lesser the contact time the higher is the rate of adsorption as shown in fig 3 e uptake of fluoride by zeolite naa was 89 at 4 h the adsorption of fluoride was initially increasing with increase in time which can be due to occurrence of diffusion in the pores present on the adsorbent s surface tripathy et al 2006 further decrease in fluoride removal beyond 4 h might be due to less availability of vacant sites on the adsorbent which caused lowered mass transfer of the fluoride ions to the exterior surface of zeolite naa from the liquid bulk mehdizadeh et al 2014 3 4 adsorption equilibrium fig 4 a b and c represents the langmuir freundlich and d r isothermal plots for the present sorption study a comparative study of the defluoridation capabilities of various zeolites is represented in table 2 table 3 a b and c presents the calculated parameters of the three isotherm models the value of correlation coefficients r 2 obtained for freundlich isotherm 0 9903 was higher in comparison to the one obtained for langmuir isotherm 0 9574 higher rmse values of langmuir 0 1943 and d r isotherms 0 1721 were obtained which indicated the non suitability of the two models higher correlation coefficient and least rmse value 0 0814 of freundlich isotherm suggested the suitability of the model the r 2 value for d r isotherm was 0 9594 which suggested a moderately good fit to the experimental data when compared to freundlich isotherm therefore it can be recommended that the surface of the adsorbent was heterogeneous in nature the maximum adsorption capacity q m and langmuir constant b of zeolite naa were 22 83 mg g and 19 92 mg 1 respectively the apparent energy was 1 284 kj mol 1 and the e value was less than 8 kj mol 1 monika et al 2009 3 5 adsorption kinetics the present sorption study is not explainable by pseudo first order kinetics because the correlation coefficients r2 obtained for each concentration were less than obtained for pseudo second order kinetic model least rmse 0 0677 was also obtained in case of pseudo second order kinetics whereas it was higher 0 1183 for pseudo first order kinetics hence it can be said that the present sorption study obeyed the pseudo second order kinetics the linear plots of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic plots are given in fig 5 a and b and table 4 represents the calculated kinetic parameters of the two models 3 6 thermodynamics the values of δh and δs were obtained from the slope and intercept of δg v s 1 t as shown in fig 6 the values of δh δs and δg are tabulated in table 5 the positive values of enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs indicate the endothermic irreversibility and increased randomness of the sorption process at the solid liquid interface during fluoride uptake it was also observed that the standard free energy change δg of the process decreased with increasing temperature which suggests the spontaneity and feasibility of the process 4 cost analysis adsorbent preparation the efficiency of any removal process employed at commercial level largely depends on the cost involved in adsorbent preparation and the entire removal process the present study involves the use of zeolite naa in fluoride removal silica used in the process was extracted from rice husks instead of buying commercially available silica rice husks are waste products usually thrown away as they are mostly indigestible to humans which was the most important factor governing the choice of adsorbent the rice husks were available from a nearby mill absolutely free of cost in our study we have used 1 7 kg of rice husk from which we obtained 340 g of rice husk ash which yielded 303 g of silica around 1 26 g of silica yields approximately 0 39 g of zeolite naa which corroborated with the results reported by ghasemi and younesi 2011 therefore in our study we obtained 94 g of zeolite naa from 303 g of silica the cost of development of zeolite from rice husk has not been reported yet as per literature review the cost estimation of adsorbent preparation has been done following the methodology mentioned in previous literatures dhawane et al 2016 cost of adsorbent production comprises collection and preparation of adsorbent cost estimation of preparing 94 g of zeolite naa is calculated in united states dollar usd which is as follows cost of rice husk crh 0 0

cost for zeolite naa production crh csr ccrh drh csf cc cec 23 72 usd o v e r h e a d c h arge 10 o f o v e r a l l c o s t 0 1 23 72 2 372 u s d n e t c o s t o f z e o l i t e n a a p r o d u c t i o n 23 72 2 372 26 092 u s d the above cost analysis suggests that the preparation of zeolite naa was a cost effective process since the price of 100 g of commercially available zeolite sigma aldrich is 97 03 usd 94 g of the synthesized zeolite can be used to treat approximately 100 l of wastewater therefore it can be said that the utilization of an agricultural by product in the synthesis of zeolite naa resulted in the development of a high value added product from a useless product 5 conclusions the present study has successfully established the efficiency of zeolite naa in sorption of fluoride from aqueous solution maximum removal of 90 was achieved with an adsorbent dosage of 105 mg when 10 mg l was the fluoride concentration ph of the solution was 5 at a temperature of 45 c and contact time of 4 h the linearized plot of freundlich isotherm model was found to be the best fit to the sorption process higher correlation coefficient of pseudo second order kinetics obtained for each initial concentration suggested that the sorption process obeyed it feasibility spontaneity and randomness of the process were determined from thermodynamic parameters negative value of gibbs free energy suggested the process to be endothermic and irreversible ftir spectra suggested the presence of functional groups like primary and tertiary amines and amides responsible for fluoride adsorption cost analysis also confirmed the cost effectiveness of zeolite naa hence it can be conclusively said that zeolite naa could be an efficient adsorbent in uptake of fluoride due to its cost

resource for sustenance of all life form on the earth unfortunately in the past few decades its quality gets degraded mainly by human activities such as urbanization rapid population growth industrialization and unskilled utilization of natural water resources water gets polluted by many sources which include dumping of toxic industrial waste untreated sanitary and agricultural runoff bhatnagar et al 2015a 2015b ground water gets polluted by natural as well as anthropogenic sources dissolution of many f containing rocks and minerals fluorspar cryolite and fluorapatite are the major natural source of f contamination which gets contacted with ground water and surface water jagtap et al 2012 moreover the runoff of various industries i e fluoride chemical industry as well as the semiconductor metal processing fertilizer and glass manufacturing industries also contaminate the water raichur and basu 2001 shen et al 2003 the excessive concentration of f in drinking water has been considered as very hazardous for human health who 2006 toxicity of f depends upon its concentration within the permissible limit 1 5 mg l it is necessary for healthy development of tooth and bone in children mohan et al 2016 whereas the concentration of f beyond permissible limit exerts detrimental effects on human health such as dental and skeletal fluorosis brittle bones osteoporosis and arthritis moreover prolonged exposure of excess f to the living organism may also cause birth and immunological defects and can even induce cancer mohan et al 2016 around the world more than 20 countries including africa china srilanka and india are suffering from endemic fluorosis in india about 17 states are found to be fluorosis endemic and affect the health of approximate 1 million people jagtap et al 2012 due to the toxic effect of excessive f in water it is necessary to reduce the f concentration to the permissible limit so far various methods have been utilized for the f removal from water such as adsorption ion exchange precipitation and electrodialysis however these techniques showed drawbacks such as high operational and maintenance costs generation of toxic sludge and complicated procedure in comparison to these shortcomings adsorption method is extensively used technique because it is simple in procedure cheap and easy to operate teng et al 2009a 2009b ali and gupta 2007 in the past few years numerous approaches have been applied to the development of more economical and more efficient adsorbents based on the natural waste products which are being used for removal of pollutant from water because they are non toxic and abundant in nature the agricultural wastes are considered to be promising adsorbent due to their eco friendliness and their plentiful availability in nature bhatnagar et al 2015a 2015b activated carbon considered as one of the preferred adsorbents in comparison to other adsorbents for removal of the wide range of pollutant from the water adsorbent based on activated carbon found to be very efficient i e they show fast adsorption kinetics and very simple to apply in the past few years researchers are focused on the production of activated carbon from natural sources such as industrial and agricultural waste products because commercial activated carbon is very expensive for water treatment it has been prepared from many agricultural by products such as waste apricot rubber wood sawdust coconut shell sugar beet bagasse rice straw bamboo rattan sawdust molasses and oil palm fibre as they are inexpensive and renewable which can act as a precursor coconut husk is the mesocarp of coconut and a coconut contains about 35 of coconut husk coconut husk is extensively used as a fuel for household purpose and used to prepare rope and mats in india coconut husk is abundantly available as waste at various worship places and its disposal is very problematic so in order to utilize and to dispose this cheap and abundant agricultural waste it is proposed to convert coconut husk into activated carbon tan et al 2008 thus the synthesis of activated carbon from coconut husk gives dual advantage i e firstly this process solves the problem of disposal of coconut husk and secondly this agricultural by product is converted into excellent adsorbent for f ions from the above discussion it is revealed that activated carbon derived from coconut husk would be promising material to be used as adsorbent for the removal of f hence in the present study the adsorptive removal of f from water by activated carbon derived from coconut husk has been investigated in the fixed bed continuous column mode to address the possibility of industrial application furthermore the effect of flow rate f concentration and bed depth on breakthrough time was also investigated the various models were also used to analyze the breakthrough curve i e bdst thomas and yoon nelson models 2 materials and methods 2 1

dissolving the desired amount of naf in the dw further other solution of fluoride ion of different concentration was prepared by subsequent dilution of the stock solution 2 2 preparation of activated carbon from coconut husk in the current investigation the coconut husk utilized for preparation of activated carbon was acquired from the waste of different worship places of varanasi india the coconut husk was washed initially by distilled water to eradicated dirt and other contaminants then the washed coconut husk was dried for 6 h at 95 c to make it free from moisture further for the carbonization process the precursor was heated at 700 c in the purified nitrogen 99 9 atmosphere for 3 h and the heating rate was fixed at 10 c minute approximately after 75 min we got final

as 1 1 ach1 1 2 ach2 1 3 ach3 and 1 4 ach4 and dw was added to this mixture all the samples were kept for dehydration in the n2 atmosphere for 3 h at 350 c after that the activation was carried out in the same condition as carbonization but the final temperature was different finally the activated samples were cool down to the room temperature washed with hot dw the horizontal tubular furnace was used in the preparation process 2 3 characterization the microstructure of prepared activated carbon was investigated by using scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 200 and transmission electron microscope fei technai 20 g2 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of activated carbon was recorded using pro pan analytical surface area measurement was conducted by brunauer emmett teller bet method using micrometrics usa asap 2020 model thermal stability of the activated carbon was examined through thermo gravimetric analyzer tga using perkin elmer pyris 1 2 4 fixed bed column adsorption studies the continuous fixed bed column experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the prepared activated carbon for the removal of f from the water for this purpose a borosilicate glass cylinder of diameter 1 cm and length 30 cm was used as a column the effect of various parameters bed depth f concentration and flow rate on the performance of the column was studied during the column experiment the column was packed with the activated carbon in between the glass wool which is supported by glass beads to avoid the adsorbent from being washed away the ph of f solution was adjusted at 5 the optimum ph for the maximum uptake of f was determined using batch study and the solution was pumped into the column with the help of peristaltic pump miclins pp 10 the solution was injected in the upward direction from lower part of the column thereafter the samples were collected at definite interval of time from upper end of the column to analyze the concentration of f ions in the effluent solution by f ion selective electrode thermo orion expandable ion analyzer ea 940 the column was analyzed until the concentration of effluent became 99 of the initial f concentration 2 5 desorption and column regeneration studies in order to analyze the efficiency of the column for repetitive use the regeneration studies were also carried out for this purpose dw was introduced in upward flow direction to rinse the column with the same flow rate used for the adsorption of f from the aqueous solution desorption study was performed by 10 naoh solution by passing it in upward flow manner at a flow rate of 1 66 ml min after that the effluent solution was analyzed for the concentration of the f with the ion analyzer after the accomplishment of desorption cycle the column was again rinsed from dw until the ph of eluted water become neutral the regenerated column was utilized for another cycle of adsorption and then desorption as explained above 2 6 fixed bed column data analysis the fixed bed column performance is analyzed in terms of the breakthrough curves the adsorption capacity of adsorbent under certain operation conditions can be calculated from the breakthrough curve a breakthrough curve is a graph of ct c0 vs time t for a given condition breakthrough point tb can be evaluated from the breakthrough curve which is the point in terms of the time where the effluent concentration reached to its maximum permissible limit of the particular contaminant hasan et al 2010 for the current study tb is the time at which concentration of the effluent reached at 1 5 mg l maximum allowable limit of f for potable water the time at which the effluent concentration reached 99 of the influent concentration of contaminant is known as exhaustion point hasan et al 2010 the volume of effluent veff which can be treated by this column was calculated from the following equation ranjan et al 2009 1 v eff q t e where q is the volumetric flow rate ml min and te is the exhaustion point the total mass of f adsorbed on the adsorbent at a given flow rate and initial f concentration can be calculated from the equation give below ranjan et al 2009 2 q total qa 1000 q 1000 0 t total c ad dt q 1000 0 t total c 0 c t dt where qtotal mg g is the total f adsorbed and the q represent the flow rate of f ion solution ml min the total f adsorbed can be calculated by determining the area a under the breakthrough curve the maximum uptake capacity or equilibrium uptake capacity of the column can be determined by the expression given below 3 q eq q total m where m g stands for the dry mass of the adsorbent in the column 2 7 modeling and analysis of column data in order to understand the breakthrough performance of fixed bed column system the experimental data are subjected to several mathematical models the models viz bed depth service time model bdst thomas model and yoon nelson model were used in this work to describe the adsorption performance of packed column these models are widely used for modeling of adsorption process in fixed bed continuous column system and provide important column parameters which are the basis for designing the column for field application gong et al 2015 salman et al 2011 2 7 1 bed depth service time bdst model the bed depth service time model is the most extensively used and simple model which was developed by hutchins by modification of bohart adams equation ghosh et al 2015 this model is used to predict how long the adsorbent will be able to adsorb the adsorbate from aqueous solution before its exhaustion it establishes the relationship between service time t and bed height z in terms of adsorption parameters the linear form of the bdst model can be written as follows 4 t n 0 z c 0 u 1 k a c 0 ln c 0 c 0 1 where c0 and cb is the initial f ion concentration mg l and breakthrough f ion concentration mg l respectively u represent the linear velocity cm min n0 stand for the adsorption capacity of bed mg l ka is the rate constant of the bdst model l mg min eq 3 can be rewritten in the form of a straight line by following concentration 5 t az b where a and b is the slope and intercept respectively 6 a n 0 z c 0 u 7 b 1 k a c 0 ln c 0 c 0 1 with the help of eq 3 the important parameter i e critical bed depth z0 can be calculated critical bed depth can be defined as the theoretical depth of the adsorbent which is enough to avoid the breakthrough at time t 0 or it is the sufficient depth of the adsorbent which can ensure that the effluent concentration does not go beyond to the permissible concentration for this case it is 1 5 mg l ranjan et al 2009 it can be obtained by eq 3 and expressed as follows 8 zo u k 0 n 0 ln c 0 c b 1 2 7 2 thomas model it is also most commonly used mathematical model for describing the breakthrough performance of the fixed bed column system thomas model assumes that adsorption equilibrium is best described by langmuir isotherm model and the adsorption process follows pseudo second order reversible reaction kinetics chen et al 2012 the thomas model can be expressed in linear form as written below 9 ln c 0 c b 1 k th q 0 m q k th c 0 t where kth is the thomas model constant q0 is the adsorption capacity of the bed mg g and t is the total flow time min the values of kth and q0 cab be calculated by the linear plot of ln c0 ct 1 vs t 2 7 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model is the very simple model than others and was established in 1984 by yoon and nelson this model assumes that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption of each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of adsorbate adsorption and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on the adsorbent the linear equation of yoon nelson model can be expressed as follows baral et al 2009 10 ln c t c o c t k yn t τ k yn where τ is the time min calculated by an intercept of linear plot ln c t c o c t vs t min which is required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough the rate constant kyn min 1 of this model can be calculated by slope of the plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents all the samples ach1 ach2 ach3 and ach4 were subjected to bet surface area measurement at 77 c fig s1 represented the adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples the fig s1 showed that the hysteresis loop corresponding to all the samples are low which indicated toward microporous nature of the prepared activated carbon it was also observed that pore size of the ach4 sample is much larger than that of the other three ach1 ach2 and ach3 samples which was indicated by higher hysteresis loop of the sample the parameter specific surface areas and pore volumes calculated by bet measurement are listed in the table 1 table 1 revealed that with the increase in koh concentration specific surface area and pore volume increased and ach4 showed maximum specific surface area 1448 m2 g and pore volume 0 44 cm3 g here we have not shown the data of the activated carbon prepared with 1 5 char to koh because of the reduced surface area due to the over activation these results reveal that the optimum char to koh ratio for coconut husk is 1 4 fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of activated carbon prepared at different carbonization temperatures xrd pattern of all the samples contains the peaks corresponding to the 002 and 001 plane of the graphitic structure at 2θ 23 and 43 respectively the broadening of the peaks suggested the amorphous nature of the prepared activated carbon the surface morphology of the ach4 was studied by sem analysis and the images at various magnifications are shown in fig 2 images clearly show the presence of well developed large sized pores on the surface of activated carbon having size ranges from 1 5 to 10 nm the adsorbent becomes porous due to the chemical activation of the carbonized material by koh which behave as an oxidant the redox reaction occurred during activation process can be expressed as below sevilla and mokaya 2014 6koh 2c 2k 3h2 2k2co3 due to oxidation process carbon skeleton is etched to produce pore on its surface along with oxidation gasification of carbon also takes places by which co2 formed because of the k2co3 decomposition at high temperature above 700 c which further assist the formation of pores on its surface teng et al 2009a 2009b furthermore the morphology and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx of ach4 was also investigated by tem analysis fig 3 a shows the presence of dense micropores on the surface of the carbon skeleton fig 3 b shows the hrtem image of the ach4 which suggested the presence of abundant slit shaped small nanopores evenly distributed on the surface of ach4 moreover fig 3 c shows the hollow diffraction pattern of ach4 which revealed that ach4 is amorphous in nature which is in agreement with the results of xrd analysis the thermal decomposition curve for the ach4 is shown in fig 4 it was found that between 100 c and 350 c temperatures first weight losses occur due to the elimination of moisture and volatile compound whereas large weight loss observed above 500 c due to decomposition of ach4 framework 3 2 fixed bed column studies 3 2 1 effect of bed depth the effect of bed height was studied at three different bed height i e 5 10 and 15 cm at a constant initial f concentration 10 mg l and flow rate 1 66 ml min and the obtained breakthrough curves are represented in fig 5 the various column parameters were evaluated and summarized in table 2 results showed that both breakthrough time and exhaustion time increased with increase in bed height in addition to it the value of veff as well as uptake capacity was also increased since larger adsorbent bed provide enough time to f ion to get diffuse into the adsorbent thus in the column of longer bed depth metal ions spent more time with the adsorbent and treat the large volume of contaminated water additionally this result also supported by the fact that on increasing of bed depth the axial dispersion in mass transfer decreased which resulted into the enhanced diffusion of f into the adsorbent surface hasan et al 2009 breakthrough time is a performance determining factor in the column study and the larger breakthrough point advocated for the efficient adsorption system thus larger bed depth gives the larger breakthrough time hence resulted in the better intra particulate phenomenon and high uptake capacity hasan et al 2009 3 2 2 effect of flow rate fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves obtained at a different flow rates 1 66 3 32 and 4 98 ml min at constant bed height 15 cm and f ion concentration 10 mg l the various column parameters are listed in table 2 results shows that all the column parameter such as treated volume breakthrough time exhaustion time and uptake capacity decreased with increase in the flow rate of the influent while the treated volume increased as the flow rate increased the fig 6 showed that the breakthrough curve corresponding to higher flow rate are steeper than that of the breakthrough curves at low flow rates because f did not got sufficient time to make contact with adsorbent and hence they passed from the column without attaining the equilibrium it was also found that the larger uptake of f ions was observed at lower flow rate because adsorbate reside for longer time in the column and got enough time to diffuse into the adsorbents however at the high flow rate resident time of the adsorbate decreased and hence adsorbate spend less time in contact of the adsorbent mohan et al 2017 thus the maximum column efficiency can be observed at lower flow rate therefore in order to treat large volume of water low flow rate of effluent should be applied it was also found that adsorbent got exhausted easily at higher flow rate hence adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cannot be utilized properly 3 2 3 effect of initial f concentration the effect of f concentration 6 8 10 mg l on the adsorption of f by ach4 at a constant flow rate 1 66 ml min and bed depth 15 cm and obtained results are shown in fig 7 and the result obtained is summarized in table 2 the results indicated that lower influent adsorbate concentration gives higher breakthrough time and larger veff values thus lower influent concentration of f ion may be utilized to treat the large volume of the influent this result can be explained by the fact that the lower influent concentration leads low concentration gradient hence slow diffusion of adsorbate ions occurs toward the adsorbent it was also observed that with increases in f concentration the breakthrough time as well as exhaustion time decreased because at high f ion concentration the adsorbent get saturates in short period of time the maximum uptake capacity was found corresponding to the highest f concentration table 2 this result can be attributed by the fact that higher influent concentration the causes higher concentration gradient which is the driving force for the adsorption of f ion in the aqueous phase hence higher adsorption capacity was observed at higher f ion concentration ranjan et al 2009 mohan et al 2017 3 3 breakthrough curve modeling 3 3 1 bed depth service time bdst model fig 8 shows the bdst plot of t service time vs z bed depth at two different flow rates of the influent i e 1 66 and 3 32 ml min at f concentration of 10 mg l the bdst model parameters sorption rate constant ka sorption capacity n0 and critical bed depth z0 are summarized in table 3 which were calculated from slope and intercept of the plot the plot of bdst model showed significant linearity having high value of correlation coefficient r2 at both the flow rates which advocated for its validity it was observed from the results that the values of ka determined by the slope of bdst plot were found to be 0 00027 and 0 0032 l mg min for the flow rates 1 66 and 3 32 ml min respectively the value of n0 adsorption capacity observed decreasing with the increase in flow rate 11286 and 11016 mg l for the flow rates of 1 66 and 3 32 ml min respectively the high value of the bdst adsorption capacity n0 for the present system with high r2 values indicated toward high efficiency of the ach4 bed for the f adsorption ensuring the validity of bdst model for the present system table 3 also shows the value of critical bed depth which suggests that the critical bed depth increased from 1 56 to 2 63 cm with increase in flow rate from 1 66 to 3 32 ml min therefore it can be concluded that the column efficiency decreased with increases in flow rate which is in good agreement with the results of the breakthrough curve of flow rates hasan et al 2010 the main application of bdst model is it applicability to determine the column parameter of new flow rate with the help of column parameters of known flow rate hasan et al 2010 eq 8 modified as below 11 a a u u a f f where u and a represent the original linear velocity and old slope respectively whereas u and a represented the new linear velocity and new slope furthermore f and f are the original and new flow rates of the influents thus from the parameters calculated from column design for a particular flow rate it is possible to design the fixed bed column for different flow rates mohan et al 2017 in the current adsorption system bdst model has been applied to the two flow rates 1 66 and 3 32 ml min and the parameters which are determined experimentally showed in table 4 hence in order to compare the experimental and predicted values of column parameter the bdst model also applied on the new flow rate the results thus obtained from the prediction using a sample flow rate of 1 66 ml min is also given in table 4 and it was found that experimental and predicted values of slopes were in good agreement for the flow rate of 3 32 ml min from above discussion the conclusion has been made that with the help of bdst model a new column can be designed with the help of existing column parameters 3 3 2 application of thomas and yoon nelson models the adsorption kinetic data were also applied on the thomas model and yoon nelson model at the different flow rates 1 66 3 32 and 4 98 ml min and at initial f concentration of 10 mg l corresponding to the bed depth of 15 cm the various parameters associated with the thomas model such as thomas rate constant kth maximum solid phase concentration of f q0 in mg g and r2 values were calculated from the plot of ln co ct 1 vs t fig s2 at different flow rates and are listed in table 5 results indicated that the plots are significantly linear at all studied flow rates having the high value of r2 which clearly advocated for the validity of this model it was also observed from the analysis that with an increase in flow rate the kth increased whereas bed capacity decreased it was also revealed from table 5 that experimental and predicted values of bed capacity q are found to be very close to each other suggested the validity of this model the yoon nelson model also applied to the experimental data the result of yoon nelson model is given in the table 5 and the plots corresponding to the different flow rate are shown in fig s3 the plot exhibit linearity at all flow rates which is also supported by high value of correlation coefficient the validity of yoon nelson model also supported by the close agreement between experimental and calculated values of ʈ the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough which was calculated from the graph of ln ct c0 ct vs t from the above discussion it can be revealed that the both the studied model found best fit to the experimental data and thus applicable to described this column system 3 4 regeneration the regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent is necessary for obtaining the maximum efficiency of the adsorbent and for reducing the operational cost of the plant it is important to note that desorption of the adsorbate should not induce any damage to the adsorbent as it may reduces the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in the current investigation activated carbon was regenerated by 10 naoh solution and the adsorbent was analyzed up to three cycles of adsorption and desorption the column was packed with 15 cm bed height and the naoh solution was introduced with the flow rate of 1 66 ml min it was found that 10 naoh gives 97 elution efficiency fig 9 represented the breakthrough curve for three adsorption desorption cycle the parameters determine from these breakthrough curves are summarized in table 6 which indicated that the breakthrough time decreased with the progress of adsorption desorption cycle from i to iii nevertheless the excellent uptake capacity was found in all the cases with slight reduction in adsorption performance from cycle i to iii it is important to mention here that greater efficiencies 95 of desorption of the f from the ach4 advocated the involvement of ion exchange mechanism during adsorption of f ion on the ach4 surface in all the cycle elution efficiency observed to be considerably high i e 97 which revealed that this adsorption system is the efficient way to remove f from water 3 5 adsorption column life factor the above discussion showed that adsorption performance decreased as the elution cycle progresses so that the life of the adsorbent can be predicted on the basis of some of the column parameter for this study life factor was calculated by considering the breakthrough time and column uptake capacity the life factor of the column was calculated using a linear regression equation proposed by volesky volesky et al 2003 12 t b t bi k l n where tbi is the initial breakthrough time min and k is the corresponding life factor min cycle the values of tbi and its corresponding life factor kl were calculated from the plot of tb vs n fig s4 and the relationships tb 2266 250 n was predicted from these relationships it was found that the column bed would be capable to avoid the breakthrough time at t 0 up to 9 06 cycle for f ion removal similarly in order to calculate the life factor in terms of uptake capaccity the following regression was used volesky et al 2003 13 q q i k l n where qi stand for the initial uptake capacity mg g and kl is the corresponding life factor per cycle the value of qi and kl was determined by the equation q 7 5 0 9 n it was predicted from the equation that the column bed would be completely exhausted after 8 3 cycles thus the life factors calculation in terms of breakthrough time and column uptake capacity utilized to evaluate the adsorption performance of column 4 conclusion this study identifies the highly porous ach4 derived from coconut husk as a suitable adsorbent for continuous remediation of f from the water this investigation deals with two important aspects i preparation of activated carbon from coconut husk which helps to solve the problem of its disposal and ii the use of obtained activated carbon as an excellent adsorbent for removal of f ion from water the adsorption performance of activated carbon was strongly affected by variation in influent f concentration flow rate as well as bed depth the adsorption performance of the column improved with the increase in bed depth whereas it decreased with increase in flow rate however the column uptake increased with increase in f concentration the maximum uptake was found to be 6 7 mg g at a flow rate of 1 66 ml min and 15 cm of bed depth the bdst model was successfully applied in order to predict the relation between service time and bed depth which was important to design the column for new flow rate the bdst model was also utilized for prediction of column parameters to design new column for the flow rate of 3 32 ml min from a sample flow rate of 1 66 ml min the experimental kinetic data successfully applied to the mathematical models i e thomas and yoon nelson models which were well fitted to these models and the studies were useful for application of the large scale field application the column was regenerated with the 10 naoh solution and the adsorption performance was evaluated up to the three adsorption desorption cycle the elution efficiencies were observed to be greater than 97 for f which indicated the presence of ion exchange in the removal process the life factor of the column predicted the life of the adsorbent and the adsorbent was anticipated to have enough uptake capacity to avoid the breakthrough at time t 0 for up to 8 3 cycles and it was also predicted that the bed would be completely exhausted zero uptake after 9 0 cycles acknowledgement the author m talat would like to acknowledge the financial support from dst wos a scheme file no sr wos a pm 25 2016

resource for sustenance of all life form on the earth unfortunately in the past few decades its quality gets degraded mainly by human activities such as urbanization rapid population growth industrialization and unskilled utilization of natural water resources water gets polluted by many sources which include dumping of toxic industrial waste untreated sanitary and agricultural runoff bhatnagar et al 2015a 2015b ground water gets polluted by natural as well as anthropogenic sources dissolution of many f containing rocks and minerals fluorspar cryolite and fluorapatite are the major natural source of f contamination which gets contacted with ground water and surface water jagtap et al 2012 moreover the runoff of various industries i e fluoride chemical industry as well as the semiconductor metal processing fertilizer and glass manufacturing industries also contaminate the water raichur and basu 2001 shen et al 2003 the excessive concentration of f in drinking water has been considered as very hazardous for human health who 2006 toxicity of f depends upon its concentration within the permissible limit 1 5 mg l it is necessary for healthy development of tooth and bone in children mohan et al 2016 whereas the concentration of f beyond permissible limit exerts detrimental effects on human health such as dental and skeletal fluorosis brittle bones osteoporosis and arthritis moreover prolonged exposure of excess f to the living organism may also cause birth and immunological defects and can even induce cancer mohan et al 2016 around the world more than 20 countries including africa china srilanka and india are suffering from endemic fluorosis in india about 17 states are found to be fluorosis endemic and affect the health of approximate 1 million people jagtap et al 2012 due to the toxic effect of excessive f in water it is necessary to reduce the f concentration to the permissible limit so far various methods have been utilized for the f removal from water such as adsorption ion exchange precipitation and electrodialysis however these techniques showed drawbacks such as high operational and maintenance costs generation of toxic sludge and complicated procedure in comparison to these shortcomings adsorption method is extensively used technique because it is simple in procedure cheap and easy to operate teng et al 2009a 2009b ali and gupta 2007 in the past few years numerous approaches have been applied to the development of more economical and more efficient adsorbents based on the natural waste products which are being used for removal of pollutant from water because they are non toxic and abundant in nature the agricultural wastes are considered to be promising adsorbent due to their eco friendliness and their plentiful availability in nature bhatnagar et al 2015a 2015b activated carbon considered as one of the preferred adsorbents in comparison to other adsorbents for removal of the wide range of pollutant from the water adsorbent based on activated carbon found to be very efficient i e they show fast adsorption kinetics and very simple to apply in the past few years researchers are focused on the production of activated carbon from natural sources such as industrial and agricultural waste products because commercial activated carbon is very expensive for water treatment it has been prepared from many agricultural by products such as waste apricot rubber wood sawdust coconut shell sugar beet bagasse rice straw bamboo rattan sawdust molasses and oil palm fibre as they are inexpensive and renewable which can act as a precursor coconut husk is the mesocarp of coconut and a coconut contains about 35 of coconut husk coconut husk is extensively used as a fuel for household purpose and used to prepare rope and mats in india coconut husk is abundantly available as waste at various worship places and its disposal is very problematic so in order to utilize and to dispose this cheap and abundant agricultural waste it is proposed to convert coconut husk into activated carbon tan et al 2008 thus the synthesis of activated carbon from coconut husk gives dual advantage i e firstly this process solves the problem of disposal of coconut husk and secondly this agricultural by product is converted into excellent adsorbent for f ions from the above discussion it is revealed that activated carbon derived from coconut husk would be promising material to be used as adsorbent for the removal of f hence in the present study the adsorptive removal of f from water by activated carbon derived from coconut husk has been investigated in the fixed bed continuous column mode to address the possibility of industrial application furthermore the effect of flow rate f concentration and bed depth on breakthrough time was also investigated the various models were also used to analyze the breakthrough curve i e bdst thomas and yoon nelson models 2 materials and methods 2 1

purchased from sigma aldrich all the solutions utilized throughout the experiments were prepared in deionized double distilled water dw the 100 ppm stock solution of fluoride was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of naf in the dw further other solution of fluoride ion of different concentration was prepared by subsequent dilution of the stock solution 2 2 preparation of activated carbon from coconut husk in the current investigation the coconut husk utilized for preparation of activated carbon was acquired from the waste of different worship places of varanasi india the coconut husk was washed initially by distilled water to eradicated dirt and other contaminants then the washed coconut husk was dried for 6 h at 95 c to make it free from moisture further for the carbonization process the precursor was heated at 700 c in the purified nitrogen 99 9 atmosphere for 3 h and the heating rate was fixed at 10 c minute approximately after 75 min we got final temperature afterward the furnace was cool down to the room temperature and the material was well grinded the prepared carbonized material was mixed with koh pellets in different ratio and classified as 1 1 ach1 1 2 ach2 1 3 ach3 and 1 4 ach4 and dw was added to this mixture all the samples were kept for dehydration in the n2 atmosphere for 3 h at 350 c after that the activation was carried out in the same condition as carbonization but the final temperature was different finally the activated samples were cool down to the room temperature washed with hot dw the horizontal tubular furnace was used in the preparation process 2 3 characterization the microstructure of prepared activated carbon was investigated by using scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 200 and transmission electron microscope fei technai 20 g2 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of activated carbon was recorded using pro pan analytical surface area measurement was conducted by brunauer emmett teller bet method using micrometrics usa asap 2020 model thermal stability of the activated carbon was examined through thermo gravimetric analyzer tga using perkin elmer pyris 1 2 4 fixed bed column adsorption studies the continuous fixed bed column experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the prepared activated carbon for the removal of f from the water for this purpose a borosilicate glass cylinder of diameter 1 cm and length 30 cm was used as a column the effect of various parameters bed depth f concentration and flow rate on the performance of the column was studied during the column experiment the column was packed with the activated carbon in between the glass wool which is supported by glass beads to avoid the adsorbent from being washed away the ph of f solution was adjusted at 5 the optimum ph for the maximum uptake of f was determined using batch study and the solution was pumped into the column with the help of peristaltic pump miclins pp 10 the solution was injected in the upward direction from lower part of the column thereafter the samples were collected at definite interval of time from upper end of the column to analyze the concentration of f ions in the effluent solution by f ion selective electrode thermo orion expandable ion analyzer ea 940 the column was analyzed until the concentration of effluent became 99 of the initial f concentration 2 5 desorption and column regeneration studies in order to analyze the efficiency of the column for repetitive use the regeneration studies were also carried out for this purpose dw was introduced in upward flow direction to rinse the column with the same flow rate used for the adsorption of f from the aqueous solution desorption study was performed by 10 naoh solution by passing it in upward flow manner at a flow rate of 1 66 ml min after that the effluent solution was analyzed for the concentration of the f with the ion analyzer after the accomplishment of desorption cycle the column was again rinsed from dw until the ph of eluted water become neutral the regenerated column was utilized for another cycle of adsorption and then desorption as explained above 2 6 fixed bed column data analysis the fixed bed column performance is analyzed in terms of the breakthrough curves the adsorption capacity of adsorbent under certain operation conditions can be calculated from the breakthrough curve a breakthrough curve is a graph of ct c0 vs time t for a given condition breakthrough point tb can be evaluated from the breakthrough curve which is the point in terms of the time where the effluent concentration reached to its maximum permissible limit of the particular contaminant hasan et al 2010 for the current study tb is the time at which concentration of the effluent reached at 1 5 mg l maximum allowable limit of f for potable water the time at which the effluent concentration reached 99 of the influent concentration of contaminant is known as exhaustion point hasan et al 2010 the volume of effluent veff which can be treated by this column was calculated from the following equation ranjan et al 2009 1 v eff q t e where q is the volumetric flow rate ml min and te is the exhaustion point the total mass of f adsorbed on the adsorbent at a given flow rate and initial f concentration can be calculated from the equation give below ranjan et al 2009 2 q total qa 1000 q 1000 0 t total c ad dt q 1000 0 t total c 0 c t dt where qtotal mg g is the total f adsorbed and the q represent the flow rate of f ion solution ml min the total f adsorbed can be calculated by determining the area a under the breakthrough curve the maximum uptake capacity or equilibrium uptake capacity of the column can be determined by the expression given below 3 q eq q total m where m g stands for the dry mass of the adsorbent in the column 2 7 modeling and analysis of column data in order to understand the breakthrough performance of fixed bed column system the experimental data are subjected to several mathematical models the models viz bed depth service time model bdst thomas model and yoon nelson model were used in this work to describe the adsorption performance of packed column these models are widely used for modeling of adsorption process in fixed bed continuous column system and provide important column parameters which are the basis for designing the column for field application gong et al 2015 salman et al 2011 2 7 1 bed depth service time bdst model the bed depth service time model is the most extensively used and simple model which was developed by hutchins by modification of bohart adams equation ghosh et al 2015 this model is used to predict how long the adsorbent will be able to adsorb the adsorbate from aqueous solution before its exhaustion it establishes the relationship between service time t and bed height z in terms of adsorption parameters the linear form of the bdst model can be written as follows 4 t n 0 z c 0 u 1 k a c 0 ln c 0 c 0 1 where c0 and cb is the initial f ion concentration mg l and breakthrough f ion concentration mg l respectively u represent the linear velocity cm min n0 stand for the adsorption capacity of bed mg l ka is the rate constant of the bdst model l mg min eq 3 can be rewritten in the form of a straight line by following concentration 5 t az b where a and b is the slope and intercept respectively 6 a n 0 z c 0 u 7 b 1 k a c 0 ln c 0 c 0 1 with the help of eq 3 the important parameter i e critical bed depth z0 can be calculated critical bed depth can be defined as the theoretical depth of the adsorbent which is enough to avoid the breakthrough at time t 0 or it is the sufficient depth of the adsorbent which can ensure that the effluent concentration does not go beyond to the permissible concentration for this case it is 1 5 mg l ranjan et al 2009 it can be obtained by eq 3 and expressed as follows 8 zo u k 0 n 0 ln c 0 c b 1 2 7 2 thomas model it is also most commonly used mathematical model for describing the breakthrough performance of the fixed bed column system thomas model assumes that adsorption equilibrium is best described by langmuir isotherm model and the adsorption process follows pseudo second order reversible reaction kinetics chen et al 2012 the thomas model can be expressed in linear form as written below 9 ln c 0 c b 1 k th q 0 m q k th c 0 t where kth is the thomas model constant q0 is the adsorption capacity of the bed mg g and t is the total flow time min the values of kth and q0 cab be calculated by the linear plot of ln c0 ct 1 vs t 2 7 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model is the very simple model than others and was established in 1984 by yoon and nelson this model assumes that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption of each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of adsorbate adsorption and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on the adsorbent the linear equation of yoon nelson model can be expressed as follows baral et al 2009 10 ln c t c o c t k yn t τ k yn where τ is the time min calculated by an intercept of linear plot ln c t c o c t vs t min which is required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough the rate constant kyn min 1 of this model can be calculated by slope of the plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents all the samples ach1 ach2 ach3 and ach4 were subjected to bet surface area measurement at 77 c fig s1 represented the adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples the fig s1 showed that the hysteresis loop corresponding to all the samples are low which indicated toward microporous nature of the prepared activated carbon it was also observed that pore size of the ach4 sample is much larger than that of the other three ach1 ach2 and ach3 samples which was indicated by higher hysteresis loop of the sample the parameter specific surface areas and pore volumes calculated by bet measurement are listed in the table 1 table 1 revealed that with the increase in koh concentration specific surface area and pore volume increased and ach4 showed maximum specific surface area 1448 m2 g and pore volume 0 44 cm3 g here we have not shown the data of the activated carbon prepared with 1 5 char to koh because of the reduced surface area due to the over activation these results reveal that the optimum char to koh ratio for coconut husk is 1 4 fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of activated carbon prepared at different carbonization temperatures xrd pattern of all the samples contains the peaks corresponding to the 002 and 001 plane of the graphitic structure at 2θ 23 and 43 respectively the broadening of the peaks suggested the amorphous nature of the prepared activated carbon the surface morphology of the ach4 was studied by sem analysis and the images at various magnifications are shown in fig 2 images clearly show the presence of well developed large sized pores on the surface of activated carbon having size ranges from 1 5 to 10 nm the adsorbent becomes porous due to the chemical activation of the carbonized material by koh which behave as an oxidant the redox reaction occurred during activation process can be expressed as below sevilla and mokaya 2014 6koh 2c 2k 3h2 2k2co3 due to oxidation process carbon skeleton is etched to produce pore on its surface along with oxidation gasification of carbon also takes places by which co2 formed because of the k2co3 decomposition at high temperature above 700 c which further assist the formation of pores on its surface teng et al 2009a 2009b furthermore the morphology and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx of ach4 was also investigated by tem analysis fig 3 a shows the presence of dense micropores on the surface of the carbon skeleton fig 3 b shows the hrtem image of the ach4 which suggested the presence of abundant slit shaped small nanopores evenly distributed on the surface of ach4 moreover fig 3 c shows the hollow diffraction pattern of ach4 which revealed that ach4 is amorphous in nature which is in agreement with the results of xrd analysis the thermal decomposition curve for the ach4 is shown in fig 4 it was found that between 100 c and 350 c temperatures first weight losses occur due to the elimination of moisture and volatile compound whereas large weight loss observed above 500 c due to decomposition of ach4 framework 3 2 fixed bed column studies 3 2 1 effect of bed depth the effect of bed height was studied at three different bed height i e 5 10 and 15 cm at a constant initial f concentration 10 mg l and flow rate 1 66 ml min and the obtained breakthrough curves are represented in fig 5 the various column parameters were evaluated and summarized in table 2 results showed that both breakthrough time and exhaustion time increased with increase in bed height in addition to it the value of veff as well as uptake capacity was also increased since larger adsorbent bed provide enough time to f ion to get diffuse into the adsorbent thus in the column of longer bed depth metal ions spent more time with the adsorbent and treat the large volume of contaminated water additionally this result also supported by the fact that on increasing of bed depth the axial dispersion in mass transfer decreased which resulted into the enhanced diffusion of f into the adsorbent surface hasan et al 2009 breakthrough time is a performance determining factor in the column study and the larger breakthrough point advocated for the efficient adsorption system thus larger bed depth gives the larger breakthrough time hence resulted in the better intra particulate phenomenon and high uptake capacity hasan et al 2009 3 2 2 effect of flow rate fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves obtained at a different flow rates 1 66 3 32 and 4 98 ml min at constant bed height 15 cm and f ion concentration 10 mg l the various column parameters are listed in table 2 results shows that all the column parameter such as treated volume breakthrough time exhaustion time and uptake capacity decreased with increase in the flow rate of the influent while the treated volume increased as the flow rate increased the fig 6 showed that the breakthrough curve corresponding to higher flow rate are steeper than that of the breakthrough curves at low flow rates because f did not got sufficient time to make contact with adsorbent and hence they passed from the column without attaining the equilibrium it was also found that the larger uptake of f ions was observed at lower flow rate because adsorbate reside for longer time in the column and got enough time to diffuse into the adsorbents however at the high flow rate resident time of the adsorbate decreased and hence adsorbate spend less time in contact of the adsorbent mohan et al 2017 thus the maximum column efficiency can be observed at lower flow rate therefore in order to treat large volume of water low flow rate of effluent should be applied it was also found that adsorbent got exhausted easily at higher flow rate hence adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cannot be utilized properly 3 2 3 effect of initial f concentration the effect of f concentration 6 8 10 mg l on the adsorption of f by ach4 at a constant flow rate 1 66 ml min and bed depth 15 cm and obtained results are shown in fig 7 and the result obtained is summarized in table 2 the results indicated that lower influent adsorbate concentration gives higher breakthrough time and larger veff values thus lower influent concentration of f ion may be utilized to treat the large volume of the influent this result can be explained by the fact that the lower influent concentration leads low concentration gradient hence slow diffusion of adsorbate ions occurs toward the adsorbent it was also observed that with increases in f concentration the breakthrough time as well as exhaustion time decreased because at high f ion concentration the adsorbent get saturates in short period of time the maximum uptake capacity was found corresponding to the highest f concentration table 2 this result can be attributed by the fact that higher influent concentration the causes higher concentration gradient which is the driving force for the adsorption of f ion in the aqueous phase hence higher adsorption capacity was observed at higher f ion concentration ranjan et al 2009 mohan et al 2017 3 3 breakthrough curve modeling 3 3 1 bed depth service time bdst model fig 8 shows the bdst plot of t service time vs z bed depth at two different flow rates of the influent i e 1 66 and 3 32 ml min at f concentration of 10 mg l the bdst model parameters sorption rate constant ka sorption capacity n0 and critical bed depth z0 are summarized in table 3 which were calculated from slope and intercept of the plot the plot of bdst model showed significant linearity having high value of correlation coefficient r2 at both the flow rates which advocated for its validity it was observed from the results that the values of ka determined by the slope of bdst plot were found to be 0 00027 and 0 0032 l mg min for the flow rates 1 66 and 3 32 ml min respectively the value of n0 adsorption capacity observed decreasing with the increase in flow rate 11286 and 11016 mg l for the flow rates of 1 66 and 3 32 ml min respectively the high value of the bdst adsorption capacity n0 for the present system with high r2 values indicated toward high efficiency of the ach4 bed for the f adsorption ensuring the validity of bdst model for the present system table 3 also shows the value of critical bed depth which suggests that the critical bed depth increased from 1 56 to 2 63 cm with increase in flow rate from 1 66 to 3 32 ml min therefore it can be concluded that the column efficiency decreased with increases in flow rate which is in good agreement with the results of the breakthrough curve of flow rates hasan et al 2010 the main application of bdst model is it applicability to determine the column parameter of new flow rate with the help of column parameters of known flow rate hasan et al 2010 eq 8 modified as below 11 a a u u a f f where u and a represent the original linear velocity and old slope respectively whereas u and a represented the new linear velocity and new slope furthermore f and f are the original and new flow rates of the influents thus from the parameters calculated from column design for a particular flow rate it is possible to design the fixed bed column for different flow rates mohan et al 2017 in the current adsorption system bdst model has been applied to the two flow rates 1 66 and 3 32 ml min and the parameters which are determined experimentally showed in table 4 hence in order to compare the experimental and predicted values of column parameter the bdst model also applied on the new flow rate the results thus obtained from the prediction using a sample flow rate of 1 66 ml min is also given in table 4 and it was found that experimental and predicted values of slopes were in good agreement for the flow rate of 3 32 ml min from above discussion the conclusion has been made that with the help of bdst model a new column can be designed with the help of existing column parameters 3 3 2 application of thomas and yoon nelson models the adsorption kinetic data were also applied on the thomas model and yoon nelson model at the different flow rates 1 66 3 32 and 4 98 ml min and at initial f concentration of 10 mg l corresponding to the bed depth of 15 cm the various parameters associated with the thomas model such as thomas rate constant kth maximum solid phase concentration of f q0 in mg g and r2 values were calculated from the plot of ln co ct 1 vs t fig s2 at different flow rates and are listed in table 5 results indicated that the plots are significantly linear at all studied flow rates having the high value of r2 which clearly advocated for the validity of this model it was also observed from the analysis that with an increase in flow rate the kth increased whereas bed capacity decreased it was also revealed from table 5 that experimental and predicted values of bed capacity q are found to be very close to each other suggested the validity of this model the yoon nelson model also applied to the experimental data the result of yoon nelson model is given in the table 5 and the plots corresponding to the different flow rate are shown in fig s3 the plot exhibit linearity at all flow rates which is also supported by high value of correlation coefficient the validity of yoon nelson model also supported by the close agreement between experimental and calculated values of ʈ the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough which was calculated from the graph of ln ct c0 ct vs t from the above discussion it can be revealed that the both the studied model found best fit to the experimental data and thus applicable to described this column system 3 4 regeneration the regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent is necessary for obtaining the maximum efficiency of the adsorbent and for reducing the operational cost of the plant it is important to note that desorption of the adsorbate should not induce any damage to the adsorbent as it may reduces the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in the current investigation activated carbon was regenerated by 10 naoh solution and the adsorbent was analyzed up to three cycles of adsorption and desorption the column was packed with 15 cm bed height and the naoh solution was introduced with the flow rate of 1 66 ml min it was found that 10 naoh gives 97 elution efficiency fig 9 represented the breakthrough curve for three adsorption desorption cycle the parameters determine from these breakthrough curves are summarized in table 6 which indicated that the breakthrough time decreased with the progress of adsorption desorption cycle from i to iii nevertheless the excellent uptake capacity was found in all the cases with slight reduction in adsorption performance from cycle i to iii it is important to mention here that greater efficiencies 95 of desorption of the f from the ach4 advocated the involvement of ion exchange mechanism during adsorption of f ion on the ach4 surface in all the cycle elution efficiency observed to be considerably high i e 97 which revealed that this adsorption system is the efficient way to remove f from water 3 5 adsorption column life factor the above discussion showed that adsorption performance decreased as the elution cycle progresses so that the life of the adsorbent can be predicted on the basis of some of the column parameter for this study life factor was calculated by considering the breakthrough time and column uptake capacity the life factor of the column was calculated using a linear regression equation proposed by volesky volesky et al 2003 12 t b t bi k l n where tbi is the initial breakthrough time min and k is the corresponding life factor min cycle the values of tbi and its corresponding life factor kl were calculated from the plot of tb vs n fig s4 and the relationships tb 2266 250 n was predicted from these relationships it was found that the column bed would be capable to avoid the breakthrough time at t 0 up to 9 06 cycle for f ion removal similarly in order to calculate the life factor in terms of uptake capaccity the following regression was used volesky et al 2003 13 q q i k l n where qi stand for the initial uptake capacity mg g and kl is the corresponding life factor per cycle the value of qi and kl was determined by the equation q 7 5 0 9 n it was predicted from the equation that the column bed would be completely exhausted after 8 3 cycles thus the life factors calculation in terms of breakthrough time and column uptake capacity utilized to evaluate the adsorption performance of column 4 conclusion this study identifies the highly porous ach4 derived from coconut husk as a suitable adsorbent for continuous remediation of f from the water this investigation deals with two important aspects i preparation of activated carbon from coconut husk which helps to solve the problem of its disposal and ii the use of obtained activated carbon as an excellent adsorbent for removal of f ion from water the adsorption performance of activated carbon was strongly affected by variation in influent f concentration flow rate as well as bed depth the adsorption performance of the column improved with the increase in bed depth whereas it decreased with increase in flow rate however the column uptake increased with increase in f concentration the maximum uptake was found to be 6 7 mg g at a flow rate of 1 66 ml min and 15 cm of bed depth the bdst model was successfully applied in order to predict the relation between service time and bed depth which was important to design the column for new flow rate the bdst model was also utilized for prediction of column parameters to design new column for the flow rate of 3 32 ml min from a sample flow rate of 1 66 ml min the experimental kinetic data successfully applied to the mathematical models i e thomas and yoon nelson models which were well fitted to these models and the studies were useful for application of the large scale field application the column was regenerated with the 10 naoh solution and the adsorption performance was evaluated up to the three adsorption desorption cycle the elution efficiencies were observed to be greater than 97 for f which indicated the presence of ion exchange in the removal process the life factor of the column predicted the life of the adsorbent and the adsorbent was anticipated to have enough uptake capacity to avoid the breakthrough at time t 0 for up to 8 3 cycles and it was also predicted that the bed would be completely exhausted zero uptake after 9 0 cycles acknowledgement the author m talat would like to acknowledge the financial support from dst wos a scheme file no sr wos a pm 25 2016

12342,a numerical model has been developed for simulating fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system by considering a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture as against the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation in addition for the first time a transient fluid mass transfer function has been introduced in the governing equation of fluid flow within the rock matrix in order to explicitly consider the fluid drainage from rock matrix into the fracture the effectiveness in modeling fluid flow using different governing equations developed by implementing the pseudo steady state and transient models of transfer functions with parabolic and hyperbolic conditions within the fracture and rock matrix has been discussed in detail numerical results suggest that the drainage of fluid from the rock matrix to the fracture and thus the estimation of its fluid recovery from the reservoir are overestimated in a typical coupled fracture matrix system using conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation it has been further observed that among the hyperbolic and parabolic dominant mathematical models used to describe the fluid flow through fracture the recent model proposed by the first author which is associated with the rate limited fluid mass transfer term within the low permeable rock matrix yields a significantly varying pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases it is also observed that the resultant pressure distribution within a coupled fracture matrix system is independent of the pseudo steady state transfer or transient transfer function which is used for modeling the fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface graphical abstract fx1 keywords fluid flow fracture rock matrix numerical model pressure distribution 1 introduction it is well known that the groundwater extraction from alluvial aquifers around the globe has made a significant contribution to the enhancement of the social and economic status of the mankind however such extraction from fractured aquifers remain limited due to the limited knowledge associated with characterizing a fractured aquifer apart from groundwater resources it is also known that more than half of the world s proven oil reserves and a nearly half of the world s gas reserves are trapped in carbonate reservoirs that are naturally fractured a sound understanding on fluid flow through rock fractures at the scale of a single fracture is fundamental in characterizing a network of complex fractured reservoir which essentially dictates the production performance as well as the recovery of oil and gas thus an improved knowledge associated with a fractured aquifer is imminent in the context of both groundwater sustainability as well as oil recovery it can also be noted that the modeling of a complex fracture network on a three dimensional scale not necessarily replicate the real reservoir dynamics as the resultant fluid flow through a connected network of fractures does not occur through all the naturally connected or synthetically generated fractures while the fluid flow occurs through the limited preferential pathways dictated by the coupled hydro geo mechanical effects at a much larger scale than perceived by the conventional representative elementary volume barrenblatt and zheltov 1960 warren and root 1963 adams et al 1968 najurieta 1980 nanba 1991 lim and aziz 1995 sekhar et al 2006 suresh kumar 2008 ortiz et al 2013 natarajan and suresh kumar 2011 natarajan and suresh kumar 2012 suresh kumar 2014a 2014b 2014c thereby making the fluid dynamics associated with a saturated aquifer or a petroleum reservoir to be extremely complex the petroleum reservoir or a geothermal reservoir fluid dynamics require the knowledge of thermodynamics as well since the reservoir fluid flow is generally associated with high temperature and high pressure conditions involving phase changes in essence one requires solving a multi phase multi component three dimensional fluid flow equation in order to grasp the exact reservoir dynamics of a fractured reservoir however the focus of the present study is limited to a single component single phase fluid flow through a fractured reservoir at the scale of a single fracture in a coupled fracture matrix system using the concept of dual continuum 1 1 fracture and rock matrix fluid flow as the fluid flow through saturated rock fractures has a direct influence on the economic production of crude oil as well as on the groundwater recharge potential in fractured rocks the hydraulic behavior of fluid flow through a fractured reservoir plays a very critical role the hydraulic behavior in turn determines the nature of governing fluid flow equations within the physical system fractured reservoir in general is composed of two fundamental entities namely low permeable rock matrix where the oil or the groundwater has been stored and a high permeable fracture through which oil or groundwater is transmitted towards the production well the fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface determines the quantum of oil or groundwater that will be drained from stored rock matrix into high permeable fracture since the porosity and permeability of fracture and rock matrix vary over several orders of magnitudes the assumption of single continuum in a fractured carbonate reservoir is highly idealistic in this context the physical domain of interest in the case of a fractured reservoir is split into two different continuums one for fracture and the other for rock matrix and the both the continuums are assumed to be connected effectively at the fracture matrix interface the rock matrix despite being low permeable has the characteristic feature of a typical porous medium and hence the conventional parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation can be applied comfortably the mathematical nature of a parabolic equation typically implies that the physical system of interest will try to reach a steady state condition after a sufficiently long time thus it is reasonable to anticipate a steady state condition within the rock matrix after a long time as the initial perturbations or noises associated with the pressure distribution within the rock matrix will eventually vanish with time in this context conventionally the same parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation is also applied to represent the fluid flow within the high permeable fracture however it is to be noted that the porosity of a single fracture pertains to 100 and also the fluid flow through a single rock fracture resembles the fluid flow through a pipe since the fluid velocity associated with the fracture is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the fluid velocity associated with the rock matrix the conventional assumption of parabolic dominant fluid flow within the high permeable fracture may not be always valid and needs a relook in this context a better description of fluid flow within the fracture associated with a fractured reservoir is very critical to the successful design and operation of petroleum reservoir projects and or artificial groundwater recharge in fractured rocks to start with many researchers have developed models in order to investigate the mechanism of fluid flow and a relatively efficient method has been deduced to recover oil from fractured reservoirs to mention a few despite the discovery of the very first fractured reservoir in 1880 hubbert and wills 1955 horner 1951 clearly pointed out that the conventional well test analysis associated with a homogeneous saturated sub surface reservoir cannot be extended in order to apply the same for a highly heterogeneous complex saturated fractured reservoir in this context baker 1955 first ever tried to characterize a fractured reservoir with reference to its new fundamental entity called a fracture this new hydro geological entity was associated with the earlier works by lamb 1932 muskat 1937 and huitt 1956 in order to deduce an equation that describes the steady state fluid flow through a typical fracture which is in line with the earlier equations describing fluid flow through smooth parallel plates thus baker 1955 for the very first time modeled a steady state fluid flow through a fracture as a function of width and depth of the fracture in addition to the conventional consideration of the developed pressure gradient along the direction of fluid flow baker s 1955 being a steady state model pollard 1959 for the first time modeled a transient fluid flow problem associated with a fractured reservoir it should be noted here that until this point 1959 the earlier studies assumed that there was no fluid mass exchange between the so called fine non communicating voids and coarse communicating voids it was barenblatt et al 1960 who first considered a fractured reservoir that consists of two different porous media with two different pore sizes where the very critical concept of fluid mass exchange between these two porous media was introduced during the same period barenblatt et al 1960 extended the fracture fluid flow analysis for a slightly compressible fluid as well since each porous medium represents a continuum the model proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 was referred to as a dual continuum model the concept of dual continuum essentially implies that in a geological formation with extremely varying porosity and permeability distributions for example in a fractured reservoir it is nearly impossible to deduce a reasonable representative elementary volume rev over which a mean value of variable such as intrinsic permeability can be deduced using the conventional single continuum approach it can be noted that at the scale of a single fracture the porosity of fracture corresponds to cent percent while that of its adjacent rock matrix can have porosity as low as 0 1 three orders of variation in magnitude over a very small distance similarly the permeability of fracture is in general several magnitudes higher than that of its associated rock matrix permeability thus a huge variation in magnitude over a very short distance yields steep gradient in flux distributions at the fracture matrix interface and this shock or discontinuity severely disturbs the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the fracture matrix interface and it does not allow to make use of the conventional single continuum concept comfortably as the fundamental assumption of smooth and continuous variation of dependent variable of interest pressure in this case in the physical domain is violated at the fracture matrix interface hence the associated fundamental geological units namely fracture and rock matrix is treated as two different continuums connected by the diffusive limited fluid mass exchange term thus in a typical dual continuum model the fluid flow equations are solved separately for both the continuums and the equations are coupled with a transfer term that characterizes the fluid mass transfer between the fracture and the rock matrix warren and root 1963 both the models by warren and root 1963 and adams et al 1968 projected a two straight line theory for the temporal variation of pressure associated with a fractured reservoir however it should be noted here that these plots were resulted from the variations of hydraulic head within a given fracture which was expressed at the scale of a single fracture while considering a pseudo steady state fluid mass transfer between low permeable rock matrix and high permeable fracture in other words the transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix was not considered explicitly and instead a pseudo steady state mass transfer function as a function of mean rock matrix pressure was introduced at the fracture matrix interface in order to consider the drainage from the rock matrix later kazemi 1969 numerically modeled the drainage from rock matrix into fracture by considering the transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix as a result the plot which provides the pressure as a function of logarithmic time yielded three distinct regions in describing the fluid flow through a fractured reservoir the first slope represents the early stage fracture dominated fluid flow while the intermediate nearly horizontal profile represents the transient fluid mass exchange between rock matrix and fracture and the final slope at the later stage represents the pseudo steady state rock matrix flow thus the introduction of transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix helped to better characterize a fractured reservoir in fact a plenty of numerical and analytical studies have been conducted in modeling the fluid flow in fractured reservoirs in the past few decades for example kazemi 1969 proposed a theoretical model for a naturally fractured reservoir based on the analytical model introduced by warren and root 1963 it was concluded that the pressure transient analysis of a naturally fractured reservoir depends on the degree and type of heterogeneity present in the system odeh 1965 developed a mathematical model for an unsteady radial flow in a naturally fractured reservoir which emphasized that the drawdown and pressure build up curves obtained by assuming a homogeneous reservoir was not suitable for understanding the flow mechanism in fractured reservoirs a theoretical model for flow in homogenous reservoirs was developed by najurieta 1980 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 proposed a new technique based on bilinear theory which considered a linear flow in both fracture and rock matrix for analyzing pressure transient data kazemi s dual porosity model was updated by gilman and kazemi 1983 by including the fracture relative permeability when fluid was flowing from fracture to matrix nanba 1991 compared the pseudo steady inter porosity behavior with the transient inter porosity model in an actual field using the concept of a matrix block skin and concluded that both the models exhibited the same behavior when the matrix skin was large lim and aziz 1995 developed a matrix fracture transfer function for dual porosity flow simulation in naturally fractured reservoir combining analytical solution of pressure diffusion for various flow geometries a numerical investigation of a two dimensional matrix fracture system was performed by ortiz et al 2013 based on bilinear flow theory 1 2 limitations of darcy s law the overall fluid migration within a reservoir is controlled by a couple of hydraulic parameters namely hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity while the rate of fluid flux is essentially controlled by the time required by the fluid flux to traverse between recharge and discharge zones the consistent interpretation of hydraulic or pressure head profiles for a given mathematical model is the characteristic feature of a particular numerical model given the constraints on the availability of reservoir field data numerical modeling of the fractured reservoirs provides a better insight in the estimation of oil or groundwater resources as the modeling provides more details on the spatial and temporal distribution of fluid stresses however the validity of these model based forecasting has become extremely challenging the empirical darcy s equation is the fundamental equation used to describe the flow of newtonian fluids through porous media and this equation is essentially applicable at lower reynolds number darcy s equation provides a linear relationship between bulk volume based darcy velocity and the pore volume based potential gradient the constant of proportionality in darcy s equation depends on both aquifers permeability as well fluid properties density and viscosity however it is not possible to classify the permeability tensor to be symmetric or non symmetric based on the empirical darcy s equation and also darcy s law as such does not entertain its applicability to transient or compressible fluid flow more than a century later mokadam confirmed that darcy s law cannot be derived analytically by performing a momentum balance in terms of macroscopic quantities on a small element of the porous media later darcy s law was derived by integrating n s equation hubbert 1957 hall 1956 however it should be noted that n s equation represents microscopic momentum balance equation for a newtonian fluid while darcy s analogy deduced from n s equation also represents the momentum balance equation for newtonian fluids through porous medium but at the microscopic scale thus by default conventional darcy s equation requires the values of constants and variables to be averaged properly over the volume of interest failing which the nature of the permeability tensor and in turn the physical nature of darcian flow cannot be represented precisely this problem becomes further complex in the case of fractured aquifers for example the presence of fractures in the fractured reservoirs acts as high permeable conduits while the adjoining rock matrix acts a low permeable geological unit in addition at the scale of a single fracture as applied in a typical dual porosity system the porosity in fracture equals 100 while the porosity of the adjoining rock matrix falls as low as less than 1 given the variation in porosity and permeability by orders of magnitude over an adjacent geological unit the averaging of the parameters cannot be justified easily as it requires a representative elementary volume which is extremely large for fractured reservoirs in addition from mathematical perspective the presence of fractures makes the fluid flow to be more towards hyperbolic dominancy rather than its conventional parabolic assumption for describing the fluid flow through alluvial aquifers conventional diffusing equation which is parabolic dominant characterizes the aquifer reasonably while the description of fluid flow through fractured aquifers which is predominantly hyperbolic dominant cannot be described with the existing form of diffusivity equation and requires modification to include the effects of hyperbolic dominancy resulting from the presence of fluid flow through connected high permeable fractures 1 3 hyperbolic dominant fluid flow plenty of numerical studies have been conducted for addressing the hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow in fractured reservoirs by considering non linearity associated with the fluid flow equation of high permeable fracture to mention a few chakrabarty et al 1993 and bai and roegiers 1994 have derived analytical dimensionless pressure solution by incorporating a quadratic gradient term in the fluid flow equation it has been observed from their respective models that the predicted wellbore pressure using linear solution is smaller than that by non linear solution at larger times from a correlation between non linear fluid flow and diffusion convection transport bai et al 1994 proved that neglecting the quadratic gradient term in flow equation will result in a transport mechanism with a non convective transport a new analytical model for solving diffusion equation with quadratic gradient term was introduced by jelmert and vik 1996 a comparison of non linear and linear pressure solution has been performed by tong and wang 2005 by considering the effect of the quadratic gradient term in large time well tests sim 2008 proposed a new methodology in order to deal with the square gradient term in the flow equation a new variable has been introduced which depends exponentially on the pressure for replacing the quadratic pressure term a non linear spherical flow equation with a quadratic gradient term has been deduced by nie and ding 2010 for the analysis of spherical percolation of oil flow in porous media it is evident from the percolation type curves that the influence of the quadratic pressure gradient term makes the non linear solution very distinct from the linear solution the analysis of errors generated by the exclusion of the non linear term from the flow governing equation has been conducted by dewei et al 2013 it has been concluded from the analysis that the quadratic pressure gradient term has significant influence on governing the transient flow and well testing guo and nie 2013 modeled a non linear transient flow behavior of well production in an underground formation by deducing diffusion equation by inclusion of quadratic pressure gradients by comparing the theoretical data and field data it has been concluded that in underground formations non linear model describes the fluid flow more realistic and accurate all the earlier models of non linear quadratic hyperbolic pressure gradient term do not explicitly consider the direction of fluid flow between high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix in this context suresh kumar 2014a proposed an improved mathematical model which better describes the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system the mathematical model includes a hyperbolic dominant non linear fluid flow equation in fracture instead of a conventional parabolic dominant linear fluid flow governing equation in addition to that the transfer function which defines the fluid mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface is considered explicitly in the governing equation within the rock matrix as against the conventional consideration of coupling term within the fracture however in the present paper the deduction of the proposed non linear fluid flow governing equation within the fracture from continuity equation is detailed and a robust numerical model with detailed comparison between the linear and non linear cases and the sensitivity of considering the instantaneous and transient diffusive fluid mass exchange from fracture to rock matrix and from rock matrix to fracture have been analyzed in detail as against the earlier mathematical model proposed by suresh kumar 2014a several researchers have attempted to consider the non linear fluid flow equations by using either forchheimer or brinkman equations to take into account the larger fluid velocity however it is not feasible to delineate the onset of non darcy effects using reynolds number as well as forchheimer number relates the pressure drop caused by fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface to that by the viscous resistance of the saturated fluid within the fracture thus it can be noted that unlike the earlier non darcian models using forchheimer 1901 and brinkman 1947 the present model considers the darcian approach by neither considering the second order of the fracture fluid velocity term that represents the microscopic inertial effect nor by considering the second order derivative of the velocity term as used in brinkman equation in addition in the present model the flow non linearity is not assumed to be attributed by turbulence while it is assumed that the flow is still non linear resulting from non linear variation of fluid flow rate with the pressure loss within the high permeable fracture since the computation of this pressure loss using non linear navier stokes equation is highly time consuming for engineering applications the present work explicitly considers the fundamental darcian based fluid flow equation without neglecting the hyperbolic dominant non linear fluid flow term in addition most of the commercial packages used by the current oil and gas industries for analyzing the fluid flow phenomena in various applications such as well testing primary secondary and enhanced oil recoveries are still using the diffusive dominant parabolic diffusivity equation the same equation is being used in order to analyze the behavior of fluid flow within the high permeable fracture as well however the numerical results of the present study have clearly indicated the importance of considering the behavior of fluid flow to be of hyperbolic dominant under higher mean fluid velocities or higher intrinsic permeability in addition since the present model considers the presence of hyperbolic term as an additional term to the existing model it will be much easier to implement this additional hyperbolic term in the software packages without altering the existing base equations further all the fluid mass exchange terms can be directly incorporated into the existing model and thus the present work can be easily incorporated in order to improve the existing modeling equations associated with oil and gas industries packages the present work clearly differs from earlier works in the sense that the model considers the darcian based non linear hyperbolic dominant fluid flow term in order to better consider the higher mean fluid velocity that is generally expected within a high permeable fracture since the present problem is particularly concerned with the fluid flow through a fractured reservoir at the scale of a single fracture the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the fracture matrix interface between the two different continuums plays a very sensitive role at this point it should be clearly noted that in a coupled fracture matrix system there can be fluid exchange from fracture into rock matrix as well as vice versa in other words the direction of fluid flow in a direction normal to the fracture axis needs to be clearly specified in order to better describe the spatial and temporal distribution of fluid pressure within the coupled fracture matrix system in this context all the earlier models used to describe fluid flow through a coupled fracture matrix system has a coupling term that ensures the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the interface only along with the fracture fluid flow equation and obviously it does not completely describe the fluid mass distribution between fracture and rock matrix in other words from the existing set of fluid flow equations applied for a dual continuum system it is difficult to delineate the fluid mass exchange a from fracture into rock matrix and b from rock matrix into fracture this particular aspect is very critical in the context of reservoir engineering as the fluid from fracture needs to be diffused into the low permeable rock matrix in order for the chemical or steam to react with the trapped crude oil within the rock matrix which will subsequently reduce the interfacial tension and or viscosity and thereby improving the mobility of the oil within the rock matrix thus the fraction of applied chemicals or steam that diffused into the rock matrix from the fracture needs to be precisely evaluated in the context of enhanced oil recovery in order to better assess the injection rate of steam or chemicals that should be applied at the surface on the other hand as soon as the mobility of crude oil within the rock matrix is enhanced then there will be fluid flow in the reverse direction i e from rock matrix into the high permeable fracture which will eventually be transmitted towards the production well thus in this case the fraction of oil draining from rock matrix into high permeable fracture provides a better insight on the resulting oil recovery efficiency from a typical fractured reservoir such delineations of fluid flow across the fracture matrix interface could provide better insights in understanding the microscopic displacement efficiency and macroscopic sweep efficiency associated with a fractured reservoir in this context the objectives of the present study is as follows i to revisit and deduce a mathematical model that takes into account non linear hyperbolic dominant fluid flow within the high permeable fracture using darcian approach from fundamental principles ii to numerically solve the set of proposed linear and non linear fluid flow equations for a coupled fracture matrix system using finite volume scheme and iii to investigate the sensitivity of pseudo steady state transfer and transient transfer fluid exchange terms that are used at the fracture matrix interface on the spatial and temporal distribution of reservoir pressure 2 physical system and governing equations the numerical modeling for analyzing the pressure distribution in a coupled fracture matrix system is performed by idealizing the fractured reservoir into a physical domain which considers fractures and matrices as two different geological units with entirely different properties as suggested by warren and root 1960 in their dual porosity model the dual porosity model assumes the reservoir block as a parallelepiped which contains cubical blocks of rock matrices arranged with fractures in between the adjacent blocks the flow equations are solved separately in fracture and matrix and the two systems are coupled together by a transfer function coupling term which defines the fluid mass exchange between the fracture and matrix at the interface the dual porosity model has contributed much for a simplified analysis of fractured reservoirs and is widely used in the research studies involving flow and transport in a coupled fracture matrix system the present study focuses on a coupled fracture matrix system at the scale of a single fracture as shown in fig 1 with its respective boundary conditions and the results obtained can be generalized to the whole reservoir the domain consists of a two dimensional rectangular block of low permeable rock matrix of thickness l m associated with a high permeable fracture of length l f and fracture aperture thickness 2b the pressure at the fracture inlet and outlet have been specified by the dirichlet type boundary conditions the fluid flow within the fracture is considered to be driven by the pressure difference between the fracture inlet and outlet with negligible capillary effects the flow within the matrix block is considered to be laminar zero flux neumann type boundary conditions have been specified on the sides of the low permeable rock matrix the fluid flow within the fracture is discussed in detail as follows darcy s law is the fundamental equation describing the flow of newtonian fluid through porous medium based on the experiments on vertical water filtration through sand beds darcy from his experiments on steady state fluid flow established an empirical relation in which the volumetric flow rate varies linearly with pressure gradient thus the darcy flux within the high permeable fracture is represented as given in eq 1 1 q q a k f μ δ p ρ g h l where q represents the darcy flux q is the volume flow rate k f is the fracture permeability µ is the viscosity p is the static pressure ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration h is the head and l is the total length of the fracture in eq 1 q represents the darcy flux expressed in m 3 m 2 s further the same equation is also used for transient fluid flow by converting the same into a differential form as expressed in eq 2 2 q v q a k μ d p ρ g h d z for one dimensional horizontal flow eq 2 get converted into a form in the absence of gravity as expressed in eq 3 with the assumption that both horizontal and vertical permeability are equal 3 q h q a k μ d p d x considering fluid flow through a one dimensional tube of cross sectional area a the mass conservation equation for one dimensional linear flow in a porous medium can be expressed as given in eq 4 4 d d x ρ q d d t ρ ϕ expanding the r h s of eq 4 yields 5 d d t ρ ϕ ρ d ϕ f d t ϕ f d ρ d t ρ ϕ f c φ c f d p d t where ϕ f is the porosity of fracture c ϕ and c f represent the rock and fluid compressibility respectively expanding the l h s of eq 4 yields 6 d d x ρ q ρ k f μ d 2 p d x 2 c f d p d x 2 now equating eqs 5 and 6 yields 7 d 2 p d x 2 c f d p d x 2 ϕ f μ c t k d p d t the r h s of the diffusion equation provided by eq 7 involves a total compressibility factor which is equal to the sum of fracture compressibility and the fluid compressibility 8 c t c ϕ c f the fracture compressibility c ϕ depends on the rate of change of porosity with respect to time within the fracture 9 c ϕ 1 ϕ f ϕ f t in the current analysis the fracture porosity is considered to be 100 at the scale of a single fracture and it is assumed that the fracture deformation due to hydraulic stress is negligible hence the pores i e the fracture aperture thickness are considered to be inelastic and the porosity of the fracture remains constant throughout the fluid flow simulation therefore the fracture compressibility c ϕ will eventually become zero and can be ignored from the fluid flow governing equation within the fracture in order to observe a significant difference in the pressure profile obtained from the equation governing the fluid flow within the fracture with quadratic pressure term and without quadratic pressure term the compressibility of the working fluid in the system should be greater than 1 10 9 pa 1 since the fluids with the mentioned compressibility values falls under the category of gases the fluid compressibility can no more be considered as a constant value it will be a strong function of pressure in eq 7 the fluid compressibility is defined as provided in eq 10 10 c f 1 ρ ρ p from the real gas equation of state 11 ρ p r t z where r is the real gas constant t is the temperature and z is the compressibility factor combining eqs 10 and 11 and simplifying yields 12 c f 1 p 1 z z p the reservoir temperature in the present analysis is assumed to be at 500 f associated with the gas window and the specific gravity of the gas is 0 7 for the current reservoir conditions the variation in the compressibility factor with respect to reservoir pressure is negligible manning and thomson 1991 such that 13 z p 0 substituting eq 13 in eq 12 yields 14 c f 1 p the viscosity of the fluid has a strong dependence on temperature since the range of reservoir pressure throughout the simulation is maintained consistently to be at a pressure value less than the critical pressure of the reservoir at the assumed reservoir condition the viscosity of the fluid eventually remains as a constant for an isothermal fluid flow the value of viscosity for the gas with specific gravity 0 7 for the given reservoir condition is 1 91 10 5 pa s in eq 7 the non linear hyperbolic term becomes very critical under two critical conditions for the case of fractured reservoirs i when the difference between the pressure within the well and the undisturbed pressure away from the well becomes large and ii when the ratio ln r 0 r w becomes small which essentially depends on the distribution nature of fracture spacing and fracture density thus it can be clearly concluded that the conventional approach using parabolic dominant linear diffusivity fluid flow equation within the high permeable fracture inherently assumes that the above two conditions are not violated such conditions are mostly satisfied for a classical porous medium reservoir based on a single continuum approach and that too in the absence of any heterogeneity however for a fractured reservoir since the porosity of fracture and its adjoining rock matrix vary over two orders magnitude while the intrinsic permeability of fracture and its adjoining rock matrix vary over several orders of magnitude it is pretty clear that it is not always feasible to satisfy the above two conditions given the variety of heterogeneities eq 7 can be rearranged as given in eq 15 that represents the hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation for high permeable fracture 15 k f μ d 2 p d x 2 c f k f μ d p d x 2 ϕ f c f d p d t the fluid flow equation along the fracture in the absence of non linear hyperbolic dominant term represents the conventional diffusivity equation describing fluid flow through a typical porous medium as given by eq 16 eq 16 is parabolic in nature as against the hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow equation as represented in eq 15 16 k f μ d 2 p d x 2 ϕ f c f d p d t similarly the fluid flow equation for the rock matrix with fluid mass transfer term suresh kumar 2014a 2014b 2014c is provided as given in eq

represents the matrix porosity the initial and boundary conditions for the fracture representing eq 15 are provided by eq 18 18 p x t 0 0 p x 0 t p a p x l t p b the initial and boundary conditions for the rock matrix representing eq 17 are provided by eq 19 19 p x y t 0 p 0 p x x 0 y t 0 p x x l y t 0 p x x y l m t 0 the base case parameters considered in the present numerical model are provided in table 1 the following assumptions have been made with reference to eq 1 19 i most of the storage storativity is assumed to be within the low permeable rock matrix while the high permeable fractures act as conduits which are essentially responsible for the fluid transmission transmissivity ii the fluid flow rate is assumed to be along the length of the fracture axis which essentially coincides with that of the principal direction of fluid flow iii the fluid flow within the fracture is assumed to follow the theory of fluid flow between two smooth parallel plates in the absence of any roughness or tortuosity iv the fluid flow within the low permeable rock matrix is in the direction normal to the fracture axis v the thickness of the fracture aperture is assumed to be greater than 10 µm and hence fluid driven by capillary effects if any is ignored vi the thickness of the fracture aperture is assumed to be lesser than 1000 µm and hence the possibility of two dimensional velocity distribution within the high permeable fracture is averted vii the fluid flow through the high permeable fracture is assumed to be completely saturated with a single phase fluid only either water or oil and hence the concept of capillary pressure effects if any resulting from the theory of multi phase fluid flow is averted the formulation of dual porosity model deviates from a single porosity model by the inclusion of a transfer function term which governs the matrix fracture interaction between the rock matrix and fracture at the interface barenblatt et al 1960 the transfer function couples the fluid flow in the fracture and rock matrix the implementation of transfer function either in the rock matrix equation or in the fracture equation is decided by the direction of the fluid flow for example the transfer function employed in the rock matrix suresh kumar 2014a defines the draining of fluid from rock matrix to fracture whereas the transfer function employed in the fracture equation defines the diffusion of fluid from fracture to rock matrix warren et al 1963 cinco ley et al 1978 ortiz et al 2013 two types of transfer function models have been proposed by many authors pseudo steady state transfer model and transient transfer model hassan and mehran 2006 in pseudo steady state transfer model the matrix block act as a source or sink for the fracture system the mass transfer rate between the rock matrix and the fracture is proportional to the difference in the average matrix block pressure and the fracture pressure at the instant of computation the pseudo steady state transfer function model is provided by eq 20 20 q m k m μ a v p m p f δ y y 0 in eq 20 q m represents the source or sink term p m and p f represents the average matrix block pressure and the fracture pressure at the instant of computation in transient transfer model the mass transfer rate between the rock matrix and the fracture is proportional to the pressure gradient at the matrix fracture interface the transient transfer model is provided by eq 21 21 q m k m μ a v p f y y 0 in order to numerically investigate the sensitivity of fluid mass transfer term at the fracture matrix interface by considering it within the high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix explicitly and to investigate the role of considering the non linear hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow within the high permeable fracture multiple simulation runs have been carried out pseudo steady state model and transient transfer model are the two prominent models proposed by many researchers for addressing the fracture matrix mass transfer in the fluid flow simulation in a typical coupled fracture matrix system the cases specified in table 2 parabolic and table 3 hyperbolic includes transfer function modeled using transient transfer model case1a case1b pseudo steady state model case4a case4b combination of both pseudo steady state and transient transfer models case3a case3b and the transient transfer function model considered in fluid flow governing equation within the rock matrix case2a case2b the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure within the fracture fig 10 to 16 obtained from the fluid flow simulations corresponding to the cases mentioned in table 2 parabolic cases and table 3 hyperbolic cases are intended to investigate the sensitivity of different models of mass transfer function that can be applied at the fracture matrix interface and to understand the influence of the quadratic pressure term on the resultant distribution of pressure profiles within the fracture the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure within the fracture between parabolic cases specified in table 2 and hyperbolic cases specified in table 3 are provided in fig 10 a and fig 10 b respectively the role of transfer function in fluid flow simulation using parabolic and hyperbolic fluid flow governing equation within the fracture is projected in fig 10 the importance of the comparison study performed in fig 10 conveys the sensitivity of the existing transfer function models which essentially defines the mass transfer between fracture and rock matrix at the interface in estimating the resultant pressure distribution in fluid flow simulation in fractured reservoirs figs 11 14 provide an individual comparison of pressure profiles obtained from the fluid flow simulated using parabolic cases and hyperbolic cases the pressure distribution profiles in figs 11 14 are presented to demonstrate the combined effect of the fracture matrix mass transfer and the non linearity on fluid flow in a fracture matrix system for example in fig 11 the pressure distribution obtained from the fluid flow simulation using case 1a parabolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in fracture is being compared with case 1b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in fracture case 2b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in rock matrix case 3b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with pseudo steady state mass transfer term in fracture and transient mass transfer term in matrix case 4b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with pseudo steady state mass transfer term in fracture similarly all other parabolic cases in table 2 are compared with each hyperbolic case in table 3 in figs 12 14 respectively tables 2 and 3 provide 4 different cases of parabolic and hyperbolic dominant governing equations for fluid flow within a coupled low permeable rock matrix and a high permeable fracture respectively these tables have been constructed for the first time which involves all possible combinations of governing equations pertaining to a coupled fracture matrix system in the presence and absence of fluid mass exchange term either in the fracture or in the rock matrix the governing equations consider both pseudo steady state and transient transfer function terms within the fracture and rock matrix either as source or sink term thereby explicitly considering the direction of the fluid flow between fracture and rock matrix at the fracture matrix interface case 1a table 2 parabolic equation case 1 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and rock matrix in which a transient transfer function which characterizes the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface has been incorporated in the fracture equation the transfer term in the fracture equation as given in case 1a constitutes the source term that defines the acceptance of the fluid drained from the rock matrix by the fracture the equations specified in case 1a is mostly used in the modeling of diffusion of fluid from fracture to rock matrix by replacing the positive sign of the transfer term to negative sign the negative sign implies that the fluid is being injected from the fracture into the matrix block ortiz et al 2013 case 2a table 2 parabolic equation case 2 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and matrix in which the transient transfer function has been incorporated in the equation for fluid flow within the rock matrix the transfer function is added as a sink term that represents the draining of fluid from the rock matrix into the fracture the equation specified in case 2a does not consider the acceptance of fluid by the fracture discharged from the rock matrix case 3a table 2 parabolic equation case 3 represents the parabolic fluid flow equation within the fracture and roc matrix in which the transfer function is implemented in both the fracture and rock matrix equations the transfer function is employed as a source term within the fracture equation whereas in the rock matrix equation the transfer function is employed as a sink term a pseudo steady state transfer function model is implemented within the fracture equation the equation specified in case 3a considers both instantaneous acceptance of fluid by the fracture as well as the rate limited fluid drainage from the rock matrix into the fracture case 4a table 2 parabolic equation case 4 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and matrix in which the transient transfer function in the fracture equation as specified in case 1a is replaced by pseudo steady state transfer function the transfer function included in the fracture equation acts as a source which accepts the instantaneous fluid drainage from the rock matrix this type of coupled governing equations in which a pseudo steady state inter porosity transfer function model in the fracture has widely been used in models proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 kazemi et al 1976 and sarma and aziz 2006 all the above cases of pseudo steady state and transient transfer function models falling under linear fluid flow equations within the fracture and rock matrix have been extended to hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations as represented in cases 1b to 4b table 3 the implementation of the transient transfer function as a sink term in the non linear governing equation for fluid flow within the rock matrix case 2b was recently proposed by the first author suresh kumar 2014a while introducing the non linear effects within the high permeable fracture this non linear effect within the high permeable fracture is significantly addressed when the mean fluid velocity within the fracture is reasonably higher thus tables 2 and 3 provide the complete set of linear and non linear governing equations with various kinds of fluid mass exchange terms within the fracture and or rock matrix associated with couple fracture matrix systems addressed at the scale of a single fracture it can be noted that the mathematical models for all the non linear cases except case 2b table 3 have been proposed for the first time while the respective numerical models for all the four cases table 3 case 1b case 4b are to be modeled for the first time as explained in the following section 2 1 numerical model the present numerical model solves a hyperbolic dominant one dimensional partial differential equation governing the fluid flow within the fracture as expressed in eq 15 and a parabolic dominant two dimensional partial differential equation governing the fluid flow within the rock matrix as expressed in eq 17 the fluid flow equations have to be solved separately within the fracture and the rock matrix domains and hence a one dimensional uniform structured grid with 100 nodes is generated for the fracture geometry and a two dimensional non uniform structured grid with 100 50 nodes is generated to represent the low permeable rock matrix within the 2d rock matrix block the cell widths along the horizontal direction is uniformly spaced while the cell widths in the direction perpendicular to the fracture axis follows a geometric variation given by y j y j 1 a j 1 where y j is the y coordinate of the current node y j 1 is the y coordinate of the previous node and a is the common ratio the mesh size is kept finer nearer to the fracture matrix interface in order to better ensure the continuity of fluid mass fluxes resulting steep gradients of the concerned dependent variables while cell widths far away from the interface are chosen relatively courser as the distribution of gradients of the dependent variables at these places are relatively smooth thus the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface is well captured due to the larger number of computational cells considered in the vicinity of the interface since finite difference technique cannot capture the steep gradients effectively that occur at the fracture matrix interface and also since this technique cannot handle a relatively larger mean fluid velocity within the fracture mass conservation based finite volume implicit solver is employed in order to solve the set of the coupled equations as given in tables 2 and 3 since the finite volume method is based on flux conservation at the interfaces of the control volumes it will be easy to handle the fluid mass transfer terms at the fracture matrix interface which involves abrupt changes in the reservoir properties like porosity and permeability as the fluid expands from one continuum to another a second order central scheme is used for spatial discretization of the pressure equation and a first order accurate forward differencing scheme has been used for the temporal variation in the fluid pressure as given in eqs 15 and 17 discretization of the partial differential equation within the fracture eq 15 is provided by eq 22 22 k f μ p f n 1 x e a e p f n 1 x w a w u n c f n p f e n 1 a e p f w n 1 a w ϕ f c f n p f n 1 p f n δ t δ v the discretization of the partial differential equation is carried out based on the finite volume cell centered approach in which the fluxes crossing individual faces of the control volume cell are averaged at the cell center the first term in the l h s of eq 22 represents the discretization of diffusive fluxes the pressure gradients p f x e and p f x w are calculated at the east and west faces subscripts e and w denotes the east and west faces respectively and a e and a w are the area vectors normal to the respective faces similarly the second term in the l h s represents the discretization of the convective fluxes the r h s of eq 22 represents the temporal discretization of the conservative pressure within the fracture the quantity u in the eq 22 represents the darcy flux 23 u n k f μ p x n the expression for fluid compressibility c f as a function of pressure is provided in eq 10 the inclusion of darcy flux in the conventional parabolic dominant diffusion equation modifies the governing equation in to a hyperbolic dominant equation the value of u and c f is assumed initially i e at time 0 and u and c f remains unknown at next time level n 1 at subsequent time levels the value of u and c f obtained at the previous time level is substituted and is iterated at each time level till its convergence discretization of the partial differential equation within the rock matrix eq 17 is provided by eq 24 24 k m x μ p m n 1 x e a e p m n 1 x w a w k m y μ p m n 1 y n a n p m n 1 y s a s k m μ b p m n 1 p f n 1 δ y y 0 δ v ϕ m c m p m n 1 p m n δ t δ v in eq 24 a n and a s represents the area normal in the y direction to the north and south cell faces respectively the discretization of the fluid mass transfer representing the last term of l h s in eq 23 involves the difference in the fracture matrix pressure at the fracture matrix interface between rock matrix and fracture nodes the transfer term acts as a sink in describing the fluid mass exchange from rock matrix to fracture the fracture pressure p f is obtained from the calculated pressure distribution along the fracture at current time level and δ y represents the cell width across the fracture matrix interface a constant and equal pressure distribution is considered within both fracture and rock matrix initially the fluid is in equilibrium at the beginning of flow simulation significant pressure difference is generated between the inlet and outlet of the fracture domain while keeping the boundaries of the rock matrix block with zero flux the boundary conditions for fracture and rock matrix have been provided as expressed in eqs 18 and 19 respectively the fluid pressure at the fracture matrix interface is assumed to be the same as that of the fracture and this implies that there is pressure gradient within the fracture normal to the fluid flow direction moreover the same condition is imposed as a boundary condition for the flow simulation within the rock matrix block the present model delivers an unconditionally stable solution since an implicit numerical scheme is used for the calculation of pressure profiles within the coupled fracture matrix system however for a better and accurate solution the time step is taken as δt 1 s and the simulation is carried out for a total time period of t 1 day the pressure distribution obtained along the fracture has been verified with the analytical solution provided by ronald 1995 a semi implicit numerical scheme has been used to handle the hyperbolic term in the governing equation of fluid flow within the fracture as given in eq 15 the darcy flux u in eq 22 and the fluid compressibility in eq 10 is computed at previous time level whereas the pressure gradient is calculated at the current time level the tri diagonal matrix generated for the partial differential equation within the fracture and penta diagonal matrix generated for the partial differential equation within the two dimensional rock matrix are solved till convergence is achieved with a tolerance limit of 1 10 7 in the algebraic equation solver 3 results and discussion fig 2 provides spatial distribution of pressure along the fracture simulated for a period of 1 day it can be observed from fig 2 that the present numerical model results matches with that of the analytical solution provided by ronald 1995 it can be further noted that the model has been validated with the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation without hyperbolic term as represented by eq 16 the fluid is assumed to be compressible and the flow is considered to be laminar with a dynamic fluid viscosity 1 91 10 5 pa s and the rest of the details can be secured from table 1 fig 3 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profile along the fracture at the end of three different time periods with the inclusion of quadratic pressure term as represented by eq 15 it can be observed from fig 3 that the pressure profile characteristics gradually vary from hyperbolic dominant to parabolic dominant nature with time it has been noted from fig 3 that the fluid flow within the fracture attains a steady state at the end of 5 days and thus the pressure gradient between fracture and rock matrix will remain a constant as the flow progress beyond 5 days it is also observed that there is a significant reduction in the overall pressure along the fracture length as the time period increases thus it is critical to realize that the pressure difference between the high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix is always not consistent along the entire length of the fracture between the inlet and outlet for a given time period thus it can be concluded from fig 3 that the spatial distribution of pressure profile within the high permeable fracture is characterized to be either parabolic or hyperbolic nature depending upon the respective time periods and it cannot always be taken for granted that the fluid flow within the fracture will be parabolic dominant fig 4 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profiles along the fracture fig 4 a and within the rock matrix fig 4 b fig 4 a provides a comparison between the pressure distributions along the fracture for a typical fluid flow equation with parabolic nature as represented by eq 16 and the fluid flow equation with hyperbolic nature as represented by eq 15 fig 4 b provides the pressure distribution profile within the rock matrix normal to the fracture axis at a distance of 20 m from the fracture inlet both the pressure profiles along the fracture and rock matrix have been projected pertaining to a simulation period of 1 day it can be clearly noted from fig 4 a and b that the conventional fluid flow equation with parabolic dominancy overestimates the pressure reduction in fracture and rock matrix for example at a distance of 50 m from the fracture inlet the intensity of pressure within the fracture predicted using conventional parabolic dominant diffusivity equation is around 2 09 mpa while the respective intensity of pressure at the same distance within the fracture using the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation estimates the intensity of pressure to be 2 5 mpa similarly the magnitudes of intensities of pressure within the matrix at a distance of 0 01 m from the fracture matrix interface are 3 06 mpa and 3 2 mpa using parabolic dominant diffusivity equation and the currently proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations respectively thus it can be concluded from fig 4 that the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within the high permeable fracture suggests a reasonably higher values of fluid pressure along the fracture and the matrix for a given time period and this in turn may have a significant impact on the resultant oil recovery during primary secondary and tertiary oil recovery processes associated with a fractured reservoir fig 5 a and b represents the spatial distribution of pressure for two different fracture permeability values kf 1 10 15 m2 and kf 1 10 12 m2 simulated at the end of 1 day fig 5 a corresponds to the pressure profile along the fracture whereas fig 5 b corresponds to pressure profile along the rock matrix at a distance x 20 m from the fracture inlet it has been observed from fig 5 a that at a given time period the pressure distribution along the fracture for a relatively low fracture permeability kf 1 10 15 m2 follows a constant pressure value up to a significant length down the fracture from the inlet and thus it behaves more like a parabolic dominant fluid flow while the pressure distribution curve for a relatively higher fracture permeability kf 1 10 12 m2 provides a steep gradient representing more like a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow thus it can be concluded from fig 5 a that the magnitude of fracture permeability essentially decides the nature of fluid flow to be either as parabolic or hyperbolic dominant on the other hand the magnitude of fracture permeability affects the mobility of the fluid within the fracture since the mobility of the fluid is proportional to the fracture permeability mobility m k f μ any increase in fracture permeability increases the fluid mobility which in turn increases the fluid flow velocity where velocity u m p x it is also observed that the significant reduction in the pressure intensities for higher permeability value kf 1 10 12 m2 as observed from fig 5 b leads to a higher amount of drainage from the rock matrix for example from fig 5 b it can be observed that the pressure intensity for kf 1 10 12 m2 at a distance 0 02 m is 3 2 mpa whereas the pressure intensity at the same location for kf 1 10 15 m2 is 3 37 mpa thus it can be concluded from fig 5 that the fractures with high permeability conducts the fluid at a faster rate yielding a huge pressure gradient between fracture and matrix and thus enhances the recovery of the fluid from the associated rock matrix fig 6 provides the spatial distribution of fluid pressure along the rock matrix at a distance 20 m from the fracture inlet simulated at the end of 1 day the pressure distribution is obtained for two different horizontal permeability values of the rock matrix kmx 1 10 14 m2 and kmx 1 10 12 m2 it has been observed from fig 6 that for two orders of increase in the magnitude of horizontal permeability of the rock matrix the percentage reduction in overall pressure from its initial value within the rock matrix has been increased from 60 to 90 for example at a distance x 20 m and y 0 02 m within the rock matrix for kmx 1 10 14 m2 from the initial value of 3 447 m pa the intensity of pressure reduces to 1 54 m pa on the other hand for a relatively higher value kmx 1 10 12 m2 at the same location and from the same initial value the fluid pressure reduces to 0 4 m pa thus it can be concluded from fig 6 that the increase in the horizontal rock matrix permeability improves the horizontal transmitivity of the fluid within the rock matrix which subsequently enhances the pressure gradient between the fracture and the rock matrix this large pressure gradient subsequently enhances the draining of the fluid from low permeable rock matrix to high permeable fracture fig 7 a and b provides the pressure contours within the rock matrix simulated for the horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 14 m2 and kmx 1 10 12 m2 at the end of 1 day by comparing fig 7 a and b it has been observed that there is a significant variation in the pressure distribution pattern within the rock matrix for varying horizontal rock matrix permeability it can be clearly observed from fig 7 that for horizontal permeability kmx 1 10 12 m2 fig 7 b the rate of pressure decline near the fracture matrix interface is higher compared to the rate of pressure decline for kmx 1 10 14 m2 fig 11 a for example the value of pressure intensity at the location x 20 m and y 0 01 m for horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 12 m2 is noted to be 0 18 mpa whereas the pressure intensity at the same location for the horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 14 m2 is 2 15 mpa thus it can be concluded from fig 11 a and b that a larger amount of fluid has been mobilized from the rock matrix to the fracture towards the fracture matrix interface at a given time period for a high value of horizontal rock matrix permeability than that for low permeability value fig 8 provides the spatial distribution of pressure along the rock matrix at a distance x 90 m from the fracture inlet simulated at the end of 1 day the pressure profiles are obtained for three different vertical rock matrix permeability values kmy 1 10 21 m2 kmy 1 10 20 m2 kmy 1 10 19 m2 it can be clearly noted from fig 12 that the maximum pressure reduction occurs for kmy 1 10 19 m2 it is also noted that the pressure decline curve for kmy 1 10 19 m2 intersects with the pressure curves corresponding to kmy 1 10 20 m2 and kmy 1 10 21 m2 at points x 90 m y 0 0144 m and x 90 m y 0 0029 m respectively within the rock matrix the corresponding values of pressure at the points of intersection are noted to be 1 65 mpa and 1 51 mpa respectively thus the characterization of pressure distribution within the rock matrix due to the influence of the vertical rock matrix permeability becomes complex as it is difficult to delineate the individual contribution of the diffusion term and the fluid mass exchange term within the rock matrix equation eq 16 because both the terms depend on vertical permeability thus it can be concluded from fig 8 that the prediction of drainage of fluid from the rock matrix based on the vertical rock matrix permeability may be deduced by considering the combined effect of the diffusion term and the fluid mass transfer term in the governing equation of fluid flow fig 9 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profiles within the rock matrix at a distance x 20 m from the fracture inlet for two different values of half fracture apertures b 100 µm b 500 µm simulated at the end of 1 day it has been observed from fig 9 that there is a considerable variation in the pressure profile for an increase in the fracture aperture from b 100 µm to b 500 µm it has been clearly noted that the pressure reduction within the rock matrix for lower values of fracture aperture is more compared to the higher fracture aperture values this implies that the drainage rate for lower values of fracture aperture thickness is high when compared to the higher values of fracture apertures when the fracture thickness increases the interaction between the low permeable rock matrix and the high permeable fracture reduces and in turn the mass transfers at the fracture matrix interface decreases based on the first author s earlier studies suresh kumar and sekhar 2005 suresh kumar and ghassemi 2005 suresh kumar et al 2008 the intensity of coupling between fracture and rock matrix is very critical when the fracture aperture thickness varies between 2b 50 µm and 2b 500 µm thus it can be concluded from fig 9 that for fracture apertures beyond a critical value the influence of the fluid flow in the fracture on fluid flow within the rock matrix becomes less significant which in turn reduces the draining of fluid from the rock matrix figs 10 14 provide the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure profiles along the fracture length pertaining to parabolic equations governing the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system as provided in table 2 and the hyperbolic equations governing the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system provided in table 3 simulated at the end of 1 day fig 10 a and b provides the comparison of the pressure distribution along the fracture obtained using the set of parabolic governing equation cases and the set of hyperbolic governing equation cases respectively fig 11 14 represents the comparison of pressure distribution along the fracture for individual cases of parabolic governing equation against each hyperbolic case the values of the input parameters for the simulation of fluid flow using the numerical models developed from the equations specified in table 2 and table 3 are provided from table 1 the pressure distribution curves in fig 10 shows that the fluid flow modeled from the governing equation proposed in case 2a in the set of parabolic governing equations and case 2b suresh kumar 2014a in the set of hyperbolic governing equation shows significant variation from all the other cases case 2a and 2b represents the respective coupled parabolic and hyperbolic equations in the fracture and rock matrix with the transient fluid mass transfer term implemented within the rock matrix equation it can be observed from fig 10 that out of four parabolic and hyperbolic cases three cases 1a 3a 4a in parabolic and 1b 3b 4b in hyperbolic experience a sudden decline in the pressure profile near the fracture inlet followed by a smooth variation in the pressure profile along the fracture length however it can be critically observed that case 2a and case 2b differs significantly from the rest of the cases in the sense that case 2a case 2b maintains a steep gradient in the pressure profile right from the fracture inlet i e the fluid flows within the fracture as a plug flow while the rest of the cases in fig 10 follows an exponentially declining pressure profile the fluid flow being hyperbolic or parabolic dominant in fact decides the nature of resultant fluid pressure distribution within the high permeable fracture for example if the fluid flow within the fracture is mostly hyperbolic dominant then a weak interaction between fracture and rock matrix can be anticipated and this implies that injection of chemicals or steam will not serve the intended purpose during the application of enhanced oil recovery associated with a fractured reservoir however it can be observed that case 2b is more like hyperbolic dominant while the rest of the cases behave more like parabolic dominant thus it can be concluded from fig 10 that case 2a and 2b behave distinctly from the rest of the cases fig 11 provides the spatial distribution of fluid pressure along the fracture for four different cases parabolic case 1 case 1a has been compared with the rest of the hyperbolic cases 1b 2b 3b 4b it is interesting to note that case 1a vs 2b behaves distinctly from the rest of the cases in the sense that the case 2b is behaving more towards hyperbolic nature while the rest of the cases follow the conventional parabolic dominant nature of fluid flow a similar behavior is observed in figs 12 14 thus it can be concluded from figs 11 14 that the hyperbolic equation proposed by suresh kumar 2014a behaves distinctly from the rest of the cases and this implies that the presence of rate limited fluid mass transfer term within the rock matrix along with the presence of quadratic pressure gradient term within the fracture yields significantly varying results from the conventional approach and it needs further research with reference to its practical implementation further the comparison of parabolic governing equation cases with hyperbolic equation cases provided by figs 11 14 shows that the fluid flow modeled using all hyperbolic governing equation except case 2b in which the mass transfer term is not considered in the fluid flow governing equation in the fracture predicts a maximum pressure reduction in the fracture the pressure distribution for case 2a and 2b exhibits a uniform variation along the fracture whereas the cases show in an uneven pressure distribution along the fracture it can be clearly observed from fig 11 b fig 12 b fig 13 b and fig 14 b that the pressure distribution pertains to the governing equations in case 2a parabolic and case 2b hyperbolic shows a distinct behavior against all other cases in the set of parabolic and hyperbolic governing equations it has been observed from figs 11 to 14 that for the set of parabolic equation in which the mass exchange term is considered in the fracture case 1a case 3a case 4a the pressure reduces at a higher rate at the initial phase 20 m from the fracture inlet than the pressure reduction obtained from the hyperbolic governing equations it is also observed from fig 10 that the governing equation which uses transient transfer function model case 1a case 1b and pseudo steady state transfer function model case 3a case 4a case 3b case 4b to model fluid mass exchange between fracture and rock matrix exhibits identical fluid flow behavior for both the set of parabolic and hyperbolic governing equations in the fracture matrix system thus it can be concluded that the modeling the fluid flow without considering the mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface in the fluid flow governing equation for fracture predicts significantly varying spatial pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases it has been also observed the resultant pressure distribution with in a coupled fracture matrix system does not depend on pseudo steady state and the transient transfer function models for both parabolic and hyperbolic sets of governing equations this implies that the introduction of hyperbolic term within the fracture has a significant role to play with and it cannot be ignored particularly in a fractured reservoir in addition it can also be concluded that the introduction coupling terms in fracture and or rock matrix is very critical and their presence or absence may significantly influence the resultant distribution of fluid pressure within the fracture 4 discussion in the context of groundwater the differential form of the mass balance equation for the groundwater phase that occupies the full pore space is given by 25 t ρ ϕ ρ q in order to understand the concept of compressibility in the context of groundwater flow the lhs of the above groundwater mass conservation equation eq 25 needs to be expanded mathematically as explained in bear 1972 which essentially expresses the mass of groundwater phase added to storage per unit volume of porous medium per unit time the fundamental processes that enable groundwater storage can be understood in detail when the groundwater mass conservation equation is differentiated with reference to the dependent variables density and porosity with respective to time as given below 26 t ρ ϕ ϕ ρ t ρ ϕ t the rhs of eq 26 has two components the first component represents the groundwater storage resulting from changes in fluid density while the second term represents the groundwater storage resulting from changes in aquifer porosity it is generally assumed that the groundwater storage resulting from both the components are small while no attempt is being made to quantify these two storage terms explicitly before assuming it to be insignificant for example the temporal variation of density the first term on rhs is very sensitive in the applications involving groundwater contaminant transport associated with the release of heavy industrial effluents groundwater storage along coastal aquifers and groundwater aquifer thermal energy storage system it should be noted that the density can vary as a function of pressure concentration of dissolved solids as well as temperature the compressibility effect is very prominent when density becomes a function of pressure the compressibility of groundwater may be expressed by the constitutive relationship as expressed in eq 27 27 ρ ρ o e β p p o in eq 27 p o represents the reference pressure the term β which represents the coefficient of compressibility of groundwater can be expressed as given in eq 28 28 β 1 ρ d ρ d t therefore the first term on rhs of eq 26 becomes as given below 29 ϕ ρ t ϕ ρ β p t the above expression relates the changes in groundwater density to changes in groundwater pressure this relation not only expresses the linear relation between density and pressure but also expresses the rate at which groundwater is being stored per unit volume of the porous medium resulting from the compressibility of groundwater upon variation in groundwater pressure since it is not practically feasible to secure the required data in the field it is generally assumed that the groundwater is incompressible under all circumstances it can be further noted that momentum equation used in a typical porous medium darcy s law is supposed to be looked at the macroscopic scale in other words all the details or processes that remains significant at the microscopic scale are averaged out while considering the darcy s approach and eventually the groundwater storage concept resulting from groundwater compressibility at the microscopic scale is either not given is due consideration or it is assumed to be averaged out and this particular aspect where the problem is looked only at the macroscopic scale despite its physical significance at the microscopic scale may not be valid under all circumstances as explained previously similarly the temporal variation of porosity remains very sensitive the second term on rhs in the applications including groundwater aquifers associated with carbonate or fractured rocks groundwater aquifers associated with highly unconsolidated alluvial formations and groundwater aquifers associated with seismically active zone in addition we generally follow the convention of decreasing porosity with mean grain size of the particles s a y d 10 for example porosity reduces gradually with sandy clay roughly 45 fine sand medium sand coarse sand gravelly sand fine gravel roughly 30 medium gravel and coarse gravel roughly 15 from this perspective only the macroscopic details regarding the gaussian distribution of porosity at the macroscopic scale is revealed however when porosity is split into its components namely specific yield and specific retention the details at the microscopic scale will be revealed which is essential for describing groundwater to be compressible or not for example fine sand with a mean grain size of 0 35 mm has an equal amount of specific yield as well as specific retention for a given mean porosity of 40 on the other hand the magnitude of specific yield stays at its maximum associated with its minimum specific retention for both sandy clay mean grain size 0 1 mm with a mean porosity of 45 and coarse sand mean grain size 2 mm with a mean porosity of 35 thus fine sand is associated with a relatively larger specific retention with that of a coarse sand and in turn there will be a significant reduction on the expansion of groundwater associated with the fine sand geologic formations as specific retention of fine sands retains groundwater against the gravity drainage this variation in fluid expansion is sensitive to the groundwater compressibility in addition in poorly sorted groundwater aquifers restructuring of pore geometry takes at the pore scale which significantly impacts the resultant groundwater compressibility analysis of such phenomena becomes very critical with the groundwater applications mentioned earlier thus the conventional assumption of insignificant storage effects resulting from both compressibility effects deserves a special attention before considering it so the authors could not secure relevant experimental field data from the existing literature that will help to project the sensitivity of groundwater compressibility however the authors feel that the importance of the compressibility of groundwater at a smaller scale than darcy s needs to be projected which would provide better insights on some of the critical groundwater applications as mentioned earlier 5 conclusions a numerical model using a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation in the fracture has been developed in order to simulate the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system the influence of fracture and rock matrix parameters namely fracture permeability matrix permeability and fracture aperture thickness on the drainage of the fluid from the rock matrix have been analyzed using the proposed model in addition all possible combinations of governing equations pertaining to a coupled fracture matrix system as provided by table 2 and table 3 have been numerically solved in order to investigate the sensitivity of transfer function term in modeling the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface and thus determining the spatial pressure distribution of reservoir pressure the current numerical study is intended to project the deviation of solution by using a non linear fluid flow model as against the conventional diffusive dominated linear fluid flow model in a fractured reservoir in addition the sensitivity of the transfer function in determining the pressure distribution has also been included the current analysis is performed on a simplified geometric domain which involves a single fracture associated with a two dimensional rectangular rock matrix with permeable walls this problem at the scale of a single fracture can be easily extrapolated to a larger field scale regular fracture network where a square or rectangular rock matrix is uniformly embedded in between the high permeable parallel fractures on all the six sides of the rock matrix the strength of the present work is to indicate the sensitivity of the hyperbolic dominant pressure gradient term it can be clearly noted here that the physical system containing hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations do not try to reach steady state conditions which is the typical difficulty associated with a highly heterogeneous fractured reservoir as against the conventional diffusive dominated equations where the physical system of interest nearly homogeneous unfractured sandstone reservoirs usually tries to reach the steady state condition after a long period of time the following conclusions have been drawn from the present numerical study 1 due to the presence of variety of heterogeneities modeling of fluid flow in a fractured reservoir may violate the two conditions i the pressure difference between the well and the region far away from the well being sufficiently large and ii the ratio ln r 0 r w being very small which essentially emphasizes the significant role of non linear hyperbolic term to be considered along with the existing parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation 2 the nature of spatial pressure distribution within the high permeable fracture to be either parabolic or hyperbolic depends on the total time period of fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system at the scale of a single fracture 3 the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation overestimates the rate of discharge of fluid from the rock matrix to fracture and in turn the resultant oil recovery from fractured reservoirs the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within high permeable fracture predicts a larger draining of fluid mass from a low permeable rock matrix to high permeable fracture and hence yields improved results towards actual oil recovery 4 the fluid flow modeling without considering the mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface in the fluid flow governing equation for fracture case 2a case 2b predicts a significantly varying spatial pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases 5 the spatial pressure distribution with the fracture depends on the strength of source sink term which defines the fluid mass exchange at the matrix fracture interface irrespective of the type of the transfer function model pseudo steady state or transient the numerical for both the set of parabolic and hyperbolic dominant governing equations in the fracture matrix system 6 high permeable fractures conduct the fluid at a faster rate which develops a huge pressure gradient between fracture and matrix and in turn increases the amount of fluid drained from the rock matrix to the fracture this enhances the recovery of the fluid from the associated rock matrix 7 the fluid interaction between the low permeable rock matrix and the associated high permeable fracture becomes very low beyond certain limit of the fracture aperture thickness 2b 1000 µm 8 the change in the vertical rock matrix permeability influences the diffusion of the fluid flow and the fluid mass exchange between the rock matrix and the fracture and hence the prediction of drainage based on the vertical permeability may be done by considering the combined effect of the above two fluid flow phenomena 9 the parabolic case significantly differs from rest of hyperbolic cases and implies that the introduction of quadratic pressure gradient term within the fracture has a significant role to play with and it cannot be ignored particularly in a fractured reservoir in addition it is also concluded that the introduction of coupling terms either in fracture and or rock matrix is very critical and their presence or absence may significantly influence the resultant distribution of fluid pressure within the fracture 
12342,a numerical model has been developed for simulating fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system by considering a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture as against the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation in addition for the first time a transient fluid mass transfer function has been introduced in the governing equation of fluid flow within the rock matrix in order to explicitly consider the fluid drainage from rock matrix into the fracture the effectiveness in modeling fluid flow using different governing equations developed by implementing the pseudo steady state and transient models of transfer functions with parabolic and hyperbolic conditions within the fracture and rock matrix has been discussed in detail numerical results suggest that the drainage of fluid from the rock matrix to the fracture and thus the estimation of its fluid recovery from the reservoir are overestimated in a typical coupled fracture matrix system using conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation it has been further observed that among the hyperbolic and parabolic dominant mathematical models used to describe the fluid flow through fracture the recent model proposed by the first author which is associated with the rate limited fluid mass transfer term within the low permeable rock matrix yields a significantly varying pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases it is also observed that the resultant pressure distribution within a coupled fracture matrix system is independent of the pseudo steady state transfer or transient transfer function which is used for modeling the fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface graphical abstract fx1 keywords fluid flow fracture rock matrix numerical model pressure distribution 1 introduction it is well known that the groundwater extraction from alluvial aquifers around the globe has made a significant contribution to the enhancement of the social and economic status of the mankind however such extraction from fractured aquifers remain limited due to the limited knowledge associated with characterizing a fractured aquifer apart from groundwater resources it is also known that more than half of the world s proven oil reserves and a nearly half of the world s gas reserves are trapped in carbonate reservoirs that are naturally fractured a sound understanding on fluid flow through rock fractures at the scale of a single fracture is fundamental in characterizing a network of complex fractured reservoir which essentially dictates the production performance as well as the recovery of oil and gas thus an improved knowledge associated with a fractured aquifer is imminent in the context of both groundwater sustainability as well as oil recovery it can also be noted that the modeling of a complex fracture network on a three dimensional scale not necessarily replicate the real reservoir dynamics as the resultant fluid flow through a connected network of fractures does not occur through all the naturally connected or synthetically generated fractures while the fluid flow occurs through the limited preferential pathways dictated by the coupled hydro geo mechanical effects at a much larger scale than perceived by the conventional representative elementary volume barrenblatt and zheltov 1960 warren and root 1963 adams et al 1968 najurieta 1980 nanba 1991 lim and aziz 1995 sekhar et al 2006 suresh kumar 2008 ortiz et al 2013 natarajan and suresh kumar 2011 natarajan and suresh kumar 2012 suresh kumar 2014a 2014b 2014c thereby making the fluid dynamics associated with a saturated aquifer or a petroleum reservoir to be extremely complex the petroleum reservoir or a geothermal reservoir fluid dynamics require the knowledge of thermodynamics as well since the reservoir fluid flow is generally associated with high temperature and high pressure conditions involving phase changes in essence one requires solving a multi phase multi component three dimensional fluid flow equation in order to grasp the exact reservoir dynamics of a fractured reservoir however the focus of the present study is limited to a single component single phase fluid flow through a fractured reservoir at the scale of a single fracture in a coupled fracture matrix system using the concept of dual continuum 1 1 fracture and rock matrix fluid flow as the fluid flow through saturated rock fractures has a direct influence on the economic production of crude oil as well as on the groundwater recharge potential in fractured rocks the hydraulic behavior of fluid flow through a fractured reservoir plays a very critical role the hydraulic behavior in turn determines the nature of governing fluid flow equations within the physical system fractured reservoir in general is composed of two fundamental entities namely low permeable rock matrix where the oil or the groundwater has been stored and a high permeable fracture through which oil or groundwater is transmitted towards the production well the fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface determines the quantum of oil or groundwater that will be drained from stored rock matrix into high permeable fracture since the porosity and permeability of fracture and rock matrix vary over several orders of magnitudes the assumption of single continuum in a fractured carbonate reservoir is highly idealistic in this context the physical domain of interest in the case of a fractured reservoir is split into two different continuums one for fracture and the other for rock matrix and the both the continuums are assumed to be connected effectively at the fracture matrix interface the rock matrix despite being low permeable has the characteristic feature of a typical porous medium and hence the conventional parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation can be applied comfortably the mathematical nature of a parabolic equation typically implies that the physical system of interest will try to reach a steady state condition after a sufficiently long time thus it is reasonable to anticipate a steady state condition within the rock matrix after a long time as the initial perturbations or noises associated with the pressure distribution within the rock matrix will eventually vanish with time in this context conventionally the same parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation is also applied to represent the fluid flow within the high permeable fracture however it is to be noted that the porosity of a single fracture pertains to 100 and also the fluid flow through a single rock fracture resembles the fluid flow through a pipe since the fluid velocity associated with the fracture is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the fluid velocity associated with the rock matrix the conventional assumption of parabolic dominant fluid flow within the high permeable fracture may not be always valid and needs a relook in this context a better description of fluid flow within the fracture associated with a fractured reservoir is very critical to the successful design and operation of petroleum reservoir projects and or artificial groundwater recharge in fractured rocks to start with many researchers have developed models in order to investigate the mechanism of fluid flow and a relatively efficient method has been deduced to recover oil from fractured reservoirs to mention a few despite the discovery of the very first fractured reservoir in 1880 hubbert and wills 1955 horner 1951 clearly pointed out that the conventional well test analysis associated with a homogeneous saturated sub surface reservoir cannot be extended in order to apply the same for a highly heterogeneous complex saturated fractured reservoir in this context baker 1955 first ever tried to characterize a fractured reservoir with reference to its new fundamental entity called a fracture this new hydro geological entity was associated with the earlier works by lamb 1932 muskat 1937 and huitt 1956 in order to deduce an equation that describes the steady state fluid flow through a typical fracture which is in line with the earlier equations describing fluid flow through smooth parallel plates thus baker 1955 for the very first time modeled a steady state fluid flow through a fracture as a function of width and depth of the fracture in addition to the conventional consideration of the developed pressure gradient along the direction of fluid flow baker s 1955 being a steady state model pollard 1959 for the first time modeled a transient fluid flow problem associated with a fractured reservoir it should be noted here that until this point 1959 the earlier studies assumed that there was no fluid mass exchange between the so called fine non communicating voids and coarse communicating voids it was barenblatt et al 1960 who first considered a fractured reservoir that consists of two different porous media with two different pore sizes where the very critical concept of fluid mass exchange between these two porous media was introduced during the same period barenblatt et al 1960 extended the fracture fluid flow analysis for a slightly compressible fluid as well since each porous medium represents a continuum the model proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 was referred to as a dual continuum model the concept of dual continuum essentially implies that in a geological formation with extremely varying porosity and permeability distributions for example in a fractured reservoir it is nearly impossible to deduce a reasonable representative elementary volume rev over which a mean value of variable such as intrinsic permeability can be deduced using the conventional single continuum approach it can be noted that at the scale of a single fracture the porosity of fracture corresponds to cent percent while that of its adjacent rock matrix can have porosity as low as 0 1 three orders of variation in magnitude over a very small distance similarly the permeability of fracture is in general several magnitudes higher than that of its associated rock matrix permeability thus a huge variation in magnitude over a very short distance yields steep gradient in flux distributions at the fracture matrix interface and this shock or discontinuity severely disturbs the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the fracture matrix interface and it does not allow to make use of the conventional single continuum concept comfortably as the fundamental assumption of smooth and continuous variation of dependent variable of interest pressure in this case in the physical domain is violated at the fracture matrix interface hence the associated fundamental geological units namely fracture and rock matrix is treated as two different continuums connected by the diffusive limited fluid mass exchange term thus in a typical dual continuum model the fluid flow equations are solved separately for both the continuums and the equations are coupled with a transfer term that characterizes the fluid mass transfer between the fracture and the rock matrix warren and root 1963 both the models by warren and root 1963 and adams et al 1968 projected a two straight line theory for the temporal variation of pressure associated with a fractured reservoir however it should be noted here that these plots were resulted from the variations of hydraulic head within a given fracture which was expressed at the scale of a single fracture while considering a pseudo steady state fluid mass transfer between low permeable rock matrix and high permeable fracture in other words the transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix was not considered explicitly and instead a pseudo steady state mass transfer function as a function of mean rock matrix pressure was introduced at the fracture matrix interface in order to consider the drainage from the rock matrix later kazemi 1969 numerically modeled the drainage from rock matrix into fracture by considering the transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix as a result the plot which provides the pressure as a function of logarithmic time yielded three distinct regions in describing the fluid flow through a fractured reservoir the first slope represents the early stage fracture dominated fluid flow while the intermediate nearly horizontal profile represents the transient fluid mass exchange between rock matrix and fracture and the final slope at the later stage represents the pseudo steady state rock matrix flow thus the introduction of transient nature of hydraulic head distribution within the low permeable rock matrix helped to better characterize a fractured reservoir in fact a plenty of numerical and analytical studies have been conducted in modeling the fluid flow in fractured reservoirs in the past few decades for example kazemi 1969 proposed a theoretical model for a naturally fractured reservoir based on the analytical model introduced by warren and root 1963 it was concluded that the pressure transient analysis of a naturally fractured reservoir depends on the degree and type of heterogeneity present in the system odeh 1965 developed a mathematical model for an unsteady radial flow in a naturally fractured reservoir which emphasized that the drawdown and pressure build up curves obtained by assuming a homogeneous reservoir was not suitable for understanding the flow mechanism in fractured reservoirs a theoretical model for flow in homogenous reservoirs was developed by najurieta 1980 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 proposed a new technique based on bilinear theory which considered a linear flow in both fracture and rock matrix for analyzing pressure transient data kazemi s dual porosity model was updated by gilman and kazemi 1983 by including the fracture relative permeability when fluid was flowing from fracture to matrix nanba 1991 compared the pseudo steady inter porosity behavior with the transient inter porosity model in an actual field using the concept of a matrix block skin and concluded that both the models exhibited the same behavior when the matrix skin was large lim and aziz 1995 developed a matrix fracture transfer function for dual porosity flow simulation in naturally fractured reservoir combining analytical solution of pressure diffusion for various flow geometries a numerical investigation of a two dimensional matrix fracture system was performed by ortiz et al 2013 based on bilinear flow theory 1 2 limitations of darcy s law the overall fluid migration within a reservoir is controlled by a couple of hydraulic parameters namely hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity while the rate of fluid flux is essentially controlled by the time required by the fluid flux to traverse between recharge and discharge zones the consistent interpretation of hydraulic or pressure head profiles for a given mathematical model is the characteristic feature of a particular numerical model given the constraints on the availability of reservoir field data numerical modeling of the fractured reservoirs provides a better insight in the estimation of oil or groundwater resources as the modeling provides more details on the spatial and temporal distribution of fluid stresses however the validity of these model based forecasting has become extremely challenging the empirical darcy s equation is the fundamental equation used to describe the flow of newtonian fluids through porous media and this equation is essentially applicable at lower reynolds number darcy s equation provides a linear relationship between bulk volume based darcy velocity and the pore volume based potential gradient the constant of proportionality in darcy s equation depends on both aquifers permeability as well fluid properties density and viscosity however it is not possible to classify the permeability tensor to be symmetric or non symmetric based on the empirical darcy s equation and also darcy s law as such does not entertain its applicability to transient or compressible fluid flow more than a century later mokadam confirmed that darcy s law cannot be derived analytically by performing a momentum balance in terms of macroscopic quantities on a small element of the porous media later darcy s law was derived by integrating n s equation hubbert 1957 hall 1956 however it should be noted that n s equation represents microscopic momentum balance equation for a newtonian fluid while darcy s analogy deduced from n s equation also represents the momentum balance equation for newtonian fluids through porous medium but at the microscopic scale thus by default conventional darcy s equation requires the values of constants and variables to be averaged properly over the volume of interest failing which the nature of the permeability tensor and in turn the physical nature of darcian flow cannot be represented precisely this problem becomes further complex in the case of fractured aquifers for example the presence of fractures in the fractured reservoirs acts as high permeable conduits while the adjoining rock matrix acts a low permeable geological unit in addition at the scale of a single fracture as applied in a typical dual porosity system the porosity in fracture equals 100 while the porosity of the adjoining rock matrix falls as low as less than 1 given the variation in porosity and permeability by orders of magnitude over an adjacent geological unit the averaging of the parameters cannot be justified easily as it requires a representative elementary volume which is extremely large for fractured reservoirs in addition from mathematical perspective the presence of fractures makes the fluid flow to be more towards hyperbolic dominancy rather than its conventional parabolic assumption for describing the fluid flow through alluvial aquifers conventional diffusing equation which is parabolic dominant characterizes the aquifer reasonably while the description of fluid flow through fractured aquifers which is predominantly hyperbolic dominant cannot be described with the existing form of diffusivity equation and requires modification to include the effects of hyperbolic dominancy resulting from the presence of fluid flow through connected high permeable fractures 1 3 hyperbolic dominant fluid flow plenty of numerical studies have been conducted for addressing the hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow in fractured reservoirs by considering non linearity associated with the fluid flow equation of high permeable fracture to mention a few chakrabarty et al 1993 and bai and roegiers 1994 have derived analytical dimensionless pressure solution by incorporating a quadratic gradient term in the fluid flow equation it has been observed from their respective models that the predicted wellbore pressure using linear solution is smaller than that by non linear solution at larger times from a correlation between non linear fluid flow and diffusion convection transport bai et al 1994 proved that neglecting the quadratic gradient term in flow equation will result in a transport mechanism with a non convective transport a new analytical model for solving diffusion equation with quadratic gradient term was introduced by jelmert and vik 1996 a comparison of non linear and linear pressure solution has been performed by tong and wang 2005 by considering the effect of the quadratic gradient term in large time well tests sim 2008 proposed a new methodology in order to deal with the square gradient term in the flow equation a new variable has been introduced which depends exponentially on the pressure for replacing the quadratic pressure term a non linear spherical flow equation with a quadratic gradient term has been deduced by nie and ding 2010 for the analysis of spherical percolation of oil flow in porous media it is evident from the percolation type curves that the influence of the quadratic pressure gradient term makes the non linear solution very distinct from the linear solution the analysis of errors generated by the exclusion of the non linear term from the flow governing equation has been conducted by dewei et al 2013 it has been concluded from the analysis that the quadratic pressure gradient term has significant influence on governing the transient flow and well testing guo and nie 2013 modeled a non linear transient flow behavior of well production in an underground formation by deducing diffusion equation by inclusion of quadratic pressure gradients by comparing the theoretical data and field data it has been concluded that in underground formations non linear model describes the fluid flow more realistic and accurate all the earlier models of non linear quadratic hyperbolic pressure gradient term do not explicitly consider the direction of fluid flow between high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix in this context suresh kumar 2014a proposed an improved mathematical model which better describes the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system the mathematical model includes a hyperbolic dominant non linear fluid flow equation in fracture instead of a conventional parabolic dominant linear fluid flow governing equation in addition to that the transfer function which defines the fluid mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface is considered explicitly in the governing equation within the rock matrix as against the conventional consideration of coupling term within the fracture however in the present paper the deduction of the proposed non linear fluid flow governing equation within the fracture from continuity equation is detailed and a robust numerical model with detailed comparison between the linear and non linear cases and the sensitivity of considering the instantaneous and transient diffusive fluid mass exchange from fracture to rock matrix and from rock matrix to fracture have been analyzed in detail as against the earlier mathematical model proposed by suresh kumar 2014a several researchers have attempted to consider the non linear fluid flow equations by using either forchheimer or brinkman equations to take into account the larger fluid velocity however it is not feasible to delineate the onset of non darcy effects using reynolds number as well as forchheimer number relates the pressure drop caused by fluid interaction at the fracture matrix interface to that by the viscous resistance of the saturated fluid within the fracture thus it can be noted that unlike the earlier non darcian models using forchheimer 1901 and brinkman 1947 the present model considers the darcian approach by neither considering the second order of the fracture fluid velocity term that represents the microscopic inertial effect nor by considering the second order derivative of the velocity term as used in brinkman equation in addition in the present model the flow non linearity is not assumed to be attributed by turbulence while it is assumed that the flow is still non linear resulting from non linear variation of fluid flow rate with the pressure loss within the high permeable fracture since the computation of this pressure loss using non linear navier stokes equation is highly time consuming for engineering applications the present work explicitly considers the fundamental darcian based fluid flow equation without neglecting the hyperbolic dominant non linear fluid flow term in addition most of the commercial packages used by the current oil and gas industries for analyzing the fluid flow phenomena in various applications such as well testing primary secondary and enhanced oil recoveries are still using the diffusive dominant parabolic diffusivity equation the same equation is being used in order to analyze the behavior of fluid flow within the high permeable fracture as well however the numerical results of the present study have clearly indicated the importance of considering the behavior of fluid flow to be of hyperbolic dominant under higher mean fluid velocities or higher intrinsic permeability in addition since the present model considers the presence of hyperbolic term as an additional term to the existing model it will be much easier to implement this additional hyperbolic term in the software packages without altering the existing base equations further all the fluid mass exchange terms can be directly incorporated into the existing model and thus the present work can be easily incorporated in order to improve the existing modeling equations associated with oil and gas industries packages the present work clearly differs from earlier works in the sense that the model considers the darcian based non linear hyperbolic dominant fluid flow term in order to better consider the higher mean fluid velocity that is generally expected within a high permeable fracture since the present problem is particularly concerned with the fluid flow through a fractured reservoir at the scale of a single fracture the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the fracture matrix interface between the two different continuums plays a very sensitive role at this point it should be clearly noted that in a coupled fracture matrix system there can be fluid exchange from fracture into rock matrix as well as vice versa in other words the direction of fluid flow in a direction normal to the fracture axis needs to be clearly specified in order to better describe the spatial and temporal distribution of fluid pressure within the coupled fracture matrix system in this context all the earlier models used to describe fluid flow through a coupled fracture matrix system has a coupling term that ensures the continuity of fluid mass fluxes at the interface only along with the fracture fluid flow equation and obviously it does not completely describe the fluid mass distribution between fracture and rock matrix in other words from the existing set of fluid flow equations applied for a dual continuum system it is difficult to delineate the fluid mass exchange a from fracture into rock matrix and b from rock matrix into fracture this particular aspect is very critical in the context of reservoir engineering as the fluid from fracture needs to be diffused into the low permeable rock matrix in order for the chemical or steam to react with the trapped crude oil within the rock matrix which will subsequently reduce the interfacial tension and or viscosity and thereby improving the mobility of the oil within the rock matrix thus the fraction of applied chemicals or steam that diffused into the rock matrix from the fracture needs to be precisely evaluated in the context of enhanced oil recovery in order to better assess the injection rate of steam or chemicals that should be applied at the surface on the other hand as soon as the mobility of crude oil within the rock matrix is enhanced then there will be fluid flow in the reverse direction i e from rock matrix into the high permeable fracture which will eventually be transmitted towards the production well thus in this case the fraction of oil draining from rock matrix into high permeable fracture provides a better insight on the resulting oil recovery efficiency from a typical fractured reservoir such delineations of fluid flow across the fracture matrix interface could provide better insights in understanding the microscopic displacement efficiency and macroscopic sweep efficiency associated with a fractured reservoir in this context the objectives of the present study is as follows i to revisit and deduce a mathematical model that takes into account non linear hyperbolic dominant fluid flow within the high permeable fracture using darcian approach from fundamental principles ii to numerically solve the set of proposed linear and non linear fluid flow equations for a coupled fracture matrix system using finite volume scheme and iii to investigate the sensitivity of pseudo steady state transfer and transient transfer fluid exchange terms that are used at the fracture matrix interface on the spatial and temporal distribution of reservoir pressure 2 physical system and governing equations the numerical modeling for analyzing the pressure distribution in a coupled fracture matrix system is performed by idealizing the fractured reservoir into a physical domain which considers fractures and matrices as two different geological units with entirely different properties as suggested by warren and root 1960 in their dual porosity model the dual porosity model assumes the reservoir block as a parallelepiped which contains cubical blocks of rock matrices arranged with fractures in between the adjacent blocks the flow equations are solved separately in fracture and matrix and the two systems are coupled together by a transfer function coupling term which defines the fluid mass exchange between the fracture and matrix at the interface the dual porosity model has contributed much for a simplified analysis of fractured reservoirs and is widely used in the research studies involving flow and transport in a coupled fracture matrix system the present study focuses on a coupled fracture matrix system at the scale of a single fracture as shown in fig 1 with its respective boundary conditions and the results obtained can be generalized to the whole reservoir the domain consists of a two dimensional rectangular block of low permeable rock matrix of thickness l m associated with a high permeable fracture of length l f and fracture aperture thickness 2b the pressure at the fracture inlet and outlet have been specified by the dirichlet type boundary conditions the fluid flow within the fracture is considered to be driven by the pressure difference between the fracture inlet and outlet with negligible capillary effects the flow within the matrix block is considered to be laminar zero flux neumann type boundary conditions have been specified on the sides of the low permeable rock matrix the fluid flow within the fracture is discussed in detail as follows darcy s law is the fundamental equation describing the flow of newtonian fluid through porous medium based on the experiments on vertical water filtration through sand beds darcy from his experiments on steady state fluid flow established an empirical relation in which the volumetric flow rate varies linearly with pressure gradient thus the darcy flux within the high permeable fracture is represented as given in eq 1 1 q q a k f μ δ p ρ g h l where q represents the darcy flux q is the volume flow rate k f is the fracture permeability µ is the viscosity p is the static pressure ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration h is the head and l is the total length of the fracture in eq 1 q represents the darcy flux expressed in m 3 m 2 s further the same equation is also used for transient fluid flow by converting the same into a differential form as expressed in eq 2 2 q v q a k μ d p ρ g h d z for one dimensional horizontal flow eq 2 get converted into a form in the absence of gravity as expressed in eq 3 with the assumption that both horizontal and vertical permeability are equal 3 q h q a k μ d p d x considering fluid flow through a one dimensional tube of cross sectional area a the mass conservation equation for one dimensional linear flow in a porous medium can be expressed as given in eq 4 4 d d x ρ q d d t ρ ϕ expanding the r h s of eq 4 yields 5 d d t ρ ϕ ρ d ϕ f d t ϕ f d ρ d t ρ ϕ f c φ c f d p d t where ϕ f is the porosity of fracture c ϕ and c f represent the rock and fluid compressibility respectively expanding the l h s of eq 4 yields 6 d d x ρ q ρ k f μ d 2 p d x 2 c f d p d x 2 now equating eqs 5 and 6 yields 7 d 2 p d x 2 c f d p d x 2 ϕ f μ c t k d p d t the r h s of the diffusion equation provided by eq 7 involves a total compressibility factor which is equal to the sum of fracture compressibility and the fluid compressibility 8 c t c ϕ c f the fracture compressibility c ϕ depends on the rate of change of porosity with respect to time within the fracture 9 c ϕ 1 ϕ f ϕ f t in the current analysis the fracture porosity is considered to be 100 at the scale of a single fracture and it is assumed that the fracture deformation due to hydraulic stress is negligible hence the pores i e the fracture aperture thickness are considered to be inelastic and the porosity of the fracture remains constant throughout the fluid flow simulation therefore the fracture compressibility c ϕ will eventually become zero and can be ignored from the fluid flow governing equation within the fracture in order to observe a significant difference in the pressure profile obtained from the equation governing the fluid flow within the fracture with quadratic pressure term and without quadratic pressure term the compressibility of the working fluid in the system should be greater than 1 10 9 pa 1 since the fluids with the mentioned compressibility values falls under the category of gases the fluid compressibility can no more be considered as a constant value it will be a strong function of pressure in eq 7 the fluid compressibility is defined as provided in eq 10 10 c f 1 ρ ρ p from the real gas equation of state 11 ρ p r t z where r is the real gas constant t is the temperature and z is the compressibility factor combining eqs 10 and 11 and simplifying yields 12 c f 1 p 1 z z p the reservoir temperature in the present analysis is assumed to be at 500 f associated with the gas window and the specific gravity of the gas is 0 7 for the current reservoir conditions the variation in the compressibility factor with respect to reservoir pressure is negligible manning and thomson 1991 such that 13 z p 0 substituting eq 13 in eq 12 yields 14 c f 1 p the viscosity of the fluid has a strong dependence on temperature since the range of reservoir pressure throughout the simulation is maintained consistently to be at a pressure value less than the critical pressure of the reservoir at the assumed reservoir condition the viscosity of the fluid eventually remains as a constant for an isothermal fluid flow the value of viscosity for the gas with specific gravity 0 7 for the given reservoir condition is 1 91 10 5 pa s in eq 7 the non linear hyperbolic term becomes very critical under two critical conditions for the case of fractured reservoirs i when the difference between the pressure within the well and the undisturbed pressure away from the well becomes large and ii when the ratio ln r 0 r w becomes small which essentially depends on the distribution nature of fracture spacing and fracture density thus it can be clearly concluded that the conventional approach using parabolic dominant linear diffusivity fluid flow equation within the high permeable fracture inherently assumes that the above two conditions are not violated such conditions are mostly satisfied for a classical porous medium reservoir based on a single continuum approach and that too in the absence of any heterogeneity however for a fractured reservoir since the porosity of fracture and its adjoining rock matrix vary over two orders magnitude while the intrinsic permeability of fracture and its adjoining rock matrix vary over several orders of magnitude it is pretty clear that it is not always feasible to satisfy the above two conditions given the variety of heterogeneities eq 7 can be rearranged as given in eq 15 that represents the hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation for high permeable fracture 15 k f μ d 2 p d x 2 c f k f μ d p d x 2 ϕ f c f d p d t the fluid flow equation along the fracture in the absence of non linear hyperbolic dominant term represents the conventional diffusivity equation describing fluid flow through a typical porous medium as given by eq 16 eq 16 is parabolic in nature as against the hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow equation as represented in eq 15 16 k f μ d 2 p d x 2 ϕ f c f d p d t similarly the fluid flow equation for the rock matrix with fluid mass transfer term suresh kumar 2014a 2014b 2014c is provided as given in eq 17 17 k m x μ d 2 p d x 2 k m y μ d 2 p d y 2 k m y μ 1 b d p d y y 0 ϕ m c m d p d t in eq 17 k m x represents the horizontal matrix permeability k m y represents vertical matrix permeability and ϕ m represents the matrix porosity the initial and boundary conditions for the fracture representing eq 15 are provided by eq 18 18 p x t 0 0 p x 0 t p a p x l t p b the initial and boundary conditions for the rock matrix representing eq 17 are provided by eq 19 19 p x y t 0 p 0 p x x 0 y t 0 p x x l y t 0 p x x y l m t 0 the base case parameters considered in the present numerical model are provided in table 1 the following assumptions have been made with reference to eq 1 19 i most of the storage storativity is assumed to be within the low permeable rock matrix while the high permeable fractures act as conduits which are essentially responsible for the fluid transmission transmissivity ii the fluid flow rate is assumed to be along the length of the fracture axis which essentially coincides with that of the principal direction of fluid flow iii the fluid flow within the fracture is assumed to follow the theory of fluid flow between two smooth parallel plates in the absence of any roughness or tortuosity iv the fluid flow within the low permeable rock matrix is in the direction normal to the fracture axis v the thickness of the fracture aperture is assumed to be greater than 10 µm and hence fluid driven by capillary effects if any is ignored vi the thickness of the fracture aperture is assumed to be lesser than 1000 µm and hence the possibility of two dimensional velocity distribution within the high permeable fracture is averted vii the fluid flow through the high permeable fracture is assumed to be completely saturated with a single phase fluid only either water or oil and hence the concept of capillary pressure effects if any resulting from the theory of multi phase fluid flow is averted the formulation of dual porosity model deviates from a single porosity model by the inclusion of a transfer function term which governs the matrix fracture interaction between the rock matrix and fracture at the interface barenblatt et al 1960 the transfer function couples the fluid flow in the fracture and rock matrix the implementation of transfer function either in the rock matrix equation or in the fracture equation is decided by the direction of the fluid flow for example the transfer function employed in the rock matrix suresh kumar 2014a defines the draining of fluid from rock matrix to fracture whereas the transfer function employed in the fracture equation defines the diffusion of fluid from fracture to rock matrix warren et al 1963 cinco ley et al 1978 ortiz et al 2013 two types of transfer function models have been proposed by many authors pseudo steady state transfer model and transient transfer model hassan and mehran 2006 in pseudo steady state transfer model the matrix block act as a source or sink for the fracture system the mass transfer rate between the rock matrix and the fracture is proportional to the difference in the average matrix block pressure and the fracture pressure at the instant of computation the pseudo steady state transfer function model is provided by eq 20 20 q m k m μ a v p m p f δ y y 0 in eq 20 q m represents the source or sink term p m and p f represents the average matrix block pressure and the fracture pressure at the instant of computation in transient transfer model the mass transfer rate between the rock matrix and the fracture is proportional to the pressure gradient at the matrix fracture interface the transient transfer model is provided by eq 21 21 q m k m μ a v p f y y 0 in order to numerically investigate the sensitivity of fluid mass transfer term at the fracture matrix interface by considering it within the high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix explicitly and to investigate the role of considering the non linear hyperbolic dominant nature of fluid flow within the high permeable fracture multiple simulation runs have been carried out pseudo steady state model and transient transfer model are the two prominent models proposed by many researchers for addressing the fracture matrix mass transfer in the fluid flow simulation in a typical coupled fracture matrix system the cases specified in table 2 parabolic and table 3 hyperbolic includes transfer function modeled using transient transfer model case1a case1b pseudo steady state model case4a case4b combination of both pseudo steady state and transient transfer models case3a case3b and the transient transfer function model considered in fluid flow governing equation within the rock matrix case2a case2b the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure within the fracture fig 10 to 16 obtained from the fluid flow simulations corresponding to the cases mentioned in table 2 parabolic cases and table 3 hyperbolic cases are intended to investigate the sensitivity of different models of mass transfer function that can be applied at the fracture matrix interface and to understand the influence of the quadratic pressure term on the resultant distribution of pressure profiles within the fracture the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure within the fracture between parabolic cases specified in table 2 and hyperbolic cases specified in table 3 are provided in fig 10 a and fig 10 b respectively the role of transfer function in fluid flow simulation using parabolic and hyperbolic fluid flow governing equation within the fracture is projected in fig 10 the importance of the comparison study performed in fig 10 conveys the sensitivity of the existing transfer function models which essentially defines the mass transfer between fracture and rock matrix at the interface in estimating the resultant pressure distribution in fluid flow simulation in fractured reservoirs figs 11 14 provide an individual comparison of pressure profiles obtained from the fluid flow simulated using parabolic cases and hyperbolic cases the pressure distribution profiles in figs 11 14 are presented to demonstrate the combined effect of the fracture matrix mass transfer and the non linearity on fluid flow in a fracture matrix system for example in fig 11 the pressure distribution obtained from the fluid flow simulation using case 1a parabolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in fracture is being compared with case 1b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in fracture case 2b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with transient mass transfer term in rock matrix case 3b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with pseudo steady state mass transfer term in fracture and transient mass transfer term in matrix case 4b hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation with pseudo steady state mass transfer term in fracture similarly all other parabolic cases in table 2 are compared with each hyperbolic case in table 3 in figs 12 14 respectively tables 2 and 3 provide 4 different cases of parabolic and hyperbolic dominant governing equations for fluid flow within a coupled low permeable rock matrix and a high permeable fracture respectively these tables have been constructed for the first time which involves all possible combinations of governing equations pertaining to a coupled fracture matrix system in the presence and absence of fluid mass exchange term either in the fracture or in the rock matrix the governing equations consider both pseudo steady state and transient transfer function terms within the fracture and rock matrix either as source or sink term thereby explicitly considering the direction of the fluid flow between fracture and rock matrix at the fracture matrix interface case 1a table 2 parabolic equation case 1 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and rock matrix in which a transient transfer function which characterizes the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface has been incorporated in the fracture equation the transfer term in the fracture equation as given in case 1a constitutes the source term that defines the acceptance of the fluid drained from the rock matrix by the fracture the equations specified in case 1a is mostly used in the modeling of diffusion of fluid from fracture to rock matrix by replacing the positive sign of the transfer term to negative sign the negative sign implies that the fluid is being injected from the fracture into the matrix block ortiz et al 2013 case 2a table 2 parabolic equation case 2 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and matrix in which the transient transfer function has been incorporated in the equation for fluid flow within the rock matrix the transfer function is added as a sink term that represents the draining of fluid from the rock matrix into the fracture the equation specified in case 2a does not consider the acceptance of fluid by the fracture discharged from the rock matrix case 3a table 2 parabolic equation case 3 represents the parabolic fluid flow equation within the fracture and roc matrix in which the transfer function is implemented in both the fracture and rock matrix equations the transfer function is employed as a source term within the fracture equation whereas in the rock matrix equation the transfer function is employed as a sink term a pseudo steady state transfer function model is implemented within the fracture equation the equation specified in case 3a considers both instantaneous acceptance of fluid by the fracture as well as the rate limited fluid drainage from the rock matrix into the fracture case 4a table 2 parabolic equation case 4 represents the parabolic dominant fluid flow equation within the fracture and matrix in which the transient transfer function in the fracture equation as specified in case 1a is replaced by pseudo steady state transfer function the transfer function included in the fracture equation acts as a source which accepts the instantaneous fluid drainage from the rock matrix this type of coupled governing equations in which a pseudo steady state inter porosity transfer function model in the fracture has widely been used in models proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 kazemi et al 1976 and sarma and aziz 2006 all the above cases of pseudo steady state and transient transfer function models falling under linear fluid flow equations within the fracture and rock matrix have been extended to hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations as represented in cases 1b to 4b table 3 the implementation of the transient transfer function as a sink term in the non linear governing equation for fluid flow within the rock matrix case 2b was recently proposed by the first author suresh kumar 2014a while introducing the non linear effects within the high permeable fracture this non linear effect within the high permeable fracture is significantly addressed when the mean fluid velocity within the fracture is reasonably higher thus tables 2 and 3 provide the complete set of linear and non linear governing equations with various kinds of fluid mass exchange terms within the fracture and or rock matrix associated with couple fracture matrix systems addressed at the scale of a single fracture it can be noted that the mathematical models for all the non linear cases except case 2b table 3 have been proposed for the first time while the respective numerical models for all the four cases table 3 case 1b case 4b are to be modeled for the first time as explained in the following section 2 1 numerical model the present numerical model solves a hyperbolic dominant one dimensional partial differential equation governing the fluid flow within the fracture as expressed in eq 15 and a parabolic dominant two dimensional partial differential equation governing the fluid flow within the rock matrix as expressed in eq 17 the fluid flow equations have to be solved separately within the fracture and the rock matrix domains and hence a one dimensional uniform structured grid with 100 nodes is generated for the fracture geometry and a two dimensional non uniform structured grid with 100 50 nodes is generated to represent the low permeable rock matrix within the 2d rock matrix block the cell widths along the horizontal direction is uniformly spaced while the cell widths in the direction perpendicular to the fracture axis follows a geometric variation given by y j y j 1 a j 1 where y j is the y coordinate of the current node y j 1 is the y coordinate of the previous node and a is the common ratio the mesh size is kept finer nearer to the fracture matrix interface in order to better ensure the continuity of fluid mass fluxes resulting steep gradients of the concerned dependent variables while cell widths far away from the interface are chosen relatively courser as the distribution of gradients of the dependent variables at these places are relatively smooth thus the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface is well captured due to the larger number of computational cells considered in the vicinity of the interface since finite difference technique cannot capture the steep gradients effectively that occur at the fracture matrix interface and also since this technique cannot handle a relatively larger mean fluid velocity within the fracture mass conservation based finite volume implicit solver is employed in order to solve the set of the coupled equations as given in tables 2 and 3 since the finite volume method is based on flux conservation at the interfaces of the control volumes it will be easy to handle the fluid mass transfer terms at the fracture matrix interface which involves abrupt changes in the reservoir properties like porosity and permeability as the fluid expands from one continuum to another a second order central scheme is used for spatial discretization of the pressure equation and a first order accurate forward differencing scheme has been used for the temporal variation in the fluid pressure as given in eqs 15 and 17 discretization of the partial differential equation within the fracture eq 15 is provided by eq 22 22 k f μ p f n 1 x e a e p f n 1 x w a w u n c f n p f e n 1 a e p f w n 1 a w ϕ f c f n p f n 1 p f n δ t δ v the discretization of the partial differential equation is carried out based on the finite volume cell centered approach in which the fluxes crossing individual faces of the control volume cell are averaged at the cell center the first term in the l h s of eq 22 represents the discretization of diffusive fluxes the pressure gradients p f x e and p f x w are calculated at the east and west faces subscripts e and w denotes the east and west faces respectively and a e and a w are the area vectors normal to the respective faces similarly the second term in the l h s represents the discretization of the convective fluxes the r h s of eq 22 represents the temporal discretization of the conservative pressure within the fracture the quantity u in the eq 22 represents the darcy flux 23 u n k f μ p x n the expression for fluid compressibility c f as a function of pressure is provided in eq 10 the inclusion of darcy flux in the conventional parabolic dominant diffusion equation modifies the governing equation in to a hyperbolic dominant equation the value of u and c f is assumed initially i e at time 0 and u and c f remains unknown at next time level n 1 at subsequent time levels the value of u and c f obtained at the previous time level is substituted and is iterated at each time level till its convergence discretization of the partial differential equation within the rock matrix eq 17 is provided by eq 24 24 k m x μ p m n 1 x e a e p m n 1 x w a w k m y μ p m n 1 y n a n p m n 1 y s a s k m μ b p m n 1 p f n 1 δ y y 0 δ v ϕ m c m p m n 1 p m n δ t δ v in eq 24 a n and a s represents the area normal in the y direction to the north and south cell faces respectively the discretization of the fluid mass transfer representing the last term of l h s in eq 23 involves the difference in the fracture matrix pressure at the fracture matrix interface between rock matrix and fracture nodes the transfer term acts as a sink in describing the fluid mass exchange from rock matrix to fracture the fracture pressure p f is obtained from the calculated pressure distribution along the fracture at current time level and δ y represents the cell width across the fracture matrix interface a constant and equal pressure distribution is considered within both fracture and rock matrix initially the fluid is in equilibrium at the beginning of flow simulation significant pressure difference is generated between the inlet and outlet of the fracture domain while keeping the boundaries of the rock matrix block with zero flux the boundary conditions for fracture and rock matrix have been provided as expressed in eqs 18 and 19 respectively the fluid pressure at the fracture matrix interface is assumed to be the same as that of the fracture and this implies that there is pressure gradient within the fracture normal to the fluid flow direction moreover the same condition is imposed as a boundary condition for the flow simulation within the rock matrix block the present model delivers an unconditionally stable solution since an implicit numerical scheme is used for the calculation of pressure profiles within the coupled fracture matrix system however for a better and accurate solution the time step is taken as δt 1 s and the simulation is carried out for a total time period of t 1 day the pressure distribution obtained along the fracture has been verified with the analytical solution provided by ronald 1995 a semi implicit numerical scheme has been used to handle the hyperbolic term in the governing equation of fluid flow within the fracture as given in eq 15 the darcy flux u in eq 22 and the fluid compressibility in eq 10 is computed at previous time level whereas the pressure gradient is calculated at the current time level the tri diagonal matrix generated for the partial differential equation within the fracture and penta diagonal matrix generated for the partial differential equation within the two dimensional rock matrix are solved till convergence is achieved with a tolerance limit of 1 10 7 in the algebraic equation solver 3 results and discussion fig 2 provides spatial distribution of pressure along the fracture simulated for a period of 1 day it can be observed from fig 2 that the present numerical model results matches with that of the analytical solution provided by ronald 1995 it can be further noted that the model has been validated with the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation without hyperbolic term as represented by eq 16 the fluid is assumed to be compressible and the flow is considered to be laminar with a dynamic fluid viscosity 1 91 10 5 pa s and the rest of the details can be secured from table 1 fig 3 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profile along the fracture at the end of three different time periods with the inclusion of quadratic pressure term as represented by eq 15 it can be observed from fig 3 that the pressure profile characteristics gradually vary from hyperbolic dominant to parabolic dominant nature with time it has been noted from fig 3 that the fluid flow within the fracture attains a steady state at the end of 5 days and thus the pressure gradient between fracture and rock matrix will remain a constant as the flow progress beyond 5 days it is also observed that there is a significant reduction in the overall pressure along the fracture length as the time period increases thus it is critical to realize that the pressure difference between the high permeable fracture and low permeable rock matrix is always not consistent along the entire length of the fracture between the inlet and outlet for a given time period thus it can be concluded from fig 3 that the spatial distribution of pressure profile within the high permeable fracture is characterized to be either parabolic or hyperbolic nature depending upon the respective time periods and it cannot always be taken for granted that the fluid flow within the fracture will be parabolic dominant fig 4 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profiles along the fracture fig 4 a and within the rock matrix fig 4 b fig 4 a provides a comparison between the pressure distributions along the fracture for a typical fluid flow equation with parabolic nature as represented by eq 16 and the fluid flow equation with hyperbolic nature as represented by eq 15 fig 4 b provides the pressure distribution profile within the rock matrix normal to the fracture axis at a distance of 20 m from the fracture inlet both the pressure profiles along the fracture and rock matrix have been projected pertaining to a simulation period of 1 day it can be clearly noted from fig 4 a and b that the conventional fluid flow equation with parabolic dominancy overestimates the pressure reduction in fracture and rock matrix for example at a distance of 50 m from the fracture inlet the intensity of pressure within the fracture predicted using conventional parabolic dominant diffusivity equation is around 2 09 mpa while the respective intensity of pressure at the same distance within the fracture using the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation estimates the intensity of pressure to be 2 5 mpa similarly the magnitudes of intensities of pressure within the matrix at a distance of 0 01 m from the fracture matrix interface are 3 06 mpa and 3 2 mpa using parabolic dominant diffusivity equation and the currently proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations respectively thus it can be concluded from fig 4 that the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within the high permeable fracture suggests a reasonably higher values of fluid pressure along the fracture and the matrix for a given time period and this in turn may have a significant impact on the resultant oil recovery during primary secondary and tertiary oil recovery processes associated with a fractured reservoir fig 5 a and b represents the spatial distribution of pressure for two different fracture permeability values kf 1 10 15 m2 and kf 1 10 12 m2 simulated at the end of 1 day fig 5 a corresponds to the pressure profile along the fracture whereas fig 5 b corresponds to pressure profile along the rock matrix at a distance x 20 m from the fracture inlet it has been observed from fig 5 a that at a given time period the pressure distribution along the fracture for a relatively low fracture permeability kf 1 10 15 m2 follows a constant pressure value up to a significant length down the fracture from the inlet and thus it behaves more like a parabolic dominant fluid flow while the pressure distribution curve for a relatively higher fracture permeability kf 1 10 12 m2 provides a steep gradient representing more like a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow thus it can be concluded from fig 5 a that the magnitude of fracture permeability essentially decides the nature of fluid flow to be either as parabolic or hyperbolic dominant on the other hand the magnitude of fracture permeability affects the mobility of the fluid within the fracture since the mobility of the fluid is proportional to the fracture permeability mobility m k f μ any increase in fracture permeability increases the fluid mobility which in turn increases the fluid flow velocity where velocity u m p x it is also observed that the significant reduction in the pressure intensities for higher permeability value kf 1 10 12 m2 as observed from fig 5 b leads to a higher amount of drainage from the rock matrix for example from fig 5 b it can be observed that the pressure intensity for kf 1 10 12 m2 at a distance 0 02 m is 3 2 mpa whereas the pressure intensity at the same location for kf 1 10 15 m2 is 3 37 mpa thus it can be concluded from fig 5 that the fractures with high permeability conducts the fluid at a faster rate yielding a huge pressure gradient between fracture and matrix and thus enhances the recovery of the fluid from the associated rock matrix fig 6 provides the spatial distribution of fluid pressure along the rock matrix at a distance 20 m from the fracture inlet simulated at the end of 1 day the pressure distribution is obtained for two different horizontal permeability values of the rock matrix kmx 1 10 14 m2 and kmx 1 10 12 m2 it has been observed from fig 6 that for two orders of increase in the magnitude of horizontal permeability of the rock matrix the percentage reduction in overall pressure from its initial value within the rock matrix has been increased from 60 to 90 for example at a distance x 20 m and y 0 02 m within the rock matrix for kmx 1 10 14 m2 from the initial value of 3 447 m pa the intensity of pressure reduces to 1 54 m pa on the other hand for a relatively higher value kmx 1 10 12 m2 at the same location and from the same initial value the fluid pressure reduces to 0 4 m pa thus it can be concluded from fig 6 that the increase in the horizontal rock matrix permeability improves the horizontal transmitivity of the fluid within the rock matrix which subsequently enhances the pressure gradient between the fracture and the rock matrix this large pressure gradient subsequently enhances the draining of the fluid from low permeable rock matrix to high permeable fracture fig 7 a and b provides the pressure contours within the rock matrix simulated for the horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 14 m2 and kmx 1 10 12 m2 at the end of 1 day by comparing fig 7 a and b it has been observed that there is a significant variation in the pressure distribution pattern within the rock matrix for varying horizontal rock matrix permeability it can be clearly observed from fig 7 that for horizontal permeability kmx 1 10 12 m2 fig 7 b the rate of pressure decline near the fracture matrix interface is higher compared to the rate of pressure decline for kmx 1 10 14 m2 fig 11 a for example the value of pressure intensity at the location x 20 m and y 0 01 m for horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 12 m2 is noted to be 0 18 mpa whereas the pressure intensity at the same location for the horizontal rock matrix permeability kmx 1 10 14 m2 is 2 15 mpa thus it can be concluded from fig 11 a and b that a larger amount of fluid has been mobilized from the rock matrix to the fracture towards the fracture matrix interface at a given time period for a high value of horizontal rock matrix permeability than that for low permeability value fig 8 provides the spatial distribution of pressure along the rock matrix at a distance x 90 m from the fracture inlet simulated at the end of 1 day the pressure profiles are obtained for three different vertical rock matrix permeability values kmy 1 10 21 m2 kmy 1 10 20 m2 kmy 1 10 19 m2 it can be clearly noted from fig 12 that the maximum pressure reduction occurs for kmy 1 10 19 m2 it is also noted that the pressure decline curve for kmy 1 10 19 m2 intersects with the pressure curves corresponding to kmy 1 10 20 m2 and kmy 1 10 21 m2 at points x 90 m y 0 0144 m and x 90 m y 0 0029 m respectively within the rock matrix the corresponding values of pressure at the points of intersection are noted to be 1 65 mpa and 1 51 mpa respectively thus the characterization of pressure distribution within the rock matrix due to the influence of the vertical rock matrix permeability becomes complex as it is difficult to delineate the individual contribution of the diffusion term and the fluid mass exchange term within the rock matrix equation eq 16 because both the terms depend on vertical permeability thus it can be concluded from fig 8 that the prediction of drainage of fluid from the rock matrix based on the vertical rock matrix permeability may be deduced by considering the combined effect of the diffusion term and the fluid mass transfer term in the governing equation of fluid flow fig 9 provides the spatial distribution of pressure profiles within the rock matrix at a distance x 20 m from the fracture inlet for two different values of half fracture apertures b 100 µm b 500 µm simulated at the end of 1 day it has been observed from fig 9 that there is a considerable variation in the pressure profile for an increase in the fracture aperture from b 100 µm to b 500 µm it has been clearly noted that the pressure reduction within the rock matrix for lower values of fracture aperture is more compared to the higher fracture aperture values this implies that the drainage rate for lower values of fracture aperture thickness is high when compared to the higher values of fracture apertures when the fracture thickness increases the interaction between the low permeable rock matrix and the high permeable fracture reduces and in turn the mass transfers at the fracture matrix interface decreases based on the first author s earlier studies suresh kumar and sekhar 2005 suresh kumar and ghassemi 2005 suresh kumar et al 2008 the intensity of coupling between fracture and rock matrix is very critical when the fracture aperture thickness varies between 2b 50 µm and 2b 500 µm thus it can be concluded from fig 9 that for fracture apertures beyond a critical value the influence of the fluid flow in the fracture on fluid flow within the rock matrix becomes less significant which in turn reduces the draining of fluid from the rock matrix figs 10 14 provide the comparison of spatial distribution of pressure profiles along the fracture length pertaining to parabolic equations governing the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system as provided in table 2 and the hyperbolic equations governing the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system provided in table 3 simulated at the end of 1 day fig 10 a and b provides the comparison of the pressure distribution along the fracture obtained using the set of parabolic governing equation cases and the set of hyperbolic governing equation cases respectively fig 11 14 represents the comparison of pressure distribution along the fracture for individual cases of parabolic governing equation against each hyperbolic case the values of the input parameters for the simulation of fluid flow using the numerical models developed from the equations specified in table 2 and table 3 are provided from table 1 the pressure distribution curves in fig 10 shows that the fluid flow modeled from the governing equation proposed in case 2a in the set of parabolic governing equations and case 2b suresh kumar 2014a in the set of hyperbolic governing equation shows significant variation from all the other cases case 2a and 2b represents the respective coupled parabolic and hyperbolic equations in the fracture and rock matrix with the transient fluid mass transfer term implemented within the rock matrix equation it can be observed from fig 10 that out of four parabolic and hyperbolic cases three cases 1a 3a 4a in parabolic and 1b 3b 4b in hyperbolic experience a sudden decline in the pressure profile near the fracture inlet followed by a smooth variation in the pressure profile along the fracture length however it can be critically observed that case 2a and case 2b differs significantly from the rest of the cases in the sense that case 2a case 2b maintains a steep gradient in the pressure profile right from the fracture inlet i e the fluid flows within the fracture as a plug flow while the rest of the cases in fig 10 follows an exponentially declining pressure profile the fluid flow being hyperbolic or parabolic dominant in fact decides the nature of resultant fluid pressure distribution within the high permeable fracture for example if the fluid flow within the fracture is mostly hyperbolic dominant then a weak interaction between fracture and rock matrix can be anticipated and this implies that injection of chemicals or steam will not serve the intended purpose during the application of enhanced oil recovery associated with a fractured reservoir however it can be observed that case 2b is more like hyperbolic dominant while the rest of the cases behave more like parabolic dominant thus it can be concluded from fig 10 that case 2a and 2b behave distinctly from the rest of the cases fig 11 provides the spatial distribution of fluid pressure along the fracture for four different cases parabolic case 1 case 1a has been compared with the rest of the hyperbolic cases 1b 2b 3b 4b it is interesting to note that case 1a vs 2b behaves distinctly from the rest of the cases in the sense that the case 2b is behaving more towards hyperbolic nature while the rest of the cases follow the conventional parabolic dominant nature of fluid flow a similar behavior is observed in figs 12 14 thus it can be concluded from figs 11 14 that the hyperbolic equation proposed by suresh kumar 2014a behaves distinctly from the rest of the cases and this implies that the presence of rate limited fluid mass transfer term within the rock matrix along with the presence of quadratic pressure gradient term within the fracture yields significantly varying results from the conventional approach and it needs further research with reference to its practical implementation further the comparison of parabolic governing equation cases with hyperbolic equation cases provided by figs 11 14 shows that the fluid flow modeled using all hyperbolic governing equation except case 2b in which the mass transfer term is not considered in the fluid flow governing equation in the fracture predicts a maximum pressure reduction in the fracture the pressure distribution for case 2a and 2b exhibits a uniform variation along the fracture whereas the cases show in an uneven pressure distribution along the fracture it can be clearly observed from fig 11 b fig 12 b fig 13 b and fig 14 b that the pressure distribution pertains to the governing equations in case 2a parabolic and case 2b hyperbolic shows a distinct behavior against all other cases in the set of parabolic and hyperbolic governing equations it has been observed from figs 11 to 14 that for the set of parabolic equation in which the mass exchange term is considered in the fracture case 1a case 3a case 4a the pressure reduces at a higher rate at the initial phase 20 m from the fracture inlet than the pressure reduction obtained from the hyperbolic governing equations it is also observed from fig 10 that the governing equation which uses transient transfer function model case 1a case 1b and pseudo steady state transfer function model case 3a case 4a case 3b case 4b to model fluid mass exchange between fracture and rock matrix exhibits identical fluid flow behavior for both the set of parabolic and hyperbolic governing equations in the fracture matrix system thus it can be concluded that the modeling the fluid flow without considering the mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface in the fluid flow governing equation for fracture predicts significantly varying spatial pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases it has been also observed the resultant pressure distribution with in a coupled fracture matrix system does not depend on pseudo steady state and the transient transfer function models for both parabolic and hyperbolic sets of governing equations this implies that the introduction of hyperbolic term within the fracture has a significant role to play with and it cannot be ignored particularly in a fractured reservoir in addition it can also be concluded that the introduction coupling terms in fracture and or rock matrix is very critical and their presence or absence may significantly influence the resultant distribution of fluid pressure within the fracture 4 discussion in the context of groundwater the differential form of the mass balance equation for the groundwater phase that occupies the full pore space is given by 25 t ρ ϕ ρ q in order to understand the concept of compressibility in the context of groundwater flow the lhs of the above groundwater mass conservation equation eq 25 needs to be expanded mathematically as explained in bear 1972 which essentially expresses the mass of groundwater phase added to storage per unit volume of porous medium per unit time the fundamental processes that enable groundwater storage can be understood in detail when the groundwater mass conservation equation is differentiated with reference to the dependent variables density and porosity with respective to time as given below 26 t ρ ϕ ϕ ρ t ρ ϕ t the rhs of eq 26 has two components the first component represents the groundwater storage resulting from changes in fluid density while the second term represents the groundwater storage resulting from changes in aquifer porosity it is generally assumed that the groundwater storage resulting from both the components are small while no attempt is being made to quantify these two storage terms explicitly before assuming it to be insignificant for example the temporal variation of density the first term on rhs is very sensitive in the applications involving groundwater contaminant transport associated with the release of heavy industrial effluents groundwater storage along coastal aquifers and groundwater aquifer thermal energy storage system it should be noted that the density can vary as a function of pressure concentration of dissolved solids as well as temperature the compressibility effect is very prominent when density becomes a function of pressure the compressibility of groundwater may be expressed by the constitutive relationship as expressed in eq 27 27 ρ ρ o e β p p o in eq 27 p o represents the reference pressure the term β which represents the coefficient of compressibility of groundwater can be expressed as given in eq 28 28 β 1 ρ d ρ d t therefore the first term on rhs of eq 26 becomes as given below 29 ϕ ρ t ϕ ρ β p t the above expression relates the changes in groundwater density to changes in groundwater pressure this relation not only expresses the linear relation between density and pressure but also expresses the rate at which groundwater is being stored per unit volume of the porous medium resulting from the compressibility of groundwater upon variation in groundwater pressure since it is not practically feasible to secure the required data in the field it is generally assumed that the groundwater is incompressible under all circumstances it can be further noted that momentum equation used in a typical porous medium darcy s law is supposed to be looked at the macroscopic scale in other words all the details or processes that remains significant at the microscopic scale are averaged out while considering the darcy s approach and eventually the groundwater storage concept resulting from groundwater compressibility at the microscopic scale is either not given is due consideration or it is assumed to be averaged out and this particular aspect where the problem is looked only at the macroscopic scale despite its physical significance at the microscopic scale may not be valid under all circumstances as explained previously similarly the temporal variation of porosity remains very sensitive the second term on rhs in the applications including groundwater aquifers associated with carbonate or fractured rocks groundwater aquifers associated with highly unconsolidated alluvial formations and groundwater aquifers associated with seismically active zone in addition we generally follow the convention of decreasing porosity with mean grain size of the particles s a y d 10 for example porosity reduces gradually with sandy clay roughly 45 fine sand medium sand coarse sand gravelly sand fine gravel roughly 30 medium gravel and coarse gravel roughly 15 from this perspective only the macroscopic details regarding the gaussian distribution of porosity at the macroscopic scale is revealed however when porosity is split into its components namely specific yield and specific retention the details at the microscopic scale will be revealed which is essential for describing groundwater to be compressible or not for example fine sand with a mean grain size of 0 35 mm has an equal amount of specific yield as well as specific retention for a given mean porosity of 40 on the other hand the magnitude of specific yield stays at its maximum associated with its minimum specific retention for both sandy clay mean grain size 0 1 mm with a mean porosity of 45 and coarse sand mean grain size 2 mm with a mean porosity of 35 thus fine sand is associated with a relatively larger specific retention with that of a coarse sand and in turn there will be a significant reduction on the expansion of groundwater associated with the fine sand geologic formations as specific retention of fine sands retains groundwater against the gravity drainage this variation in fluid expansion is sensitive to the groundwater compressibility in addition in poorly sorted groundwater aquifers restructuring of pore geometry takes at the pore scale which significantly impacts the resultant groundwater compressibility analysis of such phenomena becomes very critical with the groundwater applications mentioned earlier thus the conventional assumption of insignificant storage effects resulting from both compressibility effects deserves a special attention before considering it so the authors could not secure relevant experimental field data from the existing literature that will help to project the sensitivity of groundwater compressibility however the authors feel that the importance of the compressibility of groundwater at a smaller scale than darcy s needs to be projected which would provide better insights on some of the critical groundwater applications as mentioned earlier 5 conclusions a numerical model using a hyperbolic dominant fluid flow governing equation in the fracture has been developed in order to simulate the fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system the influence of fracture and rock matrix parameters namely fracture permeability matrix permeability and fracture aperture thickness on the drainage of the fluid from the rock matrix have been analyzed using the proposed model in addition all possible combinations of governing equations pertaining to a coupled fracture matrix system as provided by table 2 and table 3 have been numerically solved in order to investigate the sensitivity of transfer function term in modeling the fluid mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface and thus determining the spatial pressure distribution of reservoir pressure the current numerical study is intended to project the deviation of solution by using a non linear fluid flow model as against the conventional diffusive dominated linear fluid flow model in a fractured reservoir in addition the sensitivity of the transfer function in determining the pressure distribution has also been included the current analysis is performed on a simplified geometric domain which involves a single fracture associated with a two dimensional rectangular rock matrix with permeable walls this problem at the scale of a single fracture can be easily extrapolated to a larger field scale regular fracture network where a square or rectangular rock matrix is uniformly embedded in between the high permeable parallel fractures on all the six sides of the rock matrix the strength of the present work is to indicate the sensitivity of the hyperbolic dominant pressure gradient term it can be clearly noted here that the physical system containing hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equations do not try to reach steady state conditions which is the typical difficulty associated with a highly heterogeneous fractured reservoir as against the conventional diffusive dominated equations where the physical system of interest nearly homogeneous unfractured sandstone reservoirs usually tries to reach the steady state condition after a long period of time the following conclusions have been drawn from the present numerical study 1 due to the presence of variety of heterogeneities modeling of fluid flow in a fractured reservoir may violate the two conditions i the pressure difference between the well and the region far away from the well being sufficiently large and ii the ratio ln r 0 r w being very small which essentially emphasizes the significant role of non linear hyperbolic term to be considered along with the existing parabolic dominant linear diffusivity equation 2 the nature of spatial pressure distribution within the high permeable fracture to be either parabolic or hyperbolic depends on the total time period of fluid flow in a coupled fracture matrix system at the scale of a single fracture 3 the conventional parabolic dominant fluid flow equation overestimates the rate of discharge of fluid from the rock matrix to fracture and in turn the resultant oil recovery from fractured reservoirs the proposed hyperbolic dominant fluid flow equation within high permeable fracture predicts a larger draining of fluid mass from a low permeable rock matrix to high permeable fracture and hence yields improved results towards actual oil recovery 4 the fluid flow modeling without considering the mass exchange at the fracture matrix interface in the fluid flow governing equation for fracture case 2a case 2b predicts a significantly varying spatial pressure distribution with reference to the rest of the cases 5 the spatial pressure distribution with the fracture depends on the strength of source sink term which defines the fluid mass exchange at the matrix fracture interface irrespective of the type of the transfer function model pseudo steady state or transient the numerical for both the set of parabolic and hyperbolic dominant governing equations in the fracture matrix system 6 high permeable fractures conduct the fluid at a faster rate which develops a huge pressure gradient between fracture and matrix and in turn increases the amount of fluid drained from the rock matrix to the fracture this enhances the recovery of the fluid from the associated rock matrix 7 the fluid interaction between the low permeable rock matrix and the associated high permeable fracture becomes very low beyond certain limit of the fracture aperture thickness 2b 1000 µm 8 the change in the vertical rock matrix permeability influences the diffusion of the fluid flow and the fluid mass exchange between the rock matrix and the fracture and hence the prediction of drainage based on the vertical permeability may be done by considering the combined effect of the above two fluid flow phenomena 9 the parabolic case significantly differs from rest of hyperbolic cases and implies that the introduction of quadratic pressure gradient term within the fracture has a significant role to play with and it cannot be ignored particularly in a fractured reservoir in addition it is also concluded that the introduction of coupling terms either in fracture and or rock matrix is very critical and their presence or absence may significantly influence the resultant distribution of fluid pressure within the fracture 
12343,the occurrence of radon 222rn in environment groundwater and indoor air from geogenic sources is receiving an growing attention due to its adverse impact on human health worldwide including jordan highlighting the current status of radon in jordan the present study of radon concentrations in ground waters in the amman zarqa basin azb was investigated groundwater samples were collected from fifteen wells located in three main areas of ras al ain al rsaifeh and al hashemite radon concentration was measure using liquid scintillation counting lsc tri carb 3110 with discriminator and the highest values for radon concentration in water were observed in al rsaifeh area and ranged from 4 52 up to 30 70 bq l with an average of 11 22 bq l which were attributed to the decay of naturally distributed uranium in phosphate rock from al rsaifeh mines in ras al ain area the radon concentration were noted ranged from 0 6 to 5 55 bq l with an average of 2 82 bq l and also in al hashemite area were ranged from 0 77 to 5 37 bq l with an average of 4 04 bq l the overall average concentration of tested samples was 5 77 bq l and found within the acceptable international levels ground water samples of ras al ain area showed good quality as was tested of low salinity it recorded the lowest average radon concentration of 2 82 bq l also radon indoor and building materials was reviewed in conclusion this study presented an urged need for developing national regulations and standards as well as awareness program concerning the radon status in jordan graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater indoor air radon gas liquid scintillation counting amman zarqa basin 1 introduction radon 222rn is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is invisible odorless and tasteless the half life time of 222rn was estimated at 3 825 days and considered long relative to that of the other isotopes radon emerged from the radioactive decay of radium 226ra and two other natural isotopes of actinon 219rn and thoron 220rn it is quite important to understand the original source of radon and its chemical and physical characteristics 238u is the parent element of radon isotope 222rn atomic number of 86 and it s the most common uranium isotope found in nature 222rn has a boiling point of 61 8 c 79 2 f and a density of 9 72 g l it is known that 222rn dissolves in water radon flouride rnf is the first compound produced from radon nazaroff 1992 presented a comprehensive review on the understanding of radon generation from earth surface and its migration through soil pores to the indoor and outdoor atmosphere fig 1 shows the uranium series which ends with stable lead 206pb as the final product skeppström and olofsson 2007 reviewed the problem of uranium and radon in groundwater and its impact on health who investigated the natural radioactivity of 222rn in drinking water from drilled wells in sweden natural occurrence of 222rn is observed in most rocks soils and mainly groundwaters however low concentrations of radon were observed in surface water due to its ease of emission from open water indications showed that indoor levels of radon accumulations were orders of magnitude higher than the outdoor levels liendo et al 1997 radon 222rn is considered as hidden killer as evident by several studies being factor for increasing risk of lung cancer nas 1988 jostes 1996 hofmann 1998 torres duran et al 2014 dempsey et al 2018 earlier the concentrations of radon above 400 bq m3 was considered to constitute a health risk however several recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated lung cancer risk from exposure to radon 222rn in indoor air at levels down to 100 bq m3 pacheco torgal 2012 nas 1999 icrp 1993 european commission 2001 health canada 2009 moreover a relationship was established between radon exposure and employees working in drinking water supply systems such as well houses conditioning plants reservoirs and pumping stations schmitz et al 2000 schmitz and nickels 2001 trautmannsheimer et al 2002 reported on the radon concentrations in groundwater indoor air and the radon exposure levels to the working staff in bavaria of germany and existing water supply facilities where in the east bavarian crystalline region indoor radon gas concentrations of up to 300 kbq m3 were observed even about 10 of the processing facilities workers of that region got an annual effective dose of more than 20 msv trautmannsheimer et al 2002 radon concentrations were reported in several springs and well water sources in the countries neighboring jordan such as lebanon and saudi arabia abdallah et al 2007 alabdula aly 1997 tayycb et al 1998 the concentration was as low as 0 91 bq l in a coastal well source and as high as 49 6 bq l for a spring source in a mountainous region in lebanon these concentrations are considered within the lower range of the swedish regulatory limit for radon skeppström and olofsson 2007 the drinking water distribution network of riyadh city in saudi arabia was sampled and radon concentration was found to range between 0 1 and 1 0 bq l with an average of 0 2 bq l alabdula aly 1997 tayycb et al 1998 observed in the city of jeddah that the radon concentration in different water sources was the highest in natural mineral water samples and the lowest in flush water moreover they reported that the annual effective dose resulting from direct consumption of water is far greater than that due to inhalation of radon emanated from tap water and flushing water tayycb et al 1998 radon gas has received an increased attention from researchers al bataina et al 1997 in jordan since 1995 khalidi and taweel 2016 found an evident lack of knowledge of radon and its health hazards in jordan and an overall estimate of the level of awareness on radon information among jordanians was 63 1 which was considered quite low al zubaidy 2012 showed an increase in the probability of lung cancer in some poorly venilated homes in al mafraq city which could be attributed to radon the average radon concentration in al mafraq city was estimated as 49 3 17 4 bq m3 which was comparable to the nationwide average radon concentration of 42 bq m3 thus the issue of 222rn in indoor facilitates and drinking water is a sensitive topic to address as it s a source of health risk especially due to the availability of insufficient data on 222rn in groundwater considering the background the main objective of the present work is to present an up to date status of the radon occurrence in groundwater and related environments in jordan and studying the 222rn concentrations in groundwater used for drinking in one of most important basins amman zarqa basin in central jordan 2 radon in indoor air and building

jordan in different seasons they found that the average radon concentration during the summer season was about 62 bq m3 while in winter season it was about 81 bq m3 abdullah 2012 presented a study to measure natural radioactivity concentration in the dwellings of the umm gais village by using a solid state nuclear track detectors his study indicated relatively high concentration as average 80 16 bq m3 in stone made buildings while relatively low concentration as average 42 11 bq m3 in block made buildings the concentrations of radon were noticed as average as 56 12 bq m3 44 11 bq m3 and 30 10 bq m3 with the building aging of 25 15 25 and 15 years respectively the overall average of radon concentration in the umm gais village was found to be about 58 14 bq m3 elzain 2011 investigated the variations in seasonal radon concentration levels at some commercial facilities in zarqa city in central jordan the measurements were collected using passive calibrated solid state nuclear track detectors ntd minimum averages were observed during summer with 18 2 6 7 bq m3 and 16 6 3 9 bq m3 in pharmacies and shops respectively and maximum averages during winter with 50 0 4 1 bq m3 and 45 1 4

2010 estimated the overall average of radon concentration level of 26 28 bq m3 inside the dwelling of tafila province as per report of ncrp 1984 at least 80 of the radon emitted into the atmosphere emerged from the top layers of the soil of with an average thickness of 1 5 m al shereideh et al 2006 and ershaidat et al 2015 presented the 222rn concentration levels of soil at different depths in an area which is rich in phosphate rock deposits in the city of irbid northern part of jordan by using the cr 39 dosimeters the radon concentration were reported as 1390 9682 16 778 19 817 21 720 and

zarqa river it showed that the salinity increases along the direction of flow of the river and ranges between 320 ppm at ras al ain and 1100 ppm at sukhneh zarqa awad 1997 the ras al ain area amman usually has the highest rainfall in azb estimated around 400 500 mm when compared with the rsaifeh and al hashemite areas which have a lower rainfall estimated around 150 200 mm therefore waters of the ras al ain area can be considered as very good quality water the radon concentrations in water are considered within the acceptable levels except in two wells 8 and 9 a in the al rsaifeh area having values reaching 14 8 and 30 7 bq l these increased values were attributed to the presence of phosphate mines in the area where it contains noticeable amount of u in the rocks at an average of

gradually decrease outward from the al rsaifeh area fig 6 these levels drop gradually as samples were taken far away from the al rsaifeh area however the health and safety considerations indicate that these values do not assume important concern regarding health safety the physical treatment steps applied to the groundwater involving aeration mixing handling and pumping resulted in dramatic drop in these values the data and results presented by this study for azb followed standard procedures of selection sampling and analyzing unfortunately the comparison was found challenging with other attempts to study the same area as those attempts were lacking accuracy and confidence few unpublished data were found scattered and taken randomly following old and uncalibrated systems therefore their results were over exaggerated and too high however the present work conducted systematic investigation on radon present in groundwater in jordan with joint collaboration with water authority of jordan waj using up to date instrumentation and calibrated systems the obtained results were within the acceptable range as compared to known and trusted results concerning other groundwater resources in the city of amman and in al mufraq province an early attempt to measure radon concentrations in water was conducted by al bataina et al 1997 their attempt involved studying radon levels in natural water sampled from various basins as result showed that cold spring water has the highest average of 5 4 bq l while tap water has 3 7 bq l also they reported an overall average for radon level in natural waters in jordan as 4 5 0 9 bq l which is in agreement with the one obtained in this study of 5 5 bq l al kazwini and hasan 2003 investigated radon activity in jordanian drinking water and hot springs throughout jordan as shown in table 7 the two sources of the highest radon activity are those at awajan zarka province northern region and at umm al o rooq in shafa badran amman suburbs central region fortunately limited number of inhabitants depend on these sources of water supply the third source with radon activity larger than 37 bq l is at al khaldiyah and dlail this source supply water to several small towns in al mafraq province al kazwini and hasan 2003 a concise review of radon and its existence in ground water in jordan was presented by abu khader et al 2017 the phosphate rock in jordan covers a widespread area starting from the far northwest to its south fig 7 shows the main locations of high p2o5 content phosphate rock in jordan the uranium concentrations present within the crystal structure of francolite carbonate flourapatite substituting for ca varies as low as 7 ppm and up to 379 ppm widely depending on the location in jordan however it was observed that the uranium content in the various localities increases northwards abed 2011 abed and khalid 1985 the expected source of the radioactive gas comes from the breakdown of uranium in phosphate rock the 222rn is a decay product of 226ra which is a decay product of 238u the latter can be found in uranium ores phosphate rock shales igneous and metamorphic rocks kusky 2003 it is evident that radon emmision from the soil varies with soil type thus present investigation along with previous study report on radon occurance in jordon will support the for public awareness and establishment of national legislations and guidelines that strongly needed for public health protection 5 conclusion during the last decade radon has gained great attention at the national level due to its serious health impact the al rsaifeh area has recorded the highest values for radon water concentrations reaching up to 14 8 30 7 bq l due to the presence of uranium in the phosphate rocks in the al rsaifeh mines the overall average value of all the tested samples from amman zarqa basin was 5 77 bq l the groundwaters of the ras al ain area has the lowest radon concentrations with an average value of 2 82 bq l and complemented with low salinity based on this brief investigation along with a review on indoor and building materials in jordan it is clear that radon health risk problem is not well addressed within the community and there is a lack of knowledge of how such problem exists and can be minimized or treated there is a need to develop national regulations standards and awareness program acknowledgement authors would like to thank the water authority of jordan department of radioactivity for its help and support in conducting the lsc tests for the ground water samples and the mapping of the study area 
12343,the occurrence of radon 222rn in environment groundwater and indoor air from geogenic sources is receiving an growing attention due to its adverse impact on human health worldwide including jordan highlighting the current status of radon in jordan the present study of radon concentrations in ground waters in the amman zarqa basin azb was investigated groundwater samples were collected from fifteen wells located in three main areas of ras al ain al rsaifeh and al hashemite radon concentration was measure using liquid scintillation counting lsc tri carb 3110 with discriminator and the highest values for radon concentration in water were observed in al rsaifeh area and ranged from 4 52 up to 30 70 bq l with an average of 11 22 bq l which were attributed to the decay of naturally distributed uranium in phosphate rock from al rsaifeh mines in ras al ain area the radon concentration were noted ranged from 0 6 to 5 55 bq l with an average of 2 82 bq l and also in al hashemite area were ranged from 0 77 to 5 37 bq l with an average of 4 04 bq l the overall average concentration of tested samples was 5 77 bq l and found within the acceptable international levels ground water samples of ras al ain area showed good quality as was tested of low salinity it recorded the lowest average radon concentration of 2 82 bq l also radon indoor and building materials was reviewed in conclusion this study presented an urged need for developing national regulations and standards as well as awareness program concerning the radon status in jordan graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater indoor air radon gas liquid scintillation counting amman zarqa basin 1 introduction radon 222rn is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is invisible odorless and tasteless the half life time of 222rn was estimated at 3 825 days and considered long relative to that of the other isotopes radon emerged from the radioactive decay of radium 226ra and two other natural isotopes of actinon 219rn and thoron 220rn it is quite important to understand the original source of radon and its chemical and physical characteristics 238u is the parent element of radon isotope 222rn atomic number of 86 and it s the most common uranium isotope found in nature 222rn has a boiling point of 61 8 c 79 2 f and a density of 9 72 g l it is known that 222rn dissolves in water radon flouride rnf is the first compound produced from radon nazaroff 1992 presented a comprehensive review on the understanding of radon generation from earth surface and its migration through soil pores to the indoor and outdoor atmosphere fig 1 shows the uranium series which ends with stable lead 206pb as the final product skeppström and olofsson 2007 reviewed the problem of uranium and radon in groundwater and its impact on health who investigated the natural radioactivity of 222rn in drinking water from drilled wells in sweden natural occurrence of 222rn is observed in most rocks soils and mainly groundwaters however low concentrations of radon were observed in surface water due to its ease of emission from open water indications showed that indoor levels of radon accumulations were orders of magnitude higher than the outdoor levels liendo et al 1997 radon 222rn is considered as hidden killer as evident by several studies being factor for increasing risk of lung cancer nas 1988 jostes 1996 hofmann 1998 torres duran et al 2014 dempsey et al 2018 earlier the concentrations of radon above 400 bq m3 was considered to constitute a health risk however several recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated lung cancer risk from exposure to radon 222rn in indoor air at levels down to 100 bq m3 pacheco torgal 2012 nas 1999 icrp 1993 european commission 2001 health canada 2009 moreover a relationship was established between radon exposure and employees working in drinking water supply systems such as well houses conditioning plants reservoirs and pumping stations schmitz et al 2000 schmitz and nickels 2001 trautmannsheimer et al 2002 reported on the radon concentrations in groundwater indoor air and the radon exposure levels to the working staff in bavaria of germany and existing water supply facilities where in the east bavarian crystalline region indoor radon gas concentrations of up to 300 kbq m3 were observed even about 10 of the processing facilities workers of that region got an annual effective dose of more than 20 msv trautmannsheimer et al 2002 radon concentrations were reported in several springs and well water sources in the countries neighboring jordan such as lebanon and saudi arabia abdallah et al 2007 alabdula aly 1997 tayycb et al 1998 the concentration was as low as 0 91 bq l in a coastal well source and as high as 49 6 bq l for a spring source in a mountainous region in lebanon these concentrations are considered within the lower range of the swedish regulatory limit for radon skeppström and olofsson 2007 the drinking water distribution network of riyadh city in saudi arabia was sampled and radon concentration was found to range between 0 1 and 1 0 bq l with an average of 0 2 bq l alabdula aly 1997 tayycb et al 1998 observed in the city of jeddah that the radon concentration in different water sources was the highest in natural mineral water samples and the lowest in flush water moreover they reported that the annual effective dose resulting from direct consumption of water is far greater than that due to inhalation of radon emanated from tap water and flushing water tayycb et al 1998 radon gas has received an increased attention from researchers al bataina et al 1997 in jordan since 1995 khalidi and taweel 2016 found an evident lack of knowledge of radon and its health hazards in jordan and an overall estimate of the level of awareness on radon information among jordanians was 63 1 which was considered quite low al zubaidy 2012 showed an increase in the probability of lung cancer in some poorly venilated homes in al mafraq city which could be attributed to radon the average radon concentration in al mafraq city was estimated as 49 3 17 4 bq m3 which was comparable to the nationwide average radon concentration of 42 bq m3 thus the issue of 222rn in indoor facilitates and drinking water is a sensitive topic to address as it s a source of health risk especially due to the availability of insufficient data on 222rn in groundwater considering the background the main objective of the present work is to present an up to date status of the radon occurrence in groundwater and related environments in jordan and studying the 222rn concentrations in groundwater used for drinking in one of most important basins amman zarqa basin in central jordan 2 radon in indoor air and building materials the indoor 222rn concentrations bq m3 were recorded in some selected cities in jordan abumurad and al tamimi 2005 al zubaidy and mohammad 2011 2012 khataibeh et al 1997 table 1 shows radon

year 2004 in addition the concentration of radon short lived daughters 222rn and 226ra was estimated to be 44 2 bq m3 in tafila province which located in the southern part of jordan abu haija et al 2010 estimated the overall average of radon concentration level of 26 28 bq m3 inside the dwelling of tafila province as per report of ncrp 1984 at least 80 of the radon emitted into the atmosphere emerged from the top layers of the soil of with an average thickness of 1 5 m al shereideh et al 2006 and ershaidat et al 2015 presented the 222rn concentration levels of soil at different depths in an area which is rich in phosphate rock deposits in the city of irbid northern part of jordan by using the cr 39 dosimeters the radon concentration were reported as 1390 9682 16 778 19 817 21 720 and

natural waters in jordan as 4 5 0 9 bq l which is in agreement with the one obtained in this study of 5 5 bq l al kazwini and hasan 2003 investigated radon activity in jordanian drinking water and hot springs throughout jordan as shown in table 7 the two sources of the highest radon activity are those at awajan zarka province northern region and at umm al o rooq in shafa badran amman suburbs central region fortunately limited number of inhabitants depend on these sources of water supply the third source with radon activity larger than 37 bq l is at al khaldiyah and dlail this source supply water to several small towns in al mafraq province al kazwini and hasan 2003 a concise review of radon and its existence in ground water in jordan was presented by abu khader et al 2017 the phosphate rock in jordan covers a widespread area starting from the far northwest to its south fig 7 shows the main locations of high p2o5 content phosphate rock in jordan the uranium concentrations present within the crystal structure of francolite carbonate flourapatite substituting for ca varies as low as 7 ppm and up to 379 ppm widely depending on the location in jordan however it was observed that the uranium content in the various localities increases northwards abed 2011 abed and khalid 1985 the expected source of the radioactive gas comes from the breakdown of uranium in phosphate rock the 222rn is a decay product of 226ra which is a decay product of 238u the latter can be found in uranium ores phosphate rock shales igneous and metamorphic rocks kusky 2003 it is evident that radon emmision from the soil varies with soil type thus present investigation along with previous study report on radon occurance in jordon will support the for public awareness and establishment of national legislations and guidelines that strongly needed for public health protection 5 conclusion during the last decade radon has gained great attention at the national level due to its serious health impact the al rsaifeh area has recorded the highest values for radon water concentrations reaching up to 14 8 30 7 bq l due to the presence of uranium in the phosphate rocks in the al rsaifeh mines the overall average value of all the tested samples from amman zarqa basin was 5 77 bq l the groundwaters of the ras al ain area has the lowest radon concentrations with an average value of 2 82 bq l and complemented with low salinity based on this brief investigation along with a review on indoor and building materials in jordan it is clear that radon health risk problem is not well addressed within the community and there is a lack of knowledge of how such problem exists and can be minimized or treated there is a need to develop national regulations standards and awareness program acknowledgement authors would like to thank the water authority of jordan department of radioactivity for its help and support in conducting the lsc tests for the ground water samples and the mapping of the study area

use soil slope rainfall elevation lithology lineament density and drainage density data and information regarding these criteria were collated and ascertained through the employment and utilisation of satellite imagery and digital mapping the weighted linear combination wlc technique was then employed to integrate these criteria within the gis so that the area concerned could be evaluated regarding its various hydrogeomorphic characteristics a review of the literature was then used to assess each of the criteria subsequently the criteria were assigned to various parameters per their significance and rating regarding groundwater potentiality the delineated groundwater potential map was classified into four distinct zones namely low moderate high and very high potential zones from the study findings it can be seen that approximately17 of the area concerned in this study was shown to have very high groundwater potential while 2 181 has a low potential and 32 612 is categorised as having high groundwater potential the largest region was that of moderate groundwater potential with 48 207 of the land being categorised as such furthermore the groundwater potential zones map was verified against a map of existing wells to calculate the percentage of wells in each potential zone the results showed that approximately 2 of the existing wells were within low potential zones 66 were within

manap et al 2013 and nampak et al 2014 was adapted and modified for the purposes of this study methodology as depicted in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the first step involved generating the thematic layers including lineament density slope elevation land use and drainage density a review of the available literature was used upon which the ratings and weights for the study criteria were based in order to analyse the gis layers and select the various groundwater potential zones the arcgis 10 3 gis software programme was used all thematic layers were in geographic coordinate systems lat long datum d wgs 1984 the weighted linear combination method wlc based on eq 1 was used in this study to generate the suitability map according to a study by eastman et al 1995 in the wlc method criteria are combined by applying a weight and rating to each map and summing the results to produce a suitability s map 1 s l d w l d r l w l r r w r r t s w t s r e w e r s w s r d d w d d r l u w l u r where s is suitability w is the weight of the criterion and r is the rating of the criterion ld is lineament density l is lithology r is rainfall ts is topographic slope e is elevation s is soil dd is drainage density and lu is land use as can be seen in fig 3 the following operations were conducted within gis environment to select the potential groundwater sites within the investigated area the line density function in arcgis was used to calculate the lineament ld fig 4 a and drainage dd densities fig 4 g which then classified based on table 3 by giving each class the appropriate rating the outcome of this operation was then multiplied by each parameter weight 9 for ld and 3 for dd ld values varied between 36 and 90 while dd values varied between 12 and 27 the lithological units l fig 4 b rainfall r fig 4 c and soil s fig 4 f maps were subjected to gis manipulation by adding the appropriate ratings based on table 3 such operation include adding a new field into the attribute table of each layer and then update this field by the proper ratings these layers were converted to raster format based on the new field values and then multiplied by their weights 8 for l 8 for r and 3 for s the l values varied between 40 and 72 r has a single value of 40 since the entire investigated area receives less than 225 mm annually and the s values varied between 12 and 21 the topographic slope ts fig 4 d and elevation e fig 4 e maps for the investigated area were extracted from the aster dem the cell values for both slope and elevation were classified based on table 3 and multiplied by the appropriate parameter weight 4 for ts and 4 for e the ts values varied between 18 and 32 while the e values varied between 16 and 24 as discussed earlier the land use lu map fig 4 h was generated for the study area using the supervised classification in erdas imagine software and then imported to arcgis and reclassified based on table 3 the resulted layer was multiplied by its weight 2 it appears that lu values varied between 8 and 14 fig 5 illustrates each criterion s final map while the final groundwater potential zone map is depicted in fig 6 fig 6 is the result of summing all parameters in gis and then classifying the output the output was classified into four classes low with values between 180 and 215 moderate 215 250 high 250 285 and very high with values between 285 and 320 3 research findings and discussion the research area s zones for groundwater potential can be seen depicted in fig 6 the figure shows the low high very high and moderate groundwater potential zones as can be seen just 2 18 of the area concerned in this study were low groundwater potential zones with high zones representing 32 6 moderate zones representing 48 21 and very high groundwater potential zones representing 17 of the total study area the model was validated using the location of 501 wells within the study area just 10 of these 501 wells were found to exist within the low 331 within moderate 75 within the high and 85 within the very high groundwater potential zones table 4 hence the model is valid as it indicates that 98 of wells exist in groundwater potential zones 4 conclusion and recommendations the natural environment of jordan is semiarid because there is limited precipitation and therefore limited surface water hence groundwater is considered the primary water resource in the country integrated use of remote sensing and gis for delineation of groundwater potential zones in this study proved efficient in terms of minimizing cost time and labor eight different thematic layers namely rainfall slope soil land use lineament density drainage density lithology and elevation are prepared in gis to delineate groundwater potential zones map of the central part of the azraq basin of jordan the results of this study showed that there are four classes of groundwater potential in the study area namely low moderate high and very high of the region concerned within this study 2 181 of the area is categorised as being a low groundwater potential area 49 6 as a very high groundwater potential area or high groundwater potential area and 48 207 as a moderate groundwater potential area additionally 2 of groundwater wells exist within the low groundwater potential areas 66 within the moderate groundwater potential areas 15 within the high groundwater potential areas and 17 fall within the very high groundwater potential areas the outcomes of the present study could be utilized for developing prospective guidelines for designing and implementing recharge projects within the region concerned hence it guarantee ongoing maintainable and sustainable use of groundwater resources jordan is a developing nation its means and resources and infrastructure are not as strong as developed nations and its informational resources are middling or poor data and information are rare or scarce and so this study and its findings may be employed so that decisions can be made fast and effectively for future water management in the future based on these results it is concluded that gis could help jordan and similar countries to select potential sites for groundwater this method will minimize the cost and time needed to explore large areas using traditional methods hence it is recommended to use gis for water related projects in jordan and to conduct fieldwork in the area classified as very high potential to verify the outcomes of this study it is also recommended to examine the productivity of the groundwater wells within the various potential zones to validate the outcomes of this study and use the outcomes of this study as a base map for further investigation of groundwater in the study area

by applying a weight and rating to each map and summing the results to produce a suitability s map 1 s l d w l d r l w l r r w r r t s w t s r e w e r s w s r d d w d d r l u w l u r where s is suitability w is the weight of the criterion and r is the rating of the criterion ld is lineament density l is lithology r is rainfall ts is topographic slope e is elevation s is soil dd is drainage density and lu is land use as can be seen in fig 3 the following operations were conducted within gis environment to select the potential groundwater sites within the investigated area the line density function in arcgis was used to calculate the lineament ld fig 4 a and drainage dd densities fig 4 g which then classified based on table 3 by giving each class the appropriate rating the outcome of this operation was then multiplied by each parameter weight 9 for ld and 3 for dd ld values varied between 36 and 90 while dd values varied between 12 and 27 the lithological units l fig 4 b rainfall r fig 4 c and soil s fig 4 f maps were subjected to gis manipulation by adding the appropriate ratings based on table 3 such operation include adding a new field into the attribute table of each layer and then update this field by the proper ratings these layers were converted to raster format based on the new field values and then multiplied by their weights 8 for l 8 for r and 3 for s the l values varied between 40 and 72 r has a single value of 40 since the entire investigated area receives less than 225 mm annually and the s values varied between 12 and 21 the topographic slope ts fig 4 d and elevation e fig 4 e maps for the investigated area were extracted from the aster dem the cell values for both slope and elevation were classified based on table 3 and multiplied by the appropriate parameter weight 4 for ts and 4 for e the ts values varied between 18 and 32 while the e values varied between 16 and 24 as discussed earlier the land use lu map fig 4 h was generated for the study area using the supervised classification in erdas imagine software and then imported to arcgis and reclassified based on table 3 the resulted layer was multiplied by its weight 2 it appears that lu values varied between 8 and 14 fig 5 illustrates each criterion s final map while the final groundwater potential zone map is depicted in fig 6 fig 6 is the result of summing all parameters in gis and then classifying the output the output was classified into four classes low with values between 180 and 215 moderate 215 250 high 250 285 and very high with values between 285 and 320 3 research findings and discussion the research area s zones for groundwater potential can be seen depicted in fig 6 the figure shows the low high very high and moderate groundwater potential zones as can be seen just 2 18 of the area concerned in this study were low groundwater potential zones with high zones representing 32 6 moderate zones representing 48 21 and very high groundwater potential zones representing 17 of the total study area the model was validated using the location of 501 wells within the study area just 10 of these 501 wells were found to exist within the low 331 within moderate 75 within the high and 85 within the very high groundwater potential zones table 4 hence the model is valid as it indicates that 98 of wells exist in groundwater potential zones 4 conclusion and recommendations the natural environment of jordan is semiarid because there is limited precipitation and therefore limited surface water hence groundwater is considered the primary water resource in the country integrated use of remote sensing and gis for delineation of groundwater potential zones in this study proved efficient in terms of minimizing cost time and labor eight different thematic layers namely rainfall slope soil land use lineament density drainage density lithology and elevation are prepared in gis to delineate groundwater potential zones map of the central part of the azraq basin of jordan the results of this study showed that there are four classes of groundwater potential in the study area namely low moderate high and very high of the region concerned within this study 2 181 of the area is categorised as being a low groundwater potential area 49 6 as a very high groundwater potential area or high groundwater potential area and 48 207 as a moderate groundwater potential area additionally 2 of groundwater wells exist within the low groundwater potential areas 66 within the moderate groundwater potential areas 15 within the high groundwater potential areas and 17 fall within the very high groundwater potential areas the outcomes of the present study could be utilized for developing prospective guidelines for designing and implementing recharge projects within the region concerned hence it guarantee ongoing maintainable and sustainable use of groundwater resources jordan is a developing nation its means and resources and infrastructure are not as strong as developed nations and its informational resources are middling or poor data and information are rare or scarce and so this study and its findings may be employed so that decisions can be made fast and effectively for future water management in the future based on these results it is concluded that gis could help jordan and similar countries to select potential sites for groundwater this method will minimize the cost and time needed to explore large areas using traditional methods hence it is recommended to use gis for water related projects in jordan and to conduct fieldwork in the area classified as very high potential to verify the outcomes of this study it is also recommended to examine the productivity of the groundwater wells within the various potential zones to validate the outcomes of this study and use the outcomes of this study as a base map for further investigation of groundwater in the study area
