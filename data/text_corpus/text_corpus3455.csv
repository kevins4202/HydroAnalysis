17275,although sewage diversion outside of a lake s watershed is now ordinary practice in the restoration of eutrophic lakes often the observed recovery is slower than expected and the internal load from the lake anoxic sediments is identified as a possible reason however in the case of combined sewer the quantification of the residual nutrient load discharged from sewer spillways must also be questioned in this paper the diversion efficiency of the sewer system along the east coast of lake iseo a prealpine italian lake where eutrophication effects are still severe is investigated to this purpose a representative part of the sewer system was modelled by pcswmm and calibrated by using an extensive series of discharge measurements water quality monitoring during wet weather periods reveals that the first flush is common in tributary sewers whereas it is absent along the main collector moreover flow discharges are strongly affected by infiltration waters which are controlled by the lake water level the calibrated model including infiltration modeling was used to assess the annual overflow volumes and the nutrient load through a continuous 10 year simulation simulations were conducted both with regard to the current conditions and to a climate change scenario results show that the discharged residual load is at least 7 times larger than the design value with the water infiltration contributing to 17 to the overflow volume and that non structural practices could considerably reduce the overall impact of the sewer this research thus provides important insight into the potential impact of combined sewer overflows on lacustrine environments and addresses effective mitigation measures in similar contexts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords combined sewers infiltration waters hydraulic simulation monitoring campaign nutrient load lake eutrophicatio 1 introduction eutrophication has been recognized as the greatest challenge to the integrity of water resources since the late 60s of the last century e g welch 1981 schindler 1977 2006 2012 mccrackin et al 2017 affecting both inland freshwaters and coastal marine ecosystems owing to their long renewal time and suitability to human settlings and activities lakes are particularly sensitive to this phenomenon worldwide most lakes have shown an increase in their trophic level often with a strong impairment of their ecological services e g jenny et al 2020 according to the joint international lake environment committee united nations environment program project survey of the state of world lakes all 217 major lakes included in the survey demonstrated to be affected by eutrophication e g matsui et al 1995 due to their role in phytoplankton growth phosphorus p and nitrogen n along with their stoichiometry are considered to be the crucial nutrients that control the eutrophication development e g schindler 2006 2012 therefore costly actions to reduce their loads have been extensively undertaken urban sewage is widely acknowledged as a relevant nutrient source and a leading cause of generalized environmental degradation walsh et al 2005 even in the presence of agricultural non point sources due to the imperviousness of urban areas the relative contribution of the urban pollution load to the total load largely exceeds the ratio between the urbanized catchment area and the total catchment area for instance meals and budd 1998 estimated for lake champlain that urban sewage contributes to 18 of the phosphorous load while the urbanized catchment area is only about 3 of the total catchment extension in historical settlements around european lakes the urban drainage network is frequently made up of combined sewer systems csss draining relatively small tributary sub catchments marsalek 2003 such csss are interconnected by a diversion pipe herein referred to as a main collector placed along the lake shoreline and featuring a large conveyance capacity this pipe intercepts sewage from tributary sub catchments which otherwise would directly enter the lake and delivers it to an end of pipe wastewater treatment plant wwtp treated waters are finally discharged when possible outside of the lake watershed however during wet weather periods the untreated mixture of storm waters and waste waters exceeding either the css conveyance capacity or the wwtp processing capacity is discharged into the lake waters as combined sewer overflows csos by means of spillways the presence of spillways along the main diversion pipe and upstream of the tributary css connections is justified by technical and economic reasons nevertheless urban storm waters are well known pollutant drivers novotny and goodrich mahoney 1978 marsalek and chocat 2002 tang et al 2005 kaushal et al 2011 which wash the atmosphere the impermeable surfaces and the drainage pipes thus mobilizing sediments that settled during dry weather periods therefore during wet weather periods csos may deliver large amounts of pollutants in addition to those delivered by waste waters e g bryan ellis and yu 1995 chebbo et al 2001 kim et al 2007 and their cumulative impact cannot be disregarded tibbetts 2005 usepa 2009 especially when the receiving surface waters are characterized by long renewal times when the final recipient is a lake characterised by integrative mechanisms the total discharged load is of major concern indeed typical water renewal times for lakes lie in the order of years with respect to days for rivers and this is particularly true in deep lakes e g pilotti et al 2014 further when a css is partially or totally submerged by the water table its hydraulic load can be affected by infiltration waters especially when the css is old infiltration waters through cracked pipes leaky joints and poor manhole connections may overload the conduits and diminish the actual conveyance capacity increasing the csos number and volume with respect to the design assumption kidmose et al 2015 have shown that in the city of silkeborg western denmark one fourth of water input to the storm water runoff systems comes from groundwater sources this improper discharge karpf and krebs 2011 xu et al 2014 is particularly relevant in lacustrine environments where pipes are usually located along the lake shoreline and the water table is controlled by the lake level usually the contribution of infiltration waters to the css discharge is disregarded in spillway design and storm waters are supposed to dilute waste water pollutants owing to the systematic use of these assumptions the environmental impact of csos on lakes has often been underestimated moreover csos contribute to mosquito growth increase the risk of insect borne disease transmission lund et al 2014 cause closures of areas suitable for swimming as a result of elevated escherichia coli levels mclellan et al 2007 sebastiá frasquet et al 2013 affect the amenity of wetlands and cause the reduction of dissolved oxygen camargo and alonso 2006 smil 2000 paul and meyer 2001 over the long term they also lead to a dramatic change in aquatic community composition lund et al 2014 thus structural and management practices aimed at decreasing csos are now considered to be unavoidable in lake restoration strategies huang et al 2007 watson et al 2016 with huge costs to remove nutrients from point sources and implement related policies e g pretty et al 2003 these costs are however far lower than the overall externalities of an uncontrolled eutrophication indeed the efforts to decrease nutrient loads are now leading to better water quality in many lakes in the world such as lake maggiore morabito and manca 2014 lake constance müller 1997 lake geneva rapin and gerdeaux 2013 lakes vättern in sweden wilander and persson 2001 and the great lakes in north america there expensive structural works have been implemented to mitigate the effect of csos such as the storage system in milwaukee four deep tunnels 90 m deep under the ground surface with a total length of 31 2 km and a total capacity of 1 53 106 m3 razak and christensen 2001 and the tunnel and reservoir plan in the metropolitan chicago area e g farnan et al 2004 considering a subset of 200 lakes originally included in a 1972 1976 national eutrophication survey the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2009 concluded that 50 of the lakes exhibited an improvement in phosphorus concentration with respect to the 1972 survey a holistic approach relying both on measurements and modelling maybe hybrid i e mixing deterministic and stochastic models as suggested by obropta and kardos 2007 and investigating the functional relation between a lake and the surrounding sewer marsalek and chocat 2002 moore et al 2003 is fundamental to provide reliable estimates of the loads delivered by csos and of the actual effectiveness of the structural practices that must be adopted to improve water quality liu et al 2014 dai et al 2016 bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2018 following this approach the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall efficiency of the css along the eastern lake iseo shoreline by combining the results of a monitoring campaign and of hydraulic modelling the assessment of critical issues affecting the css is considered to be an unavoidable step before planning a long term mitigation strategy to diminish cso impacts on lake iseo lake iseo the fifth italian lake in terms of volume is an originally oligothropic bonomi and gerletti 1967 deep subalpine lake that has undergone a progressive quality degradation following a path common to several others lakes over the last 50 years the strong nutrient load to the lake originating from a large urbanized mountain catchment and the growing density stratification reinforced by climate change valerio et al 2015 has caused anoxia between 100 and 256 m depth in this lake after the construction of a main collector along the shoreline in 2000 the actual residual p load of csos has not been monitored in order to evaluate the role of csos and the actual amount of nutrient loads discharged into the lake two combined sewer weirs csws were monitored one at the outlet of a tributary or municipal sub catchment and the other at the outlet of the main diversion pipe immediately upstream of the wwtp at these sites an extensive real time monitoring campaign provided time series of the flow discharges and sewage samples during csos the measured information on the csos frequency and on the amount of discharged total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn also documented the different dynamics of the first flush phenomena at the two sites in order to understand the hydrologic and hydraulic behavior of the network and to extrapolate the measured information to a longer 10 year period for which a locally measured rainfall time series is available a hydraulic model was implemented and calibrated by using the commercial software pcswmm https www pcswmm com that implements the well known epa swmm5 capabilities within a user friendly interface the most important outcome of this computation was the statistical quantification of the residual nutrient loads discharged into the lake from the overall set of csws present in the modeled network furthermore the observed rainfall time series was modified in order to account for a potential climate change scenario developed according to expected climatic projections for this region thus the calibrated model provided additional insight into the expected future variation of the csos volumes and nutrient loads the results of these detailed monitorings and modeling activities provided a clear view of the overall dynamics of the css and of the role played by the infiltration waters and led to propose an effective set of structural and non structural practices to mitigate the environmental impact on the lake 2 methods in this section the studied area is presented along with the experimental campaign and modeling methods 2 1 description of the study area lake iseo is a 256 m deep prealpine lake with a volume of about 7 9 109 m3 it drains a 1807 km2 mountain watershed see fig 1 with a pollution load of about 1 9 105 population equivalent characterized by 22 agricultural and 2 residential land use the lake and the surrounding area are an important economic and touristic resource of northern italy to the point that in 2016 it was the location of a renowned artistic en plain air performance the floating piers by the american artist christo where temporary orange walkways were set directly on the surface of the lake which drew 1 2 million visitors see fig 2 in addition to the lake area 61 km² the lake watershed is mostly made up of two large valleys valle camonica 1440 km² and valle borlezza 131 km² w1 and w2 in fig 1 and by a set of smaller watersheds that surround the lake w3 in fig 1 176 km² accordingly the lake area is only 3 4 of the drained area according to the first limnological survey by bonomi and gerletti 1967 the lake was originally oligotrophic and well oxygenated even on the bottom however during the second half of the 20th century the lake underwent a dramatic water quality deterioration e g garibaldi et al 1999 on the basis of our 2018 field measurements water under 100 m 41 of the lake s volume is anoxic with 102 µg l of average total phosphorous moreover the nutrient loads to the lake from the large drained watershed have contributed to a chemical stratification that hinders the mixing of the lake and makes the water renewal time longer with respect to its theoretical value recent studies prospect an increase in the thermal stratification in a climate change scenario pilotti et al 2014 valerio et al 2015 the water level of lake iseo is regulated by a dam in sarnico point o in fig 1 and can vary between 110 cm and 30 cm with respect to the average value of 185 15 m above sea level storing a volume of about 85 million cubic meters mostly for agricultural purposes in the wide watershed downstream of the dam 2 2 description of the combined sewer around the lake both valle camonica catchment w1 in fig 1 and valle borlezza w2 have their own sewer systems and their waste waters drain into the most important lake tributaries oglio river canale industriale and borlezza river see points i1 i2 and i3 in fig 1 such systems will not be considered in this paper since we focused our attention on the contribution from watershed w3 that is directly drained by the lake the sewer system around lake iseo catchment w3 is composed of two main sewers the first sewer is along the western side of the lake bergamo sewer or bgs in the following whose waste waters flow partly to a wwtp in costa volpino wwtp2 in fig 3 and partly to a second wwtp in paratico wwtp1 in fig 3 the second sewer is placed along the eastern side of the lake brescia sewer or bss in the following whose waste waters flow to wwtp1 only the overall relevance and performance of the two sewers are comparable about 36 000 population equivalent each where both the east and the west coasts are characterized by similar morphologies and settlements thus in the following we will consider the brescia sewer only due to lack of data regarding the western sewer and the conclusions obtained in the simulation of the bss will be extended to the bgs the bss is made up of a main collector with an overall length of 23 km black solid line in fig 4 in which 9 tributary or municipal sewers converge grey solid lines in fig 4 for a total length of 257 km mostly built with circular pipes with a diameter between 250 mm and 1600 mm the main collector follows the lake shoreline and is made of polyethylene reinforced concrete and spheroidal cast iron due to the small available topographic slopes 12 pumping stations are present green dots in fig 3 so that 17 of the conduits length is made up of pressurized delivery pipes and the remaining 83 is made up of free surface closed conduits with a slope between 0 1 to 1 5 the main collector longitudinal profile is shown in fig 5 all the 9 tributary csss converge into the main collector for instance the tributary css of the main lake island monte isola underpasses the lake and enters the pumping station s8 actually there are 51 junctions between the 9 tributary sewers and the main collector and 23 are characterized by the presence of a csw see red and pink arrows in fig 3 that during wet weather discharges the mixed sewage excess into the stream network drained by lake iseo in addition all the pumping stations except for s2 are provided with spill over conduits that are operated during maintenance or during very intense storms these conduits discharge the cso into the lake at a depth between 20 and 40 m finally two csws are located along the main collector see fig 3 in the vicinity of the terminal pumping station s1 in fig 3 the wastewater from bgs and bss converge in a tank and the overall wastewater is pumped to the wwtp1 through two pressurized delivery pipes under the current operative rule during intense storms the outlet of bss in the tank is under pressure accordingly in this circumstance the hydraulic behavior of the final part of bss is influenced by the backwater caused by the tank water level thus triggering the activation of the csw in paratico fig 4 also for discharges lower than the design threshold the settlements drained by bss amount to 12 8 km2 but 31 of the area is drained by separated sewers and the actual area that generates runoff is equal to 8 9 km2 the overall impervious area drained by the bss was computed by a suitable post processing barone et al 2019 of a recent sentinel 2 satellite image obtained from copernicus https scihub copernicus eu dhus home with 10 m spatial resolution see fig 6 the land use classification was based on the elaboration of a multi spectral image in order to divide the watershed in land cover classes water built up vegetation and bare soil the sentinel 2 image includes the following bands blue green red near infrared short wavelength infrared 1 and short wavelength infrared 2 a land use class is assigned to each pixel based on the color band it belongs to the analysis was performed through the use of an open source qgis plugin semi automatic classification plugin scp that provides a set of intertwined tools for faster processing in order to create an automatic workflow to obtain land cover classification see also https readthedocs org projects semiautomaticclassificationmanual downloads pdf latest the minimum surface that can be detected 100 m2 can hinder the classification in pixels with a mixture of covers soil vegetation however this issue is counterbalanced by the large extension that can be easily mapped accordingly in order to test the quality of the accomplished classification and to check that impervious areas were not erroneously classified e g pena regueiro et al 2020 a visual validation was made for the provaglio village using a box counting approach on a high spatial resolution image of two typical neighborhoods with high and medium density built areas the comparison with the visually recognised land use shows that the algorithm provides an excellent classification of the percentage of built areas in the high density neighborhood e g 86 versus counted 89 in the area a of fig 6 and due to the typical dimension of house gardens and streets in the medium density neighborhood tends to group them together as bare soils with a slight overestimation e g 78 versus counted 61 in the area b of fig 6 eventually the overall computed impervious area was 3 0 km2 i e 34 of the overall generating runoff area 2 3 detection of infiltrating waters along the combined sewer by controlling the groundwater level along the shoreline the variation of the lake water level over the year has important implications on the functioning of the bss as shown in fig 5 a growing length of the main collector is under the elevation of the lake waters when the lake level increases the percentage of the main sewage length below the lake water elevation varies linearly between 12 minimum lake level and 34 maximum lake level due to the presence of leakage in the pipes the higher the water level the greater the groundwater infiltration within the sewer is potentially also a moderate exfiltration into the groundwater could be expected when the lake level is very low likely contributing to the contamination of the urban aquatic environment but it will not be considered in the following the infiltration of groundwater into the bss is clearly evident in the average daily flow discharges measured at the outlet in 2016 shown in fig 7 along with the lake level as one can observe there is a strong correlation between the two series when the lake level grows higher than 50 cm with respect to the conventional reference level for a sufficiently long period of time the baseflow follows a similar increase in turn the groundwater infiltration in the sewer conduits causes discharges exceeding the design value of the pipes with overflows from csw also in dry weather periods and a decrease in the sewage concentrations with consequent issues in the functioning of the wwtps accordingly the identification of the actual stretches where leakage occurs is of paramount importance but is not an easy task in such a long network different approaches can be used to assess the infiltration contribution to the flow discharge namely the night minima observation the flow volume balance staufer et al 2012 and the isotope mass balance houhou et al 2010 in this work we adopted the second approach by measuring the discharge at the end points of a stretch during dry periods when the storm water component is absent and by knowing what discharges should enter the stretch along its extension proportional to the drained population equivalent one can compute the difference that can be reckoned as groundwater lake infiltrations from a practical point of view since a flowmeter was not available within the sewer system until 2016 the task was carried out by analysing the sewage volume delivered at the pumping stations in correspondence of different lake levels in 2016 a flowmeter was installed immediately upstream of the terminal pumping station s1 confirming the value of the computed total infiltration for different stages of the lake the analysis of the data until 2016 provides an experimental curve see fig 8 of the overall infiltration as a function of the lake level quite interestingly these data can be well approximated by a conceptual model for an orifice flow as indicated in eq 1 1 q c 0 l p δ y 0 5 d x y lake y conduit 0 y lake y conduit where p is the local perimeter of the conduit exposed to infiltrations l is its length c is a constant and y is the difference between the elevation of the lake ylake and the local elevation of the invert of the conduit yconduit if one regards the c coefficient as in eq 2 2 c 2 g k then an equivalent sewer porosity k could be introduced as a dimensionless measure of the relevance of the infiltration process in a sewer 2 4 available data and field measurements all the geometrical and hydraulic information on the main sewer system planimetric and altimetric layout of the network lengths diameters materials slopes location and types of spillways were provided by the drainage network manager acque bresciane the pumping stations were characterized by their geometry the operative rules and the characteristic curves of the pumps table 1 shows the temporal availability of the measured time series the lake level and the rainfall series with a time step of 10 minutes for the sarnico raingauge were available for a 10 year period source arpa lombardia with regard to the discharges the ones pumped by the eight pumping stations were available for a 7 month long period in the first half of 2015 at the end of the collector two data sets were available the discharge that has entered wwt1 since 2015 obtained by the operation time of the pumps at the pumping station s1 in paratico and the one measured since august 2015 by acque bresciane at the final station of the main collector using an area velocity flowmeter nivus pcm 4 with an error 0 5 of measurement 5 mm s when v 1 m s and 1 of measurement when v 1 m s accordingly the overall discharge of the main collector is available from 2015 with a time step of 5 min and was used along with the rainfall for the model calibration the discharge entering from the bgs main collector was computed as a difference between flow discharges measured in correspondence of wwtp1 and the flow measured at the outlet of the bss main collector in order to study the frequency and the quality characteristics of the coss from the csws existing in the whole network we monitored two different csws the first representative of overflows from the tributary sewers is located upstream of the junction of the corte franca sewer with the main collector see cf csw in fig 4 the second representative of overflows from the main collector is located at paratico see par csw in fig 4 indeed one can expect differences in the quality of the two overflows since the main collector is characterized by a longer residence time stronger mixing and dilution with infiltrating waters in both cases the flow discharge was measured and sewage samples collected automatically with a portable sampler during cso occurrences the extensive monitoring campaign at the cf csw is described in detail in barone et al 2019 on the other hand the quality of the water overflowing from the csw along the main collector is crucial because at each pumping station an overflow pipe exists that during intense storms discharges waters directly into the lake under the thermocline accordingly the monitoring of par csw is representative of this second category of csos from may 2017 at the par csw a level sensor lt us lacroix sofrel was installed accuracy within the maximum between 6 mm and 0 25 of the measured range by which the discharged flow series was computed in april 2018 we also installed an automatic sampler isco 3700 equipped with 24 ½ liter bottles to collect cso samples the sampling interval was set equal to 10 minutes and the sampler was set up to collect two samples of 250 ml in each bottle in order to characterize the overflowing sewage during 8 hour long events within a few hours after collection the samples were transported using a portable refrigerator to the laboratory to quantify tp and tn concentrations overall a total of 10 cso events and 107 samples were analyzed unfiltered water samples were analyzed for tp and tn concentrations with standard spectrophotometric perkin elmer lambda 35 methods as soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate after alkaline peroxydisulfate oxidation valderrama 1981 in some cases the laboratory also carried out analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod 5 events apha 2012 biochemical oxygen demand at 5 days bod5 3 events uni en 1899 1 2001 and total suspended solids tss 2 events apat cnr irsa 2090 b man 2003 considering that only accurate analytical results allow valid conclusions to be drawn in appendix 1 further information is provided regarding the quality assurance and quality control followed in the measurement of chemical data the dates of cso events when the stormwater runoff samples were collected are summarized in table 2 along with the parameters analyzed in laboratory and the numbers of samples for each event during these events the cso discharge was measured as well 2 5 hydraulic hydrological model the combined sewer was modeled using the storm water management model swmm developed by the united states environmental protection agency operating within the pcswmm environment this software computes both surface runoff and flow in conduits using hydrological hydraulics and geometrical characteristics of the watershed and the sewer network e g gironás et al 2010 rossman 2015 although swmm allows researchers to study water quality we limited our use to the reproduction of the sewer hydraulics due to the complexity of the overall system and to the lack of adequate geometrical information on the whole set of the tributary sewers we developed the hydraulic models of the main collector and of two tributary sewer systems only namely corte franca and provaglio d iseo fig 4 such tributary drainage systems were monitored at their outlet sections immediately upstream of the confluence in the main sewer by using a calibrated stage discharge curve and level meter their calibration during wet weather periods barone et al 2019 provided the hydrological parameters of the corresponding watersheds that were used for the lumped hydrological modelling of the other 7 similar tributary sewer systems considering that during intense storms likely yielding csos the decrease in the soil infiltration capacity in urban areas is negligible a simple infiltration model featuring a constant infiltration rate fp mm h was used in the totally impervious urban area fp was set at 0 mm h whereas in the remaining pervious area it was set at 3 mm h the rainfall time series used as the model input was provided by the regional meteorological monitoring agency arpa lombardia for the rain gauge located in sarnico see fig 4 in this series the rainfall depths were recorded every 10 minutes a time step that can be considered sufficiently short with respect to the tributary sewer network response times the computed discharges delivered by the tributary sewers were used as external inflow discharges in the junction nodes of the main collector in addition to the geometrical characteristics of pipes and manholes the functioning of the pumping stations placed along the main sewer was modeled in detail by implementing the geometry of the storage tanks the characteristic curves of the pumps the geometrical data of the delivery pipes and the startup and shutoff depths of the pumps the hydraulic characteristics of the different csws were also implemented in the model the dry weather loads were calculated by multiplying the daily per capita water supply estimated in 250 0 8 200 l p e d according to the data supplied by the company managing the tributary drinking water plants by the population equivalent in the area of interest this load was incremented considering the touristic seasonal loads data provided by the national statistics institute istat so that a monthly time pattern was obtained for the dry weather flow the hydraulic model also accounted for the infiltration waters computed as a function of the lake levels according to eq 1 calibration led to a value of 1 12 10 5 for the porosity coefficient k in eq 2 as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the measured and modeled infiltration water discharges is satisfactory fig 8 also shows that when the lake level is at a maximum i e 110 cm the infiltration water contribution corresponds to 175 l s that is 150 of the normal waste water flow discharge in dry weather periods since the water depth in the s1 pumping station is influenced also by the flow discharge coming from bgs its contribution had to be evaluated without the possibility of modelling its hydraulic behavior in detail therefore during dry weather periods we assumed an overall discharge proportional to the population equivalent in the bgs drained area conversely during wet weather periods we introduced a fictitious subcatchment whose runoff directly enters ps1 this subcatchment model was calibrated by using data from 2016 on the basis of the difference between the overall discharge measured at the wwtp1 and at the bss outlet the calibration of the bss main collector was instead limited to the choice of the friction factors on the basis of the typical pipe materials 3 sensitivity to climate change considering that the rainfall runoff transformation is a strongly non linear process affected by the infiltration excess of rainfall one can expect that an increase in the rainfall intensity as a likely outcome of the ongoing climate change could lead to a worsening of the environmental impact of a combined sewer due to the increase in the frequency and volume of cso events e g nie et al 2009 fortier and mailhot 2015 semadeni davies et al 2008 considering the business as usual emission scenario rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 sinha et al 2017 have shown that climate change induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase 19 14 riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental united states fostering further eutrophication unfortunately this scenario referring to the worst greenhouse gasses emission projection currently appears to be the most probable one with respect to the rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and to the rcp2 6 mitigation scenario to evaluate the consequences of this scenario on csos with reference to 2100 salerno et al 2018 proposed an increase in the rainfall intensity of 20 dealing with a case study located in this climatic region actually in northern italy statistically significant increases in the yearly total amount of precipitation are not expected conversely seasonal trends should yield increases in the rainfall depths in summer and spring along with decreases in winter and autumn in particular winter storms would be affected by a more complex change according to which the mean should decrease and the upper percentile should increase see for instance balistrocchi and grossi 2020 for a review it is worth noticing that the temporal structure of storms in northern italy shows a significant seasonality so that storms featuring short durations and high intensities mostly occur in late spring and in summer long frontal events with larger depths but low intensities are instead more common in the other seasons therefore a reasonable scenario for the study area could involve an increase in heavy storms and a decrease in moderate and low intense rainfalls in this study this was accomplished by globally increasing the observed heavy storm events of 20 and by cutting the values under a threshold calculated in order to keep the yearly cumulated rainfall constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and field data analysis in this section we discuss the exploitation of the extensive data set collected as illustrated in the previous section to the characterization of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the combined sewage 4 1 1 results of the hydraulic hydrological model fig 9 shows the comparison between modeled and measured flow discharges at the outlet of the bss into ps1 and modeled and measured overflow discharges at par csw for the period 01 05 2017 04 05 2017 in consideration of the system complexity the model reproduces the behavior of the brescia main collector well fig 10 shows additional comparison between the modeled flow discharge and the computed one from bgs and from bss for the period 01 01 2016 14 01 2016 the model was validated by using the sarnico rainfall series during the entire year of 2016 the graph in fig 10 shows the comparison between simulated and measured daily average flow discharges coming from bss the satisfactory agreement between measured and modeled flow discharges shown in fig 10 is supported by a linear correlation coefficient of r2 0 90 the strong influence of the lake water levels on the sewer flow discharges in the period 30 04 and 29 07 is also evident overall the modeled network closely reproduced the measured discharges at the main collector outlet 4 1 2 quality data analysis of csos the two flow discharge gauges and the two portable samplers installed in cf csw and in par csw provided fundamental data on the quantity and concentration of nutrients discharged into the lake due to the hydrologic and land use similarity between the different small watersheds the cf csw is considered representative of overflows from the 9 watersheds drained by tributary lines the 8 month activity at cf csw during which 18 overflows were sampled was carefully documented in barone et al 2019 the most interesting results are the presence of a moderate weak first flush whose strength is significantly correlated with the duration of the antecedent dry weather period and the occurrence of frequent cso events but with moderate volumes this implies that a small water quality volume must be provided in order for a capture storage tank to be effective on the other hand during the 4 month monitoring activity at the par csw a total of 10 events were observed also representative of the overflows that characterize the main sewer at the pumping stations the differences in the hydraulics of these two systems have remarkable consequences also on the quality of the discharged waters the thick solid line in fig 11 shows the linear regressions between tn concentrations and tp bod cod and tss in the individual sample bottles the dashed line shows the same regressions as computed from the measured data at the cf csw barone et al 2019 as observed for the cf csos data a significant linear correlation between tp and tn concentrations is observed the tn tp mass ratio is consistent with the expected range for civil sewage and with the one obtained for cf csw about 5 this strong correlation confirms the similarities between the tn and the tp transport dynamics in terms of event mean concentrations furthermore good correlations are obtained also for the other three variables showing that inter alia a significant bod removal takes place along the main sewer in order to investigate the occurrence of the phenomenon of first flush in csos from the main sewer we decided to use the dimensionless diagrams of the nutrient load and discharge volume dimensionless cumulative load dcl curves proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 since the early studies on wet weather discharge quality e g see the review by deletic 1998 the occurrence of first flush is an aspect of the pollutant delivery dynamic that continues to be debated sansalone and cristina 2004 gnecco et al 2005 gikas and tsihrintzis 2012 ekanayake et al 2019 its practical implications on the design of structural devices devoted to the mitigation of urban stormwater impacts are relevant baek et al 2015 mamoon et al 2019 indeed issues regarding the factors affecting its occurrence are manifold and still deserve to be investigated and ranked francey et al 2010 frazar et al 2019 perera et al 2019 in dcl curves ratio ν between the cumulative and total discharge volume is reported on the x axis and ratio λ between the cumulative pollution load and the total pollution load is reported on the y axis the empirical dcl curves can suitably be fitted by the power function reported in eq 3 balistrocchi et al 2009 ma et al 2011 where the exponent b measures the strength of the first flush 3 λ ν b according to this formulation the greater the first flush the smaller the value of exponent b is while a unitary value of exponent b shows the absence of the first flush alternative methodologies have actually been proposed to assess the existence and the intensity of the first flush after dcl curves for instance bach et al 2010 developed a method based on a cluster analysis which involves the separation of the flow volume into slides however the dcl curve approach has advantages in terms of practical applicability computational intensity and uncertainty with respect to arbitrary choices of the analysis parameters the main characteristics of the monitored cso events for the par csw are shown in table 2 where the rainfall events are delineated in terms of depth duration maximum intensity and antecedent dry weather periods while the pollutant dynamic is summarized by the observed event mean concentrations emc of tn and tp and exponent b of the power functions 3 fitted to the empirical dcl curves statistics of these quality parameters are reported as well the measured dcl curves for the par csw are shown in fig 12 along with the average dcl curve for the sake of comparison also the average dcl curve for cf csw is shown in the same figure table 2 and fig 12 show that the average par dcl curve is characterized by a rather uniform concentration during the overflow b close to 1 0 this result is in contrast to the case of cf csw where a moderate first flush is present b close to 0 7 and 0 65 for tn and tp see also barone et al 2019 this remarkable difference can partly be explained by groundwater infiltration that however due to its characteristic time contributes in a similar way to the different parts of the pollutograph and in a negligible way in the case of low lake levels more likely the increased discharge due to infiltration waters prevents pollutant sedimentation during dry weather periods the resuspension of dry weather sedimentations is broadly acknowledged as a leading cause for the first flush occurrence a further explanation can be found by considering that cf csw drains a single tributary network whereas the flow entering the par csw is the combination of several tributary network inputs distributed along the main sewer over more than 20 km tributary watersheds feature different stormwater delivery times therefore in the main collector there is an overlapping of pollutographs characterized by different times to peak decreasing the overall variability of the pollutant concentration finally the action of the pumping stations certainly increases the pollutant mixing thus contributing to a more uniform concentration during the event 4 2 long term continuous simulations the calibrated model of the main sewer network was used to perform a 10 year from 2007 to 2016 continuous simulation by using the sarnico rainfall series provided by arpa lombardia time step 10 minutes bearing in mind the eutrophication process of lake iseo the fundamental result of the 10 year simulation is the quantification of the volume of waters discharged into the lake from the bss during wet weather periods and the quantification of the corresponding pollutant load residual load however there is a difference between the csws along the main collector and the ones at the end of the tributary sewers because in the first case due to the absence of the nutrient first flush the pollutant load can simply be considered proportional to the discharged volumes accordingly in the following the overflows from the tributary csws e g the cf csw where a first flush is present were clustered as type 1 overflows on the other hand the overflows occurring along the main collector e g the par csw or the overflows from the pumping stations were clustered as type 2 overflows overall during the 10 year period covered by the simulation the csws type 1 discharge amounts on average to 8 44 105 m3 year and the csws type 2 amounts to 3 66 105 m3 year for a total of 1 21 106 m3 year considering that the sewage flowing towards the wwtp1 from the bss is on average 5 16 106 m3 year the volumetric efficiency of the sewer i e the percentage of volume that reaches the terminal wastewater treatment plant with respect to the total volume entering the combined sewer system is equal to 81 fig 13 reports the spatial distribution of the annual volume discharged by each csw panel a along the bss and the frequency of cso events defined as the ratio between the number of cso events and the number of rainfall events panel b these maps are particularly important because they show the location of places were a localised environmental impact can be expected they also show the frequency of these overflows during rainfall events underlining the threat that they pose to the touristic vocation of the lake an additional fundamental result of the long term simulation is the average yearly residual load to the lake from the bss obtained by multiplying the volume discharged by csws type 1 by the emc of nutrients of cf csw and the volume discharged by csws type 2 by the emc of nutrients of par csw obtaining 3445 kg of tp and 21758 kg of tn per year considering that the bgs has similar characteristics to the bss and that the population equivalent of the southern part of the bgs drained area is similar to the bss one it is possible to calculate the total contribution of bss and bgs by doubling the previous results it is more informative to see these figures in relative terms considering a pollution load of 36000 population equivalent and the per capita water supply of 250 0 8 l p e d by assuming typical literature concentration values for dry weather sewage tipically in the range 6 10 mg l for tp and 20 40 mg l for tn the average percentage of yearly loads discharged into the lake with respect to loads produced in the drained area is equal to 13 1 21 8 for tp and to 20 7 41 4 for tn these values are largely dominated by the contribution from type 1 csw it is here interesting to observe that these results are much larger than the ones adopted during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake when the overall residual p load of csos was reckoned at about 3 of the overall load to the sewer garibaldi et al 1997 in the particular case of lake iseo the computed value of about 7000 kg of overall residual tp from the csos of the 2 peripheral sewers are in the order of 6 of the tp load from the much larger watershed w1 about 110 tonns year measured by an auto analyser and by period sampling at mouth i1 and i2 fig 1 of the main tributaries similar measures for tn are about 2100 tonns year from a different perspective another indication of the relevance of the contribution can be provided by a back of the envelope evaluation of the admissible p load to the lake according to the well known vollenweider 1975 model also used in the 1982 oecd eutrophication modeling approach who related the p load to a mean depth hydraulic residence time ratio on a plot where two reference subjective curves representing excessive and permissible loading were represented considering that the theoretical renewal time of lake iseo is about 4 3 years its average depth is 130 m and its volume is 7 9 109m3 the excessive load would correspond to 61 tonns year and the permissible one would correspond to 30 accordingly the residual load from csos would correspond to 22 of the overall permissible load in general a residual tp contribution of 20 can be unbearable in a lake restoration project also considering that csos are primary sources of microbiological contamination e g bryan ellis and yu 1995 that may hinder bathing in the lake waters and the integrity of drinking water madoux humery et al 2013 if a potential interaction between the influence areas of csos and major touristic areas or water intakes is present finally the strong nutrient inflow in localized spots along the shore cause an impairment of the habitat ghirardi et al 2019 highlighted the presence of the peculiar phenomenon of the submerged aquatic vegetation uprooting that is related to an excessive organic matter accumulation in sediments just in front of the cf csw whose overflows significantly contribute to the nutrient pollution of this littoral area it is well known that deep lakes will greatly suffer climate change mostly in terms of increased vertical stability of the water column that will hinder the deep ventilation of the hypolimnetic waters and will increase their actual water renewal time pilotti et al 2014 here we show that a further issue is provided by the growing inflow of nutrients following the intensification of storms the results of the simulation conducted according to the modified rainfall series for the period 2007 2016 yield a 6 5 average yearly increase in cso volumes this increase is positively correlated with the natural variability of rainfall events during the year for instance during 2016 whose cumulated annual rainfall series is close to the long term average but is characterized by single events more intense than usual the total discharged volume increased up to 15 with respect to the average this process would be further enhanced by a possible increase in the imperviousness of the urbanized areas moreover an increased load of nutrients released in the summer period could also contribute to phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth studies demonstrated that in lake maggiore rainfall stimulates the growth of phytoplankton and the development of summer blooms likely due to a short term increase in nutrients when epilimnetic waters are usually nutrient depleted morabito et al 2018 from the operative point of view the different patterns of the dcl curves computed at the two monitored csws show that first flush capture tanks often expensive and difficult to build are not necessarily the most suitable structural practice to tackle the problem posed by csos conversely by reducing surface runoff best practices in the drained watershed are generally an effective way to limit not only peak flows but also to curb pollution the results also show that it is fundamental to limit the amount of infiltration waters by implementing waterproofing practices on the existing network by pipe monitoring relining and introduction of flap valves on connections between the collector and the lake and by searching for wrong connections and disconnecting runoff producing areas in relatively unpolluted urban environments along the tributary watersheds by repeating the 10 year simulation in the theoretical condition of negligible infiltration along the pipes network the volumes discharged to the lake by the csws would decrease by 17 it is worth underlining that apart from the dominant environmental externalities the groundwater infiltration increases management costs due to the energy used by the pumping stations to lift the water volumes by running the model with and without infiltrations for the period 2007 2016 we calculated the operating time of each pump in both conditions knowing the operating times and the nominal power obtained by using the characteristic curves of each pump the yearly energy absorbed by the pumps in the real case with and without infiltrations was computed by eliminating the infiltrations a yearly average energy saving of 0 34 gwh could be obtained that amounts to almost 20 of the overall energy consumption in addition the implementation of a different management logic of the pumping stations would provide an appreciable improvement of the cso scenario actually a synergetic economic and environmental benefit would be obtained by changing the operative rule of the final pump station at s1 since the activation of the par csw is governed by the levels in the tank of the outlet pumping station s1 at paratico a possible strategy to improve the functioning of the sewer system would be to lower the startup and shutoff depth of the pumps in order to reduce the backwater effect in the downstream part of the main sewer the model was eventually used to test the reduction in annual volumes discharged by par csw that would be obtained by lowering the tank levels by 0 2 m and 0 8 m the computed reduction is 36 in the first case and 66 in the second with a slight increase in overall costs at pumping station s1 2 and 5 respectively it is interesting to observe that an improved management of the sewer is beneficial both in economic and environmental terms from this perspective the long term simulation provides the quantification of the role of infiltrations on the reduction of the conveyance capacity of the system and as a consequence on the increase of the cso volumes during wet weather finally the renewal of the urban environment in relatively unpolluted areas must be directed to the introduction of pervious materials progressively introducing a sponge city culture that is a fundamental step towards the protection of the fragile lake ecosystems 5 conclusion in this paper the case of the italian lake iseo was considered as an emblematic exemplification of a lake evolving towards eutrophic conditions the study showed that although the construction of a collector used to intercept and treat the urban sewage is a fundamental step to reduce the overall pollutant load discharged into a lake the effectiveness of this solution in a combined sewer system is strongly compromised during wet weather periods this is a critical problem of general interest since the majority of existing sewer systems are combined and the separation of storm waters and waste waters is often economically and technically unsustainable until recently even in fragile environments such as lakes this nutrient source has often been overlooked mostly due to the economic and practical difficulties involved in the systematic monitoring of spillways and to the assumption that the combined sewer systems perform according to theoretical assumptions a year long monitoring campaign on two combined sewer spillways and its generalization through an extensive simulation over a 10 year period show that in lake iseo the residual contribution amounts to about 20 40 of the total phosporous nitrogen load conveyed by the collector to the final waste water treatment plant the generalization of the results to a business as usual climate change scenario obtained by amplifying the most intense storms keeping the cumulative yearly rainfall constant demonstrated that it is reasonable to expect a further 10 increase in the computed volumes with respect to the overall values in relative terms in the particular case of this lake that drains a watershed that is 30 times larger than its area these values could seem a minor contribution although an extension of this study to the large watershed of valle camonica would certainly inflate the computed values in other situations this residual load can be dominant and contribute to explain the slow recovery of a lake from its eutrophic condition the results evidenced a further and relatively unknown way in which climate change will further challenge lakes although unexplored in this paper similar consequences can be expected as a result of the growing urbanization on the watershed hydrology a problem that is often considered only in terms of its effects on flood risk this paper suggests that water quality is the other subtler and possibly more difficult to solve implication of this issue moreover the measurements showed the different behaviors of combined sewer spillways located along the tributary sewers and along the main collector whereas in the first case the construction of water retention ponds would be justified due to the occurrence of first flush phenomenon in the latter this intervention would be impaired by the stronger mixing that equalizes the pollutant concentration during rainfall events the efficiency of flush storage tanks placed on the spillways of the main collector is actually diminished by the absence of the first flush phenomenon accordingly larger storage volumes would be needed to gain a satisfactory capture efficiency with respect to the possible location in the secondary tributary networks this result further underlines the site specific nature of the first flush phenomenon even inside the same drainage network and the need to conduct extensive monitoring campaigns of overflows in terms of frequency volume and mass of major pollutants in order to have reliable estimates of the loads actually discharged through spillways moreover these considerations emphasize the importance of limiting the residual nutrient loading entering a lake by using distributed non structural practices aimed at diminishing the wet period volumes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17275,although sewage diversion outside of a lake s watershed is now ordinary practice in the restoration of eutrophic lakes often the observed recovery is slower than expected and the internal load from the lake anoxic sediments is identified as a possible reason however in the case of combined sewer the quantification of the residual nutrient load discharged from sewer spillways must also be questioned in this paper the diversion efficiency of the sewer system along the east coast of lake iseo a prealpine italian lake where eutrophication effects are still severe is investigated to this purpose a representative part of the sewer system was modelled by pcswmm and calibrated by using an extensive series of discharge measurements water quality monitoring during wet weather periods reveals that the first flush is common in tributary sewers whereas it is absent along the main collector moreover flow discharges are strongly affected by infiltration waters which are controlled by the lake water level the calibrated model including infiltration modeling was used to assess the annual overflow volumes and the nutrient load through a continuous 10 year simulation simulations were conducted both with regard to the current conditions and to a climate change scenario results show that the discharged residual load is at least 7 times larger than the design value with the water infiltration contributing to 17 to the overflow volume and that non structural practices could considerably reduce the overall impact of the sewer this research thus provides important insight into the potential impact of combined sewer overflows on lacustrine environments and addresses effective mitigation measures in similar contexts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

the state of world lakes all 217 major lakes included in the survey demonstrated to be affected by eutrophication e g matsui et al 1995 due to their role in phytoplankton growth phosphorus p and nitrogen n along with their stoichiometry are considered to be the crucial nutrients that control the eutrophication development e g schindler 2006 2012 therefore costly actions to reduce their loads have been extensively undertaken urban sewage is widely acknowledged as a relevant nutrient source and a leading cause of generalized environmental degradation walsh et al 2005 even in the presence of agricultural non point sources due to the imperviousness of urban areas the relative contribution of the urban pollution load to the total load largely exceeds the ratio between the urbanized catchment area and the total catchment area for instance meals and budd 1998 estimated for lake champlain that urban sewage contributes to 18 of the phosphorous load while the urbanized catchment area is only about 3 of the total catchment extension in historical settlements around european lakes the urban drainage network is frequently made up of combined sewer systems csss draining relatively small tributary sub catchments marsalek 2003 such csss are interconnected by a diversion pipe herein referred to as a main collector placed along the lake shoreline and featuring a large conveyance capacity this pipe intercepts sewage from tributary sub catchments which otherwise would directly enter the lake and delivers it to an end of pipe wastewater treatment plant wwtp treated waters are finally discharged when possible outside of the lake watershed however during wet weather periods the untreated mixture of storm waters and waste waters exceeding either the css conveyance capacity or the wwtp processing capacity is discharged into the lake waters as combined sewer overflows csos by means of spillways the presence of spillways along the main diversion pipe and upstream of the tributary css connections is justified by technical and economic reasons nevertheless urban storm waters are well known pollutant drivers novotny and goodrich mahoney 1978 marsalek and chocat 2002 tang et al 2005 kaushal et al 2011 which wash the atmosphere the impermeable surfaces and the drainage pipes thus mobilizing sediments that settled during dry weather periods therefore during wet weather periods csos may deliver large amounts of pollutants in addition to those delivered by waste waters e g bryan ellis and yu 1995 chebbo et al 2001 kim et al 2007 and their cumulative impact cannot be disregarded tibbetts 2005 usepa 2009 especially when the receiving surface waters are characterized by long renewal times when the final recipient is a lake characterised by integrative mechanisms the total discharged load is of major concern indeed typical water renewal times for lakes lie in the order of years with respect to days for rivers and this is particularly true in deep lakes e g pilotti et al 2014 further when a css is partially or totally submerged by the water table its hydraulic load can be affected by infiltration waters especially when the css is old infiltration waters through cracked pipes leaky joints and poor manhole connections may overload the conduits and diminish the actual conveyance capacity increasing the csos number and volume with respect to the design assumption kidmose et al 2015 have shown that in the city of silkeborg western denmark one fourth of water input to the storm water runoff systems comes from groundwater sources this improper discharge karpf and krebs 2011 xu et al 2014 is particularly relevant in lacustrine environments where pipes are usually located along the lake shoreline and the water table is controlled by the lake level usually the contribution of infiltration waters to the css discharge is disregarded in spillway design and storm waters are supposed to dilute waste water pollutants owing to the systematic use of these assumptions the environmental impact of csos on lakes has often been underestimated moreover csos contribute to mosquito growth increase the risk of insect borne disease transmission lund et al 2014 cause closures of areas suitable for swimming as a result of elevated escherichia coli levels mclellan et al 2007 sebastiá frasquet et al 2013 affect the amenity of wetlands and cause the reduction of dissolved oxygen camargo and alonso 2006 smil 2000 paul and meyer 2001 over the long term they also lead to a dramatic change in aquatic community composition lund et al 2014 thus structural and management practices aimed at decreasing csos are now considered to be unavoidable in lake restoration strategies huang et al 2007 watson et al 2016 with huge costs to remove nutrients from point sources and implement related policies e g pretty et al 2003 these costs are however far lower than the overall externalities of an uncontrolled eutrophication indeed the efforts to decrease nutrient loads are now leading to better water quality in many lakes in the world such as lake maggiore morabito and manca 2014 lake constance müller 1997 lake geneva rapin and gerdeaux 2013 lakes vättern in sweden wilander and persson 2001 and the great lakes in north america there expensive structural works have been implemented to mitigate the effect of csos such as the storage system in milwaukee four deep tunnels 90 m deep under the ground surface with a total length of 31 2 km and a total capacity of 1 53 106 m3 razak and christensen 2001 and the tunnel and

protection agency usepa 2009 concluded that 50 of the lakes exhibited an improvement in phosphorus concentration with respect to the 1972 survey a holistic approach relying both on measurements and modelling maybe hybrid i e mixing deterministic and stochastic models as suggested by obropta and kardos 2007 and investigating the functional relation between a lake and the surrounding sewer marsalek and chocat 2002 moore et al 2003 is fundamental to provide reliable estimates of the loads delivered by csos and of the actual effectiveness of the structural practices that must be adopted to improve water quality liu et al 2014 dai et al 2016 bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2018 following this approach the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall efficiency of the css along the eastern lake iseo shoreline by combining the results of a monitoring campaign and of hydraulic modelling the assessment of critical issues affecting the css is considered to be an unavoidable step before planning a long term mitigation strategy to diminish cso impacts on lake iseo lake iseo the fifth italian lake in terms of volume is an originally oligothropic bonomi and gerletti 1967 deep subalpine lake that has undergone a progressive quality degradation following a path common to several others lakes over the last 50 years the strong nutrient load to the lake originating from a large urbanized mountain catchment and the growing density stratification reinforced by climate change valerio et al 2015 has caused anoxia between 100 and 256 m depth in this lake after the construction of a main collector along the shoreline in 2000 the actual residual p load of csos has not been monitored in order to evaluate the role of csos and the actual amount of nutrient loads discharged into the lake two combined sewer weirs csws were monitored one at the outlet of a tributary or municipal sub catchment and the other at the outlet of the main diversion pipe immediately upstream of the wwtp at these sites an extensive real time monitoring campaign provided time series of the flow discharges and sewage samples during csos the measured information on the csos frequency and on the amount of discharged total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn also documented the different dynamics of the first flush phenomena at the two sites in order to understand the hydrologic and hydraulic behavior of the network and to extrapolate the measured information to a longer 10 year period for which a locally measured rainfall time series is available a hydraulic model was implemented and calibrated by using the commercial software pcswmm https www pcswmm com that implements the well known epa swmm5 capabilities within a user friendly interface the most important outcome of this computation was the statistical quantification of the residual nutrient loads discharged into the lake from the overall set of csws present in the modeled network furthermore the observed rainfall time series was modified in order to account for a potential climate change scenario developed according to expected climatic projections for this region thus the calibrated model provided additional insight into the expected future variation of the csos volumes and nutrient loads the results of these detailed monitorings and modeling activities provided a clear view of the overall dynamics of the css and of the role played by the infiltration waters and led to propose an effective set of structural and non structural practices to mitigate the environmental impact on the lake 2 methods in this section the studied area is presented along with the experimental campaign and modeling methods 2 1 description of the study area lake iseo is a 256 m deep prealpine lake with a volume of about 7 9 109 m3 it drains a 1807 km2 mountain watershed see fig 1 with a pollution load of about 1 9 105 population equivalent characterized by 22 agricultural and 2 residential land use the lake and the surrounding area are an important economic and touristic resource of northern italy to the point that in 2016 it was the location of a renowned artistic en plain air performance the floating piers by the american artist christo where temporary orange walkways were set directly on the surface of the lake which drew 1 2 million visitors see fig 2 in addition to the lake area 61 km² the lake watershed is mostly made up of two large valleys valle camonica 1440 km² and valle borlezza 131 km² w1 and w2 in fig 1 and by a set of smaller watersheds that surround the lake w3 in fig 1 176 km² accordingly the lake area is only 3 4 of the drained area according to the first limnological survey by bonomi and gerletti 1967 the lake was originally oligotrophic and well oxygenated even on the bottom however during the second half of the 20th century the lake underwent a dramatic water quality deterioration e g garibaldi et al 1999 on the basis of our 2018 field measurements water under 100 m 41 of the lake s volume is anoxic with 102 µg l of average total phosphorous moreover the nutrient loads to the lake from the large drained watershed have contributed to a chemical stratification that hinders the mixing of the lake and makes the water renewal time longer with respect to its theoretical value recent studies prospect an increase in the thermal stratification in a climate change scenario pilotti et al 2014 valerio et al 2015 the water level of lake iseo is regulated by a dam in sarnico point o in fig 1 and can vary between 110 cm and 30 cm with respect to the average value of 185 15 m above sea level storing a volume of about 85 million cubic meters mostly for agricultural purposes in the wide watershed downstream of the dam 2 2 description of the combined sewer around the lake both valle camonica catchment w1 in fig 1 and valle borlezza w2 have their own sewer systems and their waste waters drain into the most important lake tributaries oglio river canale industriale and borlezza river see points i1 i2 and i3 in fig 1 such systems will not be considered in this paper since we focused our attention on the contribution from watershed w3 that is directly drained by the lake the sewer system around lake iseo catchment w3 is composed of two main sewers the first sewer is along the western side of the lake bergamo sewer or bgs in the following whose waste waters flow partly to a wwtp in costa volpino wwtp2 in fig 3 and partly to a second wwtp in paratico wwtp1 in fig 3 the second sewer is placed along the eastern side of the lake brescia sewer or bss in the following whose waste waters flow to wwtp1 only the overall relevance and performance of the two sewers are comparable about 36 000 population equivalent each where both the east and the west coasts are characterized by similar morphologies and settlements thus in the following we will consider the brescia sewer only due to lack of data regarding the western sewer and the conclusions obtained in the simulation of the bss will be extended to the bgs the bss is made up of a main collector with an overall length of 23 km black solid line in fig 4 in which 9 tributary or municipal sewers converge grey solid lines in fig 4 for a total length of 257 km mostly built with circular pipes with a diameter between 250 mm and 1600 mm the main collector follows the lake shoreline and is made of polyethylene reinforced concrete and spheroidal cast iron due to the small available topographic slopes 12 pumping stations are present green dots in fig 3 so that 17 of the conduits length is made up of pressurized delivery pipes and the remaining 83 is made up of free surface closed conduits with a slope between 0 1 to 1 5 the main collector longitudinal profile is shown in fig 5 all the 9 tributary csss converge into the main collector for instance the tributary css of the main lake island monte isola underpasses the lake and enters the pumping station s8 actually there are 51 junctions between the 9 tributary sewers and the main collector and 23 are characterized by the presence of a csw see red and pink arrows in fig 3 that during wet weather discharges the mixed sewage excess into the stream network drained by lake iseo in addition all the pumping stations except for s2 are provided with spill over conduits that are operated during maintenance or during very intense storms these conduits discharge the cso into the lake at a depth between 20 and 40 m finally two csws are located along the main collector see fig 3 in the vicinity of the terminal pumping station s1 in fig 3 the wastewater from bgs and bss converge in a tank and the overall wastewater is pumped to the wwtp1 through two pressurized delivery pipes under the current operative rule during intense storms the outlet of bss in the tank is under pressure accordingly in this circumstance the hydraulic behavior of the final part of bss is influenced by the backwater caused by the tank water level thus triggering the activation of the csw in paratico fig 4 also for discharges lower than the design threshold the settlements drained by bss amount to 12 8 km2 but 31 of the area is drained by separated sewers and the actual area that generates runoff is equal to 8 9 km2 the overall impervious area drained by the bss was computed by a suitable post processing barone et al 2019 of a recent sentinel 2 satellite image obtained from copernicus https scihub copernicus eu dhus home with 10 m spatial resolution see fig 6 the land use classification was based on the elaboration of a multi spectral image in order to divide the watershed in land cover classes water built up vegetation and bare soil the sentinel 2 image includes the following bands blue green red near infrared short wavelength infrared 1 and short wavelength infrared 2 a land use class is assigned to each pixel based on the color band it belongs to the analysis was performed through the use of an open source qgis plugin semi automatic classification plugin scp that provides a set of intertwined tools for faster processing in order to create an automatic workflow to obtain land cover classification see also https readthedocs org projects semiautomaticclassificationmanual downloads pdf latest the minimum surface that can be detected 100 m2 can hinder the classification in pixels with a mixture of covers soil vegetation however this issue is counterbalanced by the large extension that can be easily mapped accordingly in order to test the quality of the accomplished classification and to check that impervious areas were not erroneously classified e g pena regueiro et al 2020 a visual validation was made for the provaglio village using a box counting approach on a high spatial resolution image of two typical neighborhoods with high and medium density built areas the comparison with the visually recognised land use shows that the algorithm provides an excellent classification of the percentage of built areas in the high density neighborhood e g 86 versus counted 89 in the area a of fig 6 and due to the typical dimension of house gardens and streets in the medium density neighborhood tends to group them together as bare soils with a slight overestimation e g 78 versus counted 61 in the area b of fig 6 eventually the overall computed impervious area was 3 0 km2 i e 34 of the overall generating runoff area 2 3 detection of infiltrating waters along the combined sewer by controlling the groundwater level along the shoreline the variation of the lake water level over the year has important implications on the functioning of the bss as shown in fig 5 a growing length of the main collector is under the elevation of the lake waters when the lake level increases the percentage of the main sewage length below the lake water elevation varies linearly between 12 minimum lake level and 34 maximum lake level due to the presence of leakage in the pipes the higher the water level the greater the groundwater infiltration within the sewer is potentially also a moderate exfiltration into the groundwater could be expected when the lake level is very low likely contributing to the contamination of the urban aquatic environment but it will not be considered in the following the infiltration of groundwater into the bss is clearly evident in the average daily flow discharges measured at the outlet in 2016 shown in fig 7 along with the lake level as one can observe there is a strong correlation between the two series when the lake level grows higher than 50 cm with respect to the conventional reference level for a sufficiently long period of time the baseflow follows a similar increase in turn the groundwater infiltration in the sewer conduits causes discharges exceeding the design value of the pipes with overflows from csw also in dry weather periods and a decrease in the sewage concentrations with consequent issues in the functioning of the wwtps accordingly the identification of the actual stretches where leakage occurs is of paramount importance but is not an easy task in such a long network different approaches can be used to assess the infiltration contribution to the flow discharge namely the night minima observation the flow volume balance staufer et al 2012 and the isotope mass balance houhou et al 2010 in this work we adopted the second approach by measuring the discharge at the end points of a stretch during dry periods when the storm water component is absent and by knowing what discharges should enter the stretch along its extension proportional to the drained population equivalent one can compute the difference that can be reckoned as groundwater lake infiltrations from a practical point of view since a flowmeter was not available within the sewer system until 2016 the task was carried out by analysing the sewage volume delivered at the pumping stations in correspondence of different lake levels in 2016 a flowmeter was installed immediately upstream of the terminal pumping station s1 confirming the value of the computed total infiltration for different stages of the lake the analysis of the data until 2016 provides an experimental curve see fig 8 of the overall infiltration as a function of the lake level quite interestingly these data can be well approximated by a conceptual model for an orifice flow as indicated in eq 1 1 q c 0 l p δ y 0 5 d x y lake y conduit 0 y lake y conduit where p is the local perimeter of the conduit exposed to infiltrations l is its length c is a constant and y is the difference between the elevation of the lake ylake and the local elevation of the invert of the conduit yconduit if one regards the c coefficient as in eq 2 2 c 2 g k then an equivalent sewer porosity k could be introduced as a dimensionless measure of the relevance of the infiltration process in a sewer 2 4 available data and field measurements all the geometrical and hydraulic information on the main sewer system planimetric and altimetric layout of the network lengths diameters materials slopes location and types of spillways were provided by the drainage network manager acque bresciane the pumping stations were characterized by their geometry the operative rules and the characteristic curves of the pumps table 1 shows the temporal availability of the measured time series the lake level and the rainfall series with a time step of 10 minutes for the sarnico raingauge were available for a 10 year period source arpa lombardia with regard to the discharges the ones pumped by the eight pumping stations were available for a 7 month long period in the first half of 2015 at the end of the collector two data sets were available the discharge that has entered wwt1 since 2015 obtained by the operation time of the pumps at the pumping station s1 in paratico and the one measured since august 2015 by acque bresciane at the final station of the main collector using an area velocity flowmeter nivus pcm 4 with an error 0 5 of measurement 5 mm s when v 1 m s and 1 of measurement when v 1 m s accordingly the overall discharge of the main collector is available from 2015 with a time step of 5 min and was used along with the rainfall for the model calibration the discharge entering from the bgs main collector was computed as a difference between flow discharges measured in correspondence of wwtp1 and the flow measured at the outlet of the bss main collector in order to study the frequency and the quality characteristics of the coss from the csws existing in the whole network we monitored two different csws the first representative of overflows from the tributary sewers is located upstream of the junction of the corte franca sewer with the main collector see cf csw in fig 4 the second representative of overflows from the main collector is located at paratico see par csw in fig 4 indeed one can expect differences in the quality of the two overflows since the main collector is characterized by a longer residence time stronger mixing and dilution with infiltrating waters in both cases the flow discharge was measured and sewage samples collected automatically with a portable sampler during cso occurrences the extensive monitoring campaign at the cf csw is described in detail in barone et al 2019 on the other hand the quality of the water overflowing from the csw along the main collector is crucial because at each pumping station an overflow pipe exists that during intense storms discharges waters directly into the lake under the thermocline accordingly the monitoring of par csw is representative of this second category of csos from may 2017 at the par csw a level sensor lt us lacroix sofrel was installed accuracy within the maximum between 6 mm and 0 25 of the measured range by which the discharged flow series was computed in april 2018 we also installed an automatic sampler isco 3700 equipped with 24 ½ liter bottles to collect cso samples the sampling interval was set equal to 10 minutes and the sampler was set up to collect two samples of 250 ml in each bottle in order to characterize the overflowing sewage during 8 hour long events within a few hours after collection the samples were transported using a portable refrigerator to the laboratory to quantify tp and tn concentrations overall a total of 10 cso events and 107 samples were analyzed unfiltered water samples were analyzed for tp and tn concentrations with standard spectrophotometric perkin elmer lambda 35 methods as soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate after alkaline peroxydisulfate oxidation valderrama 1981 in some cases the laboratory also carried out analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod 5 events apha 2012 biochemical oxygen demand at 5 days bod5 3 events uni en 1899 1 2001 and total suspended solids tss 2 events apat cnr irsa 2090 b man 2003 considering that only accurate analytical results allow valid conclusions to be drawn in appendix 1 further information is provided regarding the quality assurance and quality control followed in the measurement of chemical data the dates of cso events when the stormwater runoff samples were collected are summarized in table 2 along with the parameters analyzed in laboratory and the numbers of samples for each event during these events the cso discharge was measured as well 2 5 hydraulic hydrological model the combined sewer was modeled using the storm water management model swmm developed by the united states environmental protection agency operating within the pcswmm environment this software computes both surface runoff and flow in conduits using hydrological hydraulics and geometrical characteristics of the watershed and the sewer network e g gironás et al 2010 rossman 2015 although swmm allows researchers to study water quality we limited our use to the reproduction of the sewer hydraulics due to the complexity of the overall system and to the lack of adequate geometrical information on the whole set of the tributary sewers we developed the hydraulic models of the main collector and of two tributary sewer systems only namely corte franca and provaglio d iseo fig 4 such tributary drainage systems were monitored at their outlet sections immediately upstream of the confluence in the main sewer by using a calibrated stage discharge curve and level meter their calibration during wet weather periods barone et al 2019 provided the hydrological parameters of the corresponding watersheds that were used for the lumped hydrological modelling of the other 7 similar tributary sewer systems considering that during intense storms likely yielding csos the decrease in the soil infiltration capacity in urban areas is negligible a simple infiltration model featuring a constant infiltration rate fp mm h was used in the totally impervious urban area fp was set at 0 mm h whereas in the remaining pervious area it was set at 3 mm h the rainfall time series used as the model input was provided by the regional meteorological monitoring agency arpa lombardia for the rain gauge located in sarnico see fig 4 in this series the rainfall depths were recorded every 10 minutes a time step that can be considered sufficiently short with respect to the tributary sewer network response times the computed discharges delivered by the tributary sewers were used as external inflow discharges in the junction nodes of the main collector in addition to the geometrical characteristics of pipes and manholes the functioning of the pumping stations placed along the main sewer was modeled in detail by implementing the geometry of the storage tanks the characteristic curves of the pumps the geometrical data of the delivery pipes and the startup and shutoff depths of the pumps the hydraulic characteristics of the different csws were also implemented in the model the dry weather loads were calculated by multiplying the daily per capita water supply estimated in 250 0 8 200 l p e d according to the data supplied by the company managing the tributary drinking water plants by the population equivalent in the area of interest this load was incremented considering the touristic seasonal loads data provided by the national statistics institute istat so that a monthly time pattern was obtained for the dry weather flow the hydraulic model also accounted for the infiltration waters computed as a function of the lake levels according to eq 1 calibration led to a value of 1 12 10 5 for the porosity coefficient k in eq 2 as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the measured and modeled infiltration water discharges is satisfactory fig 8 also shows that when the lake level is at a maximum i e 110 cm the infiltration water contribution corresponds to 175 l s that is 150 of the normal waste water flow discharge in dry weather periods since the water depth in the s1 pumping station is influenced also by the flow discharge coming from bgs its contribution had to be evaluated without the possibility of modelling its hydraulic behavior in detail therefore during dry weather periods we assumed an overall discharge proportional to the population equivalent in the bgs drained area conversely during wet weather periods we introduced a fictitious subcatchment whose runoff directly enters ps1 this subcatchment model was calibrated by using data from 2016 on the basis of the difference between the overall discharge measured at the wwtp1 and at the bss outlet the calibration of the bss main collector was instead limited to the choice of the friction factors on the basis of the typical pipe materials 3 sensitivity to climate change considering that the rainfall runoff transformation is a strongly non linear process affected by the infiltration excess of rainfall one can expect that an increase in the rainfall intensity as a likely outcome of the ongoing climate change could lead to a worsening of the environmental impact of a combined sewer due to the increase in the frequency and volume of cso events e g nie et al 2009 fortier and mailhot 2015 semadeni davies et al 2008 considering the business as usual emission scenario rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 sinha et al 2017 have shown that climate change induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase 19 14 riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental united states fostering further eutrophication unfortunately this scenario referring to the worst greenhouse gasses emission projection currently appears to be the most probable one with respect to the rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and to the rcp2 6 mitigation scenario to evaluate the consequences of this scenario on csos with reference to 2100 salerno et al 2018 proposed an increase in the rainfall intensity of 20 dealing with a case study located in this climatic region actually in northern italy statistically significant increases in the yearly total amount of precipitation are not expected conversely seasonal trends should yield increases in the rainfall depths in summer and spring along with decreases in winter and autumn in particular winter storms would be affected by a more complex change according to which the mean should decrease and the upper percentile should increase see for instance balistrocchi and grossi 2020 for a review it is worth noticing that the temporal structure of storms in northern italy shows a significant seasonality so that storms featuring short durations and high intensities mostly occur in late spring and in summer long frontal events with larger depths but low intensities are instead more common in the other seasons therefore a reasonable scenario for the study area could involve an increase in heavy storms and a decrease in moderate and low intense rainfalls in this study this was accomplished by globally increasing the observed heavy storm events of 20 and by cutting the values under a threshold calculated in order to keep the yearly cumulated rainfall constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and field data analysis in this section we discuss the exploitation of the extensive data set collected as illustrated in the previous section to the characterization of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the combined sewage 4 1 1 results of the hydraulic hydrological model fig 9 shows the comparison between modeled and measured flow discharges at the outlet of the bss into ps1 and modeled and measured overflow discharges at par csw for the period 01 05 2017 04 05 2017 in consideration of the system complexity the model reproduces the behavior of the brescia main collector well fig 10 shows additional comparison between the modeled flow discharge and the computed one from bgs and from bss for the period 01 01 2016 14 01 2016 the model was validated by using the sarnico rainfall series during the entire year of 2016 the graph in fig 10 shows the comparison between simulated and measured daily average flow discharges coming from bss the satisfactory agreement between measured and modeled flow discharges shown in fig 10 is supported by a linear correlation coefficient of r2 0 90 the strong influence of the lake water levels on the sewer flow discharges in the period 30 04 and 29 07 is also evident overall the modeled network closely reproduced the measured discharges at the main collector outlet 4 1 2 quality data analysis of csos the two flow discharge gauges and the two portable samplers installed in cf csw and in par csw provided fundamental data on the quantity and concentration of nutrients discharged into the lake due to the hydrologic and land use similarity between the different small watersheds the cf csw is considered representative of overflows from the 9 watersheds drained by tributary lines the 8 month activity at cf csw during which 18 overflows were sampled was carefully documented in barone et al 2019 the most interesting results are the presence of a moderate weak first flush whose strength is significantly correlated with the duration of the antecedent dry weather period and the occurrence of frequent cso events but with moderate volumes this implies that a small water quality volume must be provided in order for a capture storage tank to be effective on the other hand during the 4 month monitoring activity at the par csw a total of 10 events were observed also representative of the overflows that characterize the main sewer at the pumping stations the differences in the hydraulics of these two systems have remarkable consequences also on the quality of the discharged waters the thick solid line in fig 11 shows the linear regressions between tn concentrations and tp bod cod and tss in the individual sample bottles the dashed line shows the same regressions as computed from the measured data at the cf csw barone et al 2019 as observed for the cf csos data a significant linear correlation between tp and tn concentrations is observed the tn tp mass ratio is consistent with the expected range for civil sewage and with the one obtained for cf csw about 5 this strong correlation confirms the similarities between the tn and the tp transport dynamics in terms of event mean concentrations furthermore good correlations are obtained also for the other three variables showing that inter alia a significant bod removal takes place along the main sewer in order to investigate the occurrence of the phenomenon of first flush in csos from the main sewer we decided to use the dimensionless diagrams of the nutrient load and discharge volume dimensionless cumulative load dcl curves proposed by bertrand krajewski et al 1998 since the early studies on wet weather discharge quality e g see the review by deletic 1998 the occurrence of first flush is an aspect of the pollutant delivery dynamic that continues to be debated sansalone and cristina 2004 gnecco et al 2005 gikas and tsihrintzis 2012 ekanayake et al 2019 its practical implications on the design of structural devices devoted to the mitigation of urban stormwater impacts are relevant baek et al 2015 mamoon et al 2019 indeed issues regarding the factors affecting its occurrence are manifold and still deserve to be investigated and ranked francey et al 2010 frazar et al 2019 perera et al 2019 in dcl curves ratio ν between the cumulative and total discharge volume is reported on the x axis and ratio λ between the cumulative pollution load and the total pollution load is reported on the y axis the empirical dcl curves can suitably be fitted by the power function reported in eq 3 balistrocchi et al 2009 ma et al 2011 where the exponent b measures the strength of the first flush 3 λ ν b according to this formulation the greater the first flush the smaller the value of exponent b is while a unitary value of exponent b shows the absence of the first flush alternative methodologies have actually been proposed to assess the existence and the intensity of the first flush after dcl curves for instance bach et al 2010 developed a method based on a cluster analysis which involves the separation of the flow volume into slides however the dcl curve approach has advantages in terms of practical applicability computational intensity and uncertainty with respect to arbitrary choices of the analysis parameters the main characteristics of the monitored cso events for the par csw are shown in table 2 where the rainfall events are delineated in terms of depth duration maximum intensity and antecedent dry weather periods while the pollutant dynamic is summarized by the observed event mean concentrations emc of tn and tp and exponent b of the power functions 3 fitted to the empirical dcl curves statistics of these quality parameters are reported as well the measured dcl curves for the par csw are shown in fig 12 along with the average dcl curve for the sake of comparison also the average dcl curve for cf csw is shown in the same figure table 2 and fig 12 show that the average par dcl curve is characterized by a rather uniform concentration during the overflow b close to 1 0 this result is in contrast to the case of cf csw where a moderate first flush is present b close to 0 7 and 0 65 for tn and tp see also barone et al 2019 this remarkable difference can partly be explained by groundwater infiltration that however due to its characteristic time contributes in a similar way to the different parts of the pollutograph and in a negligible way in the case of low lake levels more likely the increased discharge due to infiltration waters prevents pollutant sedimentation during dry weather periods the resuspension of dry weather sedimentations is broadly acknowledged as a leading cause for the first flush occurrence a further explanation can be found by considering that cf csw drains a single tributary network whereas the flow entering the par csw is the combination of several tributary network inputs distributed along the main sewer over more than 20 km tributary watersheds feature different stormwater delivery times therefore in the main collector there is an overlapping of pollutographs characterized by different times to peak decreasing the overall variability of the pollutant concentration finally the action of the pumping stations certainly increases the pollutant mixing thus contributing to a more uniform concentration during the event 4 2 long term continuous simulations the calibrated model of the main sewer network was used to perform a 10 year from 2007 to 2016 continuous simulation by using the sarnico rainfall series provided by arpa lombardia time step 10 minutes bearing in mind the eutrophication process of lake iseo the fundamental result of the 10 year simulation is the quantification of the volume of waters discharged into the lake from the bss during wet weather periods and the quantification of the corresponding pollutant load residual load however there is a difference between the csws along the main collector and the ones at the end of the tributary sewers because in the first case due to the absence of the nutrient first flush the pollutant load can simply be considered proportional to the discharged volumes accordingly in the following the overflows from the tributary csws e g the cf csw where a first flush is present were clustered as type 1 overflows on the other hand the overflows occurring along the main collector e g the par csw or the overflows from the pumping stations were clustered as type 2 overflows overall during the 10 year period covered by the simulation the csws type 1 discharge amounts on average to 8 44 105 m3 year and the csws type 2 amounts to 3 66 105 m3 year for a total of 1 21 106 m3 year considering that the sewage flowing towards the wwtp1 from the bss is on average 5 16 106 m3 year the volumetric efficiency of the sewer i e the percentage of volume that reaches the terminal wastewater treatment plant with respect to the total volume entering the combined sewer system is equal to 81 fig 13 reports the spatial distribution of the annual volume discharged by each csw panel a along the bss and the frequency of cso events defined as the ratio between the number of cso events and the number of rainfall events panel b these maps are particularly important because they show the location of places were a localised environmental impact can be expected they also show the frequency of these overflows during rainfall events underlining the threat that they pose to the touristic vocation of the lake an additional fundamental result of the long term simulation is the average yearly residual load to the lake from the bss obtained by multiplying the volume discharged by csws type 1 by the emc of nutrients of cf csw and the volume discharged by csws type 2 by the emc of nutrients of par csw obtaining 3445 kg of tp and 21758 kg of tn per year considering that the bgs has similar characteristics to the bss and that the population equivalent of the southern part of the bgs drained area is similar to the bss one it is possible to calculate the total contribution of bss and bgs by doubling the previous results it is more informative to see these figures in relative terms considering a pollution load of 36000 population equivalent and the per capita water supply of 250 0 8 l p e d by assuming typical literature concentration values for dry weather sewage tipically in the range 6 10 mg l for tp and 20 40 mg l for tn the average percentage of yearly loads discharged into the lake with respect to loads produced in the drained area is equal to 13 1 21 8 for tp and to 20 7 41 4 for tn these values are largely dominated by the contribution from type 1 csw it is here interesting to observe that these results are much larger than the ones adopted during the initial design of the main sewer around the lake when the overall residual p load of csos was reckoned at about 3 of the overall load to the sewer garibaldi et al 1997 in the particular case of lake iseo the computed value of about 7000 kg of overall residual tp from the csos of the 2 peripheral sewers are in the order of 6 of the tp load from the much larger watershed w1 about 110 tonns year measured by an auto analyser and by period sampling at mouth i1 and i2 fig 1 of the main tributaries similar measures for tn are about 2100 tonns year from a different perspective another indication of the relevance of the contribution can be provided by a back of the envelope evaluation of the admissible p load to the lake according to the well known vollenweider 1975 model also used in the 1982 oecd eutrophication modeling approach who related the p load to a mean depth hydraulic residence time ratio on a plot where two reference subjective curves representing excessive and permissible loading were represented considering that the theoretical renewal time of lake iseo is about 4 3 years its average depth is 130 m and its volume is 7 9 109m3 the excessive load would correspond to 61 tonns year and the permissible one would correspond to 30 accordingly the residual load from csos would correspond to 22 of the overall permissible load in general a residual tp contribution of 20 can be unbearable in a lake restoration project also considering that csos are primary sources of microbiological contamination e g bryan ellis and yu 1995 that may hinder bathing in the lake waters and the integrity of drinking water madoux humery et al 2013 if a potential interaction between the influence areas of csos and major touristic areas or water intakes is present finally the strong nutrient inflow in localized spots along the shore cause an impairment of the habitat ghirardi et al 2019 highlighted the presence of the peculiar phenomenon of the submerged aquatic vegetation uprooting that is related to an excessive organic matter accumulation in sediments just in front of the cf csw whose overflows significantly contribute to the nutrient pollution of this littoral area it is well known that deep lakes will greatly suffer climate change mostly in terms of increased vertical stability of the water column that will hinder the deep ventilation of the hypolimnetic waters and will increase their actual water renewal time pilotti et al 2014 here we show that a further issue is provided by the growing inflow of nutrients following the intensification of storms the results of the simulation conducted according to the modified rainfall series for the period 2007 2016 yield a 6 5 average yearly increase in cso volumes this increase is positively correlated with the natural variability of rainfall events during the year for instance during 2016 whose cumulated annual rainfall series is close to the long term average but is characterized by single events more intense than usual the total discharged volume increased up to 15 with respect to the average this process would be further enhanced by a possible increase in the imperviousness of the urbanized areas moreover an increased load of nutrients released in the summer period could also contribute to phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth studies demonstrated that in lake maggiore rainfall stimulates the growth of phytoplankton and the development of summer blooms likely due to a short term increase in nutrients when epilimnetic waters are usually nutrient depleted morabito et al 2018 from the operative point of view the different patterns of the dcl curves computed at the two monitored csws show that first flush capture tanks often expensive and difficult to build are not necessarily the most suitable structural practice to tackle the problem posed by csos conversely by reducing surface runoff best practices in the drained watershed are generally an effective way to limit not only peak flows but also to curb pollution the results also show that it is fundamental to limit the amount of infiltration waters by implementing waterproofing practices on the existing network by pipe monitoring relining and introduction of flap valves on connections between the collector and the lake and by searching for wrong connections and disconnecting runoff producing areas in relatively unpolluted urban environments along the tributary watersheds by repeating the 10 year simulation in the theoretical condition of negligible infiltration along the pipes network the volumes discharged to the lake by the csws would decrease by 17 it is worth underlining that apart from the dominant environmental externalities the groundwater infiltration increases management costs due to the energy used by the pumping stations to lift the water volumes by running the model with and without infiltrations for the period 2007 2016 we calculated the operating time of each pump in both conditions knowing the operating times and the nominal power obtained by using the characteristic curves of each pump the yearly energy absorbed by the pumps in the real case with and without infiltrations was computed by eliminating the infiltrations a yearly average energy saving of 0 34 gwh could be obtained that amounts to almost 20 of the overall energy consumption in addition the implementation of a different management logic of the pumping stations would provide an appreciable improvement of the cso scenario actually a synergetic economic and environmental benefit would be obtained by changing the operative rule of the final pump station at s1 since the activation of the par csw is governed by the levels in the tank of the outlet pumping station s1 at paratico a possible strategy to improve the functioning of the sewer system would be to lower the startup and shutoff depth of the pumps in order to reduce the backwater effect in the downstream part of the main sewer the model was eventually used to test the reduction in annual volumes discharged by par csw that would be obtained by lowering the tank levels by 0 2 m and 0 8 m the computed reduction is 36 in the first case and 66 in the second with a slight increase in overall costs at pumping station s1 2 and 5 respectively it is interesting to observe that an improved management of the sewer is beneficial both in economic and environmental terms from this perspective the long term simulation provides the quantification of the role of infiltrations on the reduction of the conveyance capacity of the system and as a consequence on the increase of the cso volumes during wet weather finally the renewal of the urban environment in relatively unpolluted areas must be directed to the introduction of pervious materials progressively introducing a sponge city culture that is a fundamental step towards the protection of the fragile lake ecosystems 5 conclusion in this paper the case of the italian lake iseo was considered as an emblematic exemplification of a lake evolving towards eutrophic conditions the study showed that although the construction of a collector used to intercept and treat the urban sewage is a fundamental step to reduce the overall pollutant load discharged into a lake the effectiveness of this solution in a combined sewer system is strongly compromised during wet weather periods this is a critical problem of general interest since the majority of existing sewer systems are combined and the separation of storm waters and waste waters is often economically and technically unsustainable until recently even in fragile environments such as lakes this nutrient source has often been overlooked mostly due to the economic and practical difficulties involved in the systematic monitoring of spillways and to the assumption that the combined sewer systems perform according to theoretical assumptions a year long monitoring campaign on two combined sewer spillways and its generalization through an extensive simulation over a 10 year period show that in lake iseo the residual contribution amounts to about 20 40 of the total phosporous nitrogen load conveyed by the collector to the final waste water treatment plant the generalization of the results to a business as usual climate change scenario obtained by amplifying the most intense storms keeping the cumulative yearly rainfall constant demonstrated that it is reasonable to expect a further 10 increase in the computed volumes with respect to the overall values in relative terms in the particular case of this lake that drains a watershed that is 30 times larger than its area these values could seem a minor contribution although an extension of this study to the large watershed of valle camonica would certainly inflate the computed values in other situations this residual load can be dominant and contribute to explain the slow recovery of a lake from its eutrophic condition the results evidenced a further and relatively unknown way in which climate change will further challenge lakes although unexplored in this paper similar consequences can be expected as a result of the growing urbanization on the watershed hydrology a problem that is often considered only in terms of its effects on flood risk this paper suggests that water quality is the other subtler and possibly more difficult to solve implication of this issue moreover the measurements showed the different behaviors of combined sewer spillways located along the tributary sewers and along the main collector whereas in the first case the construction of water retention ponds would be justified due to the occurrence of first flush phenomenon in the latter this intervention would be impaired by the stronger mixing that equalizes the pollutant concentration during rainfall events the efficiency of flush storage tanks placed on the spillways of the main collector is actually diminished by the absence of the first flush phenomenon accordingly larger storage volumes would be needed to gain a satisfactory capture efficiency with respect to the possible location in the secondary tributary networks this result further underlines the site specific nature of the first flush phenomenon even inside the same drainage network and the need to conduct extensive monitoring campaigns of overflows in terms of frequency volume and mass of major pollutants in order to have reliable estimates of the loads actually discharged through spillways moreover these considerations emphasize the importance of limiting

most environmental monitoring and research programmes and only accurate analytical data permits valid conclusions to be drawn for load calculations in order to assure a high quality standard and reproducibility of the total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations and respective loads along with chemical and biological oxygen demand the sampling protocol sample handling and analysis were performed according to standard methods apha 2012 apat irsa 2003 since the sampler was not refrigerated the samples were retrieved within 2 to 3 hours after collection immediately transferred into pre labelled polyethylene bottles and transported within 2 hours in a cool box to the laboratory in order to avoid cross contamination all sampling containers were pre washed by soaking them overnight in a 10 hcl solution and then rinsed twice with distilled water the quality control of the analyses was performed by constantly evaluating the performance of the full analytical procedures all chemicals for reagents and standard preparations met the analytical reagent grade quality once in laboratory samples were analysed for tp and tn concentrations using standard spectrophotometric perkin elmer lambda 35 methods after wet alkaline peroxydisulfate oxidation of the unfiltered sample valderrama 1981 to do this known volumes of unfiltered and homogenized samples were transferred into glass vials to which a solution of peroxydisulfate digestion reagent was added the samples were then oxidized in an autoclave for 1 hour and after cooling at room temperature 20 c they were analysed as soluble reactive phosphorus apha 2012 method 4500 p ascorbic acid method and nitrate apha 2012 method 4500 no3 cadmium reduction method the spectrophotometer was regularly calibrated bimonthly for dissolved inorganic phosphorus srp and nitrate no3 by means of calibration curves made of six standard concentrations each standard concentration was prepared in triplicate five analytical blanks that underwent the same digestion and analytical procedure as the samples were always analysed to correct for sample contamination due to sample handling and reagent addition

17276,although an increasing number of reports have revealed that rivers are important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs the magnitude and underlying mechanism of riverine ghg emissions are still poorly understood the global extent of the headwater stream ecosystem may represent one of the important ghg emitters a global database of ghg measurements from 595 rivers indicated that the concentrations of riverine ghgs continually decrease as the stream order increases further analysis suggested that high ghg emissions from headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 could be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen massive terrestrially derived carbon nitrogen inputs and large gas exchange velocity through a combination of the predicted river surface areas and gas transfer velocities we estimated that globally the rivers emit approximately 6 6 5 5 7 8 pg co2 29 5 19 6 37 3 tg ch4 and 0 6 0 2 0 9 tg n2o per year and totally emit 7 6 6 1 9 1 co2 equivalent into atmosphere per year the headwater streams contribute 72 3 75 5 and 77 2 of the global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions respectively this study presents a systematic estimation of ghg emissions from river ecosystems worldwide and highlights the dominant role played by headwater streams in ghg evasions from global rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words riverine ghg emissions stream order headwater stream oxygen level carbon nitrogen input 1 introduction the anthropogenic disturbance of carbon and nitrogen cycles globally has resulted in the rapid increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations especially with respect to carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o and triggered a series of environmental issues such as global warming ciais and sabine 2013 the accurate quantification of ghg sources and sinks has been determined to be a critical task for the current identification of potential ways of mitigating and managing global warming griscom et al 2017 walsh et al 2017 most conventional investigations regarded global river ecosystems as considerable sinks of terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n which may be transported into the adjacent oceans by the river network boyer et al 2006 regnier et al 2013 li et al 2017 however increasing evidence indicates that the global river ecosystem is a vital source of ghg despite its smaller surface area compared to other ecosystems terrestrial and marine ecosystems cole et al 2007 bastviken et al 2011 quick et al 2019 the magnitude and spatial variations of riverine ghg emissions have become one of the focal points of current studies but it unfortunately continue to be shrouded in uncertainty raymond et al 2013 hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 over the past number of decades many field investigations and dataset compilations have been aimed at quantifying the contribution of riverine ghg emissions to the global ghg budgets and exploring the spatial variations of different ghg components bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 for instance raymond et al 2013 employed new approaches toward the individual simulation of the surface area gas transfer velocity and co2 partial pressure pco2 for global rivers and eventually estimated that global river ecosystems emit approximately 1 8 pg c into the atmosphere every year another global synthesis suggested that most river ecosystems are supersaturated with ch4 and release approximately 26 8 tg ch4 into the atmosphere every year stanley et al 2016 for n2o a recent study implemented the ipcc method whereby the n2o emission rate was calculated by multiplying the anthropogenic n loading by the corresponding emission factor and estimated the total n2o emission from global rivers to be 46 5 55 5 gg n2o yr hu et al 2016 generally these studies systematically evaluated the magnitude and spatial patterns of riverine ghg emissions and certainly established the critical contribution of river systems to global ghg emissions however large uncertainties with respect to current global estimations have persisted perhaps as a result of methodology bias data scarcity and inadequate understanding of the environmental factors driving riverine ghg emissions at a global scale one of the challenges of global riverine ghg estimation is the identification of key environmental factors that influence the riverine ghg emissions on a large scale the biological chemical and physical processes of each type of ghg co2 ch4 and n2o varied and were thus driven by diverse environmental factors a field survey exceeding eight years in quebec suggested a strong correlation between terrestrial dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and aquatic co2 emission lapierre et al 2013 in addition to the terrestrial carbon input other environment factors such as annual precipitation flow velocity and wind speed may also be important factors affecting the riverine co2 emissions butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 li et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that riverine ch4 is primarily formed in anaerobic sediment by methanogens and quickly oxidized by methanotrophs bacteria before being released into the atmosphere comer warner et al 2018 borges et al 2019 thus sediment carbon storage and dissolved oxygen do concentration play pivotal roles in the production and consumption of riverine ch4 in addition the riverine ch4 emission may be affected by other factors e g water sediment temperature trophic status and wind speed guérin and abril 2007 stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2018 compared with co2 and ch4 riverine n2o emission is more correlated with the anthropogenic n input including agricultural n fertilizer or industrial nitrogen rich wastewater yu et al 2013 turner et al 2015 meanwhile riverine n2o as a byproduct of two microbial processes nitrification nh4 to no3 and denitrification no3 to n2o and finally n2 is affected by other environmental conditions such as doc ph and do rosamond et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 the key factors controlling riverine ghg emission could vary depending on the study regions or scales for example hotchkiss et al 2015 found that riverine co2 emissions are dominantly influenced by terrestrially derived co2 inputs in small rivers but are gradually more affected by aquatic internal metabolisms in the wake of increasing river sizes similar findings for riverine ch4 and n2o emissions have been reported in previous studies marzadri et al 2017 borges et al 2019 the environmental factors that control the degassing of riverine ghgs continue to be complex and unclear worldwide interestingly some recent studies have reported that the magnitude of riverine ghg emissions could be correlated with stream order butman raymond 2014 determined the identical reverse dependency of riverine pco2 and stream order according to a field measurements database usgs the united states geological survey of the 4 138 hydrological stations in the united states based on a long term 2010 2017 field survey marescaux et al 2018 found significant variations in riverine ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions among the different stream orders of seine river similarly the dependencies of ghg fluxes and stream order were observed in the streams of the us corn belt and congo river network turner et al 2015 borges et al 2019 however the variations of riverine ghg emissions with increasing stream order at the global scale remain unknown these studies may offer some theoretical insight thus allowing for the simultaneous quantification of the global riverine ghg emissions based on the possible identification of negative or positive correlations between riverine ghg emissions and stream orders at the global scale in this study we aimed to quantify the magnitude and spatial variations of global riverine ghg emissions as well as discuss the underlying mechanisms we developed a global database recording of ghg measurement from 642 rivers and explored the spatial patterns of global riverine ghg emissions and their relationship with environmental factors i e dissolved oxygen doc etc we also aimed to provide a new estimation of ghg emissions from global rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation we compiled ghg emission observations including concentration partial pressure and flux of global river ecosystems i e streams rivers from studies published during 1974 2019 by searching keywords including co2 ch4 n2o and either river or stream using google scholar web of science and cnki database china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net as a result this global database consists of 5948 ecosystem ghg measurements of 595 rivers from 208 published literatures that recorded riverine ghg emission data 2017 1978 2856 for number of co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes and n 2390 3169 2656 for number of co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations respectively fig s1 in appendix a to reduce potential bias and uncertainties we performed some pretreatment during the processes of data compilation for example to simplify database management the units of all ghg fluxes and concentration data were unified e g μatm for pco2 mg ch4 l and mg n2o l for concentration of ch4 and n2o respectively mg co2 m2 h mg ch4 m2 h and mg n2o m2 h for flux of riverine co2 ch4 and n2o respectively besides we calculated the average value of ghg fluxes and concentration for the same river reach reported in multiple studies meanwhile to explore the spatial variations of riverine ghg emissions we also divided the ghg measurements into different groups according to the biome regions tundra boreal temperate tropical and others continents and stream order they were located in the biome class was modified and revised from the köppen geiger climate classification map kottek et al 2006 whereby the others represent the biomes of desert rock ice and mangrove the global rivers were categorized using the strahler stream order systems order 1 represented the headwater streams order 2 represented the bigger streams formed when the 1st order streams meet and when the 2nd order streams come together they form the 3rd order streams etc 2 2 estimations of global riverine ghg fluxes we upscaled the in situ riverine ghg measurements to global scale by multiplying the gas fluxes co2 ch4 and n2o with the corresponding river surface areas the gas fluxes mmol gas m2 day were calculated via the boundary layer method raymond et al 2013 according to gas exchange velocity k gas and gases concentration gradient between water c gas water mmol gas l and atmospheric interface c gas air as follows 1 f g a s k g a s c g a s w a t e r p g a s a i r h g a s where p gas air represents the partial pressures of gas in the atmosphere and are set as 390 1 8 and 0 32 ppm 10 3 atm for co2 ch4 and n2o respectively the h gas mol l atm is the henry s solubility constant of gas reported by sander 2015 note that co2 concentration in the water c co2 water was calculated using pco2 and h co2 in this study the k gas is derived from k 600 and a schmidt number of gas sc via the following equations raymond et al 2012 2 k g a s k 600 s c g a s 600 0 5 3 k 600 s v 2841 2 02 4 s c g a s a b t w c t w 2 d t w 3 where k600 can be simulated using channel slope s unitless and river velocity v m3 s sc is dependent on water temperature tw c the coefficients a b c and d for co2 ch4 and n2o are different and their assignment is adherent to the technique reported by raymond et al 2013 table s2

n2o emissions of each river segment were estimated as surface area a river multiplied by the corresponding areal fluxes f gas the ariver per river segment was estimated using the width w km and length l km w was calculated using river velocity v m3 s according to an empirical model raymond et al 2013 6 ln w 2 56 0 42 ln v during f gas estimation eq 1 the gas exchange velocity k gas of the individual river segment can be calculated according to eqs 2 5 considering that the ghg concentrations c gas water of most river segment are not measured we performed a monte carlo simulation to obtain the predicted cgas water and uncertainty range for each individual river segment normal distribution was assumed for c gas water the mean and standard deviation of c gas water measurements were separately calculated per stream order to be used as inputs for monte carlo simulation owing to the lack of c gas water measurements in stream order 10 i e downstream regions of the amazon river we assumed the mean and standard deviation of c gas water in stream order 10 to be equal to the values in stream order 9 for each stream order we performed the monte carlo simulation 1000 runs for each river segment to predict the mean and 95 confidence intervals as its uncertainties of c gas water subsequently combined with the k gas a river and c gas water the ghg emissions and uncertainties of each individual river segments were separately calculated finally we obtain global ghg evasion estimates by summing up the emissions from individual river segment n 8477883 2 4 ancillary datasets to examine the factors that could influence the dynamics of riverine ghg emission we recorded the geographic location longitude latitude and water chemistry information of each river sample site from corresponding literature or from relevant documents containing related information the water chemistry data included the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved oxygen do nitrates no3 and ammonium nh4 all ghg concentration or partial pressure measurements and related water chemistry data were sampled from the surface water layer in addition according to the geographic location air temperature and hydro geomorphological parameters used to calculate riverine ghg fluxes in eqs 1 6 were also collected the annual mean temperature 1961 2017 was obtained from the cru climate research unit http www cru uea ac uk data database the hydro geomorphological parameters including strahler stream order length of river reach segment and flow velocity were derived from the hydroriver dataset https www hydrosheds org the channel slope was calculated based on a 30 meter resolution dem data gdem global digital elevation model https earthdata nasa gov learn articles new aster gdem 2 4 statistical analysis the differences of ghg fluxes among different biome types and continents were examined using tamhane t2 tests at a significance level of 0 05 the bivariate correlations between ghg emissions and water chemistry data e g do doc and dic were examined using spearman s rank correlation test the tamhane t2 tests and spearman s rank correlations were performed using ibm spss software version 22 0 and the monte carlo simulations were performed using r software version 3 5 0 note that ghg fluxes and concentrations used in statistical analysis i e spatial variation analysis in fig 1 and fig 2 correlation analysis in fig 3 were directly compiled from published papers appendix b the simulated ghg fluxes via boundary layer method eq 1 and monte carlo analysis were used to estimate the global ghg emission 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of global riverine ghg emissions the global riverine ghg co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes exhibit high variability fig 1 the average global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes are 441 1 36 3 mg co2 m2 h 5 6 0 4 mg ch4 m2 h and 0 2 0 02 mg n2o m2 h respectively among the different types of biomes the highest co2 flux was found in tundra regions 1538 3 398 0 mg co2 m2 h the highest riverine ch4 and n2o flux occurred in tropics 10 3 1 3 mg ch4 m2 h and temperate 0 2 0 02 mg n2o m2 h regions separately the average riverine co2 fluxes originating from most continents were comparable but significantly lower than those from south america 1158 0 125 4 mg co2 m2 h fig 1 and table s1 in the appendix a furthermore high riverine ch4 fluxes emanated from south america 19 6 3 7 mg ch4 m2 h and africa 12 1 2 2 mg ch4 m2 h while high riverine n2o flux occurred in europe 0 3 0 09 mg n2o m2 h we found riverine ghg concentrations or partial pressure of co2 pco2 to be highest in low order streams and to decrease with increasing stream order fig 2a c this indicates that the ghg concentrations that occur in headwater streams are higher than those that occur in the mainstream or downstream of global river systems similar findings were reported in previous studies butman and raymond 2011 turner et al 2015 additionally compared with two other ghgs global riverine pco2 continuously declines from stream order 1 to 7 but inversely increased from steam order 7 to 9 fig 2a the reasons for higher ghg concentrations in the headwater streams compared with mainstream and pco2 rising again at stream orders 7 9 are discussed in detail later in this paper 3 2 environment factors with respect to riverine ghg emissions the results showed that riverine pco2 r 0 93 p 0 01 ch4 r 0 44 p 0 01 and n2o concentration r 0 16 p 0 01 are simultaneously negatively correlated with aquatic dissolved oxygen do level fig 3 and table s3 in appendix a the negative relationship between pco2 and do could be a result of the photosynthesis by phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton which convert co2 into carbohydrates and increase the level of oxygen li et al 2013 most of the ch4 was oxidized by methanotrophs with an increasing level of dissolved oxygen during its transportation from sediment to surface water stanley et al 2016 the reverse dependencies of riverine n2o concentration and do suggested that riverine n2o production is favored with anoxia or an anaerobic environment further analysis revealed that riverine n2o concentration exhibited a positive correlation with nitrate no3 content r 0 51 p 0 01 but had no significant correlation with ammonium nh4 content r 0 04 p 0 05 fig s3 and table s3 in appendix a this indicates that denitrification is a major pathway of global riverine n2o production we also observed that pco2 r 0 56 p 0 01 ch4 r 0 30 p 0 01 and n2o r 0 14 p 0 01 concentrations are positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon doc similarly pco2 r 0 20 p 0 01 and ch4 r 0 50 p 0 01 concentration were positively correlated with dissolved inorganic carbon dic content however n2o was negatively correlated with dic r 0 35 p 0 01 fig s3f in appendix a the availability of carbon influences substrate and energy input for heterotrophic organisms and therefore plays a vital role in riverine ghg emissions marescaux et al 2018 quick et al 2019 summarily high concentrations of doc and dic in addition to anoxia are conducive to riverine co2 and ch4 emissions high n2o emissions are relatively more dependent on denitrification i e elevated no3 and low do concentration fig s3 in appendix a 3 3 global estimations of ghg emissions from river ecosystems we combined the estimated river area database and compiled ghg flux data and then quantified the annual ghg emission from rivers globally table 1 our results revealed that global rivers emitted approximately 6 6 5 5 7 8 pg co2 29 5 19 6 37 3 tg ch4 and 0 6 0 2 0 9 tg n2o per year our estimation of riverine co2 emission is close to the recent estimate of 6 6 pg co2 yr by raymond et al 2013 despite the methods being somewhat different importantly in view of the paucity of direct co2 measurements they calculated pco2 from the ph alkalinity and water temperature this could however potentially cause bias instead all pco2 used in our estimation are in situ measurements collected from published research studies our estimation of riverine ch4 is significantly higher than the early estimate of 1 47 tg ch4 yr made by bastviken et al 2011 similar to a recent estimate of 26 8 tg ch4 yr obtained from a survey conducted by stanley et al 2016 these two previous estimates were used to divide the ch4 measurements into several groups according to the biome types or geographical distribution and then global riverine ch4 emission was calculated by multiplying average ch4 flux by the corresponding surface area of each group bastviken et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 however this method could potentially cause large uncertainties due to the absence of driving mechanisms and lack of representative samples for some categories i e fewer measurements from tropical rivers during the estimation of its ch4 flux bastviken et al 2011 moreover our estimation suggested that global rivers emit 0 60 tg n2o yr which is greater than the two estimations using the ipcc method 0 05 0 07 tg n2o yr hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2019 and of the same order of magnitude as a recent model simulation result 0 29 tg n2o yr yao et al 2020 the ipcc emission factor method was employed in most of the current riverine n2o emission estimation to multiply the din dissolved inorganic carbon input by the corresponding emission factor kroeze et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 however the theoretical principle of the ipcc method stating that riverine n2o emission has a strong linear correlation with din input is not supported by our database fig s3 in appendix a and is even contrary to the results obtained from some rivers rosamond et al 2012 generally river ecosystems are regarded as an important link between the terrestrial ecosystems and oceans just like the pipeline to continuously transport the terrestrially derived water carbon nitrogen and other matters downstream or into the estuary this study suggested that river ecosystems could be a major source of ghgs and did not merely play a pipeline role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles for example despite the surface area of global river ecosystems being relatively small allen and pavelsky 2018 approximately 0 58 of global nonglacial regions emits approximately 6 6 pg co2 equating to 1 8 pg c yr annually which is close to the ocean co2 sink 2 3 pg c yr or the terrestrial ecosystem co2 sink 2 5 2 8 pg c yr regnier et al 2013 in other words the co2 emission of river ecosystems almost offsets the carbon sink of the terrestrial ecosystem or ocean although its area is by far smaller than that of the other two ecosystems although the ch4 emission of global rivers 29 5 tg ch4 yr is slightly lower than the emissions of wetland 141 3 264 tg ch4 yr and lake ecosystems 71 6 tg ch4 yr deemer et al 2016 this finding also demonstrated the important contribution of river ecosystems to global ch4 emission with respect to global riverine n2o emissions 0 6 tg n2o yr it only equates to approximately 2 1 of global natural and anthropogenic emissions ciais and sabine 2013 however the n2o emission rate of the river ecosystem is very large especially in headwater streams billen et al 2020 for instance the average n2o flux of the headwater streams in our estimation reached 0 23 mg n2o m2 h which is approximately 20 33 times higher than the average soil n2o emission rate 0 006 0 01 mg n2o m2 h zhuang et al 2012 tian et al 2016 according to the 100 year time horizon global warming potentials gwp relative to co2 myhre et al 2013 we estimated that the global river ecosystems emit an equivalent of approximately 7 6 6 1 9 1 pg co2 every year moreover the headwater streams could largely contribute to global riverine ghg emissions for instance we found that the headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 contribute 72 3 75 5 and 77 2 of global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions table 2 respectively further analysis indicated that the transfer velocities of co2 ch4 and n2o decrease continuously with increasing stream orders fig s2 in appendix a by combining the variations of ghg concentrations along the stream order we deduced that high ghg flux in the headwater streams could be attributable to its large gas transfer velocity k ghgs and ghg concentration among the all stream order fig 2 and fig s2 in appendix a as discussed in later section in this paper 3 4 potential mechanism of high riverine ghg emissions from the headwater streams ecosystem one of the important findings is the decrease in global riverine ghg emissions in accordance with stream order table 2 based on a combination of our database and previous studies we assumed that the availability of carbon and nitrogen as well as dissolved oxygen do level could be one of the important factors that resulted in high ghg emissions in headwater streams in contrast to higher order streams i e downstream regions most of the headwater rivers originate from forested catchments glaciers permafrost peatlands or regions with a high density of agricultural cultivation which exhibit a high concentration of liable carbon and nitrogen pierre et al 2019 audet et al 2020 yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the high flow velocity in headwater streams could inhibit the growth of phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton and thereby constrain do production through photosynthesis li et al 2013 crawford et al 2016 accordingly compared with higher order streams headwater streams have higher doc dic and no3 concentrations but lower do levels fig s4 in appendix a previous studies have reported that riverine ghgs could be produced in the benthic zone inclusive of the hyporheic zone and water column or from direct ghgs input via groundwater hotchkiss et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 the heterotrophic respirations in benthic zone represent a major source of ghgs in the headwater streams quick et al 2019 marescaux et al 2020 which are abundant in doc dic and no3 as well as low levels of do in addition terrestrially dissolved ghg inputs via groundwater could be another important reason for the high ghg emission in headwater streams for example hotchkiss et al 2015 found that groundwater dissolved co2 input dominates the total co2 emission in small streams however its percentage declined with increasing stream size similarly other authors reported that dissolved ch4 and n2o along the groundwater flow path are important ghg sources in the headwater streams jones and mulholland 1998 garnier et al 2013 billen et al 2020 inversely from headwater to higher order streams the increasing discharge may dilute the content of terrestrial inputs i e doc dic no3 and dissolved ghgs and reduce the percentage of ghg emissions from the benthic zone and groundwater marescaux et al 2018 meanwhile declining flow velocity in higher order streams would be beneficial to do accumulation via photosynthesis of phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton but indirectly result in a decrease of ghgs global riverine pco2 continuously decreases from steam orders 1 to 7 but increases from stream order 7 to 9 fig 2a on one hand the increase of pco2 in higher order streams could be attributable to the decreasing do fig s4a in appendix a and a great number of highly concentrated carbon or even dissolved co2 input from the riparian wetlands or floodplains in the downstream regions of some large rivers such as the amazon and congo rivers mayorga et al 2005 borges et al 2019 on the other hand riverine ghg emissions are highly affected by anthropogenic perturbations e g agricultural and industrial effluents in some rivers or reaches e g downstream garnier et al 2009 external carbon input of agricultural and industrial effluents released from croplands and urban cities are often located in the downstream reaches fig s4 in appendix a which cause a huge organic carbon load and largely increases co2 emission in the downstream regions garnier et al 2013 billen et al 2020 marescaux et al 2020 3 5 response of riverine ghg emissions to climate warming and anthropogenic perturbation riverine ghg emissions are sensitive to global warming and anthropogenic perturbation regnier et al 2013 quick et al 2019 however the feedback mechanisms could be divergent in different stream orders the headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 an important component of the river ecosystem emit more than 70 of global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions which contribute significantly to global ghg emissions in particular co2 and ch4 recently an increasing number of studies has pointed out that global warming could accelerate the melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost bring abundant liable c and n to the adjacent headwater streams promoting heterotrophic respiration which results in ghg emissions in headwater streams hood et al 2015 knoblauch et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in addition intensive agricultural activities i e fertilization and land use change have deeply perturbed the regional c and n cycles thus directly or indirectly raising the ghg emissions in headwater streams garnier et al 2009 stanley et al 2016 importantly with the increase in carbon and nitrogen input together with the low do the contribution of groundwater to total riverine ghg emissions may correspondingly increase in the downstream regions i e higher order streams given the increase in densely populated areas more anthropogenic point sources i e industrial or resident sewage provide abundant liable c and n that feed the instream heterotrophic respiration marescaux et al 2018 additionally these point source effluents in the downstream regions are prone to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton and trigger eutrophication and promote ghg emissions hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 park et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 however some studies have reported that eutrophication may change water bodies into carbon sinks due to increased primary productivity yang et al 2008 pacheco et al 2014 moreover climate warming could also stimulate the processes related to the consumption of ghgs shelley et al 2015 comer warner et al 2018 nevertheless the identification of methods of quantifying the variations of riverine ghg emissions in response to global change climate change and increasing anthropogenic perturbation is still a huge challenge suggesting an important focal point in future research studies 3 6 limitations and uncertainties through a combination of the new approaches and databases we simultaneously estimated the co2 ch4 and n2o emissions from global river ecosystems however some limitations may cause uncertainties in our estimation for example being limited by the scarcity of ghg measurements we adopted the monte carlo method to randomly simulate ghg concentrations including partial pressure for each river reach segment according to the stream order it belonged to this method appears relatively simple conversely lauerwald et al 2015 have already simulated pco2 using some environmental variables r2 0 47 including population density slope gradient air temperature and terrestrial net primary productivity we also attempted to analyze the correlations between ghg concentration and some environmental indices e g map mean annual precipitation mat mean annual temperature npp net primary productivity ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and the altitude of in situ sampling fig s5 in appendix a unfortunately we found that the environmental factors mentioned above had no significant correlations with riverine ghg concentrations in other words additional efforts to identify the environmental factors that are more directly correlated with riverine ghg emissions are required in future studies the estimations of gas transfer velocity k and river surface area a river could be another source of uncertainty for instance during k value estimation the schmidt number exponent n in eq 2 is a dynamic variable from 0 4 to 0 8 with a changing gas liquid boundary condition jähne et al 1987 generally the n is considered to be 2 3 for a smooth surface and 0 5 for a wave covered water surface jähne and hauecker 1998 considering that a smooth surface is relatively rare in the air water interface of the river ecosystem n was usually assigned a value of 0 5 in many studies lauerwald et al 2012 raymond et al 2012 in fact the use of a constant value 0 5 for n at global scale may result in the underestimation of the k value and ghg fluxes recently esters et al 2017 pointed out that n can be directly estimated through water side friction velocity u w from the eddy covariance measurements presenting a new method of calculating k value more accurately furthermore our estimation of the river surface area is 0 56 m km2 which is lower than the recent estimate 0 77 m km2 obtaining the integrated remote sensing and geographical information systems gis technology and geo statistical model allen and pavelsky 2018 compared with their study our simulation of a river derived from dems could be theoretically underestimated due to several technology limitations for example although the resolution of river database 15 arc second hydrorives is relatively high at global scale lehner and grill 2013 it is difficult to adequately capture river morphology information for small rivers at regional scale in addition our method may underestimate the surface area at river regions with complex hydromorphology e g braided rivers lauerwald et al 2015 moreover the estimated ghg flux obtained using the boundary layer method in this study only represents the diffusive ghg emissions in fact aquatic ghgs could also be emitted through other pathways namely ebullition storage and plant mediated fluxes particularly ebullition flux previous studies found that ebullitive ch4 could contribute 23 51 of total ch4 emission in some rivers sawakuchi et al 2014 spawn et al 2015 this indicates that the riverine ch4 emissions in some regions may be underestimated due to the adoption of the boundary layer method however for riverine co2 and n2o many studies revealed that the proportion of these two ghgs via ebullition are extremely rare 1 of diffusive emission baulch et al 2011 spawn et al 2015 this means that our estimations of riverine co2 and n2o emissions are at least relatively convincing 4 conclusions this study reports headwater streams ecosystem as an important component of global ghg emissions high concentration nutrients doc dic and no3 input and a low dissolved oxygen level jointly stimulate the emission of ghg from headwater streams additionally the ghg emissions of global river ecosystems may have the potential to offset climatic benefits of terrestrial carbon or ocean sinks a possibility that has not been sufficiently incorporated into the earth system models future studies on riverine ghg emission estimations will benefit from a more comprehensive global database integrating riverine ghg measurements and related environmental information and a process based model to simulate the riverine ghg dynamics i e the oxidation or absorption of ghgs responding to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance declaration

17276,although an increasing number of reports have revealed that rivers are important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs the magnitude and underlying mechanism of riverine ghg emissions are still poorly understood the global extent of the headwater stream ecosystem may represent one of the important ghg emitters a global database of ghg measurements from 595 rivers indicated that the concentrations of riverine ghgs continually decrease as the stream order increases further analysis suggested that high ghg emissions from headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 could be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen massive terrestrially derived carbon nitrogen inputs and large gas exchange velocity through a combination of the predicted river surface areas and gas transfer velocities we estimated that globally the rivers emit approximately 6 6 5 5 7 8 pg co2 29 5 19 6 37 3 tg ch4 and 0 6 0 2 0 9 tg n2o per year and totally emit 7 6 6 1 9 1 co2 equivalent into atmosphere per year the headwater streams contribute 72 3 75 5 and 77 2 of the global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions respectively this study presents a systematic estimation of ghg emissions from river ecosystems worldwide and highlights the dominant role played by headwater streams in ghg evasions from global rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words riverine ghg emissions stream order headwater stream oxygen level carbon nitrogen input 1 introduction the anthropogenic disturbance of carbon and nitrogen cycles globally has resulted in the rapid increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations especially with respect to carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o and triggered a series of environmental issues such as global warming ciais and sabine 2013 the accurate quantification of ghg sources and sinks has been determined to be a critical task for the current identification of potential ways of mitigating and managing global warming griscom et al 2017 walsh et al 2017 most conventional investigations regarded global river ecosystems as considerable sinks of terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n which may be transported into the adjacent oceans by the river network boyer et al 2006 regnier et al 2013 li et al 2017 however increasing evidence indicates that the global river ecosystem is a vital source of ghg despite its smaller surface area compared to other ecosystems terrestrial and marine ecosystems cole et al 2007 bastviken et al 2011 quick et al 2019 the magnitude and spatial variations of riverine ghg emissions have become one of the focal points of current studies but it unfortunately continue to be shrouded in uncertainty raymond et al 2013 hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 over the past number of decades many field investigations and dataset compilations have been aimed at quantifying the contribution of riverine ghg emissions to the global ghg budgets and exploring the spatial variations of different ghg components bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 for instance raymond et al 2013 employed new approaches toward the individual simulation of the surface area gas transfer velocity and co2 partial pressure pco2 for global rivers and eventually estimated that global river ecosystems emit approximately 1 8 pg c into the atmosphere every year another global synthesis suggested that most river ecosystems are supersaturated with ch4 and release approximately 26 8 tg ch4 into the atmosphere every year stanley et al 2016 for n2o a recent study implemented the ipcc method whereby the n2o emission rate was calculated by multiplying the anthropogenic n loading by the corresponding emission factor and estimated the total n2o emission from global rivers to be 46 5 55 5 gg n2o yr hu et al 2016 generally these studies systematically evaluated the magnitude and spatial patterns of riverine ghg emissions and certainly established the critical contribution of river systems to global ghg emissions however large uncertainties with respect to current global estimations have persisted perhaps as a result of methodology bias data scarcity and inadequate understanding of the environmental factors driving riverine ghg emissions at a global scale one of the challenges of global riverine ghg estimation is the identification of key environmental factors that influence the riverine ghg emissions on a large scale the biological chemical and physical processes of each type of ghg co2 ch4 and n2o varied and were thus driven by diverse environmental factors a field survey exceeding eight years in quebec suggested a strong correlation between terrestrial dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and aquatic co2 emission lapierre et al 2013 in addition to the terrestrial carbon input other environment factors such as annual precipitation flow velocity and wind speed may also be important factors affecting the riverine co2 emissions butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 li et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that riverine ch4 is primarily formed in anaerobic sediment by methanogens and quickly oxidized by methanotrophs bacteria before being released into the atmosphere comer warner et al 2018 borges et al 2019 thus sediment carbon storage and dissolved oxygen do concentration play pivotal roles in the production and consumption of riverine ch4 in addition the riverine ch4 emission may be affected by other factors e g water sediment temperature trophic status and wind speed guérin and abril 2007 stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2018 compared with co2 and ch4 riverine n2o emission is more correlated with the anthropogenic n input including agricultural n fertilizer or industrial nitrogen rich wastewater yu et al 2013 turner et al 2015 meanwhile riverine n2o as a byproduct of two microbial processes nitrification nh4 to no3 and denitrification no3 to n2o and finally n2 is affected by other environmental conditions such as doc ph and do rosamond et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 the key factors controlling riverine ghg emission could vary depending on the study regions or scales for example hotchkiss et al 2015 found that riverine co2 emissions are dominantly influenced by terrestrially derived co2 inputs in small rivers but are gradually more affected by aquatic internal metabolisms in the wake of increasing river sizes similar findings for riverine ch4 and n2o emissions have been reported in previous studies marzadri et al 2017 borges et al 2019 the environmental factors that control the degassing of riverine ghgs continue to be complex and unclear worldwide interestingly some recent studies have reported that the magnitude of riverine ghg emissions could be correlated with stream order butman raymond 2014 determined the identical reverse dependency of riverine pco2 and stream order according to a field measurements database usgs the united states geological survey of the 4 138 hydrological stations in the united states based on a long term 2010 2017 field survey marescaux et al 2018 found significant variations in riverine ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions among the different stream orders of seine river similarly the dependencies of ghg fluxes and stream order were observed in the streams of the us corn belt and congo river network turner et al 2015 borges et al 2019 however the variations of riverine ghg emissions with increasing stream order at the global scale remain unknown these studies may offer some theoretical insight thus allowing for the simultaneous quantification of the global riverine ghg emissions based on the possible identification of negative or positive correlations between riverine ghg emissions and stream orders at the global scale in this study we aimed to quantify the magnitude and spatial variations of global riverine ghg emissions as well as discuss the underlying mechanisms we developed a global database recording of ghg measurement from 642 rivers and explored the spatial patterns of global riverine ghg emissions and their relationship with environmental factors i e dissolved oxygen doc etc we also aimed to provide a new estimation of ghg emissions from global rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 data compilation we compiled ghg emission observations including concentration partial pressure and flux of global river ecosystems i e streams rivers from studies published during 1974 2019 by searching keywords including co2 ch4 n2o and either river or stream using google scholar web of science and cnki database china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net as a result this global database consists of 5948 ecosystem ghg measurements of 595 rivers from 208 published literatures that recorded riverine ghg emission data 2017 1978 2856 for number of co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes and n 2390 3169 2656 for number of co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations respectively fig s1 in appendix a to reduce potential bias and uncertainties we performed some pretreatment during the processes of data compilation for example to simplify database management the units of all ghg fluxes and concentration data were unified e g μatm for pco2 mg ch4 l and mg n2o l for concentration of ch4 and n2o respectively mg co2 m2 h mg ch4 m2 h and mg n2o m2 h for flux of riverine co2 ch4 and n2o respectively besides we calculated the average value of ghg fluxes and concentration for the same river reach reported in multiple studies meanwhile to explore the spatial variations of riverine ghg emissions we also divided the ghg measurements into different groups according to the biome regions tundra boreal temperate tropical and others continents and stream order they were located in the biome class was modified and revised from the köppen geiger climate classification map kottek et al 2006 whereby the others represent the biomes of desert rock ice and mangrove the global rivers were categorized using the strahler stream order systems order 1 represented the headwater streams order 2 represented the bigger streams formed when the 1st order streams meet and when the 2nd order streams come together they form the 3rd order streams etc 2 2 estimations of global riverine ghg fluxes we upscaled the in situ riverine ghg measurements to global scale by multiplying the gas fluxes co2 ch4 and n2o with the corresponding river surface areas the gas fluxes mmol gas m2 day were calculated via the boundary layer method raymond et al 2013 according to gas exchange velocity k gas and gases concentration gradient between water c gas water mmol gas l and atmospheric interface c gas air as follows 1 f g a s k g a s c g a s w a t e r p g a s a i r h g a s where p gas air represents the partial pressures of gas in the atmosphere and are set as 390 1 8 and 0 32 ppm 10 3 atm for co2 ch4 and n2o respectively the h gas mol l atm is the henry s solubility constant of gas reported by sander 2015 note that co2 concentration in the water c co2 water was calculated using pco2 and h co2 in this study the k gas is derived from k 600 and a schmidt number of gas sc via the following equations raymond et al 2012 2 k g a s k 600 s c g a s 600 0 5 3 k 600 s v 2841 2 02 4 s c g a s a b t w c t w 2 d t w 3 where k600 can be simulated using channel slope s unitless and river velocity v m3 s sc is dependent on water temperature tw c the coefficients a b c and d for co2 ch4 and n2o are different and their assignment is adherent to the technique reported by raymond et al 2013 table s2 in appendix a a nonlinear regression model was adopted to simulate tw using air temperature ta mohseni et al 1998 5 t w 0 8 26 2 0 8 1 exp 0 18 13 3 t a 2 3 upscaling and uncertainties the co2 ch4 and n2o emissions of each river segment were estimated as surface area a river multiplied by the corresponding areal fluxes f gas the ariver per river segment was estimated using the width w km and length l km w was calculated using river velocity v m3 s according to an empirical model raymond et al 2013 6 ln w 2 56 0 42 ln v during f gas estimation eq 1 the gas exchange velocity k gas of the individual river segment can be calculated according to eqs 2 5 considering that the ghg concentrations c gas water of most river segment are not measured we performed a monte carlo simulation to obtain the predicted cgas water and uncertainty range for each individual river segment normal distribution was assumed for c gas water the mean and standard deviation of c gas water measurements were separately calculated per stream order to be used as inputs for monte carlo simulation owing to the lack of c gas water measurements in stream order 10 i e downstream regions of the amazon river we assumed the mean and standard deviation of c gas water in stream order 10 to be equal to the values in stream order 9 for each stream order we performed the monte carlo simulation 1000 runs for each river segment to predict the mean and 95 confidence intervals as its uncertainties of c gas water subsequently combined with the k gas a river and c gas water the ghg emissions and uncertainties of each individual river segments were separately calculated finally we obtain global ghg evasion estimates by summing up the emissions from individual river segment n 8477883 2 4 ancillary datasets to examine the factors that could influence the dynamics of riverine ghg emission we recorded the geographic location longitude latitude and water chemistry information of each river sample site from corresponding literature or from relevant documents containing related information the water chemistry data included the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved oxygen do nitrates no3 and ammonium nh4 all ghg concentration or partial pressure measurements and related water chemistry data were sampled from the surface water layer in addition according to the geographic location air temperature and hydro geomorphological parameters used to calculate riverine ghg fluxes in eqs 1 6 were also collected the annual mean temperature 1961 2017 was obtained from the cru climate research unit http www cru uea ac uk data database the hydro geomorphological parameters including strahler stream order length of river reach segment and flow velocity were derived from the hydroriver dataset https www hydrosheds org the channel slope was calculated based on a 30 meter resolution dem data gdem global digital elevation model https earthdata nasa gov learn articles new aster gdem 2 4 statistical analysis the differences of ghg fluxes among different biome types and continents were examined using tamhane t2 tests at a significance level of 0 05 the bivariate correlations between ghg emissions and water chemistry data e g do doc and dic were examined using spearman s rank correlation test the tamhane t2 tests and spearman s rank correlations were performed using ibm spss software version 22 0 and the monte carlo simulations were performed using r software version 3 5 0 note that ghg fluxes and concentrations used in statistical analysis i e spatial variation analysis in fig 1 and fig 2 correlation analysis in fig 3 were directly compiled from published papers appendix b the simulated ghg fluxes via boundary layer method eq 1 and monte carlo analysis were used to estimate the global ghg emission 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of global riverine ghg emissions the global riverine ghg co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes exhibit high variability fig 1 the average global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes are 441 1 36 3 mg co2 m2 h 5 6 0 4 mg ch4 m2 h and 0 2 0 02 mg n2o m2 h respectively among the different types of biomes the highest co2 flux was found in tundra regions 1538 3 398 0 mg co2 m2 h the highest riverine ch4 and n2o flux occurred in tropics 10 3 1 3 mg ch4 m2 h and temperate 0 2 0 02 mg n2o m2 h regions separately the average riverine co2 fluxes originating from most continents were comparable but significantly lower than those from south america 1158 0 125 4 mg co2 m2 h fig 1 and table s1 in the appendix a furthermore high riverine ch4 fluxes emanated from south america 19 6 3 7 mg ch4 m2 h and africa 12 1 2 2 mg ch4 m2 h while high riverine n2o flux occurred in europe 0 3 0 09 mg n2o m2 h we found riverine ghg concentrations or partial pressure of co2 pco2 to be highest in low order streams and to decrease with increasing stream order fig 2a c this indicates that the ghg concentrations that occur in headwater streams are higher than those that occur in the mainstream or downstream of global river systems similar findings were reported in previous studies butman and raymond 2011 turner et al 2015 additionally compared with two other ghgs global riverine pco2 continuously declines from stream order 1 to 7 but inversely increased from steam order 7 to 9 fig 2a the reasons for higher ghg concentrations in the headwater streams compared with mainstream and pco2 rising again at stream orders 7 9 are discussed in detail later in this paper 3 2 environment factors with respect to riverine ghg emissions the results showed that riverine pco2 r 0 93 p 0 01 ch4 r 0 44 p 0 01 and n2o concentration r 0 16 p 0 01 are simultaneously negatively correlated with aquatic dissolved oxygen do level fig 3 and table s3 in appendix a the negative relationship between pco2 and do could be a result of the photosynthesis by phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton which convert co2 into carbohydrates and increase the level of oxygen li et al 2013 most of the ch4 was oxidized by methanotrophs with an increasing level of dissolved oxygen during its transportation from sediment to surface water stanley et al 2016 the reverse dependencies of riverine n2o concentration and do suggested that riverine n2o production is favored with anoxia or an anaerobic environment further analysis revealed that riverine n2o concentration exhibited a positive correlation with nitrate no3 content r 0 51 p 0 01 but had no significant correlation with ammonium nh4 content r 0 04 p 0 05 fig s3 and table s3 in appendix a this indicates that denitrification is a major pathway of global riverine n2o production we also observed that pco2 r 0 56 p 0 01 ch4 r 0 30 p 0 01 and n2o r 0 14 p 0 01 concentrations are positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon doc similarly pco2 r 0 20 p 0 01 and ch4 r 0 50 p 0 01 concentration were positively correlated with dissolved inorganic carbon dic content however n2o was negatively correlated with dic r 0 35 p 0 01 fig s3f in appendix a the availability of carbon influences substrate and energy input for heterotrophic organisms and therefore plays a vital role in riverine ghg emissions marescaux et al 2018 quick et al 2019 summarily high concentrations of doc and dic in addition to anoxia are conducive to riverine co2 and ch4 emissions high n2o emissions are relatively more dependent on denitrification i e elevated no3 and low do concentration fig s3 in appendix a 3 3 global estimations of ghg emissions from river ecosystems we combined the estimated river area database and compiled ghg flux data and then quantified the annual ghg emission from rivers globally table 1 our results revealed that global rivers emitted approximately 6 6 5 5 7 8 pg co2 29 5 19 6 37 3 tg ch4 and 0 6 0 2 0 9 tg n2o per year our estimation of riverine co2 emission is close to the recent estimate of 6 6 pg co2 yr by raymond et al 2013 despite the methods being somewhat different importantly in view of the paucity of direct co2 measurements they calculated pco2 from the ph alkalinity and water temperature this could however potentially cause bias instead all pco2 used in our estimation are in situ measurements collected from published research studies our estimation of riverine ch4 is significantly higher than the early estimate of 1 47 tg ch4 yr made by bastviken et al 2011 similar to a recent estimate of 26 8 tg ch4 yr obtained from a survey conducted by stanley et al 2016 these two previous estimates were used to divide the ch4 measurements into several groups according to the biome types or geographical distribution and then global riverine ch4 emission was calculated by multiplying average ch4 flux by the corresponding surface area of each group bastviken et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 however this method could potentially cause large uncertainties due to the absence of driving mechanisms and lack of representative samples for some categories i e fewer measurements from tropical rivers during the estimation of its ch4 flux bastviken et al 2011 moreover our estimation suggested that global rivers emit 0 60 tg n2o yr which is greater than the two estimations using the ipcc method 0 05 0 07 tg n2o yr hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2019 and of the same order of magnitude as a recent model simulation result 0 29 tg n2o yr yao et al 2020 the ipcc emission factor method was employed in most of the current riverine n2o emission estimation to multiply the din dissolved inorganic carbon input by the corresponding emission factor kroeze et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 however the theoretical principle of the ipcc method stating that riverine n2o emission has a strong linear correlation with din input is not supported by our database fig s3 in appendix a and is even contrary to the results obtained from some rivers rosamond et al 2012 generally river ecosystems are regarded as an important link between the terrestrial ecosystems and oceans just like the pipeline to continuously transport the terrestrially derived water carbon nitrogen and other matters downstream or into the estuary this study suggested that river ecosystems could be a major source of ghgs and did not merely play a pipeline role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles for example despite the surface area of global river ecosystems being relatively small allen and pavelsky 2018 approximately 0 58 of global nonglacial regions emits approximately 6 6 pg co2 equating to 1 8 pg c yr annually which is close to the ocean co2 sink 2 3 pg c yr or the terrestrial ecosystem co2 sink 2 5 2 8 pg c yr regnier et al 2013 in other words the co2 emission of river ecosystems almost offsets the carbon sink of the terrestrial ecosystem or ocean although its area is by far smaller than that of the other two ecosystems although the ch4 emission of global rivers 29 5 tg ch4 yr is slightly lower than the emissions of wetland 141 3 264 tg ch4 yr and lake ecosystems 71 6 tg ch4 yr deemer et al 2016 this finding also demonstrated the important contribution of river ecosystems to global ch4 emission with respect to global riverine n2o emissions 0 6 tg n2o yr it only equates to approximately 2 1 of global natural and anthropogenic emissions ciais and sabine 2013 however the n2o emission rate of the river ecosystem is very large especially in headwater streams billen et al 2020 for instance the average n2o flux of the headwater streams in our estimation reached 0 23 mg n2o m2 h which is approximately 20 33 times higher than the average soil n2o emission rate 0 006 0 01 mg n2o m2 h zhuang et al 2012 tian et al 2016 according to the 100 year time horizon global warming potentials gwp relative to co2 myhre et al 2013 we estimated that the global river ecosystems emit an equivalent of approximately 7 6 6 1 9 1 pg co2 every year moreover the headwater streams could largely contribute to global riverine ghg emissions for instance we found that the headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 contribute 72 3 75 5 and 77 2 of global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions table 2 respectively further analysis indicated that the transfer velocities of co2 ch4 and n2o decrease continuously with increasing stream orders fig s2 in appendix a by combining the variations of ghg concentrations along the stream order we deduced that high ghg flux in the headwater streams could be attributable to its large gas transfer velocity k ghgs and ghg concentration among the all stream order fig 2 and fig s2 in appendix a as discussed in later section in this paper 3 4 potential mechanism of high riverine ghg emissions from the headwater streams ecosystem one of the important findings is the decrease in global riverine ghg emissions in accordance with stream order table 2 based on a combination of our database and previous studies we assumed that the availability of carbon and nitrogen as well as dissolved oxygen do level could be one of the important factors that resulted in high ghg emissions in headwater streams in contrast to higher order streams i e downstream regions most of the headwater rivers originate from forested catchments glaciers permafrost peatlands or regions with a high density of agricultural cultivation which exhibit a high concentration of liable carbon and nitrogen pierre et al 2019 audet et al 2020 yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the high flow velocity in headwater streams could inhibit the growth of phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton and thereby constrain do production through photosynthesis li et al 2013 crawford et al 2016 accordingly compared with higher order streams headwater streams have higher doc dic and no3 concentrations but lower do levels fig s4 in appendix a previous studies have reported that riverine ghgs could be produced in the benthic zone inclusive of the hyporheic zone and water column or from direct ghgs input via groundwater hotchkiss et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 the heterotrophic respirations in benthic zone represent a major source of ghgs in the headwater streams quick et al 2019 marescaux et al 2020 which are abundant in doc dic and no3 as well as low levels of do in addition terrestrially dissolved ghg inputs via groundwater could be another important reason for the high ghg emission in headwater streams for example hotchkiss et al 2015 found that groundwater dissolved co2 input dominates the total co2 emission in small streams however its percentage declined with increasing stream size similarly other authors reported that dissolved ch4 and n2o along the groundwater flow path are important ghg sources in the headwater streams jones and mulholland 1998 garnier et al 2013 billen et al 2020 inversely from headwater to higher order streams the increasing discharge may dilute the content of terrestrial inputs i e doc dic no3 and dissolved ghgs and reduce the percentage of ghg emissions from the benthic zone and groundwater marescaux et al 2018 meanwhile declining flow velocity in higher order streams would be beneficial to do accumulation via photosynthesis of phytoplankton macrophytes or periphyton but indirectly result in a decrease of ghgs global riverine pco2 continuously decreases from steam orders 1 to 7 but increases from stream order 7 to 9 fig 2a on one hand the increase of pco2 in higher order streams could be attributable to the decreasing do fig s4a in appendix a and a great number of highly concentrated carbon or even dissolved co2 input from the riparian wetlands or floodplains in the downstream regions of some large rivers such as the amazon and congo rivers mayorga et al 2005 borges et al 2019 on the other hand riverine ghg emissions are highly affected by anthropogenic perturbations e g agricultural and industrial effluents in some rivers or reaches e g downstream garnier et al 2009 external carbon input of agricultural and industrial effluents released from croplands and urban cities are often located in the downstream reaches fig s4 in appendix a which cause a huge organic carbon load and largely increases co2 emission in the downstream regions garnier et al 2013 billen et al 2020 marescaux et al 2020 3 5 response of riverine ghg emissions to climate warming and anthropogenic perturbation riverine ghg emissions are sensitive to global warming and anthropogenic perturbation regnier et al 2013 quick et al 2019 however the feedback mechanisms could be divergent in different stream orders the headwater streams strahler stream orders of 1 to 3 an important component of the river ecosystem emit more than 70 of global riverine co2 ch4 and n2o emissions which contribute significantly to global ghg emissions in particular co2 and ch4 recently an increasing number of studies has pointed out that global warming could accelerate the melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost bring abundant liable c and n to the adjacent headwater streams promoting heterotrophic respiration which results in ghg emissions in headwater streams hood et al 2015 knoblauch et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in addition intensive agricultural activities i e fertilization and land use change have deeply perturbed the regional c and n cycles thus directly or indirectly raising the ghg emissions in headwater streams garnier et al 2009 stanley et al 2016 importantly with the increase in carbon and nitrogen input together with the low do the contribution of groundwater to total riverine ghg emissions may correspondingly increase in the downstream regions i e higher order streams given the increase in densely populated areas more anthropogenic point sources i e industrial or resident sewage provide abundant liable c and n that feed the instream heterotrophic respiration marescaux et al 2018 additionally these point source effluents in the downstream regions are prone to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton and trigger eutrophication and promote ghg emissions hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 park et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 however some studies have reported that eutrophication may change water bodies into carbon sinks due to increased primary productivity yang et al 2008 pacheco et al 2014 moreover climate warming could also stimulate the processes related to the consumption of ghgs shelley et al 2015 comer warner et al 2018 nevertheless the identification of methods of quantifying the variations of riverine ghg emissions in response to global change climate change and increasing anthropogenic perturbation is still a huge challenge suggesting an important focal point in future research studies 3 6 limitations and uncertainties through a combination of the new approaches and databases we simultaneously estimated the co2 ch4 and n2o emissions from global river ecosystems however some limitations may cause uncertainties in our estimation for example being limited by the scarcity of ghg measurements we adopted the monte carlo method to randomly simulate ghg concentrations including partial pressure for each river reach segment according to the stream order it belonged to this method appears relatively simple conversely lauerwald et al 2015 have already simulated pco2 using some environmental variables r2 0 47 including population density slope gradient air temperature and terrestrial net primary productivity we also attempted to analyze the correlations between ghg concentration and some environmental indices e g map mean annual precipitation mat mean annual temperature npp net primary productivity ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and the altitude of in situ sampling fig s5 in appendix a unfortunately we found that the environmental factors mentioned above had no significant correlations with riverine ghg concentrations in other words additional efforts to identify the environmental factors that are more directly correlated with riverine ghg emissions are required in future studies the estimations of gas transfer velocity k and river surface area a river could be another source of uncertainty for instance during k value estimation the schmidt number exponent n in eq 2 is a dynamic variable from 0 4 to 0 8 with a changing gas liquid boundary condition jähne et al 1987 generally the n is considered to be 2 3 for a smooth surface and 0 5 for a wave covered water surface jähne and hauecker 1998 considering that a smooth surface is relatively rare in the air water interface of the river ecosystem n was usually assigned a value of 0 5 in many studies lauerwald et al 2012 raymond et al 2012 in fact the use of a constant value 0 5 for n at global scale may result in the underestimation of the k value and ghg fluxes recently esters et al 2017 pointed out that n can be directly estimated through water side friction velocity u w from the eddy covariance measurements presenting a new method of calculating k value more accurately furthermore our estimation of the river surface area is 0 56 m km2 which is lower than the recent estimate 0 77 m km2 obtaining the integrated remote sensing and geographical information systems gis technology and geo statistical model allen and pavelsky 2018 compared with their study our simulation of a river derived from dems could be theoretically underestimated due to several technology limitations for example although the resolution of river database 15 arc second hydrorives is relatively high at global scale lehner and grill 2013 it is difficult to adequately capture river morphology information for small rivers at regional scale in addition our method may underestimate the surface area at river regions with complex hydromorphology e g braided rivers lauerwald et al 2015 moreover the estimated ghg flux obtained using the boundary layer method in this study only represents the diffusive ghg emissions in fact aquatic ghgs could also be emitted through other pathways namely ebullition storage and plant mediated fluxes particularly ebullition flux previous studies found that ebullitive ch4 could contribute 23 51 of total ch4 emission in some rivers sawakuchi et al 2014 spawn et al 2015 this indicates that the riverine ch4 emissions in some regions may be underestimated due to the adoption of the boundary layer method however for riverine co2 and n2o many studies revealed that the proportion of these two ghgs via ebullition are extremely rare 1 of diffusive emission baulch et al 2011 spawn et al 2015 this means that our estimations of riverine co2 and n2o emissions are at least relatively convincing 4 conclusions this study reports headwater streams ecosystem as an important component of global ghg emissions high concentration nutrients doc dic and no3 input and a low dissolved oxygen level jointly stimulate the emission of ghg from headwater streams additionally the ghg emissions of global river ecosystems may have the potential to offset climatic benefits of terrestrial carbon or ocean sinks a possibility that has not been sufficiently incorporated into the earth system models future studies on riverine ghg emission estimations will benefit from a more comprehensive global database integrating riverine ghg measurements and related environmental information and a process based model to simulate the riverine ghg dynamics i e the oxidation or absorption of ghgs responding to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance declaration

17277,biocrust mediated in situ bioremediation could be an alternative strategy to mitigate metal loid pollution in aquatic habitats to better understand the roles of biocrusts in regulating the fate of metal loid s we examined the morphology composition and structure of biological aqua crusts bac developed in the mine drainage of a representative pb zn tailing pond and tested their effectiveness for immobilizing typical metal loid s unlike terrestrial biocrusts bac results from an assembly of compounds produced by the strong microbial activity and mineral compounds present in the aquatic

immobilized metal loid s were present as the highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction adsorption on the well distributed micro particles of the clay minerals e g kaolinite and the organic matters 2 0 2 7 wt were found to be the major mechanisms for bac to bind metal cations whereas adsorption and coprecipitation on fe mn oxide e g feooh was proposed to be the dominant pathway for accumulating metal loid s especially as the decrease in aqueous concentrations of the metal loid s along the drainage could be attributed in part to the scavenging effects of the bac these findings therefore provide new insights into the possible and efficient strategy for metal loid removal from water bodies and highlighted the important role of bac as a nature based solution to benefit the

plant uptake microbial immobilization and substrate adsorption eggermont et al 2015 keesstra et al 2018 rai 2008 sheoran and sheoran 2006 singh and chakraborty 2020 however it was difficult to build an ecologically sustainable wetland in a mine tailing pond due to the poor aggregate structure excess metal loid s and extreme nutrient deficiency for plant growth cheng et al 2002 li and huang 2014 mays and edwards 2001 rai 2008 wieder 1989 it is therefore essential to improve current practices and find more efficient nbs to sustainably immobilize metal loid s in mine drainage a biological crust

a pb zn mining area cabala et al found that the biocrust developed from the top layer of sandy clayey soils poor in water could concentrate pb and zn in the form of secondary labile minerals cabala et al 2010 our recent field study on a tailing wetland impacted by pb zn tailings revealed that many crustal like substances with cyanobacteria as one of the dominant species at the phylum level were present in the mine drainage and were able to enrich pb 0 42 g kg 1 and as 23 7 g kg 1 while these studies have demonstrated the potentials of biocrusts for accumulating metal loid s a systematic investigation has been lacking on the effectiveness of biocrusts for immobilizing mixtures of metal loid s e g pb cd and as in mine drainages moreover little is known on the interactions between the various components of biocrusts and the metal loid s due to the distinct habitats biocrusts in mine drainage are markedly different in the morphology structure and composition from those formed in

cyanobacteria can bind pb and cd through their organic functional groups mota et al 2016 however the interactions between metal loid s and biocrusts have not been well understood because biocrust are composed of both active inorganic and organic components one would expect enhanced interactions with the target metal loid s due to concurrent biomineralization and multi mechanism adsorption on both the clay minerals and organic functional groups derived from microorganisms building upon our prior field investigation the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the ability of biocrusts to immobilize metal loid s pb cd zn and as in a representative mine drainage 2 examine the morphology composition structure speciation concentration and spatial variation of the metal loid s in the biocrust and 3 determine the positive influence of the biocrust treatment on the improvement of water quality in the mine drainage this research proposed to introduce a new concept of biological aqua crust which is the result of interactions between compounds produced by an intense microbial activity and inorganic compounds present in aquatic environments such as mine drainage the findings of this work should improve our understanding of the roles of biocrusts in immobilization of metal loid s in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site samples of biocrust and water were collected from the wetland downstream of an abandoned pb zn tailing pond 24 22 55 n 116 12 49 e in meizhou guangdong province china fig s1 huang et al 2018b wang et al 2020 the annual average temperature is 21 7 c and precipitation is 1473 mm in the area this tailing pond was operated from 1975 to 1992 when it was abandoned in july 2013 typhoon suli destroyed the tailing dam with heavy rains which led to the filling of tens of thousand tons of tailing sands into the downstream reservoir area and a tailing wetland subsequently emerged liang et al 2017 to mitigate the metal loid pollution brought by the mine tailing a constructed wetland was built in may 2017 and has been used since then four dominant plant species namely typha latifolia equisetum ramosissimum fimbristylis dichotoma and miscanthus floridulus were widely distributed in the wetland contributing to a vegetation coverage of about 60 of the land in november 2017 biocrusts were first found in the stream with mine drainage running through tailing wetland fig 1 2 2 sample collection and preparations from upstream inlet to downstream outlet in the wetland fig s1 three sites were selected for biocrust sampling i e b0 control source tailing materials including unstable physical crust b1 upstream biocrust and b2 downstream biocrust to assess the purification capacity of the biocrust water mine

electron bse and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the freeze dried samples were coated with carbon to improve the conductivity for sem analysis and embedded in epoxy resin and then ultrathin sectioned for tem analysis in addition the biocrusts and particles were powdered using an agate mortar to characterize the crystalline structures and compositions via x ray diffraction xrd analysis ultima iv xrd rigaku japan which was operated in the 2θ range of 3 90 and a step rate of 2 min 1 40 kv 40 ma the xrd spectra were then analyzed using the mid jade version 6 5 subsequently fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermofisher usa was employed to identify the surface functional groups of the powder samples the ftir spectra were obtained in the wavenumber range of 4000 and 400 cm 1 prior to the ftir analysis the solid samples were compressed into kbr pellets 1 100 w w in addition the bet specific surface area was determined using a bet surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2460 usa by n2 adsorption at 77 k finally the chemical composition of the surface of the biocrust was examined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific the binding energies were scaled in reference to the surface contamination of c 1s peak 284 8 ev and the deconvolution of xps spectra was conducted by the casaxps software version 2 3 13 2 4 basic chemical properties the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the biocrusts were measured mass ratio of biocrust to water 1 5 by a ph meter mettler toledo switzerland and a conductivity meter djs 1d 308a inesa china respectively total organic carbon toc were measured following the method modified from mingorance et al 2007 in brief samples 0 50 g k2cr2o7 5 ml 0 27 mol l 1 and h2so4 7 5 ml 18 4 mol l 1 were mixed and then kept at 100 for 30 min the solutions were adjusted to a constant volume with deionized water and settle for 24 hours prior to the absorbance measurement using spectrophotometer jinghua uv1900 china at 590 nm glucose was used to prepare standard calibration with the same procedure as the samples to analyze the metal loid contents biocrust samples were digested with aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 using a microwave digestion system mars6 cem usa the mixture was then filtered through with 0 45 μm fiber membranes and filtrate was analyzed for the total metal loid s by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300dv perkin elmer usa to ensure the accuracy of the methods reagent blanks external standard solutions and standard reference materials gbw07405 gbw07443 were used in the analysis the detection limits of icp oes were 1 10 μg l 1 for metal loid s e g cd as pb and zn metal loid readings were obtained from replicate analyses with a variation of 5 2 5 metal loid speciation metal loid s i e cd as zn pb fe and mn which are commonly found in biocrusts were selected for speciation analysis following the method of stewart et al 2015 with modifications briefly 0 50 g freeze dried sample was added to a centrifuge tubes containing 50 ml deionized water the samples were resuspended by vortex for 30 s the suspensions were then fractionated by centrifugation at 4750 rpm for 10 min the supernatant i e supernatant 1 containing the metal loid s bound to water soluble colloids or macromolecules was collected for analysis by direct digestion with the aqua regia approach the precipitation was resuspended using edta ph 8 0 4 mmol l 1 for 10 min after centrifugation 4750 rpm 10 min the edta exchangeable supernatant 2 was collected to obtain the metal loid s closely related to the capsular eps meylan et al 2003 subsequently the residue was further washed with a solution of 3 n mops ph 7 5 10 mmol l 1 to separate the metal loid s directly sorbed to the cell surface and residual metal edta complexes upon the same centrifugation procedure the new supernatant was collected into supernatant 2 and then digested with aqua regia the metal loid s in the residual corresponded to the non edta exchangeable fraction the metal loid concentrations in the supernatants 1 and 2 respectively for eps bound fraction and sorbed fraction were analyzed using icp oes and icp ms nexion 350d perkin elmer usa to ensure the accuracy of icp ms analysis an indium standard solution 50 μg l 1 was selected as the internal standard the metal loid concentrations in the non edta exchangeable fraction were calculated by deducting the concentrations of the eps bound fraction and sorbed fraction from the total concentration 2 6 water quality analysis upon filtration with 0 45 μm fiber membranes the water mine drainage samples were analyzed for common anions e g so4 2 and no3 by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 usa and toc using a toc analyzer vario toc elementar germany in addition the ph eh and conductivity were measured using a ph meter and a conductivity meter the zeta potential was determined using a particle sizer and zeta potential analyzer nanobrook omni brookhaven usa the metal cations and as were analyzed by the icp oes in addition the bioconcentration factor bcf was used to characterize the capacity of metal loid accumulation in the biocrust bcf was calculated as the ratio of the concentration of metal loid s in the biocrust mg kg 1 to the concentration of metal loid s in the surrounding water mg l 1 fu et al 2009 2 7 statistical analyzes spss v 21 0 was used for statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with fisher s least significant difference lsd test was performed to determine the statistical significance of treatments a significant level with p values of less than 0 05 p 0 05 was selected 3 results 3 1 morphology structure and composition of biocrusts stereo microscopy sem tem xrd and ftir were used to characterize the morphology microstructure and mineral composition of the biocrust fig 1 and fig s2 in the supplementary materials show that the biocrusts in mine drainage displayed a spongy and porous structure fig 1a c the micron scale images revealed many diatoms e g navicula sp in the biocrust fig 1d e while only large sized mineral particles were present in the source tailings fig s7 a phenomenon of gas production in the biocrust was recorded at the sampling site fig 1a fig s2 in addition nanoparticle aggregates visualized by sem and tem were potentially contribute to form an organic integrity within biocrusts fig 1f g fig s5 the xrd analysis indicated that there was no obvious difference between biocrust b1 and b2 in mineral composition fig s3 clay minerals e g kaolinite and rock forming minerals e g muscovite detailed formulas are shown in table s3 were found and evenly distributed in the biocrusts b1 and b2 while only sio2 was the dominant crystal minerals in the weathered source tailing b0 fig s3 fig s4 shows the ftir spectra of source tailing b0 and biocrusts b1 2 the bands at 3420 3456 cm 1 are assigned to the oh stretching lian et al 2019 the bands at 3620 cm 1 belonged to kaolinite whereas that at 1032 cm 1 was ascribed to the deformation variation of si o or c o barquilha et al 2019 georgakopoulos et al 2003 however the bands of carboxylate coo at 1636 cm 1 barquilha et al 2019 illite at 3698 cm 1 and silicate at 536 cm 1 were only found in the biocrusts b1 and b2 georgakopoulos et al 2003 3 2 physicochemical properties the source tailing b0 was alkaline ph 7 77 with an ec value of 92 μs cm 1 and a bet surface of 2 70 m2 g 1 table 1 compared to b0 the biocrusts were leaning to slightly acidic and neutral ph 6 57 6 98 moreover the biocrusts showed 8 7 10 2 times higher ec 1 1 times higher eh 4 5 8 2 times larger bet specific surface area and 4 0 5 4 times higher toc than b0 from upstream b1 to downstream b2 the ph and bet surface area increased by 6 and 45 respectively while the ec value decreased by 17 the variation of bet could be attributed to the minerals and organic functional groups of the biocrusts which provide active sites for the binding of metal loid ions being located upstream b1 was reasonably anticipated to bind more metal loid ions in the running mine drainage thus the more active sites consumed the less bet observed the increase in ph and decrease in ec followed the same variation patterns in the stream detailed in sub section 3 4 3 3 metal loid accumulation distribution and speciation in biocrusts extremely high concentrations of metal loid s e g as 2 67 g kg 1 cd 0 08 g kg 1 zn 2 96 g kg 1 pb 1 66 g kg 1 were detected in the source tailing b0 table 1 in the biocrusts b1 and b2 the concentrations of the metal loid s were even higher than those in b0 by 2 9 8 1 times higher for as 2 3 6 5 times for cd 2 1 2 3 times for zn 1 8 4 2 times for fe and 2 7 4 3 times for mn though the pb concentration in b1 2 were not as high as that in b0 they were still very high 0 5 0 7 g kg 1 when compared with the national standard for farmland in china gb15618 2018 the lower pb concentration in b1 2 could lie in the poor release of pb from the source tailings and consequently to a limited supply of pb to the mine drainage which resulted in a lower accumulation in bac and hence lower pb concentration than that observed in b0 from b1 to b2 the concentrations decreased for as and cd 57 and fe 46 while increased for mn 42 and pb 27 no significant difference was observed between b1 and b2 for the zn concentration in addition fig 2 shows the operationally defined speciation of the metal loid s in the biocrusts i e eps bound sorbed and non edta exchangeable fractions reflecting the various biotic and abiotic immobilization mechanisms in b0 the sorbed fractions were 5 for cd 9 for zn and 12 for pb in all cases the non edta exchangeable fraction accounted for 85 while the eps bound fraction was 1 remarkably 99 of as and fe and 98 of cd and pb were found in the non edta exchangeable fraction in the biocrusts while 6 8 of zn was found in the sorbed fraction as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 with representative sem eds elemental mappings of a b1 sample the metal loid s were widely distributed in the biocrusts the major elements 2 wt included zn 2 53 as 2 96 si 25 19 al 9 52 fe 9 63 and mn 6 00 the metal loid s appeared colocalized e g as pb and zn were colocalized with fe mn and s in the mineral aggregates of the biocrusts moreover the corresponding xps analysis of as 3d spectra fig 4 showed the presence of both as iii at 44 4 ev 45 6 and as ⅴ at 45 2 ev 54 4 fantauzzi et al 2006 martinson and reddy 2009 likewise the fe 2p spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks i e feooh at 710 4 ev 75 1 and fe iii oxide at 712 5 ev 24 9 uhlig et al 2001 the peaks deconvoluted from the spectra of zn 2p mn 2p3 s 2p indicated the presence of zn oxide at 1021 9 ev pyrolusite mno2 at 641 7 ev and metal sulfate at 169 1 ev in the biocrusts biesinger et al 2011 rataboul et al 2002 uhlig et al 2001 in addition the xps peak of c 1s was fitted with three peaks at 284 8 286 3 and 287 7 ev which corresponded to the bands of alkene c c 37 6 c o or hydroxyls c oh 42 9 and carbonyls c o 19 5 respectively murphy et al 2006 these results also clearly indicated that organic carbon was the dominant carbon forms in the biocrust 3 4 effect of biocrusts on the water the bcf values were calculated to assess the potential of the biocrusts for the enrichment of the metal loid s from the water mine drainage as shown in table 1 much high bcf values of 9 2 104 for as 8 1 103 for cd 2 7 103 for zn 7 0 104 for fe and 5 8 103 for mn were found in biocrust the ph values in mine drainage went up from acidity 5 79 to near neutrality 6 90 from w1 to w4 whereas the ec values gradually decreased by 32 table 2 the eh values increased by 14 from w1 to w2 then remained relatively stable along the mine drainage interestingly a shift of zeta potential was observed from 4 43 w1 to 9 92 mv w4 however no significant variation of toc concentration was found from w1 to w4 the influence of the biocrusts on the water chemistry of the mine drainage was assessed from the analyses of anions and metal loid s table 2 table s1 the so4 2 and no3 concentrations decreased by a third from w1 to w4 however no significant difference was observed in no3 and cl among the w1 3 sites in addition the concentrations of most metal loid s significantly decreased from w1 to w4 as by 84 ca by 35 cd by 11 fe by 93 and mn by 35 except that zn increased by 70 in the mine drainage the elemental concentration and the composition of the suspended particles 0 45 μm in mine drainage were analyzed to clarify the influence of the biocrusts on the behavior of the particles the concentrations of the metal loid s and s decreased in the particles from upstream p1 to midstream p2 as by 48 cd by 39 fe by 50 and s by 79 and then remained relatively stable along the stream table s2 however the nutrient elements and zn dramatically increased from p1 to p2 by 1666 for p 535 for na 965 for k and 867 for zn in addition xrd analysis showed that crystal forms of the particulate matter gradually varied from simple quartz to complex micas and clay minerals from p1 to p2 fig s3 the clay minerals e g kaolinite and illite and rock forming minerals e g alurgite and muscovite were distributed in p2 and p3 in the area where the biocrusts were present sem analysis fig s7 also showed that aggregates of nanoparticles were present in p1 however nanoparticles cemented with filamentous cyanobacteria or eps were only found in p2 moreover more platy minerals and surrounding nanoparticle aggregates were observed in p3 and p4 4 discussion 4 1 metal loid accumulation in biological aqua crusts bacs biological materials such as biological soil crusts bscs and cyanobacterial mats or biofilms play crucial roles in c and n metabolisms and ecological restoration in extreme terrestrial or aquatic habitats dick et al 2018 rodriguez caballero et al 2018 watnick and kolter 2000 studies identified that bscs are organo minerals assemblages at the soil surface belnap 2001 while cyanobacterial mats are the stratified microbial communities i e bacteria and cyanobacteria knoll 1989 and biofilms are composed of the aggregates of microorganisms dry mass 10 and hydrated eps dry mass 90 flemming and wingender 2010 watnick and kolter 2000 our results demonstrated that similar materials were formed in the mine drainage ponds the composition was found to be similar in the mine drainage biocrust than in bsc however there were some differences due to the distinct environmental conditions here we propose to call the biocrust in the aquatic environments e g mine drainage biological aqua crust bac which is formed due to the high activity of microorganisms the presence of inorganic minerals and the presence of a sufficient amount of water bac differs from conventional bsc not only in their formation conditions but also in their structure and functional properties bac as observed in the mine drainage wetland fig s1 exhibited a special spongy structure the flexible structure is in clear contrast to traditional biocrusts observed in dry environments where compacted soil aggregates lead to a solid and stable structure of the biocrusts the spongy structure can be attributed to the presence of microorganisms in large quantities including oxygen producing cyanobacteria and diatoms the high cementing ability of eps as shown in the sem analysis fig 1e also plays an important role in the formation of bac resulting in the structural integrity of the organic mineral framework because of the sponge like and porous structure the bac was able to effectively concentrate as cd pb and zn as amorphous minerals fig s3 and the accumulation capacity of as cd and zn was much higher than surrounding source tailings in addition to the presence of large quantities of cyanobacteria and diatoms aggregated metallic nanoparticles were found on the surface of microorganisms in the bac fig 3 moreover crystals of muscovite and clay minerals were generally present in the bac with inorganic minerals being the dominant components 95 of the total bac mass finally bac exists in the aquatic environments and appears yellow green which could be attributed to the combination of amorphous metallic minerals e g red ferric oxide and green algae or cyanobacteria bigham et al 1996 rojas et al 2014 while most prior work has focused on bsc our work is the first focusing on bac and demonstrating the effectiveness of bac for metal loid immobilization in the mine drainage 4 2 proposed mechanisms on metal loid immobilization in bac based on the foregoing experimental results the immobilization of the metal loid s by bac involved several concurrent physical chemical and biological processes in the mine drainage wetland first the adsorption of metal cations on clay minerals is one of the key mechanisms in the metal loid immobilization due to the unique porous structure the fine clay mineral particles e g kaolinite and illite were not only abundant in the bac but also well distributed on the bac surface with high specific surface area moreover the zeta potential in mine drainage turned sharply from positive to negative values along the stream where bacs were present indicating that high concentrations of metal cations e g ca and cd were trapped by the clay minerals in the bac second the organic functional groups e g oh cooh on the surface of microorganisms e g algae and cyanobacteria in the bac can effectively take up the metal cations through ion exchange and or surface complexation ayangbenro and babalola 2017 mota et al 2016 in addition the biofilms composed of microorganisms and eps could also serve as good matrices for binding suspended particles in the mine drainage fomina and gadd 2014 finally fe mn oxides especially feooh in the bac can adsorb oxyanions such as arsenate and facilitate mineral co precipitation of the metal loid s our work identified that the highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction of metal loid s e g pb and as was the predominant fraction in the bac moreover as pb and zn were strongly co localized with fe mn oxides and very high concentrations of fe 63 116 g kg 1 in the forms of iron containing minerals dominated by amorphous feooh 75 were found in the bac fig 4 previous studies showed that feooh performed well on as zn cd and mn immobilization by adsorption or surface complexation in aqueous environment chang et al 2016 huang et al 2018a lin et al 2018 wang et al reported that fe mn binary oxide was one of the key factors in controlling cd mobilization in paddy systems wang et al 2019a with the help of x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy park et al 2016 also found that fe minerals e g ferrihydrite and schwertmannite mediated co precipitation other than adsorption was the dominant mechanism for natural attenuation of as in a mine stream in addition strong ligand oxyanions may be adsorbed through the formation of ternary complexes zhao and sengupta 2000 for instance the organically bound transition metals e g fe2 and zn2 may serve as a lewis acid that can bind with arsenate or phosphate the abundant presence of cyanobacteria and diatom in the bac may result in the production of large amounts of oxygen air bubbles were observed in fig s2 which was on the one hand the reason for the formation of the porous structure of bac and on the other hand the driving factor for triggering boosting the abiotic oxidation of minerals e g pyrite similar phenomena reported in previous works confirmed that the oxygen from plant roots accelerated the formation of ferric oxide in wetland environment which could be explained by the fact that the oxygen could act as electron acceptor for fe ii oxidizing bacteria maisch et al 2019 wu et al 2019 hence the oxygen driven formation of fe mn oxides could also contribute to the development of bac and its metal loid immobilization in mine drainage 4 3 environmental implications of bac due to the unique features i e spongy like and porous structure the bac was able to effectively and simultaneously concentrate various metals e g pb cd or metalloids e g as from mine drainage based on the very high bcf values the bac may serve as an effective sink to simultaneously immobilize metal loid s e g pb cd and as and therefore prevent the introduction of metal loid s carried by mine drainage into the downstream area in addition thanks to the clay minerals e g kaolinite and illite fe mn oxide e g feooh and microorganisms e g diatom and cyanobacteria in bac most of metal loid s in the drainage were immobilized as highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction in the bac and then the habitat and water quality in the mine drainage were greatly improved table 2 with the ph increased acidity switched to near neutrality and the concentrations of anions e g so4 2 no3 and metal loid s e g as cd decreased in the mine drainage therefore as an efficient nbs to immobilize the toxic metal loid s the bac may be used as an ideal biological filter in future engineering practices for ecological remediation of and valuable metal loid s recovery from polymetal contaminated aquatic system moreover further studies are needed to better understand the biogenic formation and the metal loid immobilization mechanisms of the bac in mine drainage also the stability of bac operating as a biological filter in various ph conditions should be further studied which could better help evaluate the sustainability of this natural attenuation strategy finally it can be assumed that under similar conditions i e metal loid contamination and climate similar processes would occur and would be observed in a large number of environments affected by mine drainage especially in the tropics 5 conclusions this work has been the first to have introduced the concept of biological aqua crust bac formed in the aquatic environments such as mine drainage characterized the bac s structures and tested its effectiveness for immobilizing typical metals and metalloids unique features were found in bac that differed it from biological soil crust commonly found in the terrestrial environments specifically bac could concentrate large quantities of metal loid s e g cd 0 26 0 60 g kg 1 as 10 4 24 3 g kg 1 in polymetallic mine drainage and the bcf values of typical metal loid s can reach 2 7 103 to 9 2 104 bac could be the main contributor which not only improved the ph from 5 79 to near neutrality 6 90 but also drastically reduced the levels of metal loid s e g as by 84 fe by 96 in the mine drainage while other factors should not be excluded such as a change in the chemistry of the stream induced by the adjacent soil materials remarkably more than 98 of pb cd as and fe were immobilized as non edta exchangeable fractions in the bac the adsorption of metal cations on clay minerals ion exchange and or surface complexation of metal cations by organic functional groups and coprecipitation with fe mn oxide e g feooh appeared to be the major processes of metal loid e g pb cd as immobilization in the bac further studies are also needed to broaden the practice of bac in a wider number of aquatic

17277,biocrust mediated in situ bioremediation could be an alternative strategy to mitigate metal loid pollution in aquatic habitats to better understand the roles of biocrusts in regulating the fate of metal loid s we examined the morphology composition and structure of biological aqua crusts bac developed in the mine drainage of a representative pb zn tailing pond and tested their effectiveness for immobilizing typical metal loid s unlike terrestrial biocrusts bac results from an assembly of compounds produced by the strong microbial activity and mineral compounds present in the aquatic environment the bac exhibited a unique flexible spongy and porous structure with a specific surface area of 12 22 m2 g 1 and was able to effectively concentrate various metal loid s e g cd 0 26 0 60 g kg 1 pb 0 52 0 66 g kg 1 as 10 4 24 3 g kg 1 the concentrations of metal loid s e g cd and as in the bac were even three to seven times higher than those in the source tailings and more than 98 of immobilized metal loid s were present as the highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction adsorption on the well distributed micro particles of the clay minerals e g kaolinite and the organic matters 2 0 2 7 wt were found to be the major mechanisms for bac to bind metal cations whereas adsorption and coprecipitation on fe mn oxide e g feooh was proposed to be the dominant pathway for accumulating metal loid s especially as the decrease in aqueous concentrations of the metal loid s along the drainage could be attributed in part to the scavenging effects of the bac these findings therefore provide new insights into the possible and efficient strategy for metal loid removal from water bodies and highlighted the important role of bac as a nature based solution to benefit the

plant uptake microbial immobilization and substrate adsorption eggermont et al 2015 keesstra et al 2018 rai 2008 sheoran and sheoran 2006 singh and chakraborty 2020 however it was difficult to build an ecologically sustainable wetland in a mine tailing pond due to the poor aggregate structure excess metal loid s and extreme nutrient deficiency for plant growth cheng et al 2002 li and huang 2014 mays and edwards 2001 rai 2008 wieder 1989 it is therefore essential to improve current practices and find more efficient nbs to sustainably immobilize metal loid s in mine drainage a biological crust

availability at the regional and global scales and in the biogeochemical c and n cycling and as such may be employed as an nbs technique for ecological remediation within mining areas cabala et al 2010 elbert et al 2012 fischer and veste 2018 weber et al 2015 currently only a few studies have reported the functional roles of biocrusts in the bioremediation of metal loid s in desert paddy field or mining areas mota et al 2016 peng et al 2019 song et al 2019 xu et al 2012 xu et al found that the desert biocrust was useful for monitoring and indicating metal loid e g cd as pollution due to atmospheric deposition in the vicinity of power plants xu et al 2012 peng et al observed that biocrusts in paddy fields were able to concentrate cd 2 3 94 2 mg kg 1 from irrigation water and the presence of mn ii facilitated the cd immobilization due to the creation of a porous spongy like birnessite crystal lattice by mn oxidizing bacteria peng et al 2019 song et al 2019 in a field study in a pb zn mining area cabala et al found that the biocrust developed from the top layer of sandy clayey soils poor in water could concentrate pb and zn in the form of secondary labile minerals cabala et al 2010 our recent field study on a tailing wetland impacted by pb zn tailings revealed that many crustal like substances with cyanobacteria as one of the dominant species at the phylum level were present in the mine drainage and were able to enrich pb 0 42 g kg 1 and as 23 7 g kg 1 while these studies have demonstrated the potentials of biocrusts for accumulating metal loid s a systematic investigation has been lacking on the effectiveness of biocrusts for immobilizing mixtures of metal loid s e g pb cd and as in mine drainages moreover little is known on the interactions between the various components of biocrusts and the metal loid s due to the distinct habitats biocrusts in mine drainage are markedly different in the morphology structure and composition from those formed in natural systems and as such they may behave differently in terms of the metal loid immobilization effectiveness and mechanisms in addition studies have shown that clay minerals e g montmorillonite and kaolinite can effectively adsorb heavy metals e g pb cd from wastewater gu et al 2019 jiang et al 2010 and extracellular polymeric substances eps e g polysaccharides secreted by unicellular cyanobacteria can bind pb and cd through their organic functional groups mota et al 2016 however the interactions between metal loid s and biocrusts have not been well understood because biocrust are composed of both active inorganic and organic components one would expect enhanced interactions with the target metal loid s due to concurrent biomineralization and multi mechanism adsorption on both the clay minerals and organic functional groups derived from microorganisms building upon our prior field investigation the objectives of this work were to 1 investigate the ability of biocrusts to immobilize metal loid s pb cd zn and as in a representative mine drainage 2 examine the morphology composition structure speciation concentration and spatial variation of the metal loid s in the biocrust and 3 determine the positive influence of the biocrust treatment on the improvement of water quality in the mine drainage this research proposed to introduce a new concept of biological aqua crust which is the result of interactions between compounds produced by an intense microbial activity and inorganic compounds present in aquatic environments such as mine drainage the findings of this work should improve our understanding of the roles of biocrusts in immobilization of metal loid s in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site samples of biocrust and water were collected from the wetland downstream of an abandoned pb zn tailing pond 24 22 55 n 116 12 49 e in meizhou guangdong province china fig s1 huang et al 2018b wang et al 2020 the annual average temperature is 21 7 c and precipitation is 1473 mm in the area this tailing pond was operated from 1975 to 1992 when it was abandoned in july 2013 typhoon suli destroyed the tailing dam with heavy rains which led to the filling of tens of thousand tons of tailing sands into the downstream reservoir area and a tailing wetland subsequently emerged liang et al 2017 to mitigate the metal loid pollution brought by the mine tailing a constructed wetland was built in may 2017 and has been used since then four dominant plant species namely typha latifolia equisetum ramosissimum fimbristylis dichotoma and miscanthus floridulus were widely distributed in the wetland contributing to a vegetation coverage of about 60 of the land in november 2017 biocrusts were first found in the stream with mine drainage running through tailing wetland fig 1 2 2 sample collection and preparations from upstream inlet to downstream outlet in the wetland fig s1 three sites were selected for biocrust sampling i e b0 control source tailing materials including unstable physical crust b1 upstream biocrust and b2 downstream biocrust to assess the purification capacity of the biocrust water mine drainage samples were collected at four sites i e w1 upstream inlet w2 midstream w3 outlet adjacent to b2 and w4 downstream pond biocrusts and water samples were collected from the surface 0 15 cm of the mine drainage petri dishes ϕ 9 cm 2 cm in depth corning usa were used to keep the biocrusts intact the sample dishes were then sealed with parafilm for further characterization and analysis five replicates of b0 and b1 2 in each site 1 m2 were randomly sampled and then transported to the laboratory within a portable freezer at 4 c the biocrusts and source tailings were freeze dried then sieved through a 0 149 mm mesh for total elemental analysis water samples were collected in triplicate with plastic bottles 1 l suspended particles were collected by filtering the water through 0 45

centrifuge tubes 1 5 ml corning usa for further characterization and physicochemical analysis the filtered water was acidified to ph 2 using nitric acid ar for metal loid e g pb cd and as analysis 2 3 characterization after lyophilization labconco usa for 72 h the surface morphology and the microstructure of the biocrusts and the particles were observed by stereomicroscopy leica s9i germany field

electron bse and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the freeze dried samples were coated with carbon to improve the conductivity for sem analysis and embedded in epoxy resin and then ultrathin sectioned for tem analysis in addition the biocrusts and particles were powdered using an agate mortar to characterize the crystalline structures and compositions via x ray diffraction xrd analysis ultima iv xrd rigaku japan which was operated in the 2θ range of 3 90 and a step rate of 2 min 1 40 kv 40 ma the xrd spectra were then analyzed using the mid jade version 6 5 subsequently fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermofisher usa was employed to identify the surface functional groups of the powder samples the ftir spectra were obtained in the wavenumber range of 4000 and 400 cm 1 prior to the ftir analysis the solid samples were compressed into kbr pellets 1 100 w w in addition the bet specific surface area was determined using a bet surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2460 usa by n2 adsorption at 77 k finally the chemical composition of the surface of the biocrust was examined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific the binding energies were scaled in reference to the surface contamination of c 1s peak 284 8 ev and the deconvolution of xps spectra was conducted by the casaxps software version 2 3 13 2 4 basic chemical properties the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the biocrusts were measured mass ratio of biocrust to water 1 5 by a ph meter mettler toledo switzerland and a conductivity meter djs 1d 308a inesa china respectively total organic carbon toc were measured following the method modified from mingorance et al 2007 in brief samples 0 50 g k2cr2o7 5 ml 0 27 mol l 1 and h2so4 7 5 ml 18 4 mol l 1 were mixed and then kept at 100 for 30 min the solutions were adjusted to a constant volume with deionized water and settle for 24 hours prior to the absorbance measurement using spectrophotometer jinghua uv1900 china at 590 nm glucose was used to prepare standard calibration with the same procedure as the samples to analyze the metal loid contents biocrust samples were digested with aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 using a microwave digestion system mars6 cem usa the mixture was then filtered through with 0 45 μm fiber membranes and filtrate was analyzed for the total metal loid s by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300dv perkin elmer usa to ensure the accuracy of the methods reagent blanks external standard solutions and standard reference materials gbw07405 gbw07443 were used in the analysis the detection limits of icp oes were 1 10 μg l 1 for metal loid s e g cd as pb and zn metal loid readings were obtained from replicate analyses with a variation of 5 2 5 metal loid speciation metal loid s i e cd as zn pb fe and mn which are commonly found in biocrusts were selected for speciation analysis following the method of stewart et al 2015 with modifications briefly 0 50 g freeze dried sample was added to a centrifuge tubes containing 50 ml deionized water the samples were resuspended by vortex for 30 s the suspensions were then fractionated by centrifugation at 4750 rpm for 10 min the supernatant i e supernatant 1 containing the metal loid s bound to water soluble colloids or macromolecules was collected for analysis by direct digestion with the aqua regia approach the precipitation was resuspended using edta ph 8 0 4 mmol l 1 for 10 min after centrifugation 4750 rpm 10 min the edta exchangeable supernatant 2 was collected to obtain the metal loid s closely related to the capsular eps meylan et al 2003 subsequently the residue was further washed with a solution of 3 n mops ph 7 5 10 mmol l 1 to separate the metal loid s directly sorbed to the cell surface and residual metal edta complexes upon the same centrifugation procedure the new supernatant was collected into supernatant 2 and then digested with aqua regia the metal loid s in the residual corresponded to the non edta exchangeable fraction the metal loid concentrations in the supernatants 1 and 2 respectively for eps bound fraction and sorbed fraction were analyzed using icp oes and icp ms nexion 350d perkin elmer usa to ensure the accuracy of icp ms analysis an indium standard solution 50 μg l 1 was selected as the internal standard the metal loid concentrations in the non edta exchangeable fraction were calculated by deducting the concentrations of the eps bound fraction and sorbed fraction from the total concentration 2 6 water quality analysis upon filtration with 0 45 μm fiber membranes the water mine drainage samples were analyzed for common anions e g so4 2 and no3 by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 usa and toc using a toc analyzer vario toc elementar germany in addition the ph eh and conductivity were measured using a ph meter and a conductivity meter the zeta potential was determined using a particle sizer and zeta potential analyzer nanobrook omni brookhaven usa the metal cations and as were analyzed by the icp oes in addition the bioconcentration factor bcf was used to characterize the capacity of metal loid accumulation in the biocrust bcf was calculated as the ratio of the concentration of metal loid s in the biocrust mg kg 1 to the concentration of metal loid s in the surrounding water mg l 1 fu et al 2009 2 7 statistical analyzes spss v 21 0 was used for statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with fisher s least significant difference lsd test was performed to determine the statistical significance of treatments a significant level with p values of less than 0 05 p 0 05 was selected 3 results 3 1 morphology structure and composition of biocrusts stereo microscopy sem tem xrd and ftir were used to characterize the morphology microstructure and mineral composition of the biocrust fig 1 and fig s2 in the supplementary materials show that the biocrusts in mine drainage displayed a spongy and porous structure fig 1a c the micron scale images revealed many diatoms e g navicula sp in the biocrust fig 1d e while only large sized mineral particles were present in the source tailings fig s7 a phenomenon of gas production in the biocrust was recorded at the sampling site fig 1a fig s2 in addition nanoparticle aggregates visualized by sem and tem were potentially contribute to form an organic integrity within biocrusts fig 1f g fig s5 the xrd analysis indicated that there was no obvious difference between biocrust b1 and b2 in mineral composition fig s3 clay minerals e g kaolinite and rock forming minerals e g muscovite detailed formulas are shown in table s3 were found and evenly distributed in the biocrusts b1 and b2 while only sio2 was the dominant crystal minerals in the weathered source tailing b0 fig s3 fig s4 shows the ftir spectra of source tailing b0 and biocrusts b1 2 the bands at 3420 3456 cm 1 are assigned to the oh stretching lian et al 2019 the bands at 3620 cm 1 belonged to kaolinite whereas that at 1032 cm 1 was ascribed to the deformation variation of si o or c o barquilha et al 2019 georgakopoulos et al 2003 however the bands of carboxylate coo at 1636 cm 1 barquilha et al 2019 illite at 3698 cm 1 and silicate at 536 cm 1 were only found in the biocrusts b1 and b2 georgakopoulos et al 2003 3 2 physicochemical properties the source tailing b0 was alkaline ph 7 77 with an ec value of 92 μs cm 1 and a bet surface of 2 70 m2 g 1 table 1 compared to b0 the biocrusts were leaning to slightly acidic and neutral ph 6 57 6 98 moreover the biocrusts showed 8 7 10 2 times higher ec 1 1 times higher eh 4 5 8 2 times larger bet specific surface area and 4 0 5 4 times higher toc than b0 from upstream b1 to downstream b2 the ph and bet surface area increased by 6 and 45 respectively while the ec value decreased by 17 the variation of bet could be attributed to the minerals and organic functional groups of the biocrusts which provide active sites for the binding of metal loid ions being located upstream b1 was reasonably anticipated to bind more metal loid ions in the running mine drainage thus the more active sites consumed the less bet observed the increase in ph and decrease in ec followed the same variation patterns in the stream detailed in sub section 3 4 3 3 metal loid accumulation distribution and speciation in biocrusts extremely high concentrations of metal loid s e g as 2 67 g kg 1 cd 0 08 g kg 1 zn 2 96 g kg 1 pb 1 66 g kg 1 were detected in the source tailing b0 table 1 in the biocrusts b1 and b2 the concentrations of the metal loid s were even higher than those in b0 by 2 9 8 1 times higher for as 2 3 6 5 times for cd 2 1 2 3 times for zn 1 8 4 2 times for fe and 2 7 4 3 times for mn though the pb concentration in b1 2 were not as high as that in b0 they were still very high 0 5 0 7 g kg 1 when compared with the national standard for farmland in china gb15618 2018 the lower pb concentration in b1 2 could lie in the poor release of pb from the source tailings and consequently to a limited supply of pb to the mine drainage which resulted in a lower accumulation in bac and hence lower pb concentration than that observed in b0 from b1 to b2 the concentrations decreased for as and cd 57 and fe 46 while increased for mn 42 and pb 27 no significant difference was observed between b1 and b2 for the zn concentration in addition fig 2 shows the operationally defined speciation of the metal loid s in the biocrusts i e eps bound sorbed and non edta exchangeable fractions reflecting the various biotic and abiotic immobilization mechanisms in b0 the sorbed fractions were 5 for cd 9 for zn and 12 for pb in all cases the non edta exchangeable fraction accounted for 85 while the eps bound fraction was 1 remarkably 99 of as and fe and 98 of cd and pb were found in the non edta exchangeable fraction in the biocrusts while 6 8 of zn was found in the sorbed fraction as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 with representative sem eds elemental mappings of a b1 sample the metal loid s were widely distributed in the biocrusts the major elements 2 wt included zn 2 53 as 2 96 si 25 19 al 9 52 fe 9 63 and mn 6 00 the metal loid s appeared colocalized e g as pb and zn were colocalized with fe mn and s in the mineral aggregates of the biocrusts moreover the corresponding xps analysis of as 3d spectra fig 4 showed the presence of both as iii at 44 4 ev 45 6 and as ⅴ at 45 2 ev 54 4 fantauzzi et al 2006 martinson and reddy 2009 likewise the fe 2p spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks i e feooh at 710 4 ev 75 1 and fe iii oxide at 712 5 ev 24 9 uhlig et al 2001 the peaks deconvoluted from the spectra of zn 2p mn 2p3 s 2p indicated the presence of zn oxide at 1021 9 ev pyrolusite mno2 at 641 7 ev and metal sulfate at 169 1 ev in the biocrusts biesinger et al 2011 rataboul et al 2002 uhlig et al 2001 in addition the xps peak of c 1s was fitted with three peaks at 284 8 286 3 and 287 7 ev which corresponded to the bands of alkene c c 37 6 c o or hydroxyls c oh 42 9 and carbonyls c o 19 5 respectively murphy et al 2006 these results also clearly indicated that organic carbon was the dominant carbon forms in the biocrust 3 4 effect of biocrusts on the water the bcf values were calculated to assess the potential of the biocrusts for the enrichment of the metal loid s from the water mine drainage as shown in table 1 much high bcf values of 9 2 104 for as 8 1 103 for cd 2 7 103 for zn 7 0 104 for fe and 5 8 103 for mn were found in biocrust the ph values in mine drainage went up from acidity 5 79 to near neutrality 6 90 from w1 to w4 whereas the ec values gradually decreased by 32 table 2 the eh values increased by 14 from w1 to w2 then remained relatively stable along the mine drainage interestingly a shift of zeta potential was observed from 4 43 w1 to 9 92 mv w4 however no significant variation of toc concentration was found from w1 to w4 the influence of the biocrusts on the water chemistry of the mine drainage was assessed from the analyses of anions and metal loid s table 2 table s1 the so4 2 and no3 concentrations decreased by a third from w1 to w4 however no significant difference was observed in no3 and cl among the w1 3 sites in addition the concentrations of most metal loid s significantly decreased from w1 to w4 as by 84 ca by 35 cd by 11 fe by 93 and mn by 35 except that zn increased by 70 in the mine drainage the elemental concentration and the composition of the suspended particles 0 45 μm in mine drainage were analyzed to clarify the influence of the biocrusts on the behavior of the particles the concentrations of the metal loid s and s decreased in the particles from upstream p1 to midstream p2 as by 48 cd by 39 fe by 50 and s by 79 and then remained relatively stable along the stream table s2 however the nutrient elements and zn dramatically increased from p1 to p2 by 1666 for p 535 for na 965 for k and 867 for zn in addition xrd analysis showed that crystal forms of the particulate matter gradually varied from simple quartz to complex micas and clay minerals from p1 to p2 fig s3 the clay minerals e g kaolinite and illite and rock forming minerals e g alurgite and muscovite were distributed in p2 and p3 in the area where the biocrusts were present sem analysis fig s7 also showed that aggregates of nanoparticles were present in p1 however nanoparticles cemented with filamentous cyanobacteria or eps were only found in p2 moreover more platy minerals and surrounding nanoparticle aggregates were observed in p3 and p4 4 discussion 4 1 metal loid accumulation in biological aqua crusts bacs biological materials such as

microbial communities i e bacteria and cyanobacteria knoll 1989 and biofilms are composed of the aggregates of microorganisms dry mass 10 and hydrated eps dry mass 90 flemming and wingender 2010 watnick and kolter 2000 our results demonstrated that similar materials were formed in the mine drainage ponds the composition was found to be similar in the mine drainage biocrust than in bsc however there were some differences due to the distinct environmental conditions here we propose to call the biocrust in the aquatic environments e g mine drainage biological aqua crust bac which is formed due to the high activity of microorganisms the presence of inorganic minerals and the presence of a sufficient amount of water bac differs from conventional bsc not only in their formation conditions but also in their structure and functional properties bac as observed in the mine drainage wetland fig s1 exhibited a special spongy structure the flexible structure is in clear contrast to traditional biocrusts observed in dry environments where compacted soil aggregates lead to a solid and stable structure of the biocrusts the spongy structure can be attributed to the presence of microorganisms in large quantities including oxygen producing cyanobacteria and diatoms the high cementing ability of eps as shown in the sem analysis fig 1e also plays an important role in the formation of bac resulting in the structural integrity of the organic mineral framework because of the sponge like and porous structure the bac was able to effectively concentrate as cd pb and zn as amorphous minerals fig s3 and the accumulation capacity of as cd and zn was much higher than surrounding source tailings in addition to the presence of large quantities of cyanobacteria and diatoms aggregated metallic nanoparticles were found on the surface of microorganisms in the bac fig 3 moreover crystals of muscovite and clay minerals were generally present in the bac with inorganic minerals being the dominant components 95 of the total bac mass finally bac exists in the aquatic environments and appears yellow green which could be attributed to the combination of amorphous metallic minerals e g red ferric oxide and green algae or cyanobacteria bigham et al 1996 rojas et al 2014 while most prior work has focused on bsc our work is the first focusing on bac and demonstrating the effectiveness of bac for metal loid immobilization in the mine drainage 4 2 proposed mechanisms on metal loid immobilization in bac based on the foregoing experimental results the immobilization of the metal loid s by bac involved several concurrent physical chemical and biological processes in the mine drainage wetland first the adsorption of metal cations on clay minerals is one of the key mechanisms in the metal loid immobilization due to the unique porous structure the fine clay mineral particles e g kaolinite and illite were not only abundant in the bac but also well distributed on the bac surface with high specific surface area moreover the zeta potential in mine drainage turned sharply from positive to negative values along the stream where bacs were present indicating that high concentrations of metal cations e g ca and cd were trapped by the clay minerals in the bac second the organic functional groups e g oh cooh on the surface of microorganisms e g algae and cyanobacteria in the bac can effectively take up the metal cations through ion exchange and or surface complexation ayangbenro and babalola 2017 mota et al 2016 in addition the biofilms composed of microorganisms and eps could also serve as good matrices for binding suspended particles in the mine drainage fomina and gadd 2014 finally fe mn oxides especially feooh in the bac can adsorb oxyanions such as arsenate and facilitate mineral co precipitation of the metal loid s our work identified that the highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction of metal loid s e g pb and as was the predominant fraction in the bac moreover as pb and zn were strongly co localized with fe mn oxides and very high concentrations of fe 63 116 g kg 1 in the forms of iron containing minerals dominated by amorphous feooh 75 were found in the bac fig 4 previous studies showed that feooh performed well on as zn cd and mn immobilization by adsorption or surface complexation in aqueous environment chang et al 2016 huang et al 2018a lin et al 2018 wang et al reported that fe mn binary oxide was one of the key factors in controlling cd mobilization in paddy systems wang et al 2019a with the help of x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy park et al 2016 also found that fe minerals e g ferrihydrite and schwertmannite mediated co precipitation other than adsorption was the dominant mechanism for natural attenuation of as in a mine stream in addition strong ligand oxyanions may be adsorbed through the formation of ternary complexes zhao and sengupta 2000 for instance the organically bound transition metals e g fe2 and zn2 may serve as a lewis acid that can bind with arsenate or phosphate the abundant presence of cyanobacteria and diatom in the bac may result in the production of large amounts of oxygen air bubbles were observed in fig s2 which was on the one hand the reason for the formation of the porous structure of bac and on the other hand the driving factor for triggering boosting the abiotic oxidation of minerals e g pyrite similar phenomena reported in previous works confirmed that the oxygen from plant roots accelerated the formation of ferric oxide in wetland environment which could be explained by the fact that the oxygen could act as electron acceptor for fe ii oxidizing bacteria maisch et al 2019 wu et al 2019 hence the oxygen driven formation of fe mn oxides could also contribute to the development of bac and its metal loid immobilization in mine drainage 4 3 environmental implications of bac due to the unique features i e spongy like and porous structure the bac was able to effectively and simultaneously concentrate various metals e g pb cd or metalloids e g as from mine drainage based on the very high bcf values the bac may serve as an effective sink to simultaneously immobilize metal loid s e g pb cd and as and therefore prevent the introduction of metal loid s carried by mine drainage into the downstream area in addition thanks to the clay minerals e g kaolinite and illite fe mn oxide e g feooh and microorganisms e g diatom and cyanobacteria in bac most of metal loid s in the drainage were immobilized as highly stable non edta exchangeable fraction in the bac and then the habitat and water quality in the mine drainage were greatly improved table 2 with the ph increased acidity switched to near neutrality and the concentrations of anions e g so4 2 no3 and metal loid s e g as cd decreased in the mine drainage therefore as an efficient nbs to immobilize the toxic metal loid s the bac may be used as an ideal biological filter in future engineering practices for ecological remediation of and valuable metal loid s recovery from polymetal contaminated aquatic system moreover further studies are needed to better understand the biogenic formation and the metal loid immobilization mechanisms of the bac in mine drainage also the stability of bac operating as a biological filter in various ph conditions should be further studied which could better help evaluate the sustainability of this natural attenuation strategy finally it can be assumed that under similar conditions i e metal loid contamination and climate similar processes would occur and would be observed in a large number of environments affected by mine drainage especially in the tropics 5 conclusions this work has been the first to have introduced the concept of biological aqua crust bac formed in the aquatic environments such as mine drainage characterized the bac s structures and tested its effectiveness for immobilizing typical metals and metalloids unique features were found in bac that differed it from biological soil crust commonly found in the terrestrial environments specifically bac could concentrate large quantities of metal loid s e g cd 0 26 0 60 g kg 1 as 10 4 24 3 g kg 1 in polymetallic mine drainage and the bcf values of typical metal loid s can reach 2 7 103 to 9 2 104 bac could be the main contributor which not only improved the ph from 5 79 to near neutrality 6 90 but also drastically reduced the levels of metal loid s e g as by 84 fe by 96 in the mine drainage while other factors should not be excluded such as a change in the chemistry of the stream induced by the adjacent soil materials remarkably more than 98 of pb cd as and fe were immobilized as non edta exchangeable fractions in the bac the adsorption of metal cations on clay minerals ion exchange and or surface complexation of metal cations by organic functional groups and coprecipitation with fe mn oxide e g feooh appeared to be the major processes of metal loid e g pb cd as immobilization in the bac further studies are also needed to broaden the practice of bac in a wider number of aquatic

17278,intermittent every other day microaerobic picomolar oxygen by oxidation reduction potential orp set at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline digestion of lignocellulosic biomass showed higher digestibility and better stability at a high organic loading rate olr of 5 g volatile solids vs l d than that under strict anaerobic conditions however the microbial mechanisms supporting the delicate balance under microaeration remain underexplored on the basis of our previous findings that microbial communities in replicate experiments were dominated by strains of the genus proteiniphilum but contained diverse taxa of methanogenic archaea here we recovered related genomes and reconstructed the putative metabolic pathways using a genome centric metagenomic approach the highly enriched proteiniphilum strains were identified as efficient cellulolytic facultative bacterium which directly degraded lignocellulose to carbon dioxide formate and acetate via aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation alternatively moreover high oxygen affinity cytochromes bd type terminal oxidases in proteiniphilum strains were found to be closely associated with such picomolar oxygen conditions which has long been overlooked in anaerobic digestion furthermore hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the prevalent pathway for methane production while methanosarcina methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum were the dominant methanogens in the replicate experiments importantly the two functional groups namely cellulolytic facultative proteiniphilum strains and methanogens encoded various antioxidant enzymes energy dependent reactive oxygen species ros scavengers superoxide reductase sor and rubrerythrin rbr were ubiquitously present in different methanogenic taxa in response to replicate specific orp levels 470 450 and 475 mv collectively cytochrome bd oxidase and ros defenders may play roles in improving the digestibility and stability observed in intermittent

oxidation reduction potential orp 1 introduction in recent years anaerobic digestion ad of lignocellulosic biomass has drawn significant interest for sustainable bioenergy production sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 however the highly recalcitrant nature coupled with the heterogeneous structure of lignocellulosic feedstocks impedes their digestibility moreover long term ad operation with such feedstocks at high organic loading rates olrs usually leads to volatile fatty acids vfas build up subsequent ph drop and eventual system failure nguyen et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 recently these

et al 2009 johansen and bakke 2006 lim and wang 2013 nguyen and khanal 2018 nguyen et al 2019 specifically an oxidation reduction potential orp based oxygenation approach where the orp level varies linearly with the logarithmic dissolved oxygen do concentration allows for a more precise control of oxygen air injection far below 0 1 mg l into a digester orp based microaeration has been examined in fermentation industries for ethanol and butanol production liu et al 2013 its application in ad system however has been very limited khanal and huang 2003 nguyen et al 2019 in general successful biogas production in ad systems depends on an intricate balance between multiple functional microbial groups including hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea briones and raskin 2003 nevertheless injection of oxygen a redox active gas into ad system has been reported to stimulate the extracellular orp level thereby altering the intracellular redox balance and redirecting the metabolic pathways banerjee 2012 consequently reshaping the microbial community to achieve a new balance previous studies reported that microaeration led to a high abundance of firmicutes fu et al 2016 lim et al 2014 tang et al 2004 yin et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 since bacteria whining the firmicutes are known to produce extracellular enzymes such as cellulases lipases and proteases leven et al 2007 their high abundance is likely responsible for enhanced hydrolysis moreover archaeal population shifts were also observed and were attributed to species specific differences in oxygen tolerance fu et al 2016 tang et al 2004 when introducing o2 various reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide radical o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl

a vital role for facultative and obligate anaerobes to adapt to the microaerobic environments in ad systems fischer et al 2016 in a previous study we developed an orp based intermittent microaeration ad system with picomolar o2 addition by setting the orp 25 mv above the strict anaerobic baseline 470 450 475 mv every other day this system was fed with napier grass a typical lignocellulosic feedstock at an olr of 5 g vs l d and achieved a stable methane yield of 80 8 9 6 n ch4 ml volatile solids vs g using three independent replicates 16s rrna and mcra gene sequencing analyse showed that the microbial communities in three systems were dominated by the genus proteiniphilum but contained various methanogenic taxa this research led to several questions associated with such high rate ad of lignocellulose under intermittent microaerobic conditions 1 why was the same bacterial genus proteiniphilum prevalent but were diverse taxa of methanogens present in replicate systems 2 how was each microbial population able to switch to different carbohydrate degradation pathways to adapt to intermittent microaerobic environment and 3 how were the predominant anaerobes capable of oxygen tolerance to address these questions this study was carried out to identify the functional genes involved in critical pathways within the enriched microbiomes we used genome centric metagenomics to gain genomic insights into the highly abundant bacterial genus proteiniphilum and methanogens from two independent samples collected during orp based microaeration experiments four near complete proteiniphilum genomes and three methanogenic genomes were retrieved their metabolic pathways associated with lignocellulose degradation methane formation and oxygen detoxification were reconstructed the functional assignments from genome sequences of these key populations were mapped to understand their physiology and behavior related to methane production the knowledge obtained will enable biotechnological exploration of microbial interaction network under the orp controlled intermittent microaerobic strategy for digester design and operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and microbial sampling as described in our previous study nguyen et al 2019 a 2 0 l continuous stirred tank reactor cstr equipped with an orp based microaeration control system was used for digestion of napier grass a lignocellulosic biomass the cstr was fed with stepwise increase in olr from 1 5 to 5 0 g vs l day under anaerobic conditions and the reactor showed sign of instability when the olr reached 5 0 g vs l day intermittent microaeration was then initiated by injecting oxygen by controlling orp value at 25 mv above its corresponding anaerobic baseline every other day the experiments were replicated three times rep 1 rep 2 and rep 3 to confirm the reactor performance during anaerobic microaerobic experimental cycles using the same inoculum substrate and reactor operating conditions however orp value is extremely sensitive towards the availability of electron acceptors e g o2 nad and reducing equivalents e g nadh in the system and significantly affected by a slight variation in operating conditions such as ph electrical conductivity temperature etc thus different baseline orp values of 495 7 mv 475 15 mv and 500 20 mv were obtained in three independent replicates to achieve microaerobic condition the system orp was raised by 25 mv above the baseline orp in each replicate resulting in different orp values 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv in rep1 rep2 and rep3 respectively while reactor performance and microbial community 16s rrna gene based bacterial analysis and mcra gene based methanogen analysis under each scenario were examined in our previous study nguyen et al 2019 the current study evaluated the microaeration driven digestion pathway via metagenomic analysis here each sample was collected when its steady state microaeration performance was achieved no significant difference anova p 0 05 in each operating parameter during five consecutive days of operation in each replicate all collected samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 2 min and the pellets were stored at 80 c until further processing in this study only samples in rep 1 and rep 2 met the sequence criteria for metagenomic analysis whereas samples in rep 3 were discarded due to severe dna degradation the reference genome sequences based on community analysis data of rep 3 however were chosen for comparison in this study as well 2 2 dna extraction and sequencing genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturers protocols the quality and the quantity of the extracted dna were determined using nanodrop thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa and qubit fluorometer life technologies carlsbad ca usa genomic dna was sent to bgi shenzhen china for paired end library construction the prepared libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2000 platform illumina san diego ca usa to generate 125 bp paired end sequencing reads 2 3 metagenomic assembly and binning raw paired end reads from the illumina hiseq 2000 platform were initially filtered using trimmomatic version 0 36 based on a minimum quality score of 30 a minimum sequence length of 76 bp and allowing for less than three ambiguous nucleotides ns bolger et al 2014 for each sample the trimmed clean paired end reads were further de novo assembled into long sequence contigs using spades version 3 9 0 based on the de bruijn graph with default settings k 19 33 47 61 75 bankevich et al 2012 nurk et al 2017 the quality of the assembled contigs was evaluated with quast version 4 5 gurevich et al 2013 then metagenomic contigs were clustered into genomic bins with maxbin based on an expectation maximization algorithm wu et al 2014 checkm version 1 0 18 was introduced to estimate the completeness and contamination of each draft genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes parks et al 2015 jspeciesws online http jspecies ribohost com jspeciesws was used to calculate the average nucleotide identity ani values between genomes of proteiniphilum strains richter et al 2016 2 4 gene annotation and metabolic reconstruction gene prediction on the contigs assigned to a genomic bin was performed using the prodigal program hyatt et al 2010 incorporated prokka software seemann 2014 the annotations of these genome sequences were carried out by means of ko kegg orthology assignments using blastkoala server at kegg website which characterize individual gene functions and reconstruct kegg pathways inferring high level functions of the organism and the ecosystem kanehisa et al 2016 to predict genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes the carbohydrate active enzyme database cazy annotation web server dbcan was used yin et al 2012 2 5 data availability the metagenome sequencing reads have been submitted to the ncbi s sequence read archive under accession numbers samn13634953 to samn13634954 draft genomes obtained in this study have been deposited in ncbi s whole genome shotgun database under accession numbers jadlkj000000000 to jadlkp000000000 their functional annotations have further been deposited at the figshare online database https figshare com articles dataset microaerobic digestion genome annotation 13270487 all other relevant data are available in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 overview of metagenomic sequencing and binning high throughput sequencing yielded a total of 87 089 214 and 91 305 190 quality pair end reads in rep 1 and rep 2 respectively table s1 the assembly of resulting reads generated 237 059 and 58 704 contigs with n50 of 2 427 and 3 118 bp in rep1 and rep2 respectively table s1 the assemblies both with minimum length of 76 bp accounted for about 96 and 99 of their respective total quality reads suggesting their fair representativeness of microbial community in the bioreactor focusing on the prominent pathway during microaerobic digestion this study only investigated the core bacterial and methanogenic populations bacterial genus proteiniphilum repeatedly enriched with abundance of 31 8 64 5 and 43 2 respectively in rep1 rep 2 and rep3 and various methanogens methanosarcina 56 8 in rep1 methanobrevibacter 53 9 in rep2 and methanocorpusculum 45 9 in rep3 as elucidated in our previous community analysis nguyen et al 2019 as a result of metagenomic binning rep1 yielded two proteiniphilum genomes rep1 bin001 bin026 and two methanogenic genomes rep1 bin027 bin035 yet without genome of methanosarcina table 1 rep2 resulted in two genomes of proteiniphilum rep2 bin001 bin003 and one genome of methanobrevibacter rep2 bin008 table 1 for comparison and curation representative genomes of genera methanosarcina methanobrevibacter methanocorpusculum as well as proteiniphilum were chosen as references in our study ani analysis table s2 showed that rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin001 shared a genome similarity of 97 7 implying that highly reproducibility of bacterial population upon microaeration at orp of 25 mv above the anaerobic baseline in addition genomic mapping table s3 showed that the relative abundances of 43 4 of reads in rep1 and 84 5 of reads in rep2 were mapped to rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin001 respectively indicating their functional importance during microaeration 3 2 cellulose and xylan hydrolysis by proteiniphilum strains the observed enhanced degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in orp based microaeration ad system suggests that the highly abundant bacterial genus proteiniphilum is potentially responsible for polysaccharides hydrolysis especially cellulose and xylan four genomes belonging to this genus were retrieved and screened for the presence of carbohydrate active enzymes by applying the cazy annotation server dbcan for comparative purposes the genome of a phylogenetically closely related reference strain proteiniphilum saccharofermentans m3 6 lt605205 was also investigated results presented in figs 1 and 2 and table s4 indicate that all analyzed genomes harbor a diverse repertoire of enzymes involved in stepwise hydrolysis including glycoside hydrolases gh carbohydrate esterase ce and substrate specific carbohydrate binding motifs cbm among them strain rep2 bin003 comprised 239 such enzymes the highest among all four strains followed by strain rep2 bin001 and strain rep1 bin001 with 183 and 190 related enzymes respectively and strain rep1 bin026 containing the lowest with 153 enzymes the complete hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose requires a combination of several enzymes working synergistically endoglucanases and exoglucanases cellobiohydrolases initially cleave the β 1 4 glycosidic bonds of long chain cellulose and then β glucosidases bgl and cellobiose phosphorylases further break cellobioses into glucose monomers bhat and bhat 1997 doi and kosugi 2004 in this study the genomes of strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 encoded gh5 gh9 endoglucanases and gh3 β glucosidases bglx indicating their ability to hydrolyze cellulose completely similar to the reference strain m3 6 besides these three genomic bins contained an additional gh94 cellobiose phosphorylase allowing versatile pathways in cellulose degradation in addition cbm4 and cbm6 known to bind to cellulose extracellularly gilbert et al 2013 were also found in these three genomes but were not found in the reference strain m3 6 this suggests that the proteiniphilum strains enriched under intermittent microaerobic condition provided more efficient hydrolysis than that of strain m3 6 however strain rep1 bin026 lacked the enzyme cellulase xylan as the major polysaccharide of hemicellulose requires a synergistic action of endo 1 4 β xylanase xln and 1 4 β xylosidase bxl cleaving the backbone for hydrolysis and the accessory enzymes cleaving the side chains of the associated oligo di monosaccharides including α l arabinofuranosidase α glucuronidase acetyl xylan esterase and feruloyl esterase uffen 1997 in this study we found that strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 possessed the same enzymes responsible for xylan degradation but different from those present in strains rep1 bin026 and m3 6 strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 encoded gh10 xylanase xyna and gh43 xylosidase xynb moreover the three genomes also encoded accessory enzymes gh43 gh51 arabinofuranosidase abfa and gh67 glucuronidase agua for further xylan degradation into monosaccharides in addition the aforementioned cbm4 and cbm6 as well as cbm13 and cbm22 which were characterized by binding specificity for linear and branched decorated xylan gilbert et al 2013 were also detected however strain m3 6 lacked glucuronidase whereas strain rep1 bin026 lacked all xylan related enzymes therefore this analysis confirmed that proteiniphilum strains capable of degrading cellulose and hemicellulose xylan were actively enriched in the napier grass fed microaerobic digesters meanwhile the proteiniphilum strains also showed their versatility in hydrolysis pathways 3 3 carbohydrate degradation via alternative aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation by cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum strains considering the picomolar oxygen dosing every other day it is postulated that the microorganisms may activate micro aerobic and anaerobic metabolic switch alternatively to respond to the reducing equivalent change driven by direct oxygen variation to further elucidate this postulation the putative genes of the predominant proteiniphilum strains were assigned to both fermentation and respiration pathways in the kegg database figs 1 and 2 and table s4 given that lignocellulose hydrolysis yields hexose e g glucose and pentose e g xylose sugars their degradation pathways were investigated results showed that all four proteiniphilum genomes as well as the reference strain m3 6 encoded a series of enzymes for prominent central carbon metabolic routes i e the embden meyerhof parnas emp and the pentose phosphate pp pathways particularly genomes rep1 bin026 rep2 bin001 and strain m3 6 contained a full complement of genes for emp pathway whereas genomes rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin003 lacked enolase eno and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk respectively this could be attributed to the assembly gaps moreover in contrast to strain m3 6 all four recovered proteiniphilum genomes lacked transaldolase tal involved in the non oxidative pp pathway instead they might perform an alternative hexose pentose interconversion pathway in which only enzyme transketolase tkt in the pp pathway would be involved xylulose was catalyzed from xylose a pentose from xylan hydrolysis via the action of xylose isomerase xyla and xylulose kinase xylb as observed in all these genomes thus the proteiniphilum strains in this study may mainly use the emp pathway for hexose degradation or alternatively use the incomplete pp pathway integrated with the emp pathway for pentose degradation pyruvate the end product of emp pathway serves as a crucial intermediate in the central metabolic network linking fermentation or respiration for a better adaptation in different oxygen mediated redox environments genome analysis revealed that all four analyzed proteiniphilum genomes as well as the reference strain m3 6 harbored a number of enzymes for mixed acid fermentation from pyruvate they encoded pyruvate formate lyase pfld allowing formate and acetyl coa formation via non oxidative conversion meanwhile they also contained several ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductases pfor gene por or korab encoding for oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl coa anaerobically subsequently the aforementioned acetyl coa is capable of further converting into acetate via either a single step reaction by an acetyl coa synthetase acs or a two step reaction by phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetate kinase acka in all the four proteiniphilum genomes however all retrieved proteiniphilum strains lacked methylmalonyl coa carboxytransferase pccb enzyme in methylmalonyl coa pathway for propionate production while the strain m3 6 possessed this enzyme furthermore the common pathway for production of intermediates such as ethanol butyrate and lactate were incomplete or missing in these genomes as a result it is believed that the proteiniphilum strains studied can form formate and acetate via anaerobic fermentation although strain m3 6 have been verified to produce acetate and propionate hahnke et al 2016 fermentative propionate production in the proteiniphilum strains present in our experiments should be further examined by physiological studies in addition to anaerobic fermentation the proteiniphilum strains also encoded all major components involved in aerobic respiration including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdhc gene pdhab dlat and dld tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and electron transfer complex the pyruvate pdhc acted as a substitution of pfor for pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl coa but functioned under aerobic conditions ginger et al 2010 then tca cycle would further oxidize acetyl coa completely into co2 with addition of electron carriers nadh and fadh2 finally these electron carriers would pass their electrons into the electron transport chain and drive atp production through oxidative phosphorylation interestingly only one type of oxygen dependent terminal oxidases cytochrome bd quinol oxidases cydab was identified in the proteiniphilum strains as well as in the strain m3 6 since cytochrome bd quinol oxidase has much higher affinity towards o2 d mello and poole 1996 its presence suggests that the proteiniphilum strains could respire under extremely low oxygen environments to harvest more energy compared to under anaerobic conditions which was consistent with our experimental setup in which picomolar oxygen was injected by intermittently setting orp value at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline jointly the genomes of proteiniphilum strains contained complete sets of genes for versatile carbon and energy metabolism pathways including anaerobic aerobic pyruvate degradation pfor pdhc in central carbon metabolism fermentative acetate formate and propionate production tca cycle and electron transport oxidative phosphorylation system using cytochrome bd as terminal oxidase they provided the genetic potential for their facultative metabolism but might not grow well under high oxygen conditions known as nanareobes baughn and malamy 2004 however due to the favorable energy yield such nanaerobes were likely to prefer aerobic respiration rather than anaerobic fermentation under intermittent micro aerobic conditions 3 4 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis prevalence in our previous study the digester recovered from the verge of collapse when orp controlled microaeration was introduced nguyen et al 2019 reactor performance data showed that the addition of a picomolar level of oxygen prompted the degradation of accumulated vfas elevated the system ph value back to neutral level thereby increasing the methanogenic activity and subsequently the methane yield however contrary to consistent bacterial dominance the dominant methanogenic populations differed among the three microaeration replicates methanosarcina in rep1 methanobrevibacter in rep2 and methanocorpusculum in rep3 based on mcra gene analysis nguyen et al 2019 in order to investigate the major methanogenesis route this study retrieved methanogenic genomes figs 1 and 2 and table s4 rep1 yielded two genomes related to genera methanobacterium rep1 bin027 and methanobrevibacter rep1 bin035 without dominant methanosarcina but did not recover a genome consistent with the dominant methanosarcina rep2 produced one genome of methanobrevibacter rep2 bin008 the lack of genome recovery of the most abundant methanogen in rep1 may be attributed to the low abundance of methanogens 5 generally in digester communities de vrieze et al 2016 sundberg et al 2013 as well as strain heterogeneity among methanogens charuvaka and rangwala 2011 thus reference genomes of methanosarcina sp nc 003901 and methanocorpusculum sp nr 075452 were selected as methanogenic representatives in rep1 and rep3 respectively the genome of methanosarcina rep1 harbored hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways the methanobacterium genome rep1 beside hydrogenotrophic pathway also encoded acetyl coa synthetase acs and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase acds essential for the acetoclastic pathway however all known methanobacterium species are physiologically recognized as hydrogenotrophic methanogen boone 2001 where enzyme acds may function in reverse to carry out acetyl coa synthesis from co and methyl adam et al 2018 moreover the genera methanobrevibacter rep2 and methanocorpusculum rep3 genomes only encoded full hydrogenotrophic metabolism in addition genes for formate dehydrogenase fdh were identified in almost all genomes except in the methanosarcina genome indicating their ability to alternatively use formate as initial substrate and subsequently enter into hydrogenotrphic pathway collectively the hydrogenotrophic pathway was observed in all analyzed methanogen genomes 3 5 ros detoxification in proteiniphilum and methanogens since ros detoxification mechanism supported the adaptation of the putative proteiniphilum strains and methanogens under microaerobic conditions the occurrence of antioxidant genes in the genomes was also examined in this study figs 1 and 2 and table s4 all the analyzed proteiniphilum genomes encoded superoxide dismutase sod detoxifying the o2 and catalases cat glutathione peroxidases gpx and peroxiredoxins prx reducing the produced h2o2 table s2 which belong to energy free ros scavenger but allow new o2 production during their detoxification reaction martins et al 2019 for methanogens beside sod and cat gpx and prx energy dependent o2 scavenger superoxide reductase sor and energy dependent h2o2 scavenger rubrerythrin rbr were identified to be more ubiquitously present in their genomes table s2 in contrast energy dependent ros quenching by sor and rbr enable an advantage of no oxygen formation for anaerobes yet require additional energy sources with f420 as the ultimate electron donor in methanogens martins et al 2019 thus the predominant bacterial genus proteiniphilum and methanogenic archaea in the orp controlled microaeration ad system possessed a ros scavenging mechanism thereby providing a selective advantage under microaerobic conditions 3 6 mitigation of vfas accumulation by proteiniphilum and methanogens in intermittent microaerobic digestion based on the genome scale metabolic network reconstruction we consistently observed complement sets of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolyzing enzymes and facultative metabolic pathways in proteiniphilum genomes as well as prevalence of the hydrogenotrophic pathway in taxonomically diverse methanogens in replicate samples consequently cooperative interaction between proteiniphilum strains and methanogens is proposed as follows fig 2 1 proteiniphilum strains were involved in the breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose overcoming the rate limiting hydrolysis step 2 during intermittent microaerobic condition every other day when no oxygen was supplied vfas were produced by facultative proteiniphilum strains via anaerobic fermentation when oxygen was introduced the vfas were rapidly consumed by the same facultative proteiniphilum strains via aerobic respiration using cytochrome bd oxidase this reduces the stress on the rate limiting syntrophic reaction associated with vfa degrading syntrophs and h2 consuming methanogens 3 methane production can be achieved by taxonomically diverse methanogens 4 ros e g o2 and h2o2 scavengers are ubiquitously identified in both proteiniphilum strains and methanogens releasing the oxidative stress during microaerobic conditions 4 discussion our previous study demonstrated stable ad operation at high olrs using the strategy of intermittent every other day microaeration picomolar oxygen regulated by the orp level of 25 mv above anaerobic baseline nguyen et al 2019 within a 24 h microaerobic cycle an orp level of 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv was maintained in three independent replicates respectively in other words repeated start up shut down cycles of oxygen injection were executed and an approximate do level of 1 98 10 8 mg l or 0 62 pm was maintained during the microaerobic cycle nguyen et al 2019 we evaluated why the only dominant bacteria were proteiniphilum strains but a diverse range of methanogens were able todominate under intermittent exposure of picomolar oxygen in replicate experiments 4 1 oxygen resistance of cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum and diverse methanogens proteiniphilum strains encode solely one terminal oxidase cytochrome bd oxidase for direct oxygen consumption and energy conservation generally cytochrome bd is noteworthy for its high affinity to oxygen among different aerobic terminal oxidases d mello and poole 1996 baughn and malamy 2004 demonstrated that the cytochrome bd in the nanaerobe bacteroides fragilis was essential for its oxygen dependent growth at a concentration as low as 300 nm but inhibited its viability at concentrations higher than 2 µm furthermore due to the up expression of cytochrome bd oxidase under microaerobic conditions tseng et al 1996 escherichia coli was found to fuel the aerobic respiration at oxygen concentrations lower than 3 nm measurement based on precision sensor in addition an oxygen concentration as low as 0 05 nm was explored based on an oxygen flux modelling calculation stolper et al 2010 these findings are in agreements with our observation that cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum strains highly enriched at the extreme microaerobic condition of 0 62 pm more importantly this study proposes the occurrence of aerobic respiration at an oxygen level of one to two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported which shows much broader environmental range of aerobic organisms in the ecosystems however a time delayed gene regulatory network for fermentative and respiratory switch was observed in a cytochrome bd encoded e coli k 12 during the initial phase of transition from anaerobic to microaerobic conditions trotter et al 2011 in the study the introduction of oxygen resulted in an immediate inhibition of fnr controlled pfl anaerobic pyruvate fermentation but a 60 120 mins delay in induction of pdhr regulated pdhc activity aerobic pyruvate oxidation trotter et al 2011 hence it suggests that suitable oxygen exposure pattern i e 24 hr intermittent microaerobic operation is pivotal in alternative expression of metabolic switch between fermentation and aerobic respiration in proteiniphilum in addition to direct oxygen consumption antioxidant enzymes encoding genes e g sod cat gpx prx were also ubiquitous in proteiniphilum genomes implying that it has the ability to further scavenge the concurrent oxygen induced ross under microaerobic conditions overall the metabolism of cytochrome bd dependent aerobic respiration and oxygen detoxification contributed together to the oxygen tolerance of bacterium proteiniphilum in intermittent every other day oxygen limited picomolar level system based on these finds we hypothesize that the consistently predominant facultative bacterium proteiniphilum readily performs aerobic respiration during the oxygen supply period thereby releasing the stress of vfas accumulation which relies solely on syntrophs in traditional ad by converting a portion of vfas to co2 for methanogens though an aerobic respiration pathway was not found various antioxidant enzymes for both o2 and subsequent h2o2 detoxification were detected in the taxonomically diverse methanogens considering their close interaction with the facultative oxygen scavenger proteiniphilum it may rapidly consume the majority of the dissolved oxygen shielding the surrounding methanogenic cells from direct oxygen attack but releasing a small amount of ross during oxidative phosphorylation process for further toxic effects therefore this may induce the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes in the methanogens more intriguingly energy dependent o2 and h2o2 reductase f420 as ultimate electron donor sors and rbrs were more ubiquitously present in these methanogens than energy free ros scavengers sod cat gpx and prx although such energy dependent ros scavengers confer a selective advantage no new o2 production during detoxification reaction on anaerobes they need to divert the electron flow from their energy source in order to reduce oxidative stress jenney jr et al 1999 thorgersen et al 2012 reported that anaerobic archaea pyrococcus furiosus used electrons from sugar oxidation to reduce o2 via sor resulting in a decrease in fermentative h2 production on this basis electrons from methanogenesis that are normally used to generate ch4 were likely diverted to detoxify ros in the studied methanogens moreover with various redox potential sets in different replicates 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv methanogens might utilize different amounts of diverted energy to relieve the oxidative toxicity at different levels therefore requiring diverse methanogens to adapt to their orp specific cellular energy status actually antioxidant systems are critically important for poising the extra and intracellular redox milieus which are maintained far from equilibrium and reflect electron transfer and redox balance between cell membrane banerjee 2012 and a shift in environmental redox potential can impact the distribution of endogenous and exogenous ros as well as cellular redox status thereby regulating the associated metabolism adler et al 1999 hence the application of various sets of orp values in reps 1 2 and 3 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv might have led to the dominance of different methanogenic taxa methanosarcina methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum respectively in this study buan 2018 reported that methanogens required a reducing environment with a redox potential below 50 mv however the methanogenic species specific adaptation to various orp levels needs to be studied further 4 2 microbial survival niches under intermittent oxygen poor environments fig 3 illustrates an intermicrobial relationship in the intermittent microaerobic ad process and such microbial prevalence and interaction may also be shaped by the species specific growth properties on the one hand facultative heterotroph like proteiniphilum have both kinetic µm 13 2 vs 0 35 day 1 and thermodynamic g r 90 0 vs 0 0 kj e advantages over syntrophic fermenters i e syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidizing bacteria for degrading accumulated vfas lawrence and mccarty 1969 nguyen et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 on the other hand even though the facultative heterotrophic proteiniphilum and hydrogen oxidizing bacteria are at the same level in energy acquisition g r 90 0 vs 92 7 kj e the former grows much faster than the latter µm 13 2 vs 10 1 day 1 matassa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 thereby making them more competitive in oxygen scarce environments here the insufficient oxygen supply during microaerobic condition is reflected by the fact that vfas reduced but remained in the system hence the operational mode of picomolar oxygen injection by intermittently elevating orp of 25 mv above anaerobic baseline contributed to the predominance of facultative heterotroph proteiniphilum in the system in addition the niche difference between acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in orp controlled microaeration ecosystem is also of great interest in this study we observed that hydrogenotrophic pathway rather than acetoclastic one is more prevalent in the methanogens studied fig 1 implying the dominance of the hydrogenotrophic pathway here functional redundancy but taxonomic diversity was observed in the methanogenic archaeal communities the thermodynamic fundamentals underlying such hydrogenotrophic dominance could be similar to studies by dolfing et al 2008 and mayumi et al 2013 in which increased co2 partial pressure makes hydrogenotrophic pathway much more exergonic over acetoclastic one nevertheless contrary results on methanogenesis were found between our and their studies while we proposed hydrogenotrophic dominance they reported that the acetoclastic methanogens instead of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated in their co2 injected oil reservoir environment based on stable isotope based metabolic profiling and community analysis dolfing et al 2008 mayumi et al 2013 the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that whether syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob participated in the two scenarios co2 injection vs microaeration direct co2 injection drives more endergonic syntrophic acetate oxidation making it a rate limiting step for methanogenesis via hydrogenotrophic pathway mayumi et al 2013 meanwhile microaeration facilitates the exergonic aerobic acetate oxidation outcompeting the higher thermodynamic constraint of saob and promotes the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in this study low abundance of saob in our microbial community analysis supports the above illustration however further studies using a stable isotope based metabolic profiling as well as metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic analysis are needed to further explore these possibilities 4 3 engineering implications the underlying microbial mechanisms elucidated in this study support our earlier findings that intermittent every other day microaeration picomolar oxygen has significant potential to maintain digester stability neutral ph level with no alkalinity addition at high olrs in field applications this study demonstrates that a picomolar concentration of oxygen maybe sufficient to introduce the aerobic respiration in ad to rapidly scavenge accumulated vfas thus microaeration could be applied to other complex substrates and co digestion systems to enhance digester stability and to achieve higher methane yields although mixtures of oxygen and methane at oxygen concentrations of 5 15 by volume may have some safety concern the oxygen in gas phase of orp based microaeration system was often much less than 1 furthermore when adequate and standard safety measures are incorporated into plant design any significant threat from an explosion hazard can be minimized moreover microaeration may only be initiated when the digester shows signs of instability at high olr once the digester is brought back to stability microaeration could be ceased 5 conclusions this study revealed a robust analysis of metabolic networks between proteiniphilum affiliated bacteria and methanogenic archaea under picomolar oxygen conditions by intermittently setting orp at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline an approach that enabled efficient digestion of lignocellulosic biomass at high olr the cytochrome bd encoded in the nanaerobe proteiniphilum may periodically perform aerobic respiration to degrade the vfas accumulated during anaerobic fermentation so as to maintain stability at high olrs furthermore the ubiquitous presence of antioxidant enzymes in proteiniphilum affiliated bacteria and different methanogenic taxa may have contributed to detoxification of oxygen for stable methane yield however to verify the functional activities between swift aerobic anaerobic switch further investigations are necessary and would need to employ tools such as stable isotope probing sip metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic approaches in summary the metabolic pathway proposed here advances our insights in the microbial interactions in the intermittent microaerobic digestion and facilitates process design and operational

17278,intermittent every other day microaerobic picomolar oxygen by oxidation reduction potential orp set at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline digestion of lignocellulosic biomass showed higher digestibility and better stability at a high organic loading rate olr of 5 g volatile solids vs l d than that under strict anaerobic conditions however the microbial mechanisms supporting the delicate balance under microaeration remain underexplored on the basis of our previous findings that microbial communities in replicate experiments were dominated by strains of the genus proteiniphilum but contained diverse taxa of methanogenic archaea here we recovered related genomes and reconstructed the putative metabolic pathways using a genome centric metagenomic approach the highly enriched proteiniphilum strains were identified as efficient cellulolytic facultative bacterium which directly degraded lignocellulose to carbon dioxide formate and acetate via aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation alternatively moreover high oxygen affinity cytochromes bd type terminal oxidases in proteiniphilum strains were found to be closely associated with such picomolar oxygen conditions which has long been overlooked in anaerobic digestion furthermore hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the prevalent pathway for methane production while methanosarcina methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum were the dominant methanogens in the replicate experiments importantly the two functional groups namely cellulolytic facultative proteiniphilum strains and methanogens encoded various antioxidant enzymes energy dependent reactive oxygen species ros scavengers superoxide reductase sor and rubrerythrin rbr were ubiquitously present in different methanogenic taxa in response to replicate specific orp levels 470 450 and 475 mv collectively cytochrome bd oxidase and ros defenders may play roles in improving the digestibility and stability observed in intermittent

oxidation reduction potential orp 1 introduction in recent years anaerobic digestion ad of lignocellulosic biomass has drawn significant interest for sustainable bioenergy production sawatdeenarunat et al 2015 however the highly recalcitrant nature coupled with the heterogeneous structure of lignocellulosic feedstocks impedes their digestibility moreover long term ad operation with such feedstocks at high organic loading rates olrs usually leads to volatile fatty acids vfas build up subsequent ph drop and eventual system failure nguyen et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 recently these

et al 2009 johansen and bakke 2006 lim and wang 2013 nguyen and khanal 2018 nguyen et al 2019 specifically an oxidation reduction potential orp based oxygenation approach where the orp level varies linearly with the logarithmic dissolved oxygen do concentration allows for a more precise control of oxygen air injection far below 0 1 mg l into a digester orp based microaeration has been examined in fermentation industries for ethanol and butanol production liu et al 2013 its application in ad system however has been very limited khanal and huang 2003 nguyen et al 2019 in general successful biogas production in ad systems depends on an intricate balance between multiple functional microbial groups including hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea briones and raskin 2003 nevertheless injection of oxygen a redox active gas into ad system has been reported to stimulate the extracellular orp level thereby altering the intracellular redox balance and redirecting the metabolic pathways banerjee 2012 consequently reshaping the microbial community to achieve a new balance previous studies reported that microaeration led to a high abundance of firmicutes fu et al 2016 lim et al 2014 tang et al 2004 yin et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 since bacteria whining the firmicutes are known to produce extracellular enzymes such as cellulases lipases and proteases leven et al 2007 their high abundance is likely responsible for enhanced hydrolysis moreover archaeal population shifts were also observed and were attributed to species specific differences in oxygen tolerance fu et al 2016 tang et al 2004 when introducing o2 various reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide radical o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl

antioxidant enzymes e g superoxide dismutase sod superoxide reductase sor catalases cat peroxidases pxd peroxiredoxins prx and rubrerythrin rbr imlay 2008 hence the ros detoxification mechanism plays a vital role for facultative and obligate anaerobes to adapt to the microaerobic environments in ad systems fischer et al 2016 in a previous study we developed an orp based intermittent microaeration ad system with picomolar o2 addition by setting the orp 25 mv above the strict anaerobic baseline 470 450 475 mv every other day this system was fed with napier grass a typical lignocellulosic feedstock at an olr of 5 g vs l d and achieved a stable methane yield of 80 8 9 6 n ch4 ml volatile solids vs g using three independent replicates 16s rrna and mcra gene sequencing analyse showed that the microbial communities in three systems were dominated by the genus proteiniphilum but contained various methanogenic taxa this research led to several questions associated with such high rate ad of lignocellulose under intermittent microaerobic conditions 1 why was the same bacterial genus proteiniphilum prevalent but were diverse taxa of methanogens present in replicate systems 2 how was each microbial population able to switch to different carbohydrate degradation pathways to adapt to intermittent microaerobic environment and 3 how were the predominant anaerobes capable of oxygen tolerance to address these questions this study was carried out to identify the functional genes involved in critical pathways within the enriched microbiomes we used genome centric metagenomics to gain genomic insights into the highly abundant bacterial genus proteiniphilum and methanogens from two independent samples collected during orp based microaeration experiments four near complete proteiniphilum genomes and three methanogenic genomes were retrieved their metabolic pathways associated with lignocellulose degradation methane formation and oxygen detoxification were reconstructed the functional assignments from genome sequences of these key populations were mapped to understand their physiology and behavior related to methane production the knowledge obtained will enable biotechnological exploration of microbial interaction network under the orp controlled intermittent microaerobic strategy for digester design and operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and microbial sampling as described in our previous study nguyen et al 2019 a 2 0 l continuous stirred tank reactor cstr equipped with an orp based microaeration control system was used for digestion of napier grass a lignocellulosic biomass the cstr was fed with stepwise increase in olr from 1 5 to 5 0 g vs l day under anaerobic conditions and the reactor showed sign of instability when the olr reached 5 0 g vs l day intermittent microaeration was then initiated by injecting oxygen by controlling orp value at 25 mv above its corresponding anaerobic baseline every other day the experiments were replicated three times rep 1 rep 2 and rep 3 to confirm the reactor performance during anaerobic microaerobic experimental cycles using the same inoculum substrate and reactor operating conditions however orp value is extremely sensitive towards the availability of electron acceptors e g o2 nad and reducing equivalents e g nadh in the system and significantly affected by a slight variation in operating conditions such as ph electrical conductivity temperature etc thus different baseline orp values of 495 7 mv 475 15 mv and 500 20 mv were obtained in three independent replicates to achieve microaerobic condition the system orp was raised by 25 mv above the baseline orp in each replicate resulting in different orp values 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv in rep1 rep2 and rep3 respectively while reactor performance and microbial community 16s rrna gene based bacterial analysis and mcra gene based methanogen analysis under each scenario were examined in our previous study nguyen et al 2019 the current study evaluated the microaeration driven digestion pathway via metagenomic analysis here each sample was collected when its steady state microaeration performance was achieved no significant difference anova p 0 05 in each operating parameter during five consecutive days of operation in each replicate all collected samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 2 min and the pellets were stored at 80 c until further processing in this study only samples in rep 1 and rep 2 met the sequence criteria for metagenomic analysis whereas samples in rep 3 were discarded due to severe dna degradation the reference genome sequences based on community analysis data of rep 3 however were chosen for comparison in this study as well 2 2 dna extraction and sequencing genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturers protocols the quality and the quantity of the extracted dna were

the prepared libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2000 platform illumina san diego ca usa to generate 125 bp paired end sequencing reads 2 3 metagenomic assembly and binning raw paired end reads from the illumina hiseq 2000 platform were initially filtered using trimmomatic version 0 36 based on a minimum quality score of 30 a minimum sequence length of 76 bp and allowing for less than three ambiguous nucleotides ns bolger et al 2014 for each sample the trimmed clean paired end reads were further de novo assembled into long sequence contigs using spades version 3 9 0 based on the de bruijn graph with default settings k 19 33 47 61 75 bankevich et al 2012 nurk et al 2017 the quality of the assembled contigs was evaluated with quast version 4 5 gurevich et al 2013 then metagenomic contigs were clustered into genomic bins with maxbin based on an expectation maximization algorithm wu et al 2014 checkm version 1 0 18 was introduced to estimate the completeness and contamination of each draft genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes parks et al 2015

annotation and metabolic reconstruction gene prediction on the contigs assigned to a genomic bin was performed using the prodigal program hyatt et al 2010 incorporated prokka software seemann 2014 the annotations of these genome sequences were carried out by means of ko kegg orthology assignments using blastkoala server at kegg website which characterize individual gene functions and reconstruct kegg pathways inferring high level functions of the organism and the ecosystem kanehisa et al 2016 to predict genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes the carbohydrate active enzyme database cazy annotation web server dbcan was used yin et al 2012 2 5 data availability the metagenome sequencing reads have been submitted to the ncbi s sequence read archive under accession numbers samn13634953 to samn13634954 draft genomes obtained in this study have been deposited in ncbi s whole genome shotgun database under accession numbers jadlkj000000000 to jadlkp000000000 their functional annotations have further been deposited at the figshare online database https figshare com articles dataset microaerobic digestion genome annotation 13270487 all other relevant data are available in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 overview of metagenomic sequencing and binning high throughput sequencing yielded a total of 87 089 214 and 91 305 190 quality pair end reads in rep 1 and rep 2 respectively table s1 the assembly of resulting reads generated 237 059 and 58 704 contigs with n50 of 2 427 and 3 118 bp in rep1 and rep2 respectively table s1 the assemblies both with minimum length of 76 bp accounted for about 96 and 99 of their respective total quality reads suggesting their fair representativeness of microbial community in the bioreactor focusing on the prominent pathway during microaerobic digestion this study only investigated the core bacterial and methanogenic populations bacterial genus proteiniphilum repeatedly enriched with abundance of 31 8 64 5 and 43 2 respectively in rep1 rep 2 and rep3 and various methanogens methanosarcina 56 8 in rep1 methanobrevibacter 53 9 in rep2 and methanocorpusculum 45 9 in rep3 as elucidated in our previous community analysis nguyen et al 2019 as a result of metagenomic binning rep1 yielded two proteiniphilum genomes rep1 bin001 bin026 and two methanogenic genomes rep1 bin027 bin035 yet without genome of methanosarcina table 1 rep2 resulted in two genomes of proteiniphilum rep2 bin001 bin003 and one genome of methanobrevibacter rep2 bin008 table 1 for comparison and curation representative genomes of genera methanosarcina methanobrevibacter methanocorpusculum as well as proteiniphilum were chosen as references in our study ani analysis table s2 showed that rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin001 shared a genome similarity of 97 7 implying that highly reproducibility of bacterial population upon microaeration at orp of 25 mv above the anaerobic baseline in addition genomic mapping table s3 showed that the relative abundances of 43 4 of reads in rep1 and 84 5 of reads in rep2 were mapped to rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin001 respectively indicating their functional importance during microaeration 3 2 cellulose and xylan hydrolysis by proteiniphilum strains the observed enhanced degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in orp based microaeration ad system suggests that the highly abundant bacterial genus proteiniphilum is potentially responsible for polysaccharides hydrolysis especially cellulose and xylan four genomes belonging to this genus were retrieved and screened for the presence of carbohydrate active enzymes by applying the cazy annotation server dbcan for comparative purposes the genome of a phylogenetically closely related reference strain proteiniphilum saccharofermentans m3 6 lt605205 was also investigated results presented in figs 1 and 2 and table s4 indicate that all analyzed genomes harbor a diverse repertoire of enzymes involved in stepwise hydrolysis including glycoside hydrolases gh carbohydrate esterase ce and substrate specific carbohydrate binding motifs cbm among them strain rep2 bin003 comprised 239 such enzymes the highest among all four strains followed by strain rep2 bin001 and strain rep1 bin001 with 183 and 190 related enzymes respectively and strain rep1 bin026 containing the lowest with 153 enzymes the complete hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose requires a combination of several enzymes working synergistically endoglucanases and exoglucanases cellobiohydrolases initially cleave the β 1 4 glycosidic bonds of long chain cellulose and then β glucosidases bgl and cellobiose phosphorylases further break cellobioses into glucose monomers bhat and bhat 1997 doi and kosugi 2004 in this study the genomes of strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 encoded gh5 gh9 endoglucanases and gh3 β glucosidases bglx indicating their ability to hydrolyze cellulose completely similar to the reference strain m3 6 besides these three genomic bins contained an additional gh94 cellobiose phosphorylase allowing versatile pathways in cellulose degradation in addition cbm4 and cbm6 known to bind to cellulose extracellularly gilbert et al 2013 were also found in these three genomes but were not found in the reference strain m3 6 this suggests that the proteiniphilum strains enriched under intermittent microaerobic condition provided more efficient hydrolysis than that of strain m3 6 however strain rep1 bin026 lacked the enzyme cellulase xylan as the major polysaccharide of hemicellulose requires a synergistic action of endo 1 4 β xylanase xln and 1 4 β xylosidase bxl cleaving the backbone for hydrolysis and the accessory enzymes cleaving the side chains of the associated oligo di monosaccharides including α l arabinofuranosidase α glucuronidase acetyl xylan esterase and feruloyl esterase uffen 1997 in this study we found that strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 possessed the same enzymes responsible for xylan degradation but different from those present in strains rep1 bin026 and m3 6 strains rep1 bin001 rep2 bin001 and rep2 bin003 encoded gh10 xylanase xyna and gh43 xylosidase xynb moreover the three genomes also encoded accessory enzymes gh43 gh51 arabinofuranosidase abfa and gh67 glucuronidase agua for further xylan degradation into monosaccharides in addition the aforementioned cbm4 and cbm6 as well as cbm13 and cbm22 which were characterized by binding specificity for linear and branched decorated xylan gilbert et al 2013 were also detected however strain m3 6 lacked glucuronidase whereas strain rep1 bin026 lacked all xylan related enzymes therefore this analysis confirmed that proteiniphilum strains capable of degrading cellulose and hemicellulose xylan were actively enriched in the napier grass fed microaerobic digesters meanwhile the proteiniphilum strains also showed their versatility in hydrolysis pathways 3 3 carbohydrate degradation via alternative aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation by cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum strains considering the picomolar oxygen dosing every other day it is postulated that the microorganisms may activate micro aerobic and anaerobic metabolic switch alternatively to respond to the reducing equivalent change driven by direct oxygen variation to further elucidate this postulation the putative genes of the predominant proteiniphilum strains were assigned to both fermentation and respiration pathways in the kegg database figs 1 and 2 and table s4 given that lignocellulose hydrolysis yields hexose e g glucose and pentose e g xylose sugars their degradation pathways were investigated results showed that all four proteiniphilum genomes as well as the reference strain m3 6 encoded a series of enzymes for prominent central carbon metabolic routes i e the embden meyerhof parnas emp and the pentose phosphate pp pathways particularly genomes rep1 bin026 rep2 bin001 and strain m3 6 contained a full complement of genes for emp pathway whereas genomes rep1 bin001 and rep2 bin003 lacked enolase eno and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk respectively this could be attributed to the assembly gaps moreover in contrast to strain m3 6 all four recovered proteiniphilum genomes lacked transaldolase tal involved in the non oxidative pp pathway instead they might perform an alternative hexose pentose interconversion pathway in which only enzyme transketolase tkt in the pp pathway would be involved xylulose was catalyzed from xylose a pentose from xylan hydrolysis via the action of xylose isomerase xyla and xylulose kinase xylb as observed in all these genomes thus the proteiniphilum strains in this study may mainly use the emp pathway for hexose degradation or alternatively use the incomplete pp pathway integrated with the emp pathway for pentose degradation pyruvate the end product of emp pathway serves as a crucial intermediate in the central metabolic network linking fermentation or respiration for a better adaptation in different oxygen mediated redox environments genome analysis revealed that all four analyzed proteiniphilum genomes as well as the reference strain m3 6 harbored a number of enzymes for mixed acid fermentation from pyruvate they encoded pyruvate formate lyase pfld allowing formate and acetyl coa formation via non oxidative conversion meanwhile they also contained several ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductases pfor gene por or korab encoding for oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl coa anaerobically subsequently the aforementioned acetyl coa is capable of further converting into acetate via either a single step reaction by an acetyl coa synthetase acs or a two step reaction by phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetate kinase acka in all the four proteiniphilum genomes however all retrieved proteiniphilum strains lacked methylmalonyl coa carboxytransferase pccb enzyme in methylmalonyl coa pathway for propionate production while the strain m3 6 possessed this enzyme furthermore the common pathway for production of intermediates such as ethanol butyrate and lactate were incomplete or missing in these genomes as a result it is believed that the proteiniphilum strains studied can form formate and acetate via anaerobic fermentation although strain m3 6 have been verified to produce acetate and propionate hahnke et al 2016 fermentative propionate production in the proteiniphilum strains present in our experiments should be further examined by physiological studies in addition to anaerobic fermentation the proteiniphilum strains also encoded all major components involved in aerobic respiration including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdhc gene pdhab dlat and dld tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and electron transfer complex the pyruvate pdhc acted as a substitution of pfor for pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl coa but functioned under aerobic conditions ginger et al 2010 then tca cycle would further oxidize acetyl coa completely into co2 with addition of electron carriers nadh and fadh2 finally these electron carriers would pass their electrons into the electron transport chain and drive atp production through oxidative phosphorylation interestingly only one type of oxygen dependent terminal oxidases cytochrome bd quinol oxidases cydab was identified in the proteiniphilum strains as well as in the strain m3 6 since cytochrome bd quinol oxidase has much higher affinity towards o2 d mello and poole 1996 its presence suggests that the proteiniphilum strains could respire under extremely low oxygen environments to harvest more energy compared to under anaerobic conditions which was consistent with our experimental setup in which picomolar oxygen was injected by intermittently setting orp value at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline jointly the genomes of proteiniphilum strains contained complete sets of genes for versatile carbon and energy metabolism pathways including anaerobic aerobic pyruvate degradation pfor pdhc in central carbon metabolism fermentative acetate formate and propionate production tca cycle and electron transport oxidative phosphorylation system using cytochrome bd as terminal oxidase they provided the genetic potential for their facultative metabolism but might not grow well under high oxygen conditions known as nanareobes baughn and malamy 2004 however due to the favorable energy yield such nanaerobes were likely to prefer aerobic respiration rather than anaerobic fermentation under intermittent micro aerobic conditions 3 4 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis prevalence in our previous study the digester recovered from the verge of collapse when orp controlled microaeration was introduced nguyen et al 2019 reactor performance data showed that the addition of a picomolar level of oxygen prompted the degradation of accumulated vfas elevated the system ph value back to neutral level thereby increasing the methanogenic activity and subsequently the methane yield however contrary to consistent bacterial dominance the dominant methanogenic populations differed among the three microaeration replicates methanosarcina in rep1 methanobrevibacter in rep2 and methanocorpusculum in rep3 based on mcra gene analysis nguyen et al 2019 in order to investigate the major methanogenesis route this study retrieved methanogenic genomes figs 1 and 2 and table s4 rep1 yielded two genomes related to genera methanobacterium rep1 bin027 and methanobrevibacter rep1 bin035 without dominant methanosarcina but did not recover a genome consistent with the dominant methanosarcina rep2 produced one genome of methanobrevibacter rep2 bin008 the lack of genome recovery of the most abundant methanogen in rep1 may be attributed to the low abundance of methanogens 5 generally in digester communities de vrieze et al 2016 sundberg et al 2013 as well as strain heterogeneity among methanogens charuvaka and rangwala 2011 thus reference genomes of methanosarcina sp nc 003901 and methanocorpusculum sp nr 075452 were selected as methanogenic representatives in rep1 and rep3 respectively the genome of methanosarcina rep1 harbored hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways the methanobacterium genome rep1 beside hydrogenotrophic pathway also encoded acetyl coa synthetase acs and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase acds essential for the acetoclastic pathway however all known methanobacterium species are physiologically recognized as hydrogenotrophic methanogen boone 2001 where enzyme acds may function in reverse to carry out acetyl coa synthesis from co and methyl adam et al 2018 moreover the genera methanobrevibacter rep2 and methanocorpusculum rep3 genomes only encoded full hydrogenotrophic metabolism in addition genes for formate dehydrogenase fdh were identified in almost all genomes except in the methanosarcina genome indicating their ability to alternatively use formate as initial substrate and subsequently enter into hydrogenotrphic pathway collectively the hydrogenotrophic pathway was observed in all analyzed methanogen genomes 3 5 ros detoxification in proteiniphilum and methanogens since ros detoxification mechanism supported the adaptation of the putative proteiniphilum strains and methanogens under microaerobic conditions the occurrence of antioxidant genes in the genomes was also examined in this study figs 1 and 2 and table s4 all the analyzed proteiniphilum genomes encoded superoxide dismutase sod detoxifying the o2 and catalases cat glutathione peroxidases gpx and peroxiredoxins prx reducing the produced h2o2 table s2 which belong to energy free ros scavenger but allow new o2 production during their detoxification reaction martins et al 2019 for methanogens beside sod and cat gpx and prx energy dependent o2 scavenger superoxide reductase sor and energy dependent h2o2 scavenger rubrerythrin rbr were identified to be more ubiquitously present in their genomes table s2 in contrast energy dependent ros quenching by sor and rbr enable an advantage of no oxygen formation for anaerobes yet require additional energy sources with f420 as the ultimate electron donor in methanogens martins et al 2019 thus the predominant bacterial genus proteiniphilum and methanogenic archaea in the orp controlled microaeration ad system possessed a ros scavenging mechanism thereby providing a selective advantage under microaerobic conditions 3 6 mitigation of vfas accumulation by proteiniphilum and methanogens in intermittent microaerobic digestion based on the genome scale metabolic network reconstruction we consistently observed complement sets of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolyzing enzymes and facultative metabolic pathways in proteiniphilum genomes as well as prevalence of the hydrogenotrophic pathway in taxonomically diverse methanogens in replicate samples consequently cooperative interaction between proteiniphilum strains and methanogens is proposed as follows fig 2 1 proteiniphilum strains were involved in the breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose overcoming the rate limiting hydrolysis step 2 during intermittent microaerobic condition every other day when no oxygen was supplied vfas were produced by facultative proteiniphilum strains via anaerobic fermentation when oxygen was introduced the vfas were rapidly consumed by the same facultative proteiniphilum strains via aerobic respiration using cytochrome bd oxidase this reduces the stress on the rate limiting syntrophic reaction associated with vfa degrading syntrophs and h2 consuming methanogens 3 methane production can be achieved by taxonomically diverse methanogens 4 ros e g o2 and h2o2 scavengers are ubiquitously identified in both proteiniphilum strains and methanogens releasing the oxidative stress during microaerobic conditions 4 discussion our previous study demonstrated stable ad operation at high olrs using the strategy of intermittent every other day microaeration picomolar oxygen regulated by the orp level of 25 mv above anaerobic baseline nguyen et al 2019 within a 24 h microaerobic cycle an orp level of 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv was maintained in three independent replicates respectively in other words repeated start up shut down cycles of oxygen injection were executed and an approximate do level of 1 98 10 8 mg l or 0 62 pm was maintained during the microaerobic cycle nguyen et al 2019 we evaluated why the only dominant bacteria were proteiniphilum strains but a diverse range of methanogens were able todominate under intermittent exposure of picomolar oxygen in replicate experiments 4 1 oxygen resistance of cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum and diverse methanogens proteiniphilum strains encode solely one terminal oxidase cytochrome bd oxidase for direct oxygen consumption and energy conservation generally cytochrome bd is noteworthy for its high affinity to oxygen among different aerobic terminal oxidases d mello and poole 1996 baughn and malamy 2004 demonstrated that the cytochrome bd in the nanaerobe bacteroides fragilis was essential for its oxygen dependent growth at a concentration as low as 300 nm but inhibited its viability at concentrations higher than 2 µm furthermore due to the up expression of cytochrome bd oxidase under microaerobic conditions tseng et al 1996 escherichia coli was found to fuel the aerobic respiration at oxygen concentrations lower than 3 nm measurement based on precision sensor in addition an oxygen concentration as low as 0 05 nm was explored based on an oxygen flux modelling calculation stolper et al 2010 these findings are in agreements with our observation that cytochrome bd encoded proteiniphilum strains highly enriched at the extreme microaerobic condition of 0 62 pm more importantly this study proposes the occurrence of aerobic respiration at an oxygen level of one to two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported which shows much broader environmental range of aerobic organisms in the ecosystems however a time delayed gene regulatory network for fermentative and respiratory switch was observed in a cytochrome bd encoded e coli k 12 during the initial phase of transition from anaerobic to microaerobic conditions trotter et al 2011 in the study the introduction of oxygen resulted in an immediate inhibition of fnr controlled pfl anaerobic pyruvate fermentation but a 60 120 mins delay in induction of pdhr regulated pdhc activity aerobic pyruvate oxidation trotter et al 2011 hence it suggests that suitable oxygen exposure pattern i e 24 hr intermittent microaerobic operation is pivotal in alternative expression of metabolic switch between fermentation and aerobic respiration in proteiniphilum in addition to direct oxygen consumption antioxidant enzymes encoding genes e g sod cat gpx prx were also ubiquitous in proteiniphilum genomes implying that it has the ability to further scavenge the concurrent oxygen induced ross under microaerobic conditions overall the metabolism of cytochrome bd dependent aerobic respiration and oxygen detoxification contributed together to the oxygen tolerance of bacterium proteiniphilum in intermittent every other day oxygen limited picomolar level system based on these finds we hypothesize that the consistently predominant facultative bacterium proteiniphilum readily performs aerobic respiration during the oxygen supply period thereby releasing the stress of vfas accumulation which relies solely on syntrophs in traditional ad by converting a portion of vfas to co2 for methanogens though an aerobic respiration pathway was not found various antioxidant enzymes for both o2 and subsequent h2o2 detoxification were detected in the taxonomically diverse methanogens considering their close interaction with the facultative oxygen scavenger proteiniphilum it may rapidly consume the majority of the dissolved oxygen shielding the surrounding methanogenic cells from direct oxygen attack but releasing a small amount of ross during oxidative phosphorylation process for further toxic effects therefore this may induce the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes in the methanogens more intriguingly energy dependent o2 and h2o2 reductase f420 as ultimate electron donor sors and rbrs were more ubiquitously present in these methanogens than energy free ros scavengers sod cat gpx and prx although such energy dependent ros scavengers confer a selective advantage no new o2 production during detoxification reaction on anaerobes they need to divert the electron flow from their energy source in order to reduce oxidative stress jenney jr et al 1999 thorgersen et al 2012 reported that anaerobic archaea pyrococcus furiosus used electrons from sugar oxidation to reduce o2 via sor resulting in a decrease in fermentative h2 production on this basis electrons from methanogenesis that are normally used to generate ch4 were likely diverted to detoxify ros in the studied methanogens moreover with various redox potential sets in different replicates 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv methanogens might utilize different amounts of diverted energy to relieve the oxidative toxicity at different levels therefore requiring diverse methanogens to adapt to their orp specific cellular energy status actually antioxidant systems are critically important for poising the extra and intracellular redox milieus which are maintained far from equilibrium and reflect electron transfer and redox balance between cell membrane banerjee 2012 and a shift in environmental redox potential can impact the distribution of endogenous and exogenous ros as well as cellular redox status thereby regulating the associated metabolism adler et al 1999 hence the application of various sets of orp values in reps 1 2 and 3 470 mv 450 mv and 475 mv might have led to the dominance of different methanogenic taxa methanosarcina methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum respectively in this study buan 2018 reported that methanogens required a reducing environment with a redox potential below 50 mv however the methanogenic species specific adaptation to various orp levels needs to be studied further 4 2 microbial survival niches under intermittent oxygen poor environments fig 3 illustrates an intermicrobial relationship in the intermittent microaerobic ad process and such microbial prevalence and interaction may also be shaped by the species specific growth properties on the one hand facultative heterotroph like proteiniphilum have both kinetic µm 13 2 vs 0 35 day 1 and thermodynamic g r 90 0 vs 0 0 kj e advantages over syntrophic fermenters i e syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidizing bacteria for degrading accumulated vfas lawrence and mccarty 1969 nguyen et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 on the other hand even though the facultative heterotrophic proteiniphilum and hydrogen oxidizing bacteria are at the same level in energy acquisition g r 90 0 vs 92 7 kj e the former grows much faster than the latter µm 13 2 vs 10 1 day 1 matassa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2001 thereby making them more competitive in oxygen scarce environments here the insufficient oxygen supply during microaerobic condition is reflected by the fact that vfas reduced but remained in the system hence the operational mode of picomolar oxygen injection by intermittently elevating orp of 25 mv above anaerobic baseline contributed to the predominance of facultative heterotroph proteiniphilum in the system in addition the niche difference between acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in orp controlled microaeration ecosystem is also of great interest in this study we observed that hydrogenotrophic pathway rather than acetoclastic one is more prevalent in the methanogens studied fig 1 implying the dominance of the hydrogenotrophic pathway here functional redundancy but taxonomic diversity was observed in the methanogenic archaeal communities the thermodynamic fundamentals underlying such hydrogenotrophic dominance could be similar to studies by dolfing et al 2008 and mayumi et al 2013 in which increased co2 partial pressure makes hydrogenotrophic pathway much more exergonic over acetoclastic one nevertheless contrary results on methanogenesis were found between our and their studies while we proposed hydrogenotrophic dominance they reported that the acetoclastic methanogens instead of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated in their co2 injected oil reservoir environment based on stable isotope based metabolic profiling and community analysis dolfing et al 2008 mayumi et al 2013 the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that whether syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob participated in the two scenarios co2 injection vs microaeration direct co2 injection drives more endergonic syntrophic acetate oxidation making it a rate limiting step for methanogenesis via hydrogenotrophic pathway mayumi et al 2013 meanwhile microaeration facilitates the exergonic aerobic acetate oxidation outcompeting the higher thermodynamic constraint of saob and promotes the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in this study low abundance of saob in our microbial community analysis supports the above illustration however further studies using a stable isotope based metabolic profiling as well as metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic analysis are needed to further explore these possibilities 4 3 engineering implications the underlying microbial mechanisms elucidated in this study support our earlier findings that intermittent every other day microaeration picomolar oxygen has significant potential to maintain digester stability neutral ph level with no alkalinity addition at high olrs in field applications this study demonstrates that a picomolar concentration of oxygen maybe sufficient to introduce the aerobic respiration in ad to rapidly scavenge accumulated vfas thus microaeration could be applied to other complex substrates and co digestion systems to enhance digester stability and to achieve higher methane yields although mixtures of oxygen and methane at oxygen concentrations of 5 15 by volume may have some safety concern the oxygen in gas phase of orp based microaeration system was often much less than 1 furthermore when adequate and standard safety measures are incorporated into plant design any significant threat from an explosion hazard can be minimized moreover microaeration may only be initiated when the digester shows signs of instability at high olr once the digester is brought back to stability microaeration could be ceased 5 conclusions this study revealed a robust analysis of metabolic networks between proteiniphilum affiliated bacteria and methanogenic archaea under picomolar oxygen conditions by intermittently setting orp at 25 mv above anaerobic baseline an approach that enabled efficient digestion of lignocellulosic biomass at high olr the cytochrome bd encoded in the nanaerobe proteiniphilum may periodically perform aerobic respiration to degrade the vfas accumulated during anaerobic fermentation so as to maintain stability at high olrs furthermore the ubiquitous presence of antioxidant enzymes in proteiniphilum affiliated bacteria and different methanogenic taxa may have contributed to detoxification of oxygen for stable methane yield however to verify the functional activities between swift aerobic anaerobic switch further investigations are necessary and would need to employ tools such as stable isotope probing sip metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic approaches in summary the metabolic pathway proposed here advances our insights in the microbial interactions in the intermittent microaerobic digestion and facilitates process design and operational

17279,aquaculture systems receive intensive carbon c and nitrogen n loadings and are therefore recognized as major anthropogenic sources of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions however the extensively managed aquaculture ponds were identified as a hotspot of ch4 emission but just a weak n2o source here we investigate annual ch4 and n2o fluxes from three earthen ponds used for crab culture of different sizes in southeast china our purposes are to identify the spatiotemporal variations of ch4 and n2o emissions and their components among ponds and to evaluate the zone for ch4 and n2o production static chamber measured ch4 flux ranged from 0 03 to 64 7 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 average 9 02 14 3 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 and temperature followed by dissolved organic c doc concentration and redox potential were the primary drivers of seasonal ch4 flux patterns annual mean diffusive ch4 flux was 1 80 2 34 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 and that by ebullition was up to 7 20 12 0 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 flux annual ch4 emission was positively correlated with sediment doc concentration but negatively p 0 05 correlated with water depth across ponds with the highest ch4 emission occurred in a pond with low water depth and high doc concentration the calculated diffusive n2o flux by the gas transfer velocity was 0 32 0 60 times greater than the measured n2o emission suggesting that n2o in water column can not only evade as water air fluxes but diffuse downwards and to be consumed in anaerobic sediments this also indicates that n2o was primarily produced in water column the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments can limit n2o production from both nitrification and denitrification but favor n2o consumption leading the ponds to become a weak source of n2o annually and even a sink of n2o in summer our results highlight that the current global ch4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and underestimation of the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux in small lentic waters the downwards n2o diffusion from the water column into sediment also indicates that the extensively used model approach based on gas transfer velocity potentially overestimates n2o fluxes especially in small eutrophic aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquaculture ponds methane nitrous oxide diffusion ebullition 1 introduction although lakes and ponds occupy only a small fraction of the earth s surface they play disproportionally large role in the global carbon c and nitrogen n cycles cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 by virtue of receiving large inputs of terrestrial organic c and n these inland waters are recognized as important atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o sources although a considerable portion of the terrestrially organic c can be buried in their sediment mendonça et al 2017 inland waters are 2 3 fold greater c sources than c sinks for the atmosphere at the global scale cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 annually lentic inland waters emit 1 10 pg and 0 11 pg of co2 and ch4 respectively bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 however the latter value may be an underestimation for two key reasons 1 the global extent of small ponds is particularly difficult to map resulting in their exclusion from greenhouse gas ghg budget estimates holgerson and raymond 2016 and 2 although ebullition bubbles of ch4 accounts for a large proportion of the total ch4 flux from inland waterways the challenge of measuring such episodic events reduces the accuracy of ebullitive ch4 flux estimates bastviken et al 2004 yet c and ghg processing in small waterbodies have been emphasized particularly because of their unique physical properties such as shallow water and frequent mixing downing 2010 wu et al 2019 according to holgerson and raymond 2016 very small ponds with areas 0 001 km2 account for 41 of all global diffusive ch4 emissions despite comprising only 8 6 of global lakes and ponds based on area in addition wik et al 2016 suggested that ebullition 8 61 tg ch4 yr 1 accounted for 40 5 72 0 of the total ch4 emissions from lakes and ponds at high northern latitudes which was equivalent to 37 4 of all the natural ch4 sources in the regions however uncertainties arise due to the relatively scarce ebullition data applied in such estimates inland small waterbodies are also important sites of n processing for instance although waterbodies with sizes in the 0 001 0 01 km2 range account for only 6 80 of global lakes and reservoirs by area they contribute to 25 of n removal from global watersheds harrison et al 2009 and therefore are considered significant components of global n2o budgets baulch et al 2011 harrison and matson 2003 global n2o emissions from inland freshwaters are estimated to be 1 51 tg n2o year 1 representing 15 of anthropogenic n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 delsontro et al 2018 however current n2o emission estimates from small waterbodies 0 01 km2 remain unreliable due to scarce data only 8 published reports from these systems are included in the 309 synthesized global lentic n2o measurements delsontro et al 2018 although more n2o data for these systems were reported recently yang et al 2020a uncertainty with respect to n2o emissions from lentic small waterbodies is further exacerbated by the highly variable nature of freshwater n2o flux across temporal and spatial scales and an inadequate understanding of the factors driving n2o uptake at the surfaces of freshwater ecosystems soued et al 2016 webb et al 2019 n2o flux tends to increase with increases in n inputs consequently current regional and global estimates of freshwater n2o fluxes assume linear increases in n2o emissions with an increase in dissolved inorganic n din loads into such systems indeed some of the highest n2o emissions have been reported in agricultural drainage waters that receive excess n in runoff from surrounding pasture and croplands hama aziz et al 2017 harrison and matson 2003 however widespread n2o uptake has also been documented in small eutrophic reservoirs in agricultural areas in canada webb et al 2019 recently n2o emissions from boreal lakes were reported to increase with an increase in lake size although small lakes had higher din concentrations relative to bigger lakes kortelainen et al 2020 soued et al 2016 such inconsistent results highlight the complexity of the multiple microbial processes driving aquatic n2o flux to better estimate global aquatic n2o budgets it is necessary to explore the rates and drivers of n2o flux under diverse aquatic ecosystems excavated earthen ponds are critical aquatic systems for aquaculture production contributing 87 0 of the global freshwater aquaculture volume yuan et al 2019 upon the increasing demand for animal proteins and the high economic returns of aquaculture converting to these artificial ponds is one of the major trajectories of land use change in many developing countries fao 2016 paddy fields in china and mangrove forests in southeast asia are increasingly and will continue being transformed into aquaculture ponds liu et al 2016 consequently the volume of production and area for freshwater aquaculture has been steadily rising since 1980s yuan et al 2019 aquaculture ponds receive intensive c and n loads associated with aquafeed application combined with their shallow and frequent mixing attributes they are recognized as major sources of anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions hu et al 2012 williams and crutzen 2010 yang et al 2020b moreover bioturbation by benthivorous animals influences nutrient and physicochemical status in sediment in turn regulating ch4 and n2o production consumption and transportation processes in aquaculture ponds for instance bioturbation by benthic fauna may strongly favor the penetration of oxygen o2 into sediment layers which increases ch4 oxidation and n2o production oliveria junior et al 2019 svensson 1998 conversely physical sediment disturbance could trigger ebullition or prevent the build up of gas bubbles and in turn increase or decrease emulative ch4 and n2o emissions oliveria junior et al 2019 yang et al 2020b our previous findings have suggested that the conversion of traditional paddy fields to extensively managed crab eriocheir sinensis ponds could increase ch4 emissions drastically by up to 248 yuan et al 2019 in contrast n2o fluxes from crab ponds were not only significantly lower than those from paddy fields but also lower than those from an adjacent large shallow lake tai lake wang et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 here we examine ch4 and n2o fluxes from three neighboring crab ponds with different sizes over one year in the tai lake basin 31 02 n 120 25 e suzhou china the objectives of the present study were to i obtain insights into the components diffusive and ebullitive of ch4 and n2o emissions from crab ponds ii investigate the heterogeneity of ch4 and n2o emissions and the contributions of different pathways across ponds and iii investigate the influence of water and sediment parameters on seasonal ch4 and n2o fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were carried out in three adjacent crab ponds cp in the tai lake basin suzhou china fig s1 the ponds are of different sizes table 1 but were all converted from paddy fields in 2001 into chinese mitten crab e sinensis aquaculture ponds the experimental region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with long

however paddy fields have been converted into aquaculture ponds rapidly since the 1980s zhang et al 2009 2 2 experimental design and field management one year round field experiments were conducted from march 2013 to march 2014 similar management practices were adopted in all ponds and they have been described in detail in a previous study yuan et al 2019 briefly chinese mitten crab monoculture was carried out at a stocking density of 15 000 ind ha 1 crabs were fed with commercial feed pellets 2 050 kg ha 1 annually purina co ltd jiaxing china trash fish 1 250 kg ha 1 and corn seeds 1 150 kg ha 1 twice a day at 9 00 a m and at 17 00 p m until the crabs were harvested the ponds were fertilized with cake manure urea compound fertilizer and calcium superphosphate at the annual rates of 40 130 100 and 200 kg ha 1 respectively to stimulate phytoplankton and macrophyte production cake manure was applied one time on march 29 whereas the latter three fertilizers were applied with four splits of 25 25 25 25 on march 29 june 5 august 12 and september 27 2013 annual c and n inputs into crab ponds were 1 20 mg c ha 1 and 244 kg n ha 1 respectively snails bellamya quadrata were introduced into the ponds twice at rates of 600 and 400 kg ha 1 on april 4 and june 20 respectively to filter feed residues and provide supplementary food for crabs water was constantly retained in the ponds all year round while the water depth wd varied across the three ponds the submerged western macrophyte elodea nuttallii was planted in ponds to provide molting shelter and food for crabs crab harvest began from 1 to 30 october 2013 and yield was expressed as fresh weight 2 3 measurement of ch4 and n2o fluxes in each pond wooden boardwalks 10 m were installed perpendicular to the shore to facilitate gas sampling activities and the measurement of auxiliary parameters fig s2 the static closed chamber technique was used to measure the ghg flux a specially designed system which included four stainless steel pegs for fixing the system and two adjustable crossbars for holding chamber collars were installed along the boardwalks to minimize the influence of water waves on gas sampling activities and results three pvc chamber collars were placed on the crossbars and would be adjusted to the water table one day before sampling if necessary see yuan et al 2015 for further detailed information on the devices ch4 and n2o flux was measured twice weekly during the crab production period from march to october and weekly during the period without crab from november to february gas sampling was conducted at 08 00 10 00 local time to minimize diurnal variation in flux patterns when sampling a transparent plexiglass chamber 50 cm 50 cm 15 cm was fitted into the water troughs of the chamber collars four gas samples of the chamber headspace were drawn using a 50 ml syringe 0 10 20 and 30 min after closure and injected into the 22 ml pre evacuated glass vials the air temperature inside the chamber was simultaneously measured with a mercury thermometer ch4 and n2o concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 santa clara ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for ch4 and a 63ni electron capture detector for n2o the gas standards were provided by the national research center for certified reference materials beijing china the accuracy of the ghg concentration measurements was 0 5 based on repeated measurements of gas standards ghg flux was calculated using linear least squares fit to the four points in the time series of concentrations for each plot data were omitted if the slope of the linear fitting had an r 2 0 90 cumulative emissions were calculated by linear interpolation between measurement days 2 4 estimation of diffusive and ebullitive ch4 and n2o flux water samples from the crab ponds were collected 10 cm below the surface of the water using a syringe and approximately 11 ml was injected into the 22 ml pre evacuated glass vials and then pure n2 gas was injected into vials to a pressure of 1 0 atm vials were shaken vigorously for 5 min to degas them subsequently gas samples were taken from the headspace for ch4 and n2o analyses concentrations of gases dissolved in water were corrected for dilution and calculated according to henry s law using ch4 values from wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 and n2o values from weiss and price 1980 the diffusive ch4 and n2o flux f m d at the water air interfaces of ponds was calculated using the transfer coefficient method based on the bulk diffusion model

ch4 fluxes from inland lentic waterbodies consist of ebullition and diffusive fluxes therefore ebullitive ch4 flux is the difference between total and diffusive ch4 fluxes 2 5 auxiliary measurements

nonparametric rank correlation was used to describe relationships between ch4 or n2o emissions and the geochemical or hydrological properties of the ponds the quality of fit of equations was judged by the coefficient of determination r 2 and its statistical significance was determined using fisher s f test 3 results 3 1 weather conditions water depth and phenology air temperature at the experimental site exhibited strong seasonal trends fig 1 a with an annual mean of 18 0 c which was 1 5 c higher than the 30 year mean 16 5 c measured at the dongshan meteorological station 5 km away from the experimental site annual precipitation was 987 mm which was lower than the 30 year average of 1176 mm by 16 1 mean ts in crab ponds ranged from 18 9 to 19 2 c fig 1b water depths of the ponds were maintained above 0 5 m all year round fig 1c cp1 had the highest wd 1 60 m followed by cp3 1 34 m and cp2 1 19 m table 1 the eh in pond sediment ranged from 271 to 20 6 286 to 22 7 and 255 to 29 7 mv in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively fig 1d annual mean eh in cp1 160 mv and cp3 145 mv was significantly lower p 0 01 than that in cp2 125 mv 3 2 mineral n and doc dynamics in pond sediment sediment nh4 n concentrations in crab ponds were generally 50 mg n kg 1 and no distinct temporal trends were observed fig 2 a the mean nh4 n concentration in sediment in cp2 was 165 mg n kg 1 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in cp1 and cp3 in contrast no3 n concentrations in sediment were generally below the detection limit of 0 015 mg n kg 1 small peaks of no3 n were only observed after fertilization fig 2b sediment doc concentrations increased during the crab growth period fig 2c mean sediment doc concentration in cp2 was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in cp1 and cp3 table 1 3 3 dissolved ch4 concentration and ch4 flux components ch4 concentrations were supersaturated in waters across all ponds and all sampling dates with an overall mean concentration of 3 76 μmol l 1 equal to a 1 437 fold supersaturation 21 6 080 fold supersaturation fig 3 a summertime ch4 concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in winter such extreme ch4 supersaturations made the crab ponds substantial sources of diffusive ch4 and the fluxes were 0 03 8 38 0 26 9 69 and 0 08 7 27 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively fig 3c diffusive ch4 flux in the three ponds had similar fluctuation trends with ch4 flux increasing gradually after crab stocking peaking just before crab capture in mid september thereafter they declined and remained at relatively low levels 0 03 2 43 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 during the period without crab in winter and in early spring total water air ch4 fluxes also exhibited similar seasonal trends however the values were much higher than those of diffusive ch4 fluxes fig 3e annual mean ch4 fluxes in cp1 cp2 and cp3 were 9 02 14 3 and 9 46 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 respectively which were 3 31 4 43 fold higher than diffusive ch4 fluxes annual total ch4 emissions ranged from 795 to 1259 kg ch4 ha 1 in the three ponds with 88 3 92 6 of the emissions occurring during the crab production period fig 4 a cp2 had the highest ch4 emission rates which were significantly higher than the emissions in cp1 and cp3 p 0 05 similarly most of the diffusive ch4 emissions in the crab production period and cumulative emission via diffusion was significantly higher in cp2 than in the other two ponds however diffusive ch4 emissions 158 205 kg ch4 ha 1 only accounted for 16 5 20 9 of the total ch4 emissions while 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 emissions was attributable to ebullition fig 4c 3 4 dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux components during the one year study period n2o concentrations ranged from 1 97 to 38 1 nmol l 1 across all ponds which is equivalent to 27 5 460 of the atmospheric equilibrium value fig 3b approximately 69 4 of the surface water samples were supersaturated with n2o that is the ponds were mostly sources of diffusive n2o n2o concentrations generally peaked following the application of urea however under saturation of n2o was observed frequently during july to september suggesting that crab ponds can act as n2o sinks in summer indeed the calculated diffusive n2o flux was the lowest negative in august but was generally much higher positive in winter and in spring fig 3d the n2o flux measured using static chambers was generally 10 μg n2o m 2 h 1 and had a seasonal pattern similar to that of the calculated diffusive flux fig 3f however the annual mean n2o fluxes measured was 1 47 3 78 and 2 21 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively which accounted for only 29 6 57 6 of the calculated diffusive flux annual n2o emissions ranged from 0 19 to 0 43 kg n2o ha 1 in the ponds with 45 9 of the emissions occurring during periods without crab fig 4b although this period was only 143 days unlike ch4 emission annual n2o emission was significantly lower in cp1 than in cp2 and cp3 p 0 05 similarly annual diffusive n2o emission was lowest in cp1 and highest in cp3 however the calculated diffusive n2o emissions were 0 32 0 60 times greater than the measured n2o emissions fig 4b suggesting that the supersaturated n2o in surface water can not only escape in the form of water air fluxes but can also be consumed in deeper layers or sediment 3 5 factors influencing ch4 and n2o emissions and their components correlations between total ch4 flux and ts wd and doc concentration were significant in all three ponds p 0 05 while eh was only correlated with total ch4 flux in cp1 table 2 when data from the three ponds were combined for stepwise multiple regression analysis ts followed by doc concentration and eh were the primary factors driving the seasonal total ch4 flux trends table 3 annual total ch4 emissions decreased exponentially with an increase in wd fig 5 a but had positive relationships p 0 05 with eh and doc concentrations fig 5b c furthermore the contribution of ebullition to total ch4 emissions was negatively p 0 05 correlated with wd fig 6 a the measured n2o flux was positively correlated with eh and negatively correlated with wd and doc concentrations in cp1 and cp2 p 0 05 but not in cp3 when combining data from the three ponds n2o flux was also negatively correlated with ts p 0 05 table 2 according to the stepwise multiple regression analysis results doc concentration followed by eh and ts could explain 18 9 of the temporal variation in n2o flux p 0 01 table 3 annual n2o emissions were negatively correlated with mean wd and positively correlated with eh among ponds p 0 05 while they were not significantly correlated with doc or mineral n concentrations fig 5 the ratio of diffusive n2o emission to total n2o emission exhibited a weak marginally significantly increasing trend with an increase in mean wd p 0 10 fig 6b although the total ch4 or n2o flux was not correlated with ws table 2 results from a partial correlation analysis show that both diffusive ch4 and n2o flux had a significant relationship with ws when removing the effect of dissolve ch4 and n2o concentrations table s1 4 discussion aquaculture systems receive intensive c and n loads that originate from feed application unconsumed feed and feces of animals which in turn provide abundant substrates for ghg production hu et al 2012 yang et al 2020b in previous study we have reported that converting traditional paddy fields to these experimental aquaculture ponds dramatically increased the net global warming potential from 8 15 to 28 0 mg co2eq ha 1 these freshwater aquaculture ponds which unequipped with aeration systems represented a critical source of ghg emission where ch4 n2o and co2 accounted 96 3 0 31 and 3 34 for the total emission respectively yuan et al 2019 eutrophic waters have been documented can act as both co2 source and sink which depends on the balance of organic c burial and mineralization almeida et al 2016 indeed the studied crab ponds are a weak co2 source annually but can be co2 sink during the summer time yuan et al 2019 in this study our main focus is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the intense ch4 but negligible n2o emissions from the shallow small and extensively managed freshwater aquaculture ponds 4 1 ch4 emission heterogeneity among aquaculture ponds in addition to intensive c inputs shallow water environments and frequent mixing in such human excavated earthen ponds imply more rapid gaseous exchange with the atmosphere and less time for ch4 removal by oxidation holgerson and raymond 2016 consequently aquaculture systems especially earthen ponds are considered potentially substantial sources of anthropogenic ch4 emissions rutegwa et al 2019 our findings demonstrate that the crab ponds which were unequipped with aerators were year round sources of ghg with particularly high ch4 emissions the areal ch4 emitted by these ponds 962 kg ch4 ha 1 not only fell within the far top end of the global range of 25 0 971 kg ch4 ha 1 from inland freshwater ecosystems bastviken et al 2011 but was also higher than the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 default emission factors for permanently inundated temperate wetlands 572 kg ch4 ha 1 and tropical inland freshwater wetlands 900 kg ch4 ha 1 respectively therefore our results highlight that earthen aquaculture ponds are ch4 emission hotspots the primary reason for such high ch4 emissions can be attributed to the high availability of labile organic substrates in our previous study yuan et al 2019 sedimentary organic c deposits were estimated to be 1 04 mg c ha 1 approximately 84 0 of the total c inputs were from feeds and fertilizers leading to extremely high doc levels in sediment table 1 secondly organic compounds in the feed remnants and feces such as starch and protein contain higher amounts of labile organic c than plant residues such as stems and roots in natural freshwater ecosystems they can be more easily decomposed into methanogenic substrates thirdly the permanently inundated crab ponds created ideal anaerobic environments for methanogensis in sediments fig 2d altor and mitsch 2008 reported that ch4 emissions from permanently inundated wetlands with emergent macrophytes were remarkably higher than in intermittently flooded wetlands with the higher emissions attributed to lower eh in continuously anoxic wetlands annual ch4 emissions in cp2 were significantly higher than those in cp1 and cp3 however contrary to our expectations there was a positive correlation between annual ch4 emission and eh indicating that higher ch4 emission in cp2 were not primarily controlled by sediment eh probably because sediment eh in permanently inundated pond was well within the optimal range for ch4 production 100 to 150 mv gaunt et al 1997 in the present study annual ch4 emission was significantly correlated with doc concentration and negatively correlated with wd fig 5 in general relatively shallow wds in freshwater ponds are suitable for growth of submerged macrophytes e g western waterweed in the present study korschgen et al 1997 macrophytes can release o2 into water and sediments which would elevate sediment eh reduce ch4 production and accelerate ch4 oxidation in addition to providing substrate such as debris and exudates that would increase ch4 production carmichael et al 2014 fritz et al 2011 substrates for acetoclastic methanogenesis are derived primarily from the photosynthates of live plants in some freshwater wetlands ström et al 2005 in this study we did not measure macrophyte biomass in crab ponds however the relatively high doc levels in cp2 sediment suggested that photosynthates partly if not solely support ch4 production since the application rates of feed and fertilizer were identical across the three crab ponds 4 2 role of ebullition in ch4 emissions from crab ponds notably annual ch4 emissions in cp2 were 0 53 0 66 times higher than the rates in cp1 and cp3 while annual mean doc concentrations were only 0 14 0 19 times higher in cp2 this discrepancy indicates that other factors besides doc regulated the heterogeneity of ch4 emissions among ponds generally during the ch4 diffusion in water body of lakes up to 99 of the ch4 produced was oxidized bastviken et al 2008 in contrast ch4 transport via bubbling could escape to the atmosphere rapidly and evade oxidation in this study although surface waters were 1 389 to 1 474 fold supersaturated with ch4 relative to the concentrations in the atmosphere diffusive ch4 emissions accounted for only 16 5 20 9 of the total ch4 emissions fig 4c therefore although the dissolved ch4 concentrations in cp2 were 18 0 26 2 greater than the concentrations in cp1 and cp3 diffusive flux comprised only a small proportion of the relatively higher ch4 emissions in cp2 on the contrary ebullition accounted for 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 emissions in the crab ponds and the higher proportions in cp2 88 0 91 0 relative to in cp1 and cp3 can be attributed to ebullitive ch4 emissions fig 4a nevertheless the contribution of ebullition to the total ch4 emissions had a negative correlation with wd fig 6a apparently the shallow wd in cp2 could have facilitated greater ebullition than in cp1 and cp3 due to relatively low hydrostatic pressure in cp2 bastviken et al 2004 in turn allowing the ch4 produced to escape into the atmosphere more easily particularly annual mean ch4 concentrations 3 34 4 51 μmol l 1 in the crab ponds are well within the 1 70 7 57 μmol l 1 range in small waterbodies 0 01 km2 based on a global survey of lakes by size holgerson and raymond 2016 meanwhile our estimates of diffusive ch4 fluxes 1 86 2 48 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 from the ponds were similar to the averages 0 65 2 28 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 reported for waterbodies within the same size class holgerson and raymond 2016 small lakes and ponds are suggested to have a disproportionately large contribution to global diffusive ch4 flux holgerson and raymond 2016 however since bubbling is very frequent and diffusion contributed to only a small proportion of the ch4 emissions from small lakes and ponds when compared to in larger lakes bastviken et al 2004 such shallow lentic waterbodies should account for a larger share in global aquatic ch4 inventories than current estimates that are based on traditional upscaling approaches delsontro et al 2018 4 3 potential impacts of crab disturbance on ch4 emissions we found that the crab yield tended to decrease as mean wd become shallower table 1 suggesting that the relatively lower wd in cp2 might depress yield of crab generally in the earlier stage of crab rearing april and may in this study wd should be kept in relative high level 1 2 1 5 m to reduce the stress reactions of crabs which were caused by the temperature difference between day and night dai et al 2020 hong et al 2007 the relative lower wd of cp2 in april and may 0 5 m might reduce the survival rate and consequently yield of crab despite the fact that stocking density and feed input were at the same rates in the three ponds in aquatic systems the bioturbation of benthivorous fauna can influence redox status and physicochemical parameters in sediment in turn regulating ch4 production consumption and transport bezerra et al 2020 oliveria junior et al 2019 however this influence remains controversial in the literature with authors disagreeing as to whether bioturbation leads to stimulation or inhibition to ch4 emission oliveira junior et al 2019 found that the existence of benthivorous fish reduced ch4 emission by 62 1 in an experiment mesocosm probably due to sediment oxygenation and preventing build up of gas bubbles in sediments as discussed above sediment eh in the three ponds was well within the optimal range for ch4 production this indicated that presence of crabs did not greatly if any enhance sediment eh and suppress ch4 production probably due to high doc level in contrast leal et al 2007 found that the bioturbation of campsurus notatus increased the sediment water ch4 flux by 307 457 times in a tropical lake when compared to the sediment core without campsurus notatus bezerra et al 2020 found a significant positive relationship between benthic chaoborus larvae density and the bubbling frequency and ebullitive ch4 flux in a tropical reservoir suggesting that the chaoborus driven physical disturbance could trigger bubbling thereby enhancing ebullitive ch4 emission consistently yang et al 2017 2020b pointed out that the disturbance from shrimps could trigger ebullition from a brackish aquaculture pond resulting in ebullitive fluxes accounting for over 90 of the total ch4 emission here we found that the relative contribution of ebullitive ch4 emission in the crab ponds was as high as 83 5 which is not only higher than the estimates 40 60 based on a survey of 73 lakes bastviken et al 2004 but also higher than the values measured from some small eutrophic waters almeida et al 2016 van bergen et al 2019 hence we speculated that the presence of crabs stimulated ch4 release from these ponds in this study the relative contribution of ebullitive ch4 emission in cp2 was just 2 48 4 38 higher than in cp1 and cp3 fig 4 although mean wd in cp2 was 11 2 25 6 lower table 1 we assume that there is a trade off impact between the hydraulic pressure and bioturbation on ebullitive ch4 emission that is the relative lower wd favors ebullition in cp2 but the lower bioturbation with lower crab density in cp2 could partly offset the stimulation effect of lower wd on ebullition when compared to cp1 and cp3 4 4 regulars for the variations of n2o flux the n pollution and global eutrophication are predicted to increase n2o emissions from freshwater ecosystems seitzinger and kroeze 1998 and current regional and global estimates of freshwater n2o fluxes assume a linear increase of n2o emissions with din loading to aquatic systems baron et al 2013 ipcc 2013 seitzinger et al 2000 aquaculture ponds are often eutrophic nutrient rich waterbodies because of the intensive c and n inputs from aquafeeds application and fertilization therefore we supposed they were important anthropogenic n2o sources however our findings suggest that the extensively managed crab ponds just acted as weak n2o sources even n2o sinks in summer fig 3 and the fluxes could not be well predicted with any of the n forms measured than previously thought tables 2 and 3 nevertheless the emission factor for applied n efn in the crab ponds 0 09 was much lower than the ipcc default values 0 25 0 75 for inland waterbodies although some researchers have argued these values are either too high or too low maavara et al 2019 soued et al 2016 has pointed out that our understanding of freshwater n2o fluxes remains fragmented and with a biased towards n rich lotic systems rivers and streams located in temperate regions the assumed linear relationship between n2o emissions with dissolved din loading exists in lotic systems might not be fitted to lentic systems moreover current n2o estimates from freshwaters is based on a fixed n2o yield unit of n2o produced per n processed whereas measured values span two orders of magnitude 0 0002 to 0 07 beaulieu et al 2011 mccrackin and elser 2011 this range highlights that in addition to n availability other controls on aquatic microbial n processes such as o2 levels c availability temperature and ph can also regulate n2o fluxes from freshwater systems microbial denitrification and nitrification have been identified as the major n2o producing pathways in freshwater systems schlesinger 2009 but the net n2o flux depends on the balance between production and consumption of n2o nitrification is an aerobic process that oxidizes nh4 n to no3 n and releases n2o as a by product whereas denitrification can either produce n2o or transform it into n2 in a final reaction favored under highly reduced anoxic conditions in the lotic systems the near atmospheric equilibrium concentration of dissolved o2 can facilitate water column n2o production via nitrification beaulieu et al 2015 richardson et al 2004 whereas the hypoxic condition of the sediment water interface minor amounts of o2 can suppress the reduction of n2o without inhibiting its production via denitrification laverman et al 2010 therefore flowing waters generally have an elevated n2o yield and increased din loading can stimulate n2o productions and emissions from these systems beaulieu et al 2015 in small lentic systems in contrast their anaerobic sediment condition can limit nitrification rates thereby reducing no3 n supply for denitrification and reducing n2o production from both reactions in this study annual n input is up to 244 kg n ha 1 n availability is not the limit factor for n2o production whereas the eh value of pond sediments is much lower than the optimal value for nitrification 200 mv charpentier et al 1998 resulting in nh4 n accumulation and no3 n depletion in sediments table 1 and fig 2 the no3 n concentration in sediments was lower than the threshold value of 5 mg n kg 1 for denitrification dobbie and smith 2003 furthermore high doc concentrations and low eh condition lead the pond sediments to become the hotpots for complete denitrification soued et al 2016 where no3 n could be completely reduced to n2 and even n2o could be consumed baulch et al 2011 indeed results from a stepwise multiple regression analysis show that the n2o flux is positively related to eh and negatively related to doc concentration but is not correlated with n table 3 suggesting that the redox condition and c concentration other than n availability are the primary regulars for the temporal variation in n2o flux in these aquaculture ponds 4 5 water column n2o production and downward diffusion since the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments were unfavorable for n2o production the n2o that escaped from the water air interface could not have originated from the sediment but from the production via water column nitrification or incomplete denitrification as observed in oceans and reservoirs beaulieu et al 2015 freing et al 2012 unlike lotic waters which tend to be oxygenated and well mixed lentic systems can become thermally stratified leading to the development of well oxygenated shallow waters epilimnion and anoxic deep waters hypolimnion which support different types of microbial n transformations beaulieu et al 2015 nitrification is the major n2o producing pathway in oxic epilimnion while the oxic anoxic interface between epilimnion and hypolimnion is another important zone for n2o production via aerobic and anaerobic metabolic processes mix webb et al 2019 deemer et al 2011 found that n2 production occurred predominantly at the sediment water interface in a small eutrophic reservoir while n2o could be produced within the water column via nitrification and denitrification although owing to their shallow water relative to the big lentic systems small ponds have high water sediment contact and are characterized by highly reduced conditions favorable for complete denitrification and n2o consumption soued et al 2016 however the supersaturated n2o concentrations suggested that water column n2o production may still exist in the oxic or oxic anoxic transport zones in the crab ponds fig 3 likewise hu et al 2012 found that n2o was produced in the hypoxic zone in an experimental aquaculture tank whereas nitrification and denitrification processes contributed equally to n2o emissions hu et al 2013 interestingly we found that the diffusive n2o flux calculated by the transfer coefficient method was higher than the chamber measured n2o flux in all three ponds fig 4b this pattern indicates that the supersaturated n2o in surface water can not only escape as water air fluxes but can also diffuse downwards consistently webb et al 2019 suggested that if n2o consumption occurred below the thermocline of the lentic systems then a diffusion gradient of n2o between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion could be strong enough to stimulate n2o diffuse downwards and even deplete n2o in the surface water when the equilibrium diffusion of n2o in the water column reaches the sediment water interface n2o could be taken up by dissimilatory nitrate reduction into ammonia by bacteria webb et al 2019 or be converted into n2 via complete denitrification lauerwald et al 2019 indeed in this study negative n2o fluxes were measured repeatedly in the ponds over the course of summer fig 3d atmospheric n2o uptake in aquatic ecosystems generally occurs in n limited wetlands yuan et al 2015 however recently negative n2o flux was also documented in some eutrophic aquatic systems for instance according to soued et al 2016 over 40 of the boreal aquatic networks in québec canada were under saturated by n2o during the summer while aquatic systems serving as sinks tended to have lower ph higher doc and lower o2 concentrations moreover webb et al 2019 reported that 67 of the small agricultural reservoirs in southern saskatchewan canada were n2o sinks despite their highly eutrophic status unlike ch4 n2o is highly soluble in water clough et al 2006 the limited no3 n in pond sediment and anoxic portion of the water column potentially compelled denitrifiers to utilize dissolved n2o for their growth blicher mathiesen and hoffmann 1999 clough et al 2007 in turn resulting in net n2o consumption through denitrification according to schlesinger 2013 n2o uptakes of 20 μg n m 2 h 1 generally occur in wetlands because denitrifiers consume dissolved n2o in overlying waters similarly beaulieu et al 2015 found that denitrification in the anoxic hypolimnion is a sink for n2o at no3 n concentrations below 3 6 μm in a group of reservoirs in ohio in addition it has been reported that some microalgal species could assimilate atmospheric n2o via direct diffusion through the algal cells ferrón et al 2012 nagase et al 2001 4 6 limitation and future research similar to many other studies there are some limitations in this study firstly although the carb yield is of potential importance via bioturbation for ch4 emissions from the aquaculture ponds we did not identify the direct impacts of carb bioturbation on ch4 transport with mesocosm approach and also we could not statistically quantify the contribution of each impact factors especially for crab yield on ch4 emission due to a limitation in the number of experimental ponds in the future study the implications of bioturbation for ghg emissions from aquaculture systems should be identified via both mesocosm approach and wide investigation across different types of aquaculture systems secondly we found that the eutrophic aquaculture ponds released limited n2o even consume n2o in summer which challenges the widely held view that n enriched aquaculture systems are potent n2o sources hu et al 2012 given the unprecedented growth of aquaculture worldwide yet have rarely been studied for ghg emissions we highlight a call to action for further n2o measurements in countries with large aquaculture industries thirdly we attributed the weak n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds to the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments which inhibited n2o production but favored n2o consumption further research into how the physical and biological controls interact to regulate microbial n2o producing and consuming processes in n enriched small waters is needed fourthly our finding of the downwards n2o diffusion was only supported by evidence from the relatively higher rates of model calculated diffusive n2o flux than the chamber measured n2o flux the biogeochemical zones where the n2o producing or consuming processes occurred are hard to be identified and the downwards diffusive n2o fluxes are unable to be quantified studies focusing on depth profiles of n2o concentration and its potential controls e g dissolved o2 doc ph din chlorophyll a etc in the water columns are recommended in future studies to further address this issue 5 conclusions in summary our results indicate that ch4 and n2o have separate production zones and distinct transportation pathways in the test ponds ch4 was produced primarily in anaerobic sediment and ebullition accounted for 81 2 of the total flux conversely n2o was produced in the water column and can escape as water air flux and diffuse downward to be consumed or taken up ultimately in the anaerobic sediment according to our results the current global ch4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and a poor underestimating of the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux in small lentic waters moreover the downward n2o diffusion not only challenges the widely held view that eutrophic n enriched waters are n2o sources but also indicates that model calculated diffusive flux based on gas transfer velocity is potentially overestimated

17279,aquaculture systems receive intensive carbon c and nitrogen n loadings and are therefore recognized as major anthropogenic sources of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions however the extensively managed aquaculture ponds were identified as a hotspot of ch4 emission but just a weak n2o source here we investigate annual ch4 and n2o fluxes from three earthen ponds used for crab culture of different sizes in southeast china our purposes are to identify the spatiotemporal variations of ch4 and n2o emissions and their components among ponds and to evaluate the zone for ch4 and n2o production static chamber measured ch4 flux ranged from 0 03 to 64 7 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 average 9 02 14 3 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 and temperature followed by dissolved organic c doc concentration and redox potential were the primary drivers of seasonal ch4 flux patterns annual mean diffusive ch4 flux was 1 80 2 34 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 and that by ebullition was up to 7 20 12 0 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 flux annual ch4 emission was positively correlated with sediment doc concentration but negatively p 0 05 correlated with water depth across ponds with the highest ch4 emission occurred in a pond with low water depth and high doc concentration the calculated diffusive n2o flux by the gas transfer velocity was 0 32 0 60 times greater than the measured n2o emission suggesting that n2o in water column can not only evade as water air fluxes but diffuse downwards and to be consumed in anaerobic sediments this also indicates that n2o was primarily produced in water column the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments can limit n2o production from both nitrification and denitrification but favor n2o consumption leading the ponds to become a weak source of n2o annually and even a sink of n2o in summer our results highlight that the current global ch4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and underestimation of the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux in small lentic waters the downwards n2o diffusion from the water column into sediment also indicates that the extensively used model approach based on gas transfer velocity potentially overestimates n2o fluxes especially in small eutrophic aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquaculture ponds methane nitrous oxide diffusion ebullition 1 introduction although lakes and ponds occupy only a small fraction of the earth s surface they play disproportionally large role in the global carbon c and nitrogen n cycles cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 by virtue of receiving large inputs of terrestrial organic c and n these inland waters are recognized as important atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o sources although a considerable portion of the terrestrially organic c can be buried in their sediment mendonça et al 2017 inland waters are 2 3 fold greater c sources than c sinks for the atmosphere at the global scale cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 annually lentic inland waters emit 1 10 pg and 0 11 pg of co2 and ch4 respectively bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 however the latter value may be an underestimation for two key reasons 1 the global extent of small ponds is particularly difficult to map resulting in their exclusion from greenhouse gas ghg budget estimates holgerson and raymond 2016 and 2 although ebullition bubbles of ch4 accounts for a large proportion of the total ch4 flux from inland waterways the challenge of measuring such episodic events reduces the accuracy of ebullitive ch4 flux estimates bastviken et al 2004 yet c and ghg processing in small waterbodies have been emphasized particularly because of their unique physical properties such as shallow water and frequent mixing downing 2010 wu et al 2019 according to holgerson and raymond 2016 very small ponds with areas 0 001 km2 account for 41 of all global diffusive ch4 emissions despite comprising only 8 6 of global lakes and ponds based on area in addition wik et al 2016 suggested that ebullition 8 61 tg ch4 yr 1 accounted for 40 5 72 0 of the total ch4 emissions from lakes and ponds at high northern latitudes which was equivalent to 37 4 of all the natural ch4 sources in the regions however uncertainties arise due to the relatively scarce ebullition data applied in such estimates inland small waterbodies are also important sites of n processing for instance although waterbodies with sizes in the 0 001 0 01 km2 range account for only 6 80 of global lakes and reservoirs by area they contribute to 25 of n removal from global watersheds harrison et al 2009 and therefore are considered significant components of global n2o budgets baulch et al 2011 harrison and matson 2003 global n2o emissions from inland freshwaters are estimated to be 1 51 tg n2o year 1 representing 15 of anthropogenic n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 delsontro et al 2018 however current n2o emission estimates from small waterbodies 0 01 km2 remain unreliable due to scarce data only 8 published reports from these systems are included in the 309 synthesized global lentic n2o measurements delsontro et al 2018 although more n2o data for these systems were reported recently yang et al 2020a uncertainty with respect to n2o emissions from lentic small waterbodies is further exacerbated by the highly variable nature of freshwater n2o flux across temporal and spatial scales and an inadequate understanding of the factors driving n2o uptake at the surfaces of freshwater ecosystems soued et al 2016 webb et al 2019 n2o flux tends to increase with increases in n inputs consequently current regional and global estimates of freshwater n2o fluxes assume linear increases in n2o emissions with an increase in dissolved inorganic n din loads into such systems indeed some of the highest n2o emissions have been reported in agricultural drainage waters that receive excess n in runoff from surrounding pasture and croplands hama aziz et al 2017 harrison and matson 2003 however widespread n2o uptake has also been documented in small eutrophic reservoirs in agricultural areas in canada webb et al 2019 recently n2o emissions from boreal lakes were reported to increase with an increase in lake size although small lakes had higher din concentrations relative to bigger lakes kortelainen et al 2020 soued et al 2016 such inconsistent results highlight the complexity of the multiple microbial processes driving aquatic n2o flux to better estimate global aquatic n2o budgets it is necessary to explore the rates and drivers of n2o flux under diverse aquatic ecosystems excavated earthen ponds are critical aquatic systems for aquaculture production contributing 87 0 of the global freshwater aquaculture volume yuan et al 2019 upon the increasing demand for animal proteins and the high economic returns of aquaculture converting to these artificial ponds is one of the major trajectories of land use change in many developing countries fao 2016 paddy fields in china and mangrove forests in southeast asia are increasingly and will continue being transformed into aquaculture ponds liu et al 2016 consequently the volume of production and area for freshwater aquaculture has been steadily rising since 1980s yuan et al 2019 aquaculture ponds receive intensive c and n loads associated with aquafeed application combined with their shallow and frequent mixing attributes they are recognized as major sources of anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions hu et al 2012 williams and crutzen 2010 yang et al 2020b moreover bioturbation by benthivorous animals influences nutrient and physicochemical status in sediment in turn regulating ch4 and n2o production consumption and transportation processes in aquaculture ponds for instance bioturbation by benthic fauna may strongly favor the penetration of oxygen o2 into sediment layers which increases ch4 oxidation and n2o production oliveria junior et al 2019 svensson 1998 conversely physical sediment disturbance could trigger ebullition or prevent the build up of gas bubbles and in turn increase or decrease emulative ch4 and n2o emissions oliveria junior et al 2019 yang et al 2020b our previous findings have suggested that the conversion of traditional paddy fields to extensively managed crab eriocheir sinensis ponds could increase ch4 emissions drastically by up to 248 yuan et al 2019 in contrast n2o fluxes from crab ponds were not only significantly lower than those from paddy fields but also lower than those from an adjacent large shallow lake tai lake wang et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 here we examine ch4 and n2o fluxes from three neighboring crab ponds with different sizes over one year in the tai lake basin 31 02 n 120 25 e suzhou china the objectives of the present study were to i obtain insights into the components diffusive and ebullitive of ch4 and n2o emissions from crab ponds ii investigate the heterogeneity of ch4 and n2o emissions and the contributions of different pathways across ponds and iii investigate the influence of water and sediment parameters on seasonal ch4 and n2o fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were carried out in three adjacent crab ponds cp in the tai lake basin suzhou china fig s1 the ponds are of different sizes table 1 but were all converted from paddy fields in 2001 into chinese mitten crab e sinensis aquaculture ponds the experimental region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with long term 1981 2010 mean annual air temperature and precipitation of 16 5 c and 1176 mm respectively china meteorological data network 2012 rice wheat rotation is the typical cropping system in the region however paddy fields have been converted into aquaculture ponds rapidly since the 1980s zhang et al 2009 2 2 experimental design and field management one year round field experiments were conducted from march 2013 to march 2014 similar management practices were adopted in all ponds and they have been described in detail in a previous study yuan et al 2019 briefly chinese mitten crab monoculture was carried out at a stocking density of 15 000 ind ha 1 crabs were fed with commercial feed pellets 2 050 kg ha 1 annually purina co ltd jiaxing china trash fish 1 250 kg ha 1 and corn seeds 1 150 kg ha 1 twice a day at 9 00 a m and at 17 00 p m until the crabs were harvested the ponds were fertilized with cake manure urea compound fertilizer and calcium superphosphate at the annual rates of 40 130 100 and 200 kg ha 1 respectively to stimulate phytoplankton and macrophyte production cake manure was applied one time on march 29 whereas the latter three fertilizers were applied with four splits of 25 25 25 25 on march 29 june 5 august 12 and september 27 2013 annual c and n inputs into crab ponds were 1 20 mg c ha 1 and 244 kg n ha 1 respectively snails bellamya quadrata were introduced into the ponds twice at rates of 600 and 400 kg ha 1 on april 4 and june 20 respectively to filter feed residues and provide supplementary food for crabs water was constantly retained in the ponds all year round while the water depth wd varied across the three ponds the submerged western macrophyte elodea nuttallii was planted in ponds to provide molting shelter and food for crabs crab harvest began from 1 to 30 october 2013 and yield was expressed as fresh weight 2 3 measurement of ch4 and n2o fluxes in each pond wooden boardwalks 10 m were installed perpendicular to the shore to facilitate gas sampling activities and the measurement of auxiliary parameters fig s2 the static closed chamber technique was used to measure the ghg flux a specially designed system which included four stainless steel pegs for fixing the system and two adjustable crossbars for holding chamber collars were installed along the boardwalks to minimize the influence of water waves on gas sampling activities and results three pvc chamber collars were placed on the crossbars and would be adjusted to the water table one day before sampling if necessary see yuan et al 2015 for further detailed information on the devices ch4 and n2o flux was measured twice weekly during the crab production period from march to october and weekly during the period without crab from november to february gas sampling was conducted at 08 00 10 00 local time to minimize diurnal variation in flux patterns when sampling a transparent plexiglass chamber 50 cm 50 cm 15 cm was fitted into the water troughs of the chamber collars four gas samples of the chamber headspace were drawn using a 50 ml syringe 0 10 20 and 30 min after closure and injected into the 22 ml pre evacuated glass vials the air temperature inside the chamber was simultaneously measured with a mercury thermometer ch4 and n2o concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 santa clara ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for ch4 and a 63ni electron capture detector for n2o the gas standards were provided by the national research center for certified reference materials beijing china the accuracy of the ghg concentration measurements was 0 5 based on repeated measurements of gas standards ghg flux was calculated using linear least squares fit to the four points in the time series of concentrations for each plot data were omitted if the slope of the linear fitting had an r 2 0 90 cumulative emissions were calculated by linear interpolation between measurement days 2 4 estimation of diffusive and ebullitive ch4 and n2o flux water samples from the crab ponds were collected 10 cm below the surface of the water using a syringe and approximately 11 ml was injected into the 22 ml pre evacuated glass vials and then pure n2 gas was injected into vials to a pressure of 1 0 atm vials were shaken vigorously for 5 min to degas them subsequently gas samples were taken from the headspace for ch4 and n2o analyses concentrations of gases dissolved in water were corrected for dilution and calculated according to henry s law using ch4 values from wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 and n2o values from weiss and price 1980 the diffusive ch4 and n2o flux f m d at the water air interfaces of ponds was calculated using the transfer coefficient method based on the bulk diffusion model raymond and cole 2001 f m d k c w c eq where k is the gas transfer velocity m d 1 and is calculated using wind based model fitting for small lakes as described by cole et al 2010 c w is the ch4 or n2o concentration μmol l 1 dissolved in the surface water and c eq is the concentration of the gas in the surface water in equilibrium with the concentration in the atmosphere c w was calculated as follows johnson et al 1990 c w c h β r t 22 4 v h v w where c h is the ch4 or n2o concentration in the vial headspace μmol l 1 β is bunsen solubility coefficients for ch4 or n2o l l 1 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 r is the gas constant t is the temperature k v h represents the vial headspace volume ml and v p is the volume of water sample ml c eq was calculated in the following equation based on henry s law sander 2015 c eq c g k h e δ sol h r 1 t 1 t r t where c g is the ambient ch4 or n2o concentration above crab ponds k h is henry s law constant of a given gas at t 298 15 k δ sol h is the enthalpy of dissolution r is the gas constant and t is the temperature k the gas transfer velocity was normalized to a schmidt number of 600 s c 600 for co2 at 20 c using the following equation k k 600 s c 600 n where s c is schmidt number of gas at in situ temperature for the exponent n 2 3 at low wind speed u 10 3 7 m s 1 and n 1 2 at high wind speed u 10 3 7 m s 1 was used liss and merlivat 1986 wind based model fitted for the small lakes described by cole et al 2010 was used to determine k 600 m d 1 k 600 0 497 0 064 u 10 1 8 where u 10 is wind speed at a 10 m height m s 1 most of the ch4 fluxes from inland lentic waterbodies consist of ebullition and diffusive fluxes therefore ebullitive ch4 flux is the difference between total and diffusive ch4 fluxes 2 5 auxiliary measurements precipitation weed speed ws and air temperature were obtained from a neighboring meteorological station concomitant with gas sampling the wds of crab ponds were measured directly using a straightedge sediment temperature at 10 cm depth ts was measured using a portable digital thermometer jm624 jinming instrument tianjin china redox potential eh of the intact sediment was measured in situ at 10 cm depth using a phb 6 ph mv meter jiaoyuan instrument yancheng china the 0 15 cm sediment core was collected weekly using a russian corer for mineral n and dissolved organic c doc measurements ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n were extracted with 2 m kcl solution shaken for 1 h and then filtered and their concentrations were determined using a continuous flow analyzer san skalar breda the netherlands doc was extracted with deionized water shaken for 30 min at 25 c centrifuged for 25 min at 4000 g and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and measured on a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan soil organic c soc and total n tn contents were determined by the wet oxidation redox method and the kjeldahl procedure respectively carter 1993 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r v3 2 2 r core team 2015 unless otherwise stated data normality was examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test and natural log transformation was used if necessary one way analysis of variance anova with a tukey s hsd test was used for the comparison of ch4 and n2o emissions and their components sediment properties and yields among ponds repeated measures anova was used to examine the effects of sampling time and treatment on ghg flux and soil nh4 n no3 n and doc concentrations stepwise regression was used to identify the key drivers of ghg flux spearman s nonparametric rank correlation was used to describe relationships between ch4 or n2o emissions and the geochemical or hydrological properties of the ponds the quality of fit of equations was judged by the coefficient of determination r 2 and its statistical significance was determined using fisher s f test 3 results 3 1 weather conditions water depth and phenology air temperature at the experimental site exhibited strong seasonal trends fig 1 a with an annual mean of 18 0 c which was 1 5 c higher than the 30 year mean 16 5 c measured at the dongshan meteorological station 5 km away from the experimental site annual precipitation was 987 mm which was lower than the 30 year average of 1176 mm by 16 1 mean ts in crab ponds ranged from 18 9 to 19 2 c fig 1b water depths of the ponds were maintained above 0 5 m all year round fig 1c cp1 had the highest wd 1 60 m followed by cp3 1 34 m and cp2 1 19 m table 1 the eh in pond sediment ranged from 271 to 20 6 286 to 22 7 and 255 to 29 7 mv in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively fig 1d annual mean eh in cp1 160 mv and cp3 145 mv was significantly lower p 0 01 than that in cp2 125 mv 3 2 mineral n and doc dynamics in pond sediment sediment nh4 n concentrations in crab ponds were generally 50 mg n kg 1 and no distinct temporal trends were observed fig 2 a the mean nh4 n concentration in sediment in cp2 was 165 mg n kg 1 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in cp1 and cp3 in contrast no3 n concentrations in sediment were generally below the detection limit of 0 015 mg n kg 1 small peaks of no3 n were only observed after fertilization fig 2b sediment doc concentrations increased during the crab growth period fig 2c mean sediment doc concentration in cp2 was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in cp1 and cp3 table 1 3 3 dissolved ch4 concentration and ch4 flux components ch4 concentrations were supersaturated in waters across all ponds and all sampling dates with an overall mean concentration of 3 76 μmol l 1 equal to a 1 437 fold supersaturation 21 6 080 fold supersaturation fig 3 a summertime ch4 concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in winter such extreme ch4 supersaturations made the crab ponds substantial sources of diffusive ch4 and the fluxes were 0 03 8 38 0 26 9 69 and 0 08 7 27 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively fig 3c diffusive ch4 flux in the three ponds had similar fluctuation trends with ch4 flux increasing gradually after crab stocking peaking just before crab capture in mid september thereafter they declined and remained at relatively low levels 0 03 2 43 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 during the period without crab in winter and in early spring total water air ch4 fluxes also exhibited similar seasonal trends however the values were much higher than those of diffusive ch4 fluxes fig 3e annual mean ch4 fluxes in cp1 cp2 and cp3 were 9 02 14 3 and 9 46 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 respectively which were 3 31 4 43 fold higher than diffusive ch4 fluxes annual total ch4 emissions ranged from 795 to 1259 kg ch4 ha 1 in the three ponds with 88 3 92 6 of the emissions occurring during the crab production period fig 4 a cp2 had the highest ch4 emission rates which were significantly higher than the emissions in cp1 and cp3 p 0 05 similarly most of the diffusive ch4 emissions in the crab production period and cumulative emission via diffusion was significantly higher in cp2 than in the other two ponds however diffusive ch4 emissions 158 205 kg ch4 ha 1 only accounted for 16 5 20 9 of the total ch4 emissions while 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 emissions was attributable to ebullition fig 4c 3 4 dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux components during the one year study period n2o concentrations ranged from 1 97 to 38 1 nmol l 1 across all ponds which is equivalent to 27 5 460 of the atmospheric equilibrium value fig 3b approximately 69 4 of the surface water samples were supersaturated with n2o that is the ponds were mostly sources of diffusive n2o n2o concentrations generally peaked following the application of urea however under saturation of n2o was observed frequently during july to september suggesting that crab ponds can act as n2o sinks in summer indeed the calculated diffusive n2o flux was the lowest negative in august but was generally much higher positive in winter and in spring fig 3d the n2o flux measured using static chambers was generally 10 μg n2o m 2 h 1 and had a seasonal pattern similar to that of the calculated diffusive flux fig 3f however the annual mean n2o fluxes measured was 1 47 3 78 and 2 21 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in cp1 cp2 and cp3 respectively which accounted for only 29 6 57 6 of the calculated diffusive flux annual n2o emissions ranged from 0 19 to 0 43 kg n2o ha 1 in the ponds with 45 9 of the emissions occurring during periods without crab fig 4b although this period was only 143 days unlike ch4 emission annual n2o emission was significantly lower in cp1 than in cp2 and cp3 p 0 05 similarly annual diffusive n2o emission was lowest in cp1 and highest in cp3 however the calculated diffusive n2o emissions were 0 32 0 60 times greater than the measured n2o emissions fig 4b suggesting that the supersaturated n2o in surface water can not only escape in the form of water air fluxes but can also be consumed in deeper layers or sediment 3 5 factors influencing ch4 and n2o emissions and their components correlations between total ch4 flux and ts wd and doc concentration were significant in all three ponds p 0 05 while eh was only correlated with total ch4 flux in cp1 table 2 when data from the three ponds were combined for stepwise multiple regression analysis ts followed by doc concentration and eh were the primary factors driving the seasonal total ch4 flux trends table 3 annual total ch4 emissions decreased exponentially with an increase in wd fig 5 a but had positive relationships p 0 05 with eh and doc concentrations fig 5b c furthermore the contribution of ebullition to total ch4 emissions was negatively p 0 05 correlated with wd fig 6 a the measured n2o flux was positively correlated with eh and negatively correlated with wd and doc concentrations in cp1 and cp2 p 0 05 but not in cp3 when combining data from the three ponds n2o flux was also negatively correlated with ts p 0 05 table 2 according to the stepwise multiple regression analysis results doc concentration followed by eh and ts could explain 18 9 of the temporal variation in n2o flux p 0 01 table 3 annual n2o emissions were negatively correlated with mean wd and positively correlated with eh among ponds p 0 05 while they were not significantly correlated with doc or mineral n concentrations fig 5 the ratio of diffusive n2o emission to total n2o emission exhibited a weak marginally significantly increasing trend with an increase in mean wd p 0 10 fig 6b although the total ch4 or n2o flux was not correlated with ws table 2 results from a partial correlation analysis show that both diffusive ch4 and n2o flux had a significant relationship with ws when removing the effect of dissolve ch4 and n2o concentrations table s1 4 discussion aquaculture systems receive intensive c and n loads that originate from feed application unconsumed feed and feces of animals which in turn provide abundant substrates for ghg production hu et al 2012 yang et al 2020b in previous study we have reported that converting traditional paddy fields to these experimental aquaculture ponds dramatically increased the net global warming potential from 8 15 to 28 0 mg co2eq ha 1 these freshwater aquaculture ponds which unequipped with aeration systems represented a critical source of ghg emission where ch4 n2o and co2 accounted 96 3 0 31 and 3 34 for the total emission respectively yuan et al 2019 eutrophic waters have been documented can act as both co2 source and sink which depends on the balance of organic c burial and mineralization almeida et al 2016 indeed the studied crab ponds are a weak co2 source annually but can be co2 sink during the summer time yuan et al 2019 in this study our main focus is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the intense ch4 but negligible n2o emissions from the shallow small and extensively managed freshwater aquaculture ponds 4 1 ch4 emission heterogeneity among aquaculture ponds in addition to intensive c inputs shallow water environments and frequent mixing in such human excavated earthen ponds imply more rapid gaseous exchange with the atmosphere and less time for ch4 removal by oxidation holgerson and raymond 2016 consequently aquaculture systems especially earthen ponds are considered potentially substantial sources of anthropogenic ch4 emissions rutegwa et al 2019 our findings demonstrate that the crab ponds which were unequipped with aerators were year round sources of ghg with particularly high ch4 emissions the areal ch4 emitted by these ponds 962 kg ch4 ha 1 not only fell within the far top end of the global range of 25 0 971 kg ch4 ha 1 from inland freshwater ecosystems bastviken et al 2011 but was also higher than the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 default emission factors for permanently inundated temperate wetlands 572 kg ch4 ha 1 and tropical inland freshwater wetlands 900 kg ch4 ha 1 respectively therefore our results highlight that earthen aquaculture ponds are ch4 emission hotspots the primary reason for such high ch4 emissions can be attributed to the high availability of labile organic substrates in our previous study yuan et al 2019 sedimentary organic c deposits were estimated to be 1 04 mg c ha 1 approximately 84 0 of the total c inputs were from feeds and fertilizers leading to extremely high doc levels in sediment table 1 secondly organic compounds in the feed remnants and feces such as starch and protein contain higher amounts of labile organic c than plant residues such as stems and roots in natural freshwater ecosystems they can be more easily decomposed into methanogenic substrates thirdly the permanently inundated crab ponds created ideal anaerobic environments for methanogensis in sediments fig 2d altor and mitsch 2008 reported that ch4 emissions from permanently inundated wetlands with emergent macrophytes were remarkably higher than in intermittently flooded wetlands with the higher emissions attributed to lower eh in continuously anoxic wetlands annual ch4 emissions in cp2 were significantly higher than those in cp1 and cp3 however contrary to our expectations there was a positive correlation between annual ch4 emission and eh indicating that higher ch4 emission in cp2 were not primarily controlled by sediment eh probably because sediment eh in permanently inundated pond was well within the optimal range for ch4 production 100 to 150 mv gaunt et al 1997 in the present study annual ch4 emission was significantly correlated with doc concentration and negatively correlated with wd fig 5 in general relatively shallow wds in freshwater ponds are suitable for growth of submerged macrophytes e g western waterweed in the present study korschgen et al 1997 macrophytes can release o2 into water and sediments which would elevate sediment eh reduce ch4 production and accelerate ch4 oxidation in addition to providing substrate such as debris and exudates that would increase ch4 production carmichael et al 2014 fritz et al 2011 substrates for acetoclastic methanogenesis are derived primarily from the photosynthates of live plants in some freshwater wetlands ström et al 2005 in this study we did not measure macrophyte biomass in crab ponds however the relatively high doc levels in cp2 sediment suggested that photosynthates partly if not solely support ch4 production since the application rates of feed and fertilizer were identical across the three crab ponds 4 2 role of ebullition in ch4 emissions from crab ponds notably annual ch4 emissions in cp2 were 0 53 0 66 times higher than the rates in cp1 and cp3 while annual mean doc concentrations were only 0 14 0 19 times higher in cp2 this discrepancy indicates that other factors besides doc regulated the heterogeneity of ch4 emissions among ponds generally during the ch4 diffusion in water body of lakes up to 99 of the ch4 produced was oxidized bastviken et al 2008 in contrast ch4 transport via bubbling could escape to the atmosphere rapidly and evade oxidation in this study although surface waters were 1 389 to 1 474 fold supersaturated with ch4 relative to the concentrations in the atmosphere diffusive ch4 emissions accounted for only 16 5 20 9 of the total ch4 emissions fig 4c therefore although the dissolved ch4 concentrations in cp2 were 18 0 26 2 greater than the concentrations in cp1 and cp3 diffusive flux comprised only a small proportion of the relatively higher ch4 emissions in cp2 on the contrary ebullition accounted for 79 1 83 5 of the total ch4 emissions in the crab ponds and the higher proportions in cp2 88 0 91 0 relative to in cp1 and cp3 can be attributed to ebullitive ch4 emissions fig 4a nevertheless the contribution of ebullition to the total ch4 emissions had a negative correlation with wd fig 6a apparently the shallow wd in cp2 could have facilitated greater ebullition than in cp1 and cp3 due to relatively low hydrostatic pressure in cp2 bastviken et al 2004 in turn allowing the ch4 produced to escape into the atmosphere more easily particularly annual mean ch4 concentrations 3 34 4 51 μmol l 1 in the crab ponds are well within the 1 70 7 57 μmol l 1 range in small waterbodies 0 01 km2 based on a global survey of lakes by size holgerson and raymond 2016 meanwhile our estimates of diffusive ch4 fluxes 1 86 2 48 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 from the ponds were similar to the averages 0 65 2 28 mg ch4 m 2 h 1 reported for waterbodies within the same size class holgerson and raymond 2016 small lakes and ponds are suggested to have a disproportionately large contribution to global diffusive ch4 flux holgerson and raymond 2016 however since bubbling is very frequent and diffusion contributed to only a small proportion of the ch4 emissions from small lakes and ponds when compared to in larger lakes bastviken et al 2004 such shallow lentic waterbodies should account for a larger share in global aquatic ch4 inventories than current estimates that are based on traditional upscaling approaches delsontro et al 2018 4 3 potential impacts of crab disturbance on ch4 emissions we found that the crab yield tended to decrease as mean wd become shallower table 1 suggesting that the relatively lower wd in cp2 might depress yield of crab generally in the earlier stage of crab rearing april and may in this study wd should be kept in relative high level 1 2 1 5 m to reduce the stress reactions of crabs which were caused by the temperature difference between day and night dai et al 2020 hong et al 2007 the relative lower wd of cp2 in april and may 0 5 m might reduce the survival rate and consequently yield of crab despite the fact that stocking density and feed input were at the same rates in the three ponds in aquatic systems the bioturbation of benthivorous fauna can influence redox status and physicochemical parameters in sediment in turn regulating ch4 production consumption and transport bezerra et al 2020 oliveria junior et al 2019 however this influence remains controversial in the literature with authors disagreeing as to whether bioturbation leads to stimulation or inhibition to ch4 emission oliveira junior et al 2019 found that the existence of benthivorous fish reduced ch4 emission by 62 1 in an experiment mesocosm probably due to sediment oxygenation and preventing build up of gas bubbles in sediments as discussed above sediment eh in the three ponds was well within the optimal range for ch4 production this indicated that presence of crabs did not greatly if any enhance sediment eh and suppress ch4 production probably due to high doc level in contrast leal et al 2007 found that the bioturbation of campsurus notatus increased the sediment water ch4 flux by 307 457 times in a tropical lake when compared to the sediment core without campsurus notatus bezerra et al 2020 found a significant positive relationship between benthic chaoborus larvae density and the bubbling frequency and ebullitive ch4 flux in a tropical reservoir suggesting that the chaoborus driven physical disturbance could trigger bubbling thereby enhancing ebullitive ch4 emission consistently yang et al 2017 2020b pointed out that the disturbance from shrimps could trigger ebullition from a brackish aquaculture pond resulting in ebullitive fluxes accounting for over 90 of the total ch4 emission here we found that the relative contribution of ebullitive ch4 emission in the crab ponds was as high as 83 5 which is not only higher than the estimates 40 60 based on a survey of 73 lakes bastviken et al 2004 but also higher than the values measured from some small eutrophic waters almeida et al 2016 van bergen et al 2019 hence we speculated that the presence of crabs stimulated ch4 release from these ponds in this study the relative contribution of ebullitive ch4 emission in cp2 was just 2 48 4 38 higher than in cp1 and cp3 fig 4 although mean wd in cp2 was 11 2 25 6 lower table 1 we assume that there is a trade off impact between the hydraulic pressure and bioturbation on ebullitive ch4 emission that is the relative lower wd favors ebullition in cp2 but the lower bioturbation with lower crab density in cp2 could partly offset the stimulation effect of lower wd on ebullition when compared to cp1 and cp3 4 4 regulars for the variations of n2o flux the n pollution and global eutrophication are predicted to increase n2o emissions from freshwater ecosystems seitzinger and kroeze 1998 and current regional and global estimates of freshwater n2o fluxes assume a linear increase of n2o emissions with din loading to aquatic systems baron et al 2013 ipcc 2013 seitzinger et al 2000 aquaculture ponds are often eutrophic nutrient rich waterbodies because of the intensive c and n inputs from aquafeeds application and fertilization therefore we supposed they were important anthropogenic n2o sources however our findings suggest that the extensively managed crab ponds just acted as weak n2o sources even n2o sinks in summer fig 3 and the fluxes could not be well predicted with any of the n forms measured than previously thought tables 2 and 3 nevertheless the emission factor for applied n efn in the crab ponds 0 09 was much lower than the ipcc default values 0 25 0 75 for inland waterbodies although some researchers have argued these values are either too high or too low maavara et al 2019 soued et al 2016 has pointed out that our understanding of freshwater n2o fluxes remains fragmented and with a biased towards n rich lotic systems rivers and streams located in temperate regions the assumed linear relationship between n2o emissions with dissolved din loading exists in lotic systems might not be fitted to lentic systems moreover current n2o estimates from freshwaters is based on a fixed n2o yield unit of n2o produced per n processed whereas measured values span two orders of magnitude 0 0002 to 0 07 beaulieu et al 2011 mccrackin and elser 2011 this range highlights that in addition to n availability other controls on aquatic microbial n processes such as o2 levels c availability temperature and ph can also regulate n2o fluxes from freshwater systems microbial denitrification and nitrification have been identified as the major n2o producing pathways in freshwater systems schlesinger 2009 but the net n2o flux depends on the balance between production and consumption of n2o nitrification is an aerobic process that oxidizes nh4 n to no3 n and releases n2o as a by product whereas denitrification can either produce n2o or transform it into n2 in a final reaction favored under highly reduced anoxic conditions in the lotic systems the near atmospheric equilibrium concentration of dissolved o2 can facilitate water column n2o production via nitrification beaulieu et al 2015 richardson et al 2004 whereas the hypoxic condition of the sediment water interface minor amounts of o2 can suppress the reduction of n2o without inhibiting its production via denitrification laverman et al 2010 therefore flowing waters generally have an elevated n2o yield and increased din loading can stimulate n2o productions and emissions from these systems beaulieu et al 2015 in small lentic systems in contrast their anaerobic sediment condition can limit nitrification rates thereby reducing no3 n supply for denitrification and reducing n2o production from both reactions in this study annual n input is up to 244 kg n ha 1 n availability is not the limit factor for n2o production whereas the eh value of pond sediments is much lower than the optimal value for nitrification 200 mv charpentier et al 1998 resulting in nh4 n accumulation and no3 n depletion in sediments table 1 and fig 2 the no3 n concentration in sediments was lower than the threshold value of 5 mg n kg 1 for denitrification dobbie and smith 2003 furthermore high doc concentrations and low eh condition lead the pond sediments to become the hotpots for complete denitrification soued et al 2016 where no3 n could be completely reduced to n2 and even n2o could be consumed baulch et al 2011 indeed results from a stepwise multiple regression analysis show that the n2o flux is positively related to eh and negatively related to doc concentration but is not correlated with n table 3 suggesting that the redox condition and c concentration other than n availability are the primary regulars for the temporal variation in n2o flux in these aquaculture ponds 4 5 water column n2o production and downward diffusion since the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments were unfavorable for n2o production the n2o that escaped from the water air interface could not have originated from the sediment but from the production via water column nitrification or incomplete denitrification as observed in oceans and reservoirs beaulieu et al 2015 freing et al 2012 unlike lotic waters which tend to be oxygenated and well mixed lentic systems can become thermally stratified leading to the development of well oxygenated shallow waters epilimnion and anoxic deep waters hypolimnion which support different types of microbial n transformations beaulieu et al 2015 nitrification is the major n2o producing pathway in oxic epilimnion while the oxic anoxic interface between epilimnion and hypolimnion is another important zone for n2o production via aerobic and anaerobic metabolic processes mix webb et al 2019 deemer et al 2011 found that n2 production occurred predominantly at the sediment water interface in a small eutrophic reservoir while n2o could be produced within the water column via nitrification and denitrification although owing to their shallow water relative to the big lentic systems small ponds have high water sediment contact and are characterized by highly reduced conditions favorable for complete denitrification and n2o consumption soued et al 2016 however the supersaturated n2o concentrations suggested that water column n2o production may still exist in the oxic or oxic anoxic transport zones in the crab ponds fig 3 likewise hu et al 2012 found that n2o was produced in the hypoxic zone in an experimental aquaculture tank whereas nitrification and denitrification processes contributed equally to n2o emissions hu et al 2013 interestingly we found that the diffusive n2o flux calculated by the transfer coefficient method was higher than the chamber measured n2o flux in all three ponds fig 4b this pattern indicates that the supersaturated n2o in surface water can not only escape as water air fluxes but can also diffuse downwards consistently webb et al 2019 suggested that if n2o consumption occurred below the thermocline of the lentic systems then a diffusion gradient of n2o between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion could be strong enough to stimulate n2o diffuse downwards and even deplete n2o in the surface water when the equilibrium diffusion of n2o in the water column reaches the sediment water interface n2o could be taken up by dissimilatory nitrate reduction into ammonia by bacteria webb et al 2019 or be converted into n2 via complete denitrification lauerwald et al 2019 indeed in this study negative n2o fluxes were measured repeatedly in the ponds over the course of summer fig 3d atmospheric n2o uptake in aquatic ecosystems generally occurs in n limited wetlands yuan et al 2015 however recently negative n2o flux was also documented in some eutrophic aquatic systems for instance according to soued et al 2016 over 40 of the boreal aquatic networks in québec canada were under saturated by n2o during the summer while aquatic systems serving as sinks tended to have lower ph higher doc and lower o2 concentrations moreover webb et al 2019 reported that 67 of the small agricultural reservoirs in southern saskatchewan canada were n2o sinks despite their highly eutrophic status unlike ch4 n2o is highly soluble in water clough et al 2006 the limited no3 n in pond sediment and anoxic portion of the water column potentially compelled denitrifiers to utilize dissolved n2o for their growth blicher mathiesen and hoffmann 1999 clough et al 2007 in turn resulting in net n2o consumption through denitrification according to schlesinger 2013 n2o uptakes of 20 μg n m 2 h 1 generally occur in wetlands because denitrifiers consume dissolved n2o in overlying waters similarly beaulieu et al 2015 found that denitrification in the anoxic hypolimnion is a sink for n2o at no3 n concentrations below 3 6 μm in a group of reservoirs in ohio in addition it has been reported that some microalgal species could assimilate atmospheric n2o via direct diffusion through the algal cells ferrón et al 2012 nagase et al 2001 4 6 limitation and future research similar to many other studies there are some limitations in this study firstly although the carb yield is of potential importance via bioturbation for ch4 emissions from the aquaculture ponds we did not identify the direct impacts of carb bioturbation on ch4 transport with mesocosm approach and also we could not statistically quantify the contribution of each impact factors especially for crab yield on ch4 emission due to a limitation in the number of experimental ponds in the future study the implications of bioturbation for ghg emissions from aquaculture systems should be identified via both mesocosm approach and wide investigation across different types of aquaculture systems secondly we found that the eutrophic aquaculture ponds released limited n2o even consume n2o in summer which challenges the widely held view that n enriched aquaculture systems are potent n2o sources hu et al 2012 given the unprecedented growth of aquaculture worldwide yet have rarely been studied for ghg emissions we highlight a call to action for further n2o measurements in countries with large aquaculture industries thirdly we attributed the weak n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds to the highly reduced condition and depletion of no3 n in sediments which inhibited n2o production but favored n2o consumption further research into how the physical and biological controls interact to regulate microbial n2o producing and consuming processes in n enriched small waters is needed fourthly our finding of the downwards n2o diffusion was only supported by evidence from the relatively higher rates of model calculated diffusive n2o flux than the chamber measured n2o flux the biogeochemical zones where the n2o producing or consuming processes occurred are hard to be identified and the downwards diffusive n2o fluxes are unable to be quantified studies focusing on depth profiles of n2o concentration and its potential controls e g dissolved o2 doc ph din chlorophyll a etc in the water columns are recommended in future studies to further address this issue 5 conclusions in summary our results indicate that ch4 and n2o have separate production zones and distinct transportation pathways in the test ponds ch4 was produced primarily in anaerobic sediment and ebullition accounted for 81 2 of the total flux conversely n2o was produced in the water column and can escape as water air flux and diffuse downward to be consumed or taken up ultimately in the anaerobic sediment according to our results the current global ch4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and a poor underestimating of the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux in small lentic waters moreover the downward n2o diffusion not only challenges the widely held view that eutrophic n enriched waters are n2o sources but also indicates that model calculated diffusive flux based on gas transfer velocity is potentially overestimated
