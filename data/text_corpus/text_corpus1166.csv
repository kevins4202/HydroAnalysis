5830,the potential impacts of the spatial resolution of sedimentary structure data on solute dispersion in heterogeneous porous formations are investigated with lagrangian based transport models the models rely on a covariance function that represent a hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies types by using facies physical properties such as volume proportions and mean length as well as auto and cross transition probabilities and their log permeability covariance a detailed sedimentary architecture data i e indicator data provides better representation of the spatial correlation structures of the global covariances through capturing its underlying structure defined by transition probabilities more accurately however the extent to which such data affect time dependent transport parameters i e dispersivity is unclear in this study we parameterize transport models using detailed collocated sedimentary architecture and permeability data from an outcrop in española basin nm in addition we perform global sensitivity analysis based on polynomials chaos expansion to understand the significance of parameters in the transport models the results show that dispersivity and particle displacement variance are under estimated if less resolved facies i e indicator data are used even if the global covariance structure is well captured dispersivity is sensitive to the correlation scale that is directly calculated from sedimentary architecture data and the mean log permeability however anisotropy ratio and mean log permeability are the most sensitive parameters for the transverse dispersivity keywords solute transport dispersion sedimentary architecture lagrangian based model sensitivity analysis 1 introduction spatial heterogeneity in physical and geochemical properties has a significant impact on flow and transport processes in both fracture and porous media bolster and dentz 2012 dagan 1989 dai et al 2009 2019 de barros 2018 de barros et al 2015 fiori et al 2006 janković et al 2006 pescimoro et al 2019 rajaram 1997 ramanathan et al 2008 rubin 1995 soltanian et al 2015a b 2017 2018 such heterogeneity results in scale dependency of transport parameters such as dispersivity and retardation factor e g deng 2013 rajaram 1997 ritzi and soltanian 2015 soltanian et al 2015 to practically tackle these scale dependent parameters upscaling approach has been proposed in which the effect of small scale variability is incorporated upscaling can be categorized into stochastic averaging e g bedrikovetsky 2008 dagan 1984 de barros and fiori 2014 gelhar 1993 gelhar et al 1979 gelhar and axness 1983 kitanidis 1997 rubin and gómez hernández 1990 sun et al 2008 renormalization e g zhang 1997 volume averaging e g he et al 2018 whitaker 1999 2013 wood et al 2003 wood and valdés parada 2013 and homogenization e g lunati et al 2002 in this paper we focus on stochastic averaging by using lagrangian based models lagrangian based models for quantifying solute dispersion or spreading were initially developed by dagan 1984 which involve the application of taylor s 1922 analysis of diffusion by continuous movement this stochastic approach has been used and advanced over the past three decades bellin et al 1994 dagan and fiori 1997 dai et al 2004 de barros et al 2015 fiori 2001 fiori et al 2002 fiori and dagan 2000 lu and zhang 2002 rubin 1995 rubin et al 1999 soltanian et al 2015 sudicky 1986 this is mainly due to its physically based nature in providing a direct link between the spatial bivariate correlation structure e g semivariogram or covariance of log permeability y ln k for example rajaram 1997 presented scale dependent effective retardation factor in unimodal porous media however the integral scale of the correlation structure of y in the traditional stochastic approach is a single and finite value in these studies recent work has focused on providing a more realistic link between geologic data and lagrangian based transport models through quantifying sedimentary architecture using indicator geostatistics dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 and soltanian et al 2015a b c 2017 sedimentary aquifers are often characterized by facies types at different scales dai et al 2019 gershenzon 2015 soltanian and ritzi 2014 thus the integral scale of y arising from such heterogeneity may be neither finite nor single valued dai et al 2004 2019 ritzi and soltanian 2015 therefore it is advantageous to quantify and incorporate the multi facies and the hierarchical nature of sedimentary architecture into theories and numerical simulations for flow and mass transport for example dai et al 2004 used a hierarchical and anisotropic covariance model to derive dispersion coefficients for transport of non reactive solutes using the lagrangian based approach their model represents multi facies architecture within one scale of heterogeneity which is an extension to the covariance and the lagrangian models derived by lu and zhang 2002 and rubin 1995 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 incorporated two scales of sedimentary structure using observed data from the borden aquifer using highly resolved sedimentary architecture data their model successfully explain the observed dispersivity at the borden tracer test sudicky and illman 2011 soltanian et al 2015a b derived the multiscale lagrangian based transport models for reactive solute retardation and dispersion these models provided a viable explanation for the non ideal behavior of perchloroethylene pce plume observed at the borden tracer test by providing a better link to the sedimentary architecture data deng et al 2013 and soltanian et al 2015c developed the lagrangian base models to calculate the effective retardation factor and reactive solute dispersivity in multimodal heterogeneous media the focus of this paper is to understand how the spatial resolution of geologic data affect plume dispersion in multiscale and hierarchical systems one of the main challenges in developing spatial bivariate correlation models for hierarchical systems is how to quantify and incorporate geologic data at different scales this is often done by 1 obtaining sedimentary structure data 2 mapping the data using indicator geostatistics and 3 quantifying probability of transition from one facies to another i e transition probability 4 using the transition probability structure to quantify the spatial bivariate correlation structure e g general shape and range of y carle et al 1998 lunt et al 2005 ritzi et al 2004 2013 ritzi and allen king 2007 previous studies indicated that spatial bivariate correlation structures couldn t be well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probability structures specially the cross transitions dai et al 2019 popken 2005 therefore incorporating more sedimentary structure data is beneficial for representing the spatial correlation structures more accurately however the extent to which the resolution of sedimentary architecture data i e indicator data affect the solute dispersion remains unclear this paper will address this issue in this paper we use three spatial correlation structures which are derived based on different levels of sedimentary architecture data following dai et al 2019 the data include low resolution indicator data collocated in locations of permeability measurement high resolution indicator data and implicit high resolution indicator data combined with geological interpretation see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 and dai et al 2019 we parameterize the multiscale lagrangian based models using three spatial correlation structures and study how different level of indictor i e lithological data affect dispersion process dai et al 2019 showed that the spatial bivariate correlation structure could be well represented even when incomplete indicator data is used however using more indicator data can certainly improve the estimation of spatial variability here we investigate if this slight difference both the shape and the range of the global covariance are close in the correlation models can significantly affect dispersion we also perform a detailed global sensitivity analysis for model parameters dai et al 2004 explored the sensitivity of a multimodal lagrangian based model to input parameters through manually changing parameters their conclusions however are mainly qualitative and the relative impact of each parameter are not determined from their analysis to address this issue we use polynomials chaos expansion pce based sobol sensitivity method to quantify sensitivity of the lagrangian models to input parameters over possible ranges the detailed global sensitivity analysis on lagrangian based models in both unimodal and multimodal media can optimize site geostatistical work in practical problems 2 multiscale statistics and transport models 2 1 hierarchical sedimentary architecture heterogeneity within sedimentary deposits can be well represented by a hierarchical framework dai et al 2019 ritzi et al 2013 ritzi and allen king 2007 different hierarchical organization can be obtained by different criterion depending on research objective soltanian and ritzi 2014 in this paper we study non reactive solute dispersion in a hierarchical media and consider a hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies defined by permeability heterogeneity dai et al 2019 studied the details of sedimentary architecture in an outcrop within española basin nm here we use the conceptual model and results of dai et al 2019 to estimate the dispersion gaud et al 2004 mapped and studied the outcrop in española basin new mexico see also kuhle and smith 2001 smith 2000 and dai et al 2005 the length along the outcrop structural strike is about 370 m and the exposed stratigraphic thickness is about 30 m see fig 1 dai et al 2019 established a multimodal hierarchical model to identify the spatial correlation structure of y for the outcrop shown in fig 1 this multimodal hierarchical model consists of two levels level or scale i is mesoform level which refers to the smaller scale lithofacies there are distinct boundaries between these mesoforms across these boundaries the orientation volume proportion and average grain size as well as types of microform will change significantly dai et al 2005 there are four facies types at this level as illustrated in fig 1 macroform is the level with one facies comprised of all four mesoform facies types this level represents the cumulative result of a long period of multiple sedimentary events and is composed of channel and inter channel deposits 2 2 univariate and spatial bivariate statistics we use the general form of hierarchical correlation model developed by ritzi et al 2004 here we consider a macroform made up of n mesoforms four in this article of mutually exclusive occurrences the indicator variable i q x can be written as 1 i q x 1 i f m e s o f o r m q i s a t l o c a t i o n x 0 o t h e r w i s e the composite log permeability y x is expressed as 2 y x q 1 n i q x y q x where y q x represents log permeability within the q th mesoform the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x are ritzi et al 2004 3 m y q 1 n p q m q 4 σ y 2 q 1 n p q σ q 2 1 2 q 1 n p q n p q p p m q m p 2 where pq mq and σ q 2 are volume proportion in facies mean and variance respectively following prior studies we assume that the coefficient of variation in lengths of sedimentary facies types approaches unity which is common in nature guin and ritzi 2008 white and willis 2000 dai et al 2005 shows validity of this assumption for data used in this article thus as per ritzi 2000 an exponential model can be used to represent covariances and transition probabilities of the hierarchical correlation structure therefore auto covariances and transition probabilities are expressed as 5 c qq h σ q 2 e h λ q 6 t qp h p q δ qp p q e h λ i for transition probabilities if q p it is auto transition probability and if q p it is cross transition probability the δ qp is the kronecker delta because the cross covariances have negligible contribution to the global covariance they can be ignored this is a common assumption and was verified by rizit et al 2004 and dai et al 2005 2009 therefore the hierarchical global covariance is expressed as 7 c y h q 1 n p q c qq h t kk h 1 2 q 1 n p q n m q m p 2 p q p p t qp h substitute eqs 5 and 6 into eq 7 the hierarchical global covariance function is 8 c y h q 1 n p q 2 σ q 2 e h λ q q 1 n p q 1 p q σ q 2 e h λ q λ i λ q λ i 1 2 q 1 n p q n m q m p 2 p q p p e h λ i where λ q and λ i is the facies integral scale and the indicator integral scale respectively the first two terms on the rhs of eq 8 are referred to the auto terms weighted by auto transition probabilities and volume proportions the third term on the rhs of eq 8 is referred to cross term representing the differences in y x across facies boundaries dai et al 2004 and ritzi et al 2004 have verified the exact equivalence of the left and right sides of eq 7 as well as eq 8 by using exhaustively sampled data within a point bar deposit 2 3 lagrangian based transport model dai et al 2004 developed the hierarchical expressions for the longitudinal α 11 t and the transverse dispersivity α 22 t of a non reactive solute their models are based on the velocity covariance more detailed information about velocity covariance can be found in dagan 1989 and rubin 2003 detailed derivation of the formulas was presented by soltanian et al 2015d main assumptions for the lagrangian based model are 1 average hydraulic gradient is aligned with the principal axis 2 steady state flow condition 3 velocity field is uniform 4 log permeability variance is less than unity i e mildly heterogeneous and 5 flow domain is unbounded note that the lagrangian based model used here is based on the first order approximation which is appropriate to the sediment with weak heterogeneity σ y 2 1 dagan et al 2003 here as the σ y 2 is less than unity the usage of the first order approximation is justified recently the physically based models have been developed which can overcome limitations of the first order approximation e g see fiori et al 2006 and cvetkovic et al 2014 for more details in this paper we use the three dimensional 3d lagrangian based transport model developed by dai et al 2004 to obtain α 11 t and α 22 t we modify dai et al 2004 models to represent one macroform facies at level ii and n mesoforms at level i the α 11 t and α 22 t for 3d media are written as α 11 ζ 1 3 q 1 n α ζ q η ζ q 1 e τ ζ q ε 0 2 r j 1 β 2 u 3 2 ε r 2 u ν ν 2 u 3 2 f r d r 9 f r 2 β 2 j 1 β β j 0 β r τ ζ q 2 ε 3 r 3 4 u ν 5 ν 4 u u 3 2 ν 3 u 3 2 10 α 22 ζ 1 3 q 1 n α ζ q η ζ q ε 0 2 j 1 β β j 0 β τ ζ q 2 ε 3 r 3 4 u ν 5 ν 4 u u 3 2 r ν 3 u 3 2 d r where β r τ ζ q u 1 r 2 ν 1 r 2 ε 2 r 2 and τ ζ q tu α ζ q the u e m y g n is the mean velocity assuming that the x direction is aligned with the mean velocity direction g is the mean hydraulic gradient n is the porosity ε is the anisotropy ratio and is equal to the ratio of the vertical integral scale to the horizontal integral scale and r is the integral variable the terms j 0 and j 1 are the zero and first order bessel functions respectively expression for coefficients α ζ q and η ζ q are presented in table 1 the sum of ζ 1 2 terms represent the contribution to dispersion from the auto term and the ζ 3 represents the contribution from the cross term this hierarchical and multiscale lagrangian based model provide a strong and realistic link between sedimentary architecture of aquifers and solute dispersion geologic data are more abundant than permeability data for example geological data on the length volume proportions and juxtapositional tendencies of facies could be obtained from outcrop measurement transects core or geologic models e g dai et al 2005 rubin et al 2006 soltanian and ritzi 2014 therefore there is strong practical benefit in linking transport models such as eqs 9 and 10 directly to geologic data the particle displacement variance and dispersivity are related by sudicky 1986 rubin 2003 11 d 11 t 1 2 d x 11 dt the dispersion coefficient is related to the dispersivity by 12 d 11 t α 11 t u using eqs 11 and 12 we can obtain the relationship between dispersivity and particle displacement variance 13 x 11 t 2 u 0 t α 11 t d t therefore we can write x 11 t as 14 x 11 t ζ 1 3 q n α ζ q η ζ q 2 u t 2 α ζ q e τ ζ q 1 2 u ε 0 t 0 2 r j 1 β 2 u 3 2 ε r 2 u ν ν 2 u 3 2 f r d r d t where f r 2 β 2 j 1 β β j 0 β r τ ζ q 2 ε 3 r 3 4 u ν 5 ν 4 u u 3 2 ν 3 u 3 2 the lagrangian based transport models introduced here are similar to those developed by ramanathan et al 2008 they validated their models by comparing the estimated dispersivity and partical displacement variance to the observed plume moments at the well documented borden site eqs 9 10 and 14 are parameterized by data from española basin as our outcrop is extended mainly in a vertical x z plain thus the collected sedimentary data is in 2d framework we have to assume the correlation lengths are the same in x and y directions when characterizing the spatial correlation structures and dispersivities therefore the y direction does not have its own variation in this case if a full 3d data is available we can characterize the sedimentary heterogeneity in a real 3d framework and conduct the similar analysis on lateral dispersivity it is also worth noting that the lagrangian based models developed here are based on transition probability based geostatistics other geostatistical approach such as multi point geostatistic can also provide effective representation for complex sedimentary structure and can be used to parameterize the transport models guardiano and srivastava 1993 mariethoz et al 2010 tahmasebi 2018 tahmasebi et al 2012 2 4 global sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis can help determine the key parameters that drive the dispersion of a solute transporting through the hierarchical and multimodal media sobol indices method is a quantitative global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition this method decomposes the model into a function of individual parameters and their combinations the importance of each parameter and the interaction influences among them are weighed by the influence of the variance of the single input parameter or the parameter set on the total output variance sobol method traditionally calculates the sensitivity indices based on monte carlo simulations the monte carlo simulations are computationally expensive when the amount of the parameter is large to avoid such computational burden sudret 2008 proposed a polynomials chaos expansion based pce based method to obtain sobol indices in this paper we use pce based sobol sensitivity as our global sensitivity method to quantify sensitivity of dispersivity over the entire range of the input parameters here we review some key steps of the method for completeness more information that are detailed can be found in gratiet et al 2016 sudret 2008 and koohbor et al 2019 the model can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal polynomials 15 g g pce x α a g α ψ α x w h e r e g α m i n 1 n i 1 n m x i α a g α ψ α x i 2 where a is a set of multi indices a α 1 α 2 α m g α and ψ α x are the corresponding coefficients and multivariate orthogonal polynomials for α a the coefficients g α can be obtained by minimizing the difference between the physical model m x here refers to dispersivity and the meta model α a g α ψ α x by the least squares n is the total number of realizations see fajraoui et al 2017 on the basis of pce the model output s total variance can be expressed as follows 16 d pce α a α 0 g α 2 then the pce based first order and total sobol indices are obtained by following formulas 17 s i pce 1 α a i α 0 g α 2 d a i α a α i 0 α j i 0 18 s i pce t o t a l α a i t α 0 g α 2 d a i t α a α i 0 the first order sobol indices reflect the contribution of the individual variable to the total variance of the model the larger the first order sobol indices the greater the impact of the variable s change on the final output the total sobol indices include the cross effects among variables the differences between total sobol s indices and first order sobol indices represent the contribution of interactions between parameters if the difference is small the interactions between the variable with other variables has small effect on the output global sensitivity analysis are performed in this article using uqlab an open source framework for uncertainty quantification in matlab e g marelli and sudret 2015a b 3 results and discussion we use the estimated parameters from dai et al 2019 to parameterize the lagrangian based models in eqs 9 10 and 14 in order to calculate dispersivities and particle displacement variance specifically dai et al 2019 used an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical correlation model with nested functions described in section 2 2 in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation model they used the least squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints as the objective function for theinverse problem the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method was used to solve this inverse problem their results showed that the estimated covariance models provide accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability for field measured data from the outcrop shown in fig 1 they provided three different methods of estimating parameters defining the spatial correlation structure of y data measured on the outcrop shown in fig 1 these methods differ in level of sedimentary architecture data used to develop the spatial correlation structure their first model model p hereafter is based on indicator data corresponding to only the locations of permeability measurements i e 1755 permeability measurements and indicator data the second model model w hereafter is based on indicator data from the whole outcrop i e 1755 permeability measurements and 14 860 indicator data the third model model g hereafter was based on indicator data i e 1755 permeability measurements and 14 860 indicator data combined with geologic interpretations or geological conjecture see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 and dai et al 2019 actually geological interpretations has implicitly increased the number of data sedimentologists systematic analysis was added therefore geological conjecture combines the sedimentologists systematic analysis with indicator data to estimate mean lengths for each facies using the embedding coefficients the indicator correlation scale is then calculated using those mean lengths dai et al 2019 also provided estimates for the upscaled parameters i e unimodal correlation structure defined by a finite integral scale variance and a global mean permeability for model p we will use these both multimodal and unimodal correlation models in this article we estimated upscaled parameters of a unimodal model based on high resolution indicator data corresponding to model w in this article as well we refer to the unimodal model developed based on indicator data similar to model p as model up we also refer to the unimodal model developed based on indicator data similar to model w as model uw the estimated parameters are listed in tables 2 6 the fitting results for various components of the spatial correlation models e g auto and cross transition probabilities and auto and cross covariances are shown in figs 3 11 in dai et al 2019 to which we refer the readers it is clear from tables 2 4 that the main difference between the estimated parameters of the multimodal covariance is related to the indicator integral scale the indicator integral scale for model p is about half of both model w and g this may not seem significant but we will show how this small different can add a large error in dispersivity and displacement variance note that as per dai et al 2019 all these models very well captured the global covariance correlation structure another interesting observation is related to estimated parameters for both upscaled unimodal models specifically the integral scale i e measure of continuity is under estimated for both cases 3 1 dispersivity and displacement variance here we first present our results for the longitudinal dispersivity α 11 t calculated by using eq 9 as mentioned the models are parameterized using parameters in tables 2 6 the porosity n is assumed constant and is 0 3 the mean hydraulic gradient g is equal to unity results of α 11 t versus dimensionless time τ tu λ y are shown in fig 2 the results of α 11 t for model p are smaller than those of model w and g in model p the transition probability structure is defined by indicator data corresponding to the locations of the permeability measurement while in model w and g the transition probability structure is well characterized by extensive number of indicator data dai et al 2019 showed that model w and model g both very well characterize the spatial bivariate correlation structure they also showed that the differences between model p and model w or g is small in representing the correlation structure however as mentioned previously the main difference is indicator integral scale quantifying degree of continuity in indicator data therefore under estimating indicator integral scale in model p results in under estimating the time evolution of the longitudinal dispersivity also the asymptotic dispersivity is under estimated therefore slight differences in estimating correlation structure both the shape and the range of the global convariance are close result in over 100 error in calculating plume dispersion the upscaled model up and uw have similar asymptotic values for α 11 t compared to their corresponding multiscale models p and w this confirms that the upscaled spatial correlation models are able to capture essential parameters to estimate dispersivity tables 5 and 6 regardless of resolution of the indicator data however α 11 t for the upscaled models reach the asymptotic values sooner and thus they do not well capture the transient growth of the plume the usefulness of multimodal covariance models compared to unimodal models will be discussed later in this article in the lagrangian based transport models the dispersivity is directly proportional to the global integral scale λ y and the particle displacement variance is directly proportional to λ y 2 see soltanian et al 2015c d therefore the underestimated integral scale of model p results in a more pronounced underestimation when it comes to x 11 t using eq 14 we calculated x 11 t the results are plotted in fig 3 similar to α 11 t results the unimodal model parameters can capture the large time linear growth of x 11 t that multiscale cases represent model p that uses less indicator data and under estimate x 11 t by about 160 compared to model w as time increases the difference between x 11 t of model w and model p two become larger therefore the large time performance of the model for x 11 t is sensitive to the estimated heterogeneity parameters see dagan 1986 rubin 2003 the difference between the upscaled unimodal model with their corresponding hierarchical multimodal model is mainly related to the time they reach asymptotic dispersivity since the upscaled models tend to reach their asymptotic stage faster due to their smaller integral scale i e λ y than multimodal model the transverse dispersivity α 22 t for five different cases is shown in fig 4 as fig 4 shows α 22 t shows significant differences our results suggest that α 22 t is quite sensitive to the estimated parameters and thus the spatial heterogeneity structure this has important implications on mixing and dilution of a moving plume e g cirpka et al 2011 2015 de barros et al 2015 de barros and fiori 2014 dentz et al 2011 fiori 2001 fiori and dagan 2000 rolle et al 2009 tartakovsky et al 2009 it is also relevant for quantifying bio degradation of reactive plumes see zech et al 2019 as opposed to α 11 t the upscaled models does not show similar behavior for α 22 t to their corresponding hierarchical multimodal models therefore our results confirm that the upscaled and estimated parameters are not able to capture α 22 t our results show how α 22 t is sensitive to heterogeneity characterization and high resolution indicator data needed to develop well characterized multimodal correlation structures of transition probabilities the exploration on potential effects of the differences between various correlation structures on plume mixing and dilution is our ongoing work and is outside the scope of this article in fact theoretical research on transverse dispersion is an active area of research see detail discussion by zech et al 2019 note that eq 10 was derived for transverse dispersivity for infinite péclet conditions by neglecting diffusion and local scale dispersion as a result the dispersivities shown in the fig 4 eventually reach to zero the readers are referred to fiori 1996 and fiori and dagan 2000 for more information results above show that a spatial bivariate correlation model may provide a reasonable representation for the bivariate statistics but it still may not provide a reasonable estimation for the dispersivity and or the particle displacement variance therefore there is value in estimating the plume dispersion with high resolution indicator data mainly because the permeability correlation structure can be better represented the resolution of data seems have no effect on the behavior of the upscaled models compared to their corresponding multimodal models upscaled models can well capture the asymptotic behavior of the longitudinal dispersion however the same is not true for the transverse dispersion if upscaled models fail to provide a reasonable estimate for transverse dispersion they will probably fail in reasonably capturing dilution and mixing process 3 2 contributions of auto and cross terms here we calculate the relative contributions of the auto and cross terms to the longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity respectively this is the value of the hierarchical correlation models and the resulting lagrangian based transport models in that they include more information about physical properties of facies types including their proportions and mean lengths therefore they provide practical advantages in that geologic data are more abundant than permeability data and far more abundant than geochemical data e g sorption distribution coefficient the formulas of lagrangian based models see eqs 9 10 and 14 allow quantifying the contribution to dispersion from each scale of sedimentary architecture see ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi and soltanian 2015 soltanian et al 2015 analyzing and observing how auto and cross terms contribute to dispersion provide more fundamental understanding on how dispersion process is controlled by heterogeneity structure this is not possible with models that only consider unimodal correlation structures longitudinal results are shown in table 7 and are also plotted in fig 5 for longitudinal dispersivity we found that the auto term and cross term have similar evolution trend with higher contributions from cross terms also the cross terms reach the asymptotic dispersion at a longer time scales this is in fact due to scale dependent dispersivity as it takes longer time for the plume to sample large scale heterogeneity structures there is an interesting process is observed with the number of indictor data increasing the value of auto term is almost same compare model p and model w or g however the value of cross term increases substantially therefore with more indicator data the heterogeneity reflected by the model is also stronger as per dai et al 2019 model w can provide a better representation of spatial correlation structure in longitudinal direction this is also true for model g since the relative contribution of auto and cross term is closed to model w even with implicit more data the value of cross term in model g is larger than model w with less indicator data model p is not able to well represent the heterogeneity structure as a result it does not well represent the time evolution of dispersivity the auto term and cross term relative contribution of the transverse dispersivity α 22 t are shown in table 8 and are also plotted in fig 6 we also found that the auto term and cross term have similar evolution trend then the cross term reaches the maximum dispersion at a longer time scale this is also in fact due to scale dependent dispersivity as it takes longer time for the plume to sample large scale heterogeneity structures while different with longitudinal dispersivity the auto term of transverse dispersivity in model p less resolution have much larger contribution than cross term when more indicator data are used model w and model g higher contribution comes from cross term for model p initially the relative contribution of auto term is larger than cross term as time increases the cross term relative contribution will overcomes that auto term it is mainly because the solute is located within a facies initially and thus only the auto term contributes to its dispersion as plume grows it samples different facies types and the cross transition terms grow and contribute more to dispersion process it is known that more detailed indicator data can provide a better estimation for cross transition probability structure e g dai et al 2005 2019 ritzi et al 2004 2013 therefore a well defined cross transition probability structure used in theoretical and numerical models for transport will provide more accurate representation on plume dispersion 3 3 polynomials chaos expansion based pce based sobol indices as mentioned in sections 3 1 and 3 2 different models can provide similar representation of spatial correlation structure and the slight difference in spatial correlation parameters can make a significant difference in predicting dispersion in order to study the sources of uncertainty here we use global sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of model output i e dispersivity to input parameters reflecting heterogeneity we used the pce based sobol indices method to calculate the total and first order sobol indices number of samples for input parameters of longitudinal and transverse dispersivities model are 3000 the input parameter in our lagrangian based transport models are anisotropy ratio indictor scale integral scale in facies mean permeabilities in facies variance of permeability and volume proportions value and distribution types of these parameters for sensitivity analysis are listed in table 9 the total and first order sobol indices for α 11 and α 22 are plotted in figs 7 and 8 respectively fig 7 shows that α 11 is most sensitive to the indicator scale since both indices of indicator scale are the highest among these input parameters as per dai et al 2004 α 11 increases as the indicator scale increases model g have the highest indicator scale after model g model w and model p respectively have the highest indicator scales the result is same with the order of longitudinal dispersivity in the three models the mean permeabilities seem to be the second sensitive parameters anisotropy ratio integral scale variance of permeability and volume proportions of facies have insignificant impact on α 11 note that the sensitivity contribution of mean permeability mainly comes from the difference between the first order and the total sobol index in fact the mean permeabilities show the largest interaction values this indicates that the interactions between mean permeabilities and other variables has largest effect on α 11 compared to other parameters for α 22 the anisotropy ratio has the highest values for both total sobol index and the first order sobol index over 75 of the total sobol sensitivity index of the anisotropy ratio comes from the first order sobol sensitivity index similar to α 11 a large proportion of mean permeabilities total sobol sensitivity index comes from the cross effects and have the largest interaction value among these parameters the total and first order sobol indices of indicator scale integral scale variance of y and proportion is closed to zero this indicates that the change of these four parameters have a small impact on α 22 overall the anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity as per dai et al 2004 and soltanian et al 2015d as the anisotropy ratio decreases the α 22 increase this is due to lateral mass transfer between streamlines with different velocities that are located close to each other rubin 2003 the interactions between mean permeabilities and other variables also have largest effect on α 22 compared to other parameters for permeabilities comparing the results above for α 11 and α 22 show that mean permeabilities are the sensitive parameter for both mean permeabilities also have the largest cross effect value for both α 11 and α 22 indicating that the interaction between mean permeabilities and other parameters is relatively strong thisisdueto the contrast in the mean permeability between different facies that significantly affect dispersion the longitudinal dispersivity largelydependson the indicator integral scale the α 22 is quite sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity structure and thus anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity it is important to exactly capture the spatial correlation structure for studying plume dispersion even though the spatial bivariate correlation structure can be well represented when less resolution indicator i e lithology data are used using more indicator data can certainly improve the estimation of spatial variability which in turn improve the estimation of a plume dispersion 4 conclusions we compare the dispersivity and particle displacement variance based on different parameters from different spatial bivariate correlation models developed by dai et al 2019 for unconsolidated sediments of española basin in order to get a more fundamental understanding on how the resolution of sedimentary indicator data affect plume dispersion estimation as well as the parameter and model uncertainty in the multiscale aquifer systems pce based sobol sensitivity indices method is used to quantify the sensitivity and the uncertainty of the input geostatistical parameters total sobol indices and first order sobol indices are analyzed to describe those parameters cross impact and their individual impact on both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities the major conclusion of this study are as follows 1 small differences in the multiscale spatial correlation structure both the shape and the range of the global convariance are close result in large differences in dispersivity calculations and the particle displacement variance though the spatial correlation structure can be characterized by less indicator data it is valuable to obtain more indicator data from various data sources when it comes to estimate transport parameters such as dispersion 2 both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are underestimated if transition probability structures are not well captured in sedimentary architecture data specifically it is more pronounced when cross transition probabilities are underestimated 3 the number of indicator data does not affect the corresponding the upscaled correlation structure unimodal models with upscaled parameters can provide nearly the same longitudinal dispersivity specifically unimodal models are able to capture the asymptotic dispersivities however the upscaled models do not capture the transient growth of both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities additionally unimodal models do not allow quantifying the contribution from each scale of stratification also the contribution from auto and cross terms to dispersion remain unclear when unimodal models are used 4 longitudinal dispersivity is most sensitive to the indicator integral scale the anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity transverse dispersivity is quite sensitive to the details of heterogeneity structures thus it is important to incorporate more indicator data and develop a well characterized spatial correlation model for the estimation of transvers dispersion mean permeability of sedimentary facies are the second most sensitive parameter for both longitudinal and transvers dispersivities estimations credit authorship contribution statement zhenxue dai

5830,the potential impacts of the spatial resolution of sedimentary structure data on solute dispersion in heterogeneous porous formations are investigated with lagrangian based transport models the models rely on a covariance function that represent a hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies types by using facies physical properties such as volume proportions and mean length as well as auto and cross transition probabilities and their log permeability covariance a detailed sedimentary architecture data i e indicator data provides better representation of the spatial correlation structures of the global covariances through capturing its underlying structure defined by transition probabilities more accurately however the extent to which such data affect time dependent transport parameters i e dispersivity is unclear in this study we parameterize transport models using detailed collocated sedimentary architecture and permeability data from an outcrop in española basin nm in addition we perform global sensitivity analysis based on polynomials chaos expansion to understand the significance of parameters in the transport models the results show that dispersivity and particle displacement variance are under estimated if less resolved facies i e indicator data are used even if the global covariance structure is well captured dispersivity is sensitive to the correlation scale that is directly calculated from sedimentary architecture data and the mean log permeability however anisotropy ratio and mean log permeability are the most sensitive parameters for the transverse dispersivity keywords solute transport dispersion sedimentary architecture lagrangian based model sensitivity analysis 1 introduction spatial heterogeneity in physical and geochemical properties has a significant impact on flow and transport processes in both fracture and porous media bolster and dentz 2012 dagan 1989 dai et al 2009 2019 de barros 2018 de barros et al 2015 fiori et

such as dispersivity and retardation factor e g deng 2013 rajaram 1997 ritzi and soltanian 2015 soltanian et al 2015 to practically tackle these scale dependent parameters upscaling approach has been proposed in which the effect of small scale variability is incorporated upscaling can be categorized into stochastic averaging e g bedrikovetsky 2008 dagan 1984 de barros and fiori 2014 gelhar 1993

2003 wood and valdés parada 2013 and homogenization e g lunati et al 2002 in this paper we focus on stochastic averaging by using lagrangian based models lagrangian based models for quantifying solute dispersion or spreading were initially developed by dagan 1984 which involve the application of taylor s 1922 analysis of diffusion by continuous movement this stochastic approach has been used and advanced over the past three decades bellin et al 1994 dagan and fiori 1997 dai et al 2004 de barros et al 2015 fiori 2001 fiori et al 2002 fiori and dagan 2000 lu and zhang 2002 rubin 1995 rubin et al 1999 soltanian et al 2015 sudicky 1986 this is mainly due to its physically based nature in providing a direct link between the spatial bivariate correlation structure e g semivariogram or covariance of log permeability y ln k for example rajaram 1997 presented scale dependent effective retardation factor in unimodal porous media however the integral scale of the correlation structure of y in the traditional stochastic approach is a single and finite value in these studies recent work has focused on providing a more realistic link between geologic data and lagrangian based transport models through quantifying sedimentary architecture using indicator geostatistics dai et al 2004 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 and soltanian et al 2015a b c 2017 sedimentary aquifers are often characterized by facies types at different scales dai et al 2019 gershenzon 2015 soltanian and ritzi 2014 thus the integral scale of y arising from such heterogeneity may be neither finite nor single valued dai et al 2004 2019 ritzi and soltanian 2015 therefore it is advantageous to quantify and incorporate the multi facies and the hierarchical nature of sedimentary architecture into theories and numerical simulations for flow and mass transport for example dai et al 2004 used a hierarchical and anisotropic covariance model to derive dispersion coefficients for transport of non reactive solutes using the lagrangian based approach their model represents multi facies architecture within one scale of heterogeneity which is an extension to the covariance and the lagrangian models derived by lu and zhang 2002 and rubin 1995 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 incorporated two scales of sedimentary structure using observed data from the borden aquifer using highly resolved sedimentary architecture data their model successfully explain the observed dispersivity at the borden tracer test sudicky and illman 2011 soltanian et al 2015a b derived the multiscale lagrangian based transport models for reactive solute retardation and dispersion these models provided a viable explanation for the non ideal behavior of perchloroethylene pce plume observed at the borden tracer test by providing a better link to the sedimentary architecture data deng et al 2013 and soltanian et al 2015c developed the lagrangian base models to calculate the effective retardation factor and reactive solute dispersivity in multimodal heterogeneous media the focus of this paper is to understand how the spatial resolution of geologic data affect plume dispersion in multiscale and hierarchical systems one of the main challenges in developing spatial bivariate correlation models for hierarchical systems is how to quantify and incorporate geologic data at different scales this is often done by 1 obtaining sedimentary structure data 2 mapping the data using indicator geostatistics and 3 quantifying probability of transition from one facies to another i e transition probability 4 using the transition probability structure to quantify the spatial bivariate correlation structure e g general shape and range of y carle et al 1998 lunt et al 2005 ritzi et al 2004 2013 ritzi and allen king 2007 previous studies indicated that spatial bivariate correlation structures couldn t be well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probability structures specially the cross transitions dai et al 2019 popken 2005 therefore incorporating more sedimentary structure data is beneficial for representing the spatial correlation structures more accurately however the extent to which the resolution of sedimentary architecture data i e indicator data affect the solute dispersion remains unclear this paper will address this issue in this paper we use three spatial correlation structures which are derived based on different levels of sedimentary architecture data following dai et al 2019 the data include low resolution indicator data collocated in locations of permeability measurement high resolution indicator data and implicit high resolution indicator data combined with geological interpretation see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 and dai et al 2019 we parameterize the multiscale lagrangian based models using three spatial correlation structures and study how different level of indictor i e lithological data affect dispersion process dai et al 2019 showed that the spatial bivariate correlation structure could be well represented even when incomplete indicator data is used however using more indicator data can certainly improve the estimation of spatial variability here we investigate if this slight difference both the shape and the range of the global covariance are close in the correlation models can significantly affect dispersion we also perform a detailed global sensitivity analysis for model parameters dai et al 2004 explored the sensitivity of a multimodal lagrangian based model to input parameters through manually changing parameters their conclusions however are mainly qualitative and the relative impact of each parameter are not determined from their analysis to address this issue we use polynomials chaos expansion pce based sobol sensitivity method to quantify sensitivity of the lagrangian models to input parameters over possible ranges the detailed global sensitivity analysis on lagrangian based models in both unimodal and multimodal media can optimize site geostatistical work in practical problems 2 multiscale statistics and transport models 2 1 hierarchical sedimentary architecture heterogeneity within sedimentary deposits can be well represented by a hierarchical framework dai et al 2019 ritzi et al 2013 ritzi and allen king 2007 different hierarchical organization can be obtained by different criterion depending on research objective soltanian and ritzi 2014 in this paper we study non reactive solute dispersion in a hierarchical media and consider a hierarchical organization of sedimentary facies defined by permeability heterogeneity dai et al 2019 studied the details of sedimentary architecture in an outcrop within española basin nm here we use the conceptual model and results of dai et al 2019 to estimate the dispersion gaud et al 2004 mapped and studied the outcrop in española basin new mexico see also kuhle and smith 2001 smith 2000 and dai et al 2005 the length along the outcrop structural strike is about 370 m and the exposed stratigraphic thickness is about 30 m see fig 1 dai et al 2019 established a multimodal hierarchical model to identify the spatial correlation structure of y for the outcrop shown in fig 1 this multimodal hierarchical model consists of two levels level or scale i is mesoform level which refers to the smaller scale lithofacies there are distinct boundaries between these mesoforms across these boundaries the orientation volume proportion and average grain size as well as types of microform will change significantly dai et al 2005 there are four facies types at this level as illustrated in fig 1 macroform is the level with one facies comprised of all four mesoform facies types this level represents the cumulative result of a long period of multiple sedimentary events and is composed of channel and inter channel deposits 2 2 univariate and spatial bivariate statistics we use the general form of hierarchical correlation model developed by ritzi et al 2004 here we consider a macroform made up of n mesoforms four in this article of mutually exclusive occurrences the indicator variable i q x can be written as 1 i q x 1 i f m e s o f o r m q i s a t l o c a t i o n x 0 o t h e r w i s e the composite log permeability y x is expressed as 2 y x q 1 n i q x y q x where y q x represents log permeability within the q th mesoform the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x are ritzi et al 2004 3 m y q 1 n p q m q 4 σ y 2 q 1 n p q σ q 2 1 2 q 1 n p q n p q p p m q m p 2 where pq mq and σ q 2 are volume proportion in facies mean and variance respectively following prior studies we assume that the coefficient of variation in lengths of sedimentary facies types approaches unity which is common in nature guin and ritzi 2008 white and willis 2000 dai et al 2005 shows validity of this assumption for data used in this article thus as per ritzi 2000 an exponential model can be used to represent covariances and transition probabilities of the hierarchical correlation structure therefore auto covariances and transition probabilities are expressed as 5 c qq h σ q 2 e h λ q 6 t qp h p q δ qp p q e h λ i for transition probabilities if q p it is auto transition probability and if q p it is cross transition probability the δ qp is the kronecker delta because the cross covariances have negligible contribution to the global covariance they can be ignored this is a common assumption and was verified by rizit et al 2004 and dai et al 2005 2009 therefore the hierarchical global covariance is expressed as 7 c y h q 1 n p q c qq h t kk h 1 2 q 1 n p q n m q m p 2 p q p p t qp h substitute eqs 5 and 6 into eq 7 the hierarchical global covariance function is 8 c y h q 1 n p q 2 σ q 2 e h λ q q 1 n p q 1 p q σ q 2 e h λ q λ i λ q λ i 1 2 q 1 n p q n m q m p 2 p q p p e h λ i where λ q and λ i is the facies integral scale and the indicator integral scale respectively the first two terms on the rhs of eq 8 are referred to the auto terms weighted by auto transition probabilities and volume proportions the third term on the rhs of eq 8 is referred to cross term representing the differences in y x across facies boundaries dai et al 2004 and ritzi et al 2004 have verified the exact equivalence of the left and right sides of eq 7 as well as eq 8 by using exhaustively sampled data within a point bar deposit 2 3 lagrangian based transport model dai et al 2004 developed the hierarchical expressions for the longitudinal α 11 t and the transverse dispersivity α 22 t of a non reactive solute their models are based on the velocity covariance more detailed information about velocity covariance can be found in dagan 1989 and rubin 2003 detailed derivation of the formulas was presented by soltanian et al 2015d main assumptions for the lagrangian based model are 1 average hydraulic gradient is aligned with the principal axis 2 steady state flow condition 3 velocity field is uniform 4 log permeability variance is less than unity i e mildly heterogeneous and 5 flow domain is unbounded note that the lagrangian based model used here is based on the first order approximation which is appropriate to the sediment with weak heterogeneity σ y 2 1 dagan et al 2003 here as the σ y 2 is less than unity the usage of the first order approximation is justified recently the physically based models have been developed which can overcome limitations of the first order approximation e g see fiori et al 2006 and cvetkovic et al 2014 for more details in this paper we use the three dimensional 3d lagrangian based transport model developed by dai et al 2004 to obtain α 11 t and α 22 t we modify dai et al 2004 models to represent one macroform facies at level ii and n mesoforms at level i the α 11 t and α 22 t for 3d media are written as α 11 ζ 1 3 q 1 n α ζ q η ζ q 1 e τ ζ q ε 0 2 r j 1 β 2 u 3 2 ε r 2 u ν ν 2 u 3 2 f r d r 9 f r

r 2 ε 2 r 2 and τ ζ q tu α ζ q the u e m y g n is the mean velocity assuming that the x direction is aligned with the mean velocity direction g is the mean hydraulic gradient n is the porosity ε is the anisotropy ratio and is equal to the ratio of the vertical integral scale to the horizontal integral scale and r is the integral variable the terms j 0 and j 1 are the zero and first order bessel functions respectively expression for coefficients α ζ q and η ζ q are presented in table 1 the sum of ζ 1 2 terms represent the contribution to dispersion from the auto term and the ζ 3 represents the contribution from the cross term this hierarchical and multiscale lagrangian based model provide a strong and realistic link between sedimentary architecture of aquifers and solute dispersion geologic data are more abundant than permeability data for example geological data on the length volume proportions and juxtapositional tendencies of facies could be obtained from outcrop measurement transects core or geologic models e g dai et al 2005 rubin et al 2006 soltanian and ritzi 2014 therefore there is strong practical benefit in linking transport models such as eqs 9 and 10 directly to geologic data the particle displacement variance and dispersivity are related by sudicky 1986 rubin 2003 11 d 11 t 1 2 d x 11 dt the dispersion coefficient is related to the dispersivity by 12 d 11 t α 11 t u using eqs 11 and 12 we can obtain the relationship between dispersivity and particle displacement variance 13 x 11 t 2 u 0 t α 11 t d t therefore we can write x 11 t as 14 x 11 t ζ 1 3 q n α ζ q η ζ q 2 u t 2 α ζ q e τ ζ q 1 2 u ε 0 t 0 2 r j 1 β 2 u 3 2 ε r 2 u ν ν 2 u 3 2 f r d r d t where f r 2 β 2 j 1 β β j 0 β r τ ζ q 2 ε 3 r 3 4 u ν 5 ν 4 u u 3 2 ν 3 u 3 2 the lagrangian based transport models introduced here are similar to those developed by ramanathan et al 2008 they validated their models by comparing the estimated dispersivity and partical displacement variance to the observed plume moments at the well documented borden site eqs 9 10 and 14 are parameterized by data from española basin as our outcrop is extended mainly in a vertical x z plain thus the collected sedimentary data is in 2d framework we have to assume the correlation lengths are the same in x and y directions when characterizing the spatial correlation structures and dispersivities therefore the y direction does not have its own variation in this case if a full 3d data is available we can characterize the sedimentary heterogeneity in a real 3d framework and conduct the similar analysis on lateral dispersivity it is also worth noting that the lagrangian based models developed here are based on transition probability based geostatistics other geostatistical approach such as multi point geostatistic can also provide effective representation for complex sedimentary structure and can be used to parameterize the transport models guardiano and srivastava 1993 mariethoz et al 2010 tahmasebi 2018 tahmasebi et al 2012 2 4 global sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis can help determine the key parameters that drive the dispersion of a solute transporting through the hierarchical and multimodal media sobol indices method is a quantitative global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition this method decomposes the model into a function of individual parameters and their combinations the importance of each parameter and the interaction influences among them are weighed by the influence of the variance of the single input parameter or the parameter set on the total output variance sobol method traditionally calculates the sensitivity indices based on monte carlo simulations the monte carlo simulations are computationally expensive when the amount of the parameter is large to avoid such computational burden sudret 2008 proposed a polynomials chaos expansion based pce based method to obtain sobol indices in this paper we use pce based sobol sensitivity as our global sensitivity method to quantify sensitivity of dispersivity over the entire range of the input parameters here we review some key steps of the method for completeness more information that are detailed can be found in gratiet et al 2016 sudret 2008 and koohbor et al 2019 the model can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal polynomials 15 g g pce x α a g α ψ α x w h e r e g α m i n 1 n i 1 n m x i α a g α ψ α x i 2 where a is a set of multi indices a α 1 α 2 α m g α and ψ α x are the corresponding coefficients and multivariate orthogonal polynomials for α a the coefficients g α can be obtained by minimizing the difference between the physical model m x here refers to dispersivity and the meta model α a g α ψ α x by the least squares n is the total number of realizations see fajraoui et al 2017 on the basis of pce the model output s total variance can be expressed as follows 16 d pce α a α 0 g α 2 then the pce based first order and total sobol indices are obtained by following formulas 17 s i pce 1 α a i α 0 g α 2 d a i α a α i 0 α j i 0 18 s i pce t o t a l α a i t α 0 g α 2 d a i t α a α i 0 the first order sobol indices reflect the contribution of the individual variable to the total variance of the model the larger the first order sobol indices the greater the impact of the variable s change on the final output the total sobol indices include the cross effects among variables the differences between total sobol s indices and first order sobol indices represent the contribution of interactions between parameters if the difference is small the interactions between the variable with other variables has small effect on the output global sensitivity analysis are performed in this article using uqlab an open source framework for uncertainty quantification in matlab e g marelli and sudret 2015a b 3 results and discussion we use the estimated parameters from dai et al 2019 to parameterize the lagrangian based models in eqs 9 10 and 14 in order to calculate dispersivities and particle displacement variance specifically dai et al 2019 used an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical correlation model with nested functions described in section 2 2 in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation model they used the least squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints as the objective function for theinverse problem the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method was used to solve this inverse problem their results showed that the estimated covariance models provide accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability for field measured data from the outcrop shown in fig 1 they provided three different methods of estimating parameters defining the spatial correlation structure of y data measured on the outcrop shown in fig 1 these methods differ in level of sedimentary architecture data used to develop the spatial correlation structure their first model model p hereafter is based on indicator data corresponding to only the locations of permeability measurements i e 1755 permeability measurements and indicator data the second model model w hereafter is based on indicator data from the whole outcrop i e 1755 permeability measurements and 14 860 indicator data the third model model g hereafter was based on indicator data i e 1755 permeability measurements and 14 860 indicator data combined with geologic interpretations or geological conjecture see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 and dai et al 2019 actually geological interpretations has implicitly increased the number of data sedimentologists systematic analysis was added therefore geological conjecture combines the sedimentologists systematic analysis with indicator data to estimate mean lengths for each facies using the embedding coefficients the indicator correlation scale is then calculated using those mean lengths dai et al 2019 also provided estimates for the upscaled parameters i e unimodal correlation structure defined by a finite integral scale variance and a global mean permeability for model p we will use these both multimodal and unimodal correlation models in this article we estimated upscaled parameters of a unimodal model based on high resolution indicator data corresponding to model w in this article as well we refer to the unimodal model developed based on indicator data similar to model p as model up we also refer to the unimodal model developed based on indicator data similar to model w as model uw the estimated parameters are listed in tables 2 6 the fitting results for various components of the spatial correlation models e g auto and cross transition probabilities and auto and cross covariances are shown in figs 3 11 in dai et al 2019 to which we refer the readers it is clear from tables 2 4 that the main difference between the estimated parameters of the multimodal covariance is related to the indicator integral scale the indicator integral scale for model p is about half of both model w and g this may not seem significant but we will show how this small different can add a large error in dispersivity and displacement variance note that as per dai et al 2019 all these models very well captured the global covariance correlation structure another interesting observation is related to estimated parameters for both upscaled unimodal models specifically the integral scale i e measure of continuity is under estimated for both cases 3 1 dispersivity and displacement variance here we first present our results for the longitudinal dispersivity α 11 t calculated by using eq 9 as mentioned the models are parameterized using parameters in tables 2 6 the porosity n is assumed constant and is 0 3 the mean hydraulic gradient g is equal to unity results of α 11 t versus dimensionless time τ tu λ y are shown in fig 2 the results of α 11 t for model p are smaller than those of model w and g in model p the transition probability structure is defined by indicator data corresponding to the locations of the permeability measurement while in model w and g the transition probability structure is well characterized by extensive number of indicator data dai et al 2019 showed that model w and model g both very well characterize the spatial bivariate correlation structure they also showed that the differences between model p and model w or g is small in representing the correlation structure however as mentioned previously the main difference is indicator integral scale quantifying degree of continuity in indicator data therefore under estimating indicator integral scale in model p results in under estimating the time evolution of the longitudinal dispersivity also the asymptotic dispersivity is under estimated therefore slight differences in estimating correlation structure both the shape and the range of the global convariance are close result in over 100 error in calculating plume dispersion the upscaled model up and uw have similar asymptotic values for α 11 t compared to their corresponding multiscale models p and w this confirms that the upscaled spatial correlation models are able to capture essential parameters to estimate dispersivity tables 5 and 6 regardless of resolution of the indicator data however α 11 t for the upscaled models reach the asymptotic values sooner and thus they do not well capture the transient growth of the plume the usefulness of multimodal covariance models compared to unimodal models will be discussed later in this article in the lagrangian based transport models the dispersivity is directly proportional to the global integral scale λ y and the particle displacement variance is directly proportional to λ y 2 see soltanian et al 2015c d therefore the underestimated integral scale of model p results in a more pronounced underestimation when it comes to x 11 t using eq 14 we calculated x 11 t the results are plotted in fig 3 similar to α 11 t results the unimodal model parameters can capture the large time linear growth of x 11 t that multiscale cases represent model p that uses less indicator data and under estimate x 11 t by about 160 compared to model w as time increases the difference between x 11 t of model w and model p two become larger therefore the large time performance of the model for x 11 t is sensitive to the estimated heterogeneity parameters see dagan 1986 rubin 2003 the difference between the upscaled unimodal model with their corresponding hierarchical multimodal model is mainly related to the time they reach asymptotic dispersivity since the upscaled models tend to reach their asymptotic stage faster due to their smaller integral scale i e λ y than multimodal model the transverse dispersivity α 22 t for five different cases is shown in fig 4 as fig 4 shows α 22 t shows significant differences our results suggest that α 22 t is quite sensitive to the estimated parameters and thus the spatial heterogeneity structure this has important implications on mixing and dilution of a moving plume e g cirpka et al 2011 2015 de barros et al 2015 de barros and fiori 2014 dentz et al 2011 fiori 2001 fiori and dagan 2000 rolle et al 2009 tartakovsky et al 2009 it is also relevant for quantifying bio degradation of reactive plumes see zech et al 2019 as opposed to α 11 t the upscaled models does not show similar behavior for α 22 t to their corresponding hierarchical multimodal models therefore our results confirm that the upscaled and estimated parameters are not able to capture α 22 t our results show how α 22 t is sensitive to heterogeneity characterization and high resolution indicator data needed to develop well characterized multimodal correlation structures of transition probabilities the exploration on potential effects of the differences between various correlation structures on plume mixing and dilution is our ongoing work and is outside the scope of this article in fact theoretical research on transverse dispersion is an active area of research see detail discussion by zech et al 2019 note that eq 10 was derived for transverse dispersivity for infinite péclet conditions by neglecting diffusion and local scale dispersion as a result the dispersivities shown in the fig 4 eventually reach to zero the readers are referred to fiori 1996 and fiori and dagan 2000 for more information results above show that a spatial bivariate correlation model may provide a reasonable representation for the bivariate statistics but it still may not provide a reasonable estimation for the dispersivity and or the particle displacement variance therefore there is value in estimating the plume dispersion with high resolution indicator data mainly because the permeability correlation structure can be better represented the resolution of data seems have no effect on the behavior of the upscaled models compared to their corresponding multimodal models upscaled models can well capture the asymptotic behavior of the longitudinal dispersion however the same is not true for the transverse dispersion if upscaled models fail to provide a reasonable estimate for transverse dispersion they will probably fail in reasonably capturing dilution and mixing process 3 2 contributions of auto and cross terms here we calculate the relative contributions of the auto and cross terms to the longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity respectively this is the value of the hierarchical correlation models and the resulting lagrangian based transport models in that they include more information about physical properties of facies types including their proportions and mean lengths therefore they provide practical advantages in that geologic data are more abundant than permeability data and far more abundant than geochemical data e g sorption distribution coefficient the formulas of lagrangian based models see eqs 9 10 and 14 allow quantifying the contribution to dispersion from each scale of sedimentary architecture see ramanathan et al 2010 ritzi and soltanian 2015 soltanian et al 2015 analyzing and observing how auto and cross terms contribute to dispersion provide more fundamental understanding on how dispersion process is controlled by heterogeneity structure this is not possible with models that only consider unimodal correlation structures longitudinal results are shown in table 7 and are also plotted in fig 5 for longitudinal dispersivity we found that the auto term and cross term have similar evolution trend with higher contributions from cross terms also the cross terms reach the asymptotic dispersion at a longer time scales this is in fact due to scale dependent dispersivity as it takes longer time for the plume to sample large scale heterogeneity structures there is an interesting process is observed with the number of indictor data increasing the value of auto term is almost same compare model p and model w or g however the value of cross term increases substantially therefore with more indicator data the heterogeneity reflected by the model is also stronger as per dai et al 2019 model w can provide a better representation of spatial correlation structure in longitudinal direction this is also true for model g since the relative contribution of auto and cross term is closed to model w even with implicit more data the value of cross term in model g is larger than model w with less indicator data model p is not able to well represent the heterogeneity structure as a result it does not well represent the time evolution of dispersivity the auto term and cross term relative contribution of the transverse dispersivity α 22 t are shown in table 8 and are also plotted in fig 6 we also found that the auto term and cross term have similar evolution trend then the cross term reaches the maximum dispersion at a longer time scale this is also in fact due to scale dependent dispersivity as it takes longer time for the plume to sample large scale heterogeneity structures while different with longitudinal dispersivity the auto term of transverse dispersivity in model p less resolution have much larger contribution than cross term when more indicator data are used model w and model g higher contribution comes from cross term for model p initially the relative contribution of auto term is larger than cross term as time increases the cross term relative contribution will overcomes that auto term it is mainly because the solute is located within a facies initially and thus only the auto term contributes to its dispersion as plume grows it samples different facies types and the cross transition terms grow and contribute more to dispersion process it is known that more detailed indicator data can provide a better estimation for cross transition probability structure e g dai et al 2005 2019 ritzi et al 2004 2013 therefore a well defined cross transition probability structure used in theoretical and numerical models for transport will provide more accurate representation on plume dispersion 3 3 polynomials chaos expansion based pce based sobol indices as mentioned in sections 3 1 and 3 2 different models can provide similar representation of spatial correlation structure and the slight difference in spatial correlation parameters can make a significant difference in predicting dispersion in order to study the sources of uncertainty here we use global sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of model output i e dispersivity to input parameters reflecting heterogeneity we used the pce based sobol indices method to calculate the total and first order sobol indices number of samples for input parameters of longitudinal and transverse dispersivities model are 3000 the input parameter in our lagrangian based transport models are anisotropy ratio indictor scale integral scale in facies mean permeabilities in facies variance of permeability and volume proportions value and distribution types of these parameters for sensitivity analysis are listed in table 9 the total and first order sobol indices for α 11 and α 22 are plotted in figs 7 and 8 respectively fig 7 shows that α 11 is most sensitive to the indicator scale since both indices of indicator scale are the highest among these input parameters as per dai et al 2004 α 11 increases as the indicator scale increases model g have the highest indicator scale after model g model w and model p respectively have the highest indicator scales the result is same with the order of longitudinal dispersivity in the three models the mean permeabilities seem to be the second sensitive parameters anisotropy ratio integral scale variance of permeability and volume proportions of facies have insignificant impact on α 11 note that the sensitivity contribution of mean permeability mainly comes from the difference between the first order and the total sobol index in fact the mean permeabilities show the largest interaction values this indicates that the interactions between mean permeabilities and other variables has largest effect on α 11 compared to other parameters for α 22 the anisotropy ratio has the highest values for both total sobol index and the first order sobol index over 75 of the total sobol sensitivity index of the anisotropy ratio comes from the first order sobol sensitivity index similar to α 11 a large proportion of mean permeabilities total sobol sensitivity index comes from the cross effects and have the largest interaction value among these parameters the total and first order sobol indices of indicator scale integral scale variance of y and proportion is closed to zero this indicates that the change of these four parameters have a small impact on α 22 overall the anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity as per dai et al 2004 and soltanian et al 2015d as the anisotropy ratio decreases the α 22 increase this is due to lateral mass transfer between streamlines with different velocities that are located close to each other rubin 2003 the interactions between mean permeabilities and other variables also have largest effect on α 22 compared to other parameters for permeabilities comparing the results above for α 11 and α 22 show that mean permeabilities are the sensitive parameter for both mean permeabilities also have the largest cross effect value for both α 11 and α 22 indicating that the interaction between mean permeabilities and other parameters is relatively strong thisisdueto the contrast in the mean permeability between different facies that significantly affect dispersion the longitudinal dispersivity largelydependson the indicator integral scale the α 22 is quite sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity structure and thus anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity it is important to exactly capture the spatial correlation structure for studying plume dispersion even though the spatial bivariate correlation structure can be well represented when less resolution indicator i e lithology data are used using more indicator data can certainly improve the estimation of spatial variability which in turn improve the estimation of a plume dispersion 4 conclusions we compare the dispersivity and particle displacement variance based on different parameters from different spatial bivariate correlation models developed by dai et al 2019 for unconsolidated sediments of española basin in order to get a more fundamental understanding on how the resolution of sedimentary indicator data affect plume dispersion estimation as well as the parameter and model uncertainty in the multiscale aquifer systems pce based sobol sensitivity indices method is used to quantify the sensitivity and the uncertainty of the input geostatistical parameters total sobol indices and first order sobol indices are analyzed to describe those parameters cross impact and their individual impact on both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities the major conclusion of this study are as follows 1 small differences in the multiscale spatial correlation structure both the shape and the range of the global convariance are close result in large differences in dispersivity calculations and the particle displacement variance though the spatial correlation structure can be characterized by less indicator data it is valuable to obtain more indicator data from various data sources when it comes to estimate transport parameters such as dispersion 2 both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are underestimated if transition probability structures are not well captured in sedimentary architecture data specifically it is more pronounced when cross transition probabilities are underestimated 3 the number of indicator data does not affect the corresponding the upscaled correlation structure unimodal models with upscaled parameters can provide nearly the same longitudinal dispersivity specifically unimodal models are able to capture the asymptotic dispersivities however the upscaled models do not capture the transient growth of both longitudinal and transverse dispersivities additionally unimodal models do not allow quantifying the contribution from each scale of stratification also the contribution from auto and cross terms to dispersion remain unclear when unimodal models are used 4 longitudinal dispersivity is most sensitive to the indicator integral scale the anisotropy ratio is the most sensitive parameter for transverse dispersivity transverse dispersivity is quite sensitive to the details of heterogeneity structures thus it is important to incorporate more indicator data and develop a well characterized spatial correlation model for the estimation of transvers dispersion mean permeability of sedimentary facies are the second most sensitive parameter for both longitudinal and transvers dispersivities estimations credit authorship contribution statement zhenxue dai

5831,accurate prediction of water surface evaporation ep is important in the fields of both hydrology and irrigation engineering this study evaluated the potential ability of a new hybrid model based on the salp swarm algorithm ssa and the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea in predicting ep two other common machine learning models including the m5 model tree m5 and the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars were also applied in this study for comparison all models were developed using daily records between 2000 and 2015 from 12 meteorological stations in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china these daily records including the maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were randomly divided into two parts with 70 of which used for model calibration and the others applied for validation four different parameter input combinations were equipped to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy two data application scenarios and five statistical indicators including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae scatter index si d index and determination coefficient r2 were used for model evaluation in the scenario of using local data as inputs for model calibration and validation the impacts of wind speed and relative humidity on ep were both greater than that of solar radiation and ssa knea was consistently superior to mars or m5 across all the input combinations in the scenario of using cross station data in which models using the best input combination were developed by local data of each station but validated by data from each of the remaining 11 stations ssa knea models performed better than mars or m5 models on average in addition the ssa knea model established by data from station 51777 was the most suitable generalized model in this research area overall our findings suggested that the new hybrid algorithm i e ssa knea has high potential for ep estimation in the arid and semi arid regions of china with local or cross station data keywords machine learning cross station meta heuristic algorithm model comparison 1 introduction evaporation is a physical process that converts liquid water into vapor and enters to the atmosphere which requires the absorption of energy and is accompanied by heat exchange in the air and changes in vapor pressure sebbar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 accurate estimation of evaporation is important for hydrological processes irrigation projects and water resources planning because of the complex relationships between land water and atmospheric systems evaporation is known as one of the most difficult elements of the hydrologic cycle to assess and has attracted countless scholars to uncover the process in a scientific way adnan et al 2019 ghorbani et al 2018 salih et al 2019 yaseen et al 2020 direct measurement of evaporation using the standard pan evaporation ep is an effective tool for observing evaporation worldwide and recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo chu et al 2010 the direct measurement of ep could provide accurate and reliable continuous records if properly operated however the accuracy of this method is greatly restricted under circumstances of heavy rainfall or strong wind ghaemi et al 2019 meanwhile the ep could also be indirectly estimated from various meteorological variables such as wind speed sunshine duration relative humidity solar radiation atmospheric pressure and air temperature due to the interaction of these variables estimation of evaporation rates becomes very complicated and traditional empirical or semi empirical models are difficult to accurately depict this physical processes therefore these traditional models are usually limited for accurately estimating ep shiri et al 2014 due to the strong power in unraveling nonlinear relationships machine learning algorithms in recent years have been widely applied to solve the hydrological and environmental problems chen et al 2019a deo et al 2016 fan et al 2020 fan et al 2019 huang et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 attempts on ep estimation have also been conducted with various machine learning algorithms abghari et al 2012 behrooz et al 2019 keshtegar et al 2016 kisi et al 2016 rahimikhoob 2009 wang et al 2017 such as artificial neural network ann gene expression programming gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis extreme learning machine elm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars support vector machine svm random forests rf and gradient boosted decision tree gbdt for instance kisi and heddam 2019 assessed the applicability of m5 and mars models in estimating monthly ep using only temperature data as inputs and evaluated the impacts of different data splitting strategies on model performance they found that mars was superior to m5 and increasing the proportion of training data was helpful for improving model accuracy lu et al 2018 compared the performance of three machine learning approaches including m5 rf and gbdt and four empirical models on simulating ep in the poyang lake basin and found that all three machine learning methods were better than the empirical models while the gbdt performed better than the other two in terms of accuracy and stability feng et al 2018 developed three machine learning models to evaluate their performance on ep estimation in a national scale with data from 178 weather stations located at five different climatic zones in china used which showed that elm was slightly better than the genetic algorithm optimized ann ga ann or the particle swarm optimized ann pso ann importantly choosing appropriate parameters is a critical step for obtaining stable and reliable models beven 1989 beven et al 2008 however each machine learning algorithm has its unique parameters making it very hard to tune by manual therefore automatic parameter calibration by coupling another optimization algorithm has now attracted the interests of scholars han et al 2019 ghorbani et al 2018 indicated that multilayer perceptron and firefly algorithm mlp ffa achieved better estimation of daily ep of two stations in iran when compared with the single svm or mlp model zounemat kermani et al 2019 studied the performance of five intelligence optimization algorithms based on the anfis model and found the pso and ga algorithms performed better than firefly algorithm ffa artificial bee colony abc and continuous ant colony optimization caco similar results were also reported by moazenzadeh et al 2018 in which they integrated ffa and svm for ep estimation nonlinear arps decline nea is a method based on the arps exponential decreasing equation which uses the kernel function method to establish nonlinear combinations of input sequences this method combines the advantages of the conventional decline curve method and the intelligent method using the one step linear recursion method to deal with the non linear relationship between input sequence and output the nea method has been successfully applied in various fields such as predictions for oil production ma and liu 2018 and global solar radiation wu et al 2019a however for the single nea or the kernel based nea knea algorithm used in above studies their parameter stability still needs to be improved to our best knowledge research on the integration of nea and meta heuristic optimization algorithm is still limited to date especially for the field of hydrology the salp swarm algorithm ssa is a meta heuristic optimization algorithm based on the biological behavior of salps a comparative study conducted by mirjalili et al 2017 indicated that ssa was significantly superior to other widely used techniques in most test functions and practical problems since the moment it was first proposed ssa has been applied to solve many practical problems such as feature selection faris et al 2018 power system ekinci and hekimoglu 2018 cmos design asaithambi and rajappa 2018 and parameters identification of photovoltaic cells abbassi et al 2019 one of the main reasons for the popularity of the ssa algorithm is that it has fewer tuning parameters another reason is the flexibility of the algorithm which makes it suitable for solving problems where precise methods are neither practical nor efficient according to these advantages ssa is an algorithm of potential for optimizing the parameters of other machine learning models therefore the purpose of this paper is to 1 establish a new method coupled ssa and knea i e the ssa knea method for ep estimation 2 evaluate the applicability of ssa knea on ep estimation in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china under the scenarios of local station and cross station data applications in comparison with the m5 and mars methods 2 methods 2 1 m5 model tree m5 the m5 algorithm was originally developed by quinlan 1992 and improved by wang and witten 1996 when the m5 algorithm is used to predict the attribute value of a certain test sample it is similar to an ordinary decision tree the direction of the tree is selected at each tree node according to the attribute value of the sample until it splits to the leaf node a linear model based on partial attribute values on the leaf node generates a predictive value for the test sample bharti et al 2017 the schematic diagram of the m5 algorithm is shown in fig 1 a this algorithm first divides the input space into several subspaces and constructs a local linear regression model in them in this process linear regression models are used to minimize changes in a particular subspace the information obtained from the previous step is then used to create several nodes on which the segmentation process is completed based on the given attributes fig 1b this step starts by creating a tree structure that extends from the top of the root node to the bottom of the leaf the mathematical logic on each node will compare the specific value of the given data record with the split value which helps the data record to find the leaf node down and can obtain the split rule in the process more details regarding how the m5 algorithm is running can be found in wang and witten 1996 2 2 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars the mars algorithm is proposed by friedman 1991 which adopts the combined model of product spline basis functions bfs fig 2 the number of bfs and the relevant parameters product degree and knot position of each bf are determined automatically by the data so mars is considered as an adaptive algorithm the automatic determining process is driven by recursive partitioning such as classification and regression trees cart and shares its information to capture higher order interactions 2 3 kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea the nonlinear arps decline nea ma and liu 2018 can be described as 1 f x a f x 1 g u x μ where f x is the output at the current step while f x 1 is the output from the last step u x represents the factors effecting the output and g u x can be interpreted as the relationship between u x and f x μ is the bias from this equation it is clear that the output of the current step is the result of the joint action between the output from the last step and the influencing factors at this step the flow chart of the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea algorithm is shown below fig 3 since it is impossible to directly determine the function g u x it can be translated to 2 g u x ω t φ u x this is equivalent to mapping the original input factors to the new space therefore the eq 1 can be written as 3 f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ we still cannot solve the eq 3 but we can find a very small value e x that makes the difference between the left and the right side of the equation as small as possible 4 e x f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ 5 min a ω e ς a ω e 1 2 a 2 1 2 ω 2 γ 2 x 2 n e x 2 6 s t f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ e x where γ is the regularization term that controls the smoothness of the model like svm and elm this optimization problem can be solved by the lagrangian multiplier method 7 l a ω μ e λ ς a ω e x 2 n λ x bf x 1 ω t φ u x μ e x f x where λ x is the lagrangian multiplier the kkt conditions for optimality of the lagrangian multiplier method are listed as follows 8 l a 0 a x 2 n λ x f x 1 l ω 0 ω x 2 n λ x φ u x l μ 0 x 2 n λ x 0 l e x 0 e x λ x γ

an n 1 dimensional identity matrix with all the diagonal elements to be 1 and others to be 0 λ μ and α can be obtained by eq 8 the ωij can be employed by a kernel function k which satisfies the mercer s theorem a gauss type kernel function was selected in this study 14 k u i u j exp u i u j 2 2 σ 2 2 4 ssa and ssa knea the salp swarm algorithm ssa is a meta heuristic global optimization algorithm inspired by the salp population movement and foraging behavior fig 4 salps are a transparent fish like free floating capsid belonging to the salpidae family in the ocean salps usually float together in chains which allows for better movement and foraging the movement behavior of the salp chain can be simplified into a mathematical model salps are naturally divided into two groups leaders and followers the leader leads the group in movement and the individual follows one after another food as a target is defined in a space f and the group of individuals is the matrix u u1 u2 un where n is the population size leaders update their positions using the following equations 15 u i j 1 f j i c 1 u b j i l b j i c 2 l b j i c 3 0 5 f j i c 1 u b j i l b j i c 2 l b j i c 3 0 5 where u i j 1 is the position of the leader in the i th iteration and the j th dimension and f j i is the position of the food source in the i th iteration and the j th dimension u b j i and l b j i are the upper and lower bounds of the i th iteration and the j th dimension while c 1 is a coefficient can be calculated as 16 c 1 2 e 4 l l 2 where l is the current iteration and l is the maximum number of iterations variable c 1 is gradually decreased over the iteration process which makes the algorithm first explores the search space and then exploits it c 2 and c 3 are random numbers uniformly generated in the interval 0 1 for other salps their positions are updated as follows 17 u i j k 0 5 u i j k u i j k 1 where k 2 u i j k is the position of the k th following salp in the i th iteration and the j th dimension as shown in the code the ssa algorithm has few algorithm specific parameters and is easy to understand and implement in this study the ssa algorithm was used to optimize the regularization coefficient γ of the knea algorithm and the parameter of the gaussian kernel function σ 2 5 date collection and application daily weather data from 12 stations operated by the china meteorological administration cma were used in the study these stations are located in northwest china belonging to the arid and semi arid climate zones the locations of the weather stations are illustrated in fig 5 the data sample covers 16 years 2000 2015 of daily records of maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin solar radiation rs relative humidity rh wind speed u and pan evaporation ep when rs was missing sunshine duration s was converted into rs following procedures in the reference fan et al 2018 it should be noted that the ep value is not measured below 0 c so we selected data from may to september table 1 we set up four parameter combinations in which combination 1 was a complete combination in order to evaluate the performance of the model combinations 2 4 were based on the temperature data and sets up the missing combination of two meteorological elements to evaluate the contribution of different meteorological elements to ep therefore four input combinations of the meteorological factors were used in this study including 1 c1 tmax tmin rs rh u 2 c2 tmax tmin rs 3 c3 tmax tmin rh and 4 c4 tmax tmin u data from each station were split into two parts with one part 70 for modeling calibration and the other part 30 for validation two data application scenarios were implemented in this study which were the local data application and the cross station data application respectively in the scenario of local application models for each algorithm were calibrated and validated both with the local data of each station in the cross station application scenario leave one out method was used gronau and wagenmakers 2019 vehtari et al 2017 the optimal model which was fed by the best input combination in each station was calibrated with the calibration part of the local data but validated in sequence by the validation part of the data from each of the other 11 stations therefore each single station based model for each algorithm was then used 11 times amounting to a total of 420 times 12 stations 2 3 algorithms 12 stations for all models 2 6 model performance evaluation five statistical indicators were used for the performance evaluation of m5 mars and ssa knea models in this study which were 1 determination coefficient r2 18 r 2 i 1 n o i m o i m o i e o i e 2 i 1 n o i m o i m 2 i 1 n o i e o i e 2 2 root mean square error rmse 19 rmse 1 n i 1

of data o e and o m are the estimated ep values by machine learning methods and the ep values respectively o m is the mean ep value the value of d index is between 0 and 1 and the value closer to 1 indicates better regression fitting between the estimated ep and the measured ep and hence the better model performance on contrary if the value of rmse or mae is closer to 0 the model performs better rmse is generally useful when model errors follow a normal distribution whereas mae suits better for models with a uniform error distribution chen et al 2019b fan et al 2019 for evaluating the model performance with the value of si four levels of indication are used which are si less than 10 20 s i 10 30 s i 20 and si 40 corresponding to perfect good fair and poor model performance respectively 3 results 3 1 local application for the three algorithms i e m5 mars and ssa knea used this study their averaged statistical results of models at the 12 stations under 4 different input combinations in the scenario of local data application are listed in table 2 and fig 6 under the c1 input combination ep estimation by m5 in the calibration stage were evaluated at rmse 0 910 mm d 1 mae 0 671 mm d 1 si 0 157 and d index 0 941 showing more accuracy than that of ssa knea or mars while in the validation stage the ssa knea model rmse 0 997 mm d 1 mae 0 755 mm d 1 si 0 169 and d index 0 921 outperformed the other models which means that ssa knea was more stable than m5 and mars in addition the m5 model had a slight over fitting problem for the c2 input combination m5 yielded the lowest rmse mae and si during the calibration stage but highest corresponding values during the validation stage among the three algorithms the statistical results of mars and ssa knea models were very similar to each other during the calibration and the validation stages indicating that these two algorithms were both more stable than m5 however the ssa knea model rmse 1 319 mm d 1 mae 1 000 mm d 1 si 0 222 and d index 0 834 performed better than the mars model rmse 1 373 mm d 1 mae 1 043 mm d 1 si 0 232 and d index 0 815 for the other two input combinations i e c3 and c4 the patterns of their model statistical results were consistent with the c1 and c2 input combinations where ssa knea performed better than m5 and mars and the m5 model was the least stable among them table 2 by comparing the statistical results of the four input combinations it is clear that on the basis of temperature adding another meteorological factor i e radiation humidity or wind speed would affect model accuracy and the size of effect was meteorological factor specific table 2 the improvement effect of adding relative humidity was the best among the three meteorological factors slightly better than the effect of adding wind speed the effect of adding radiation showed the least improvement as indicated by the approximate 10 decreases in statistical results of the c2 input combination compared with the c3 and c4 furthermore the improvement effect of adding multiple meteorological factors simultaneously was much better than the effect of adding one factor only correlations between the estimated ep values by the m5 mars and ssa knea models and their corresponding measured ep values in the validation stage were shown as scatter plots fig 7 taking the 51431 station as an example it can be seen that for the same algorithm the c1 combination is more concentrated to the 1 1 line than other input combinations while under the same input combination the r2 of correlation between estimated and measured ep values of ssa knea was higher than those of mars and m5 suggesting that ssa knea performed better than the other two algorithms for instance the r2 of correlation for the ssa knea model under the c1 combination was 0 822 higher than the corresponding mars model r2 0 774 or m5 model r2 0 741 the patterns found in the scatter plots were consistent with the trends shown in the statistical results of models 3 2 cross station application when studying evaporation in areas where historical records are lacking or missing modeling via data from neighbor weather stations i e cross station application is a common practice therefore it is necessary to evaluate whether the performance of machine learning models with cross station data is as stable as the model performance with local data application in this study all selected meteorological stations were located in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china with an average annual precipitation less than 200 mm using data from these stations to cross validate the performance of the three machine learning models in this study may be helpful to better evaluate the applicability of the models since the accuracy of model is generally higher when using the complete combination of meteorological factors as input than using other incomplete combinations the c1 input combination was selected to evaluate the effect of cross station application in this study two different strategies for cross station application were used in the first strategy i e strategy 1 the m5 mars and ssa knea models under the c1 combination were calibrated with data from station 51431 but were validated in sequence with data from each of the other 11 meteorological stations the statistical results including rmse mae si and d index of models during the validation stage are listed in table 3 according to the average statistical values of the 11 stations the m5 and mars models had little difference between each other in terms of accuracy but both were lower than that of the ssa knea model however the best modeling station for each of the three models was different specifically the best model performance for the m5 model was observed in station 51567 rmse 0 869 mm d 1 mae 0 672 mm d 1 si 0 201 and d index 0 891 suggesting that this station would be the most ideal alternative for station 51431 while for the other two types of models the best model performance was found in other stations which were station 51628 rmse 0 977 mm d 1 mae 0 754 mm d 1 si 0 226 and d index 0 861 for the mars model and station 51573 rmse 0 811 mm d 1 mae 0 639 mm d 1 si 0 188 and d index 0 904 for the ssa knea model respectively therefore although the overall performance of ssa knea was better the optimal replacement model tended to be station specific suggesting that would be necessary to explore a more appropriate generalized model optimal for the whole study region to find a station that could represent the whole study region and a model that could have relatively high accuracy for all stations within the region a second strategy for cross station data application was used in this study in this strategy i e strategy 2 for each of the three algorithms i e m5 mars and ssa knea its model with the c1 input combination was calibrated with data from each of the 12 stations which resulted in 12 models in total each of the 12 models for each algorithm was then validated in sequence with data from each of the 12 stations including 1 local validation and 11 cross station validations therefore under this strategy of the cross station application a total of 132 models were constructed for each algorithm the rmse of m5 mars and ssa knea models during the validation stage were selected for model performance evaluation tables 4 6 the average rmse values of all 132 models except 12 local models were 1 369 1 419 and 1 269 mm d 1 for m5 mars and ssa knea respectively indicating that ssa knea was overall better than the other two algorithms in this type of cross station application however in terms of the most suitable generalized individual model for this study region the result was different from the overall trend among the 12 stations the model developed by data from station 51777 was generally better than other stations for all of the three algorithms and hence results from station 51777 were used for further discussion for the m5 model in station 51777 was very close to the station of 52681 the average rmse of the 11 cross station validations was 1 248 mm d 1 13 4 higher than that of the local validation however this station seems not suitable for validation of other models when using other station data to developing model and the station 51777 data as validation the rmse is greater than 1 5 mm d 1 such deviation in the rmse of models would bring great uncertain risks to water resource planning for the mars model in station 51777 the average rmse from the cross station application valued at 1 264 mm d 1 was 13 6 higher than the value from the local application when using the ssa knea approach high model precision was also achieved with data from station 51777 rmse 1 183 mm d 1 was 14 3 higher than the value from the local application therefore the ssa knea model based on data from station 51777 was recommended as the most suitable generalized model in this study region from the perspective of model stability 4 discussion 4 1 parameters tuned of the extreme learning machine elm model studies have shown that the parameters of the model based on the kernel method usually have no physical meaning and no rules to follow mai and ngo 2018 wu et al 2019b theoretically nea model based on kernel method also has such characteristics therefore the use of intelligent optimization algorithm is an important means of parameter optimization liu et al 2009 however some studies have found that the accuracy of machine learning model cannot always be improved by using optimization algorithm goyal et al 2014 piri et al 2016 shamshirband et al 2016 this is because they typically use optimized coupling models to compare with the original model which relies on the user s experience with manual parameters in this study we compared the optimized knea model ssa knea because the parameter combination of mars and m5 model is very limited and they usually do not need to use the optimization algorithm for tuning the results of this study show that the performance of knea model ssa knea is better than that of traditional model 4 2 cross station of validation of the machine learning models the most common way to evaluate the performance of evaporation prediction model is to select two stations for cross validation kim et al 2014 kisi 2015 lu et al 2018 studied the relationship between rmse of cross station and the distance in poyang lake basin it was found that the most suitable station distance was within 100 km between the two stations the biggest limitation of this method is that the research area cannot be too large in this study the distance in the east west direction is far greater than that in the north south direction so it is not suitable to use the distance to evaluate whether it is suitable to change stations we try to find a universal site in the region the climate characteristics of this site are similar to those of other sites to a certain extent which ensures that the overall performance of the station changing mode will not change dramatically we had found such a station which has good regional applicability after modeling with mars model however the results of this study may be not suitable to the areas where climate change is dramatic or where terrain is more complex therefore the next step of the study is to further verify this method in other regions 5 conclusions in this study the potential ability of a new hybrid model i e ssa knea based on the salp swarm algorithm ssa and the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea in predicting ep was evaluated in comparison with the m5 and mars models these models were fed by daily data from 2000 to 2015 at 12 meteorological stations in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china four different parameter input combinations five statistical indicators rmse mae si d index and r2 and two data application scenarios were used for model evaluation in the first scenario local data were used for model calibration and validation results showed that ssa knea was superior to mars and m5 models at all input combinations the influence of wind speed and relative humidity on ep were both greater than that of solar radiation in the second scenario i e cross station application models with the best input combination were developed by local data of each station but validated by data from each of the remaining 11 stations results indicated that ssa knea models performed better than mars or m5 models on average in addition the ssa knea model established by data from station 51777 was the most suitable generalized model in this research area overall our findings suggest that the new hybrid algorithm i e ssa knea has high potential for ep

5831,accurate prediction of water surface evaporation ep is important in the fields of both hydrology and irrigation engineering this study evaluated the potential ability of a new hybrid model based on the salp swarm algorithm ssa and the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea in predicting ep two other common machine learning models including the m5 model tree m5 and the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars were also applied in this study for comparison all models were developed using daily records between 2000 and 2015 from 12 meteorological stations in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china these daily records including the maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were randomly divided into two parts with 70 of which used for model calibration and the others applied for validation four different parameter input combinations were equipped to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy two data application scenarios and five statistical indicators including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae scatter index si d index and determination coefficient r2 were used for model evaluation in the scenario of using local data as inputs for model calibration and validation the impacts of wind speed and relative humidity on ep were both greater than that of solar radiation and ssa knea was consistently superior to mars or m5 across all the input combinations in the scenario of using cross station data in which models using the best input combination were developed by local data of each station but validated by data from each of the remaining 11 stations ssa knea models performed better than mars or m5 models on average in addition the ssa knea model established by data from station 51777 was the most suitable generalized model in this research area overall our findings suggested that the new hybrid algorithm i e ssa knea has high potential for ep estimation in the arid and semi arid regions of china with local or cross station data keywords machine learning cross station meta heuristic algorithm model comparison 1 introduction evaporation is a physical process that converts liquid water into vapor and enters to the atmosphere which requires the absorption of energy and is accompanied by heat exchange in the air and changes in vapor pressure sebbar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 accurate estimation of evaporation is important for hydrological processes irrigation projects and water resources planning because of the complex relationships between land water and atmospheric systems evaporation is known as one of the most difficult elements of the hydrologic cycle to assess and has attracted countless scholars to uncover the process in a scientific way adnan et al 2019 ghorbani et al 2018 salih et al 2019 yaseen et al 2020 direct measurement of evaporation using the standard pan evaporation ep is an effective tool for observing evaporation worldwide and recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo chu et al 2010 the direct measurement of ep could provide accurate and reliable continuous records if properly operated however the accuracy of this method is greatly restricted under circumstances of heavy rainfall or strong wind ghaemi et al 2019 meanwhile the ep could also be indirectly estimated from various meteorological variables such as wind speed sunshine duration relative humidity solar radiation atmospheric pressure and air temperature due to the interaction of these variables estimation of evaporation rates becomes very complicated and traditional empirical or semi empirical models are difficult to accurately depict this physical processes therefore these traditional models are usually limited for accurately estimating ep shiri et al 2014 due to the strong power in unraveling nonlinear relationships machine learning algorithms in recent years have been widely applied to solve the hydrological and environmental problems chen et al 2019a deo et al 2016 fan et al 2020 fan et al 2019 huang et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 attempts on ep estimation have also been conducted with various machine learning algorithms abghari et al 2012 behrooz et al 2019 keshtegar et al 2016 kisi et al 2016 rahimikhoob 2009 wang et al 2017 such as artificial neural network ann gene expression programming gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis extreme learning machine elm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars support vector machine svm random forests rf and gradient boosted decision tree gbdt for instance kisi and heddam 2019 assessed the applicability of m5 and mars models in estimating monthly ep using only temperature data as inputs and evaluated the impacts of different data splitting strategies on model performance they found that mars was superior to m5 and increasing the proportion of training data was helpful for improving model accuracy lu et al 2018 compared the performance of three machine learning approaches including m5 rf and gbdt and four empirical models on simulating ep in the poyang lake basin and found that all three machine learning methods were better than the empirical models while the gbdt performed better than the other two in terms of accuracy and stability feng et al 2018 developed three machine learning models to evaluate their performance on ep estimation in a national scale with data from 178 weather stations located at five different climatic zones in china used which showed that elm was slightly better than the genetic algorithm optimized ann ga ann or the particle swarm optimized ann pso ann importantly choosing appropriate parameters is a critical step for obtaining stable and reliable models beven 1989 beven et al 2008 however each machine learning algorithm has its unique parameters making it very hard to tune by manual therefore automatic parameter calibration by coupling another optimization algorithm has now attracted the interests of scholars han et al 2019 ghorbani et al 2018 indicated that multilayer perceptron and firefly algorithm mlp ffa achieved better estimation of daily ep of two stations in iran when compared with the single svm or mlp model zounemat kermani et al 2019 studied the performance of five intelligence optimization algorithms based on the anfis model and found the pso and ga algorithms performed better than firefly algorithm ffa artificial bee colony abc and continuous ant colony optimization caco similar results were also reported by moazenzadeh et al 2018 in which they integrated ffa and svm for ep estimation nonlinear arps decline nea is a method based on the arps exponential decreasing equation which uses the kernel function method to establish nonlinear combinations of input sequences this method combines the advantages of the conventional decline curve method and the intelligent method using the one step linear recursion method to deal with the non linear relationship between input sequence and output the nea method has been successfully applied in various fields such as predictions for oil production ma and liu 2018 and global solar radiation wu et al 2019a however for the single nea or the kernel based nea knea algorithm used in above studies their parameter stability still needs to be improved to our best knowledge research on the integration of nea and meta heuristic optimization algorithm is still limited to date especially for the field of hydrology the salp swarm algorithm ssa is a meta heuristic optimization algorithm based on the biological behavior of salps a comparative study conducted by mirjalili et al 2017 indicated that ssa was significantly superior to other widely used techniques in most test functions and practical problems since the moment it was first proposed ssa has been applied to solve many practical problems such as feature selection faris et al 2018 power system ekinci and hekimoglu 2018 cmos design asaithambi and rajappa 2018 and parameters identification of photovoltaic cells abbassi et al 2019 one of the main reasons for the popularity of the ssa algorithm is that it has fewer tuning parameters another reason is the flexibility of the algorithm which makes it suitable for solving problems where precise methods are neither practical nor efficient according to these advantages ssa is an algorithm of potential for optimizing the parameters of other machine learning models therefore the purpose of this paper is to 1 establish a new method coupled ssa and knea i e the ssa knea method for ep estimation 2 evaluate the applicability of ssa knea on ep estimation in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china under the scenarios of local station and cross station data applications in comparison with the m5 and mars methods 2 methods 2 1 m5 model tree m5 the m5 algorithm was originally developed by quinlan 1992 and improved by wang and witten 1996 when the m5 algorithm is used to predict the attribute value of a certain test sample it is similar to an ordinary decision tree the direction of the tree is selected at each tree node according to the attribute value of the sample until it splits to the leaf node a linear model based on partial attribute values on the leaf node generates a predictive value for the test sample bharti et al 2017 the schematic diagram of the m5 algorithm is shown in fig 1 a this algorithm first divides the input space into several subspaces and constructs a local linear regression model in them in this process linear regression models are used to minimize changes in a particular subspace the information obtained from the previous step is then used to create several nodes on which the segmentation process is completed based on the given attributes fig 1b this step starts by creating a tree structure that extends from the top of the root node to the bottom of the leaf the mathematical logic on each node will compare the specific value of the given data record with the split value which helps the data record to find the leaf node down and can obtain the split rule in the process more details regarding how the m5 algorithm is running can be found in wang and witten 1996 2 2 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars the mars algorithm is proposed by friedman 1991 which adopts the combined model of product spline basis functions bfs fig 2 the number of bfs and the relevant parameters product degree and knot position of each bf are determined automatically by the data so mars is considered as an adaptive algorithm the automatic determining process is driven by recursive partitioning such as classification and regression trees cart and shares its information to capture higher order interactions 2 3 kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea the nonlinear arps decline nea ma and liu 2018 can be described as 1 f x a f x 1 g u x μ where f x is the output at the current step while f x 1 is the output from the last step u x represents the factors effecting the output and g u x can be interpreted as the relationship between u x and f x μ is the bias from this equation it is clear that the output of the current step is the result of the joint action between the output from the last step and the influencing factors at this step the flow chart of the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea algorithm is shown below fig 3 since it is impossible to directly determine the function g u x it can be translated to 2 g u x ω t φ u x this is equivalent to mapping the original input factors to the new space therefore the eq 1 can be written as 3 f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ we still cannot solve the eq 3 but we can find a very small value e x that makes the difference between the left and the right side of the equation as small as possible 4 e x f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ 5 min a ω e ς a ω e 1 2 a 2 1 2 ω 2 γ 2 x 2 n e x 2 6 s t f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ e x where γ is the regularization term that controls the smoothness of the model like svm and elm this optimization problem can be solved by the lagrangian multiplier method 7 l a ω μ e λ ς a ω e x 2 n λ x bf x 1 ω t φ u x μ e x f x where λ x is the lagrangian multiplier the kkt conditions for optimality of the lagrangian multiplier method are listed as follows 8 l a 0 a x 2 n λ x f x 1 l ω 0 ω x 2 n λ x φ u x l μ 0 x 2 n λ x 0 l e x 0 e x λ x γ

an n 1 dimensional identity matrix with all the diagonal elements to be 1 and others to be 0 λ μ and α can be obtained by eq 8 the ωij can be employed by a kernel function k which satisfies the mercer s theorem a gauss type kernel function was selected in this study 14 k u i u j exp u i u j 2 2 σ 2 2 4 ssa and ssa knea the salp swarm algorithm ssa is a meta heuristic global optimization algorithm inspired by the salp population movement and foraging behavior fig 4 salps are a transparent fish like free floating capsid belonging to the salpidae family in the ocean salps usually float together in chains which allows for better movement and foraging the movement behavior of the salp chain can be simplified into a mathematical model salps are naturally divided into two groups leaders and followers the leader leads the group in movement and the individual follows one after another food as a target is defined in a space f and the group of individuals is the matrix u u1 u2 un where n is the population size leaders update their positions using the following equations 15 u i j 1 f j i c 1 u b j i l b j i c 2 l b j i c 3 0 5 f j i c 1 u b j i l b j i c 2 l b j i c 3 0 5 where u i j 1 is the position of the leader in the i th iteration and the j th dimension and f j i is the position of the food source in the i th iteration and the j th dimension u b j i and l b j i are the upper and lower bounds of the i th iteration and the j th dimension while c 1 is a coefficient can be calculated as 16 c 1 2 e 4 l l 2 where l is the current iteration and l is the maximum number of iterations variable c 1 is gradually decreased over the iteration process which makes the algorithm first explores the search space and then exploits it c 2 and c 3 are random numbers uniformly generated in the interval 0 1 for other salps their positions are updated as follows 17 u i j k 0 5 u i j k u i j k 1 where k 2 u i j k is the position of the k th following salp in the i th iteration and the j th dimension as shown in the code the ssa algorithm has few algorithm specific parameters and is easy to understand and implement in this study the ssa algorithm was used to optimize the regularization coefficient γ of the knea algorithm and the parameter of the gaussian kernel function σ 2 5 date collection and application daily weather data from 12 stations operated by the china meteorological administration cma were used in the study these stations are located in northwest china belonging to the arid and semi arid climate zones the locations of the weather stations are illustrated in fig 5 the data sample covers 16 years 2000 2015 of daily records of maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin solar radiation rs relative humidity rh wind speed u and pan evaporation ep when rs was missing sunshine duration s was converted into rs following procedures in the reference fan et al 2018 it should be noted that the ep value is not measured below 0 c so we selected data from may to september table 1 we set up four parameter combinations in which combination 1 was a complete combination in order to evaluate the performance of the model combinations 2 4 were based on the temperature data and sets up the missing combination of two meteorological elements to evaluate the contribution of different meteorological elements to ep therefore four input combinations of the meteorological factors were used in this study including 1 c1 tmax tmin rs rh u 2 c2 tmax tmin rs 3 c3 tmax tmin rh and 4 c4 tmax tmin u data from each station were split into two parts with one part 70 for modeling calibration and the other part 30 for validation two data application scenarios were implemented in this study which were the local data application and the cross station data application respectively in the scenario of local application models for each algorithm were calibrated and validated both with the local data of each station in the cross station application scenario leave one out method was used gronau and wagenmakers 2019 vehtari et al 2017 the optimal model which was fed by the best input combination in each station was calibrated with the calibration part of the local data but validated in sequence by the validation part of the data from each of the other 11 stations therefore each single station based model for each algorithm was then used 11 times amounting to a total of 420 times 12 stations 2 3 algorithms 12 stations for all models 2 6 model performance evaluation five statistical indicators were used for the performance evaluation of m5 mars and ssa knea models in this study which were 1 determination coefficient r2 18 r 2 i 1 n o i m o i m o i e o i e 2 i 1 n o i m o i m 2 i 1 n o i e o i e 2 2 root mean square error rmse 19 rmse 1 n i 1

of data o e and o m are the estimated ep values by machine learning methods and the ep values respectively o m is the mean ep value the value of d index is between 0 and 1 and the value closer to 1 indicates better regression fitting between the estimated ep and the measured ep and hence the better model performance on contrary if the value of rmse or mae is closer to 0 the model performs better rmse is generally useful when model errors follow a normal distribution whereas mae suits better for models with a uniform error distribution chen et al 2019b fan et al 2019 for evaluating the model performance with the value of si four levels of indication are used which are si less than 10 20 s i 10 30 s i 20 and si 40 corresponding to perfect good fair and poor model performance respectively 3 results 3 1 local application for the three algorithms i e m5 mars and ssa knea used this study their averaged statistical results of models at the 12 stations under 4 different input combinations in the scenario of local data application are listed in table 2 and fig 6 under the c1 input combination ep estimation by m5 in the calibration stage were evaluated at rmse 0 910 mm d 1 mae 0 671 mm d 1 si 0 157 and d index 0 941 showing more accuracy than that of ssa knea or mars while in the validation stage the ssa knea model rmse 0 997 mm d 1 mae 0 755 mm d 1 si 0 169 and d index 0 921 outperformed the other models which means that ssa knea was more stable than m5 and mars in addition the m5 model had a slight over fitting problem for the c2 input combination m5 yielded the lowest rmse mae and si during the calibration stage but highest corresponding values during the validation stage among the three algorithms the statistical results of mars and ssa knea models were very similar to each other during the calibration and the validation stages indicating that these two algorithms were both more stable than m5 however the ssa knea model rmse 1 319 mm d 1 mae 1 000 mm d 1 si 0 222 and d index 0 834 performed better than the mars model rmse 1 373 mm d 1 mae 1 043 mm d 1 si 0 232 and d index 0 815 for the other two input combinations i e c3 and c4 the patterns of their model statistical results were consistent with the c1 and c2 input combinations where ssa knea performed better than m5 and mars and the m5 model was the least stable among them table 2 by comparing the statistical results of the four input combinations it is clear that on the basis of temperature adding another meteorological factor i e radiation humidity or wind speed would affect model accuracy and the size of effect was meteorological factor specific table 2 the improvement effect of adding relative humidity was the best among the three meteorological factors slightly better than the effect of adding wind speed the effect of adding radiation showed the least improvement as indicated by the approximate 10 decreases in statistical results of the c2 input combination compared with the c3 and c4 furthermore the improvement effect of adding multiple meteorological factors simultaneously was much better than the effect of adding one factor only correlations between the estimated ep values by the m5 mars and ssa knea models and their corresponding measured ep values in the validation stage were shown as scatter plots fig 7 taking the 51431 station as an example it can be seen that for the same algorithm the c1 combination is more concentrated to the 1 1 line than other input combinations while under the same input combination the r2 of correlation between estimated and measured ep values of ssa knea was higher than those of mars and m5 suggesting that ssa knea performed better than the other two algorithms for instance the r2 of correlation for the ssa knea model under the c1 combination was 0 822 higher than the corresponding mars model r2 0 774 or m5 model r2 0 741 the patterns found in the scatter plots were consistent with the trends shown in the statistical results of models 3 2 cross station application when studying evaporation in areas where historical records are lacking or missing modeling via data from neighbor weather stations i e cross station application is a common practice therefore it is necessary to evaluate whether the performance of machine learning models with cross station data is as stable as the model performance with local data application in this study all selected meteorological stations were located in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china with an average annual precipitation less than 200 mm using data from these stations to cross validate the performance of the three machine learning models in this study may be helpful to better evaluate the applicability of the models since the accuracy of model is generally higher when using the complete combination of meteorological factors as input than using other incomplete combinations the c1 input combination was selected to evaluate the effect of cross station application in this study two different strategies for cross station application were used in the first strategy i e strategy 1 the m5 mars and ssa knea models under the c1 combination were calibrated with data from station 51431 but were validated in sequence with data from each of the other 11 meteorological stations the statistical results including rmse mae si and d index of models during the validation stage are listed in table 3 according to the average statistical values of the 11 stations the m5 and mars models had little difference between each other in terms of accuracy but both were lower than that of the ssa knea model however the best modeling station for each of the three models was different specifically the best model performance for the m5 model was observed in station 51567 rmse 0 869 mm d 1 mae 0 672 mm d 1 si 0 201 and d index 0 891 suggesting that this station would be the most ideal alternative for station 51431 while for the other two types of models the best model performance was found in other stations which were station 51628 rmse 0 977 mm d 1 mae 0 754 mm d 1 si 0 226 and d index 0 861 for the mars model and station 51573 rmse 0 811 mm d 1 mae 0 639 mm d 1 si 0 188 and d index 0 904 for the ssa knea model respectively therefore although the overall performance of ssa knea was better the optimal replacement model tended to be station specific suggesting that would be necessary to explore a more appropriate generalized model optimal for the whole study region to find a station that could represent the whole study region and a model that could have relatively high accuracy for all stations within the region a second strategy for cross station data application was used in this study in this strategy i e strategy 2 for each of the three algorithms i e m5 mars and ssa knea its model with the c1 input combination was calibrated with data from each of the 12 stations which resulted in 12 models in total each of the 12 models for each algorithm was then validated in sequence with data from each of the 12 stations including 1 local validation and 11 cross station validations therefore under this strategy of the cross station application a total of 132 models were constructed for each algorithm the rmse of m5 mars and ssa knea models during the validation stage were selected for model performance evaluation tables 4 6 the average rmse values of all 132 models except 12 local models were 1 369 1 419 and 1 269 mm d 1 for m5 mars and ssa knea respectively indicating that ssa knea was overall better than the other two algorithms in this type of cross station application however in terms of the most suitable generalized individual model for this study region the result was different from the overall trend among the 12 stations the model developed by data from station 51777 was generally better than other stations for all of the three algorithms and hence results from station 51777 were used for further discussion for the m5 model in station 51777 was very close to the station of 52681 the average rmse of the 11 cross station validations was 1 248 mm d 1 13 4 higher than that of the local validation however this station seems not suitable for validation of other models when using other station data to developing model and the station 51777 data as validation the rmse is greater than 1 5 mm d 1 such deviation in the rmse of models would bring great uncertain risks to water resource planning for the mars model in station 51777 the average rmse from the cross station application valued at 1 264 mm d 1 was 13 6 higher than the value from the local application when using the ssa knea approach high model precision was also achieved with data from station 51777 rmse 1 183 mm d 1 was 14 3 higher than the value from the local application therefore the ssa knea model based on data from station 51777 was recommended as the most suitable generalized model in this study region from the perspective of model stability 4 discussion 4 1 parameters tuned of the extreme learning machine elm model studies have shown that the parameters of the model based on the kernel method usually have no physical meaning and no rules to follow mai and ngo 2018 wu et al 2019b theoretically nea model based on kernel method also has such characteristics therefore the use of intelligent optimization algorithm is an important means of parameter optimization liu et al 2009 however some studies have found that the accuracy of machine learning model cannot always be improved by using optimization algorithm goyal et al 2014 piri et al 2016 shamshirband et al 2016 this is because they typically use optimized coupling models to compare with the original model which relies on the user s experience with manual parameters in this study we compared the optimized knea model ssa knea because the parameter combination of mars and m5 model is very limited and they usually do not need to use the optimization algorithm for tuning the results of this study show that the performance of knea model ssa knea is better than that of traditional model 4 2 cross station of validation of the machine learning models the most common way to evaluate the performance of evaporation prediction model is to select two stations for cross validation kim et al 2014 kisi 2015 lu et al 2018 studied the relationship between rmse of cross station and the distance in poyang lake basin it was found that the most suitable station distance was within 100 km between the two stations the biggest limitation of this method is that the research area cannot be too large in this study the distance in the east west direction is far greater than that in the north south direction so it is not suitable to use the distance to evaluate whether it is suitable to change stations we try to find a universal site in the region the climate characteristics of this site are similar to those of other sites to a certain extent which ensures that the overall performance of the station changing mode will not change dramatically we had found such a station which has good regional applicability after modeling with mars model however the results of this study may be not suitable to the areas where climate change is dramatic or where terrain is more complex therefore the next step of the study is to further verify this method in other regions 5 conclusions in this study the potential ability of a new hybrid model i e ssa knea based on the salp swarm algorithm ssa and the kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea in predicting ep was evaluated in comparison with the m5 and mars models these models were fed by daily data from 2000 to 2015 at 12 meteorological stations in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china four different parameter input combinations five statistical indicators rmse mae si d index and r2 and two data application scenarios were used for model evaluation in the first scenario local data were used for model calibration and validation results showed that ssa knea was superior to mars and m5 models at all input combinations the influence of wind speed and relative humidity on ep were both greater than that of solar radiation in the second scenario i e cross station application models with the best input combination were developed by local data of each

5832,we have conducted taiwan s first groundwater temperature earthquake precursory and coseismic signal study using totally 8 month time series of groundwater temperature from two monitoring wells in eastern taiwan we applied hilbert huang transform hht analysis to identify possible precursory signals with periods ranging from one to ten minutes and duration of tens of hours that occurred one to three days before mw 4 7 earthquakes these signals are not correlated with atmospheric and pumping processes the precursors are sensitive to an earthquake within an epicentral distance that is about 20 to 25 time of the earthquake rupture length with this limited dataset we found the rates of false positives and false negatives are 16 7 and 28 6 respectively exact physical processes that generate such signals are unclear and additional data are needed but we propose that real time groundwater temperature monitoring has potentials to become a low cost but beneficial way to complement other earthquake precursory projects for more robust short term earthquake forecasting keywords groundwater temperature co seismic signals earthquake precursory 1 introduction numerous studies show a possible relationship between groundwater perturbation and earthquakes ground motions can change aquifer behavior muir wood and king 1993 chia et al 2003 matsumoto et al 2003 at the same time groundwater level changes have been documented to occur before neighboring earthquakes roeloffs 1988 king et al 2000 cox et al 2012 yeh et al 2015 these observations provide strong motivation to see if real time monitoring of groundwater can help identify earthquake precursors the mechanisms which would link precursory ground water perturbation to the occurrence of earthquake are still not clear though several processes have been proposed to explain these mechanisms including changes in crustal stress or in physical properties of the rocks near the earthquake brodsky et al 2003 wang and manga 2010 manga and wang 2015 most groundwater precursory signals are seen in groundwater level changes but precursory temperature changes in groundwater are not as well documented wakita et al 1988 found that not only a drop in groundwater level but also temperature at 30 km from the epicenter was reported a month and a half before the main shock of the 1978 m7 0 izu oshima kinkai earthquakes orihara et al 2014 also discovered underground water pre seismic changes of both level and temperature related to the 2011 tohoku earthquake therefore not only water level but also temperature seem to have potential for earthquake forecasting wang et al 2013 wang and manga 2014 recently geophysical and hydrological instruments have improved dramatically allowing high quality field measurements to be conducted new datasets might provide some new and beneficial insights for research taiwan is located along the ring of fire with an average of one hundred ml 2 earthquakes per day usually 12 mw5 earthquakes occur every year this provides an opportunity to test whether we can use groundwater temperature perturbations as a precursory signal for taiwan here we report the first field experiment to collect groundwater temperature time series in several boreholes in taiwan over two periods one 5 months and another one 3 months for earthquake precursor studies we then document what signal processing methods in addition to the temporal and distance ranges we have used to identify temperature precursory signals next we conduct statistical hypothesis tests to document the percentages of false positives and false negatives using our criteria finally we discuss the implications and recommendations derived from this work 2 data and method in our study time series data of groundwater temperature were acquired from two different groundwater wells on the east side of taiwan one is at shuiyuan hualien region and another is located at haiduan taitung both wells are constructed for mountainous region groundwater monitoring shuiyuan well was installed in 2013 and haiduan well in 2017 table 1 data quality is high because wells are located in remote mountainous area to the best of our knowledge there are no other wells around suggesting that the artificial effects such as groundwater pumping from other wells are unlikely our sensors were installed at the well screen depths which is 80 and 90 meter below surface in the shuiyuan and haiduan wells respectively we used very sensitive temperature sensors well documented in many studies e g freifeld et al 2008 wu et al 2013 two types of sensors were used the first is from the institute of oceanography national taiwan university chang and shyu 2011 called a compact high resolution temperature logger chtl which we installed in shuiyuan hualien the chtl is easy to operate has high memory capacity and low power consumption it has the resolution of better than 0 1mk the second one is level troll and was installed at haiduan taitung the level troll is from the commercial company in situ and it measures and logs water level water pressure and temperature in a maintenance free system ideal for long term monitoring at flood prone or high humidity sites and the water depth can range up to 1120 ft 341 m details can be found at https in situ com products the level troll sensors can record with an accuracy of 0 1 k and resolution of 0 01 k or better in temperature both sensors have a compact design and are therefore easy to deploy the sampling rate for both instruments was set to be 1 min for this study additionally the data intervals are 21 march 31 august 2018 for shuiyuan hualien well and 21 march 21 may 2018 and 10 may 9 july 2019 for haiduan taitung well previous hydrological studies show that many factors can influence changes of groundwater level or temperature such as pumping activity earth tides earthquakes and atmospheric indices like temperature pressure or precipitation abiye et al 2018 however those processes have different frequencies and durations thus it is essential to distinguish different frequency bands of signals from underground water data because we want to find any signal that has unusual oscillations for the purpose of earthquake precursor identification in our paper we apply the hilbert huang transform hht analysis method to investigate our dataset hht is an advanced technique for time frequency signal analysis invented by dr norden e huang the major difference between hht and common signal analysis methods such as wavelet transform or fourier transform is that hht is applicable to both non linear and non stationary temporal signals it is advantageous to use hht for hydro signals because fluctuations in the data might be abrupt and complex due to the influence of many different processes in the hht algorithm signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions imf along with a trend by the empirical mode decomposition emd method an emd is a fundamental part of the hht and the decomposition process is called shifting process which is well documented in huang et al 1998 thus we won t discuss the mathematical formula here moreover an imf is defined as a function that satisfies two conditions first it is necessary that the numbers of peaks and the number of zero crossings are equal or differ at most by one second the upper envelope defined by the local maxima and the lower envelope defined by the local minima are symmetric with respect to zero at any time in the function detailed validation was done by yang and yang 2009 to conclude an imf is similar to a sinusoid but amplitudes and periods can change at any time in the waveforms in addition it is easy to obtain instantaneous frequency and amplitude data from imf by hilbert spectral analysis so the final result of the frequency time distribution and signal amplitude can be represented as a hilbert spectrum which provides localized features huang et al 2009 huang and shen 2014 3 result fig 1 depicts groundwater temperature from april 27th to may 7th in shuiyuan hualien well with chtl device large perturbations between may 1st and 2nd are shown in addition a meteorological station of the central weather bureau cwb near the well provides air temperature and pressure data fig 1 unlike temperature data air temperature and pressure data changed normally and smoothly without abrupt perturbations therefore the groundwater temperature fluctuations between may 1st and 2nd are unlikely to be related to those atmospheric processes in addition water level data collected by sinotech and central geological survey cgs at the same well are correlated with atmospheric pressure but not with the groundwater temperature data it is not clear why the abrupt groundwater temperature perturbation does not strongly correlate with groundwater level changes note that the water level sampling interval is ten minutes instead of one minute the water level data also suggest that pumping tests and instrument maintenance did not occur in this time window to sum up abrupt perturbations in groundwater temperature may be triggered by other sources and we define this perturbation as a precursory anomaly for fig 1b we zoomed in to a time window from may 1st to may 3rd in which abrupt fluctuations of groundwater temperature began about 27 h before an mw 5 5 earthquake local time 07 47 on may 2nd the temperature was perturbed by nearly 0 1 c the epicentral distance or the distance between the epicenter and the well is 82 6 km next we used hht to decompose the anomalous groundwater temperature data we decomposed the signal into different intrinsic mode functions imf fig 2 a shows the first three imfs with a time window from 3 days before the earthquake until the earthquake origin time fig 2b depicts the instantaneous energy calculated by the different imfs here we use the convention that the energy transported by a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave the interpreted anomalous energy displays much stronger energy than is seen in other time windows in addition according to the weather report from cwb in table 2 shuiyuan the hualien area did not have any heavy precipitation during april 29th to may 2nd and only a bit over 10 mm on april 23th this aquifer groundwater temperature anomaly does not correlate with precipitation we therefore interpreted it as an earthquake precursor next we analyzed the groundwater temperature time series we show the hilbert spectrum generated by imfs in fig 2c the perturbation in the time series is dominated by signals with periods between 1 and 10 min and has duration of nearly 8 h such long period and long duration signals are very different from typical seismic ground motions induced by p s rayleigh and love wave love 1911 aki and richards 2002 thus they might be generated by other unknown processes for another well an mw4 86 earthquake with a focal depth of 19 km occurred near the coast of taitung region at 21 49 april 16th 2018 local time the epicenter is much closer to our observation well in haiduan taitung we found coseismic signals not only in groundwater level but also in temperature fig 3 the instrument level troll records not only ground water temperature but also pressure and groundwater level changes the groundwater pressure and depth between the water level and the instrument increased immediately after the earthquake occurred by 13 79 hpa and 15 cm respectively in contrast temperature gradually decreased by nearly 0 1 c the decreasing temperature could be due to colder water coming into the borehole of the well and the possible mechanism is well documented in liao et al 2015 coseismic increases in vertical permeability and the crack already existed may be clearing or the new cracks will occur therefore mixing about groundwater and cyclic flow from different reservoirs would appear which means breaching of aquitards can happen naturally fig 4 a depicts the location of the april 2018 event compared to the may 2nd earthquake shown in figs 1 and 2 the epicentral distance for the april event is only 19 8 km we performed hht analysis using the same method the hilbert spectrum from 3 days prior to the earthquake is plotted in fig 4b we found similar anomalies such pre seismic perturbations have dominant periods of less than 10 min and with a duration of nearly 12 h as well as an hour before earthquake however the amplitude of the precursory signal is not as long as that in the first case the reasons may be the smaller magnitude of the april earthquake moreover another mw 5 9 earthquake occurred at 17 46 june 4 2019 near the haiduan taitung well and the focal depth is 14 7 km the coseismic signals are shown in fig 5 a the groundwater pressure and depth between the water level and the instrument increased immediately after the earthquake occurred by 20 68 hpa and 20 cm respectively besides the temperature of groundwater drops dramatically near 0 2 c which is differ from the case discussed in fig 3 in fig 5b the location of the 2019 event and the hilbert spectrum from 3 days prior to the earthquake are demonstrated and the distance between epicenter and well is 56 km the perturbations have dominant periods of less than 10 min and with a duration of nearly 20 h on the other hand the amplitude of the precursory signal is not as large as that in the first case even though the magnitude is larger to sum up despite the smaller magnitude we still observe a similar significant anomaly in the hht spectrum however the larger magnitude is not necessarily matched to the stronger precursory signal in different well results as a result in addition to earthquake magnitude the epicentral distance to the well and different well characteristics may also affect groundwater temperature precursory signals a similar perspective was published by wang et al 2015 who suggested that ground water variations may influence by earthquake with a limited distance or specific regions 4 validation and discussion we attempted to use our limited dataset to conduct statistical analysis on our results we first compiled all the earthquakes that satisfy our requirements namely ones with mw magnitude over 4 7 and focal depth less than 50 km and which occurred during our instrument deployment period march 21st may 21st 2018 and may 10th july 9th for haiduan taitung and march 21st august 31st for shuiyuan hualian the earthquake must be located within longitude between 121 e to 123 e and latitude between 22 n to 25 n the reason why we determine the standard of magnitude to be 4 7 is because the clear magnitude distance relationship for earthquakes that induce springs discharge responses manga and rowland 2009 in total 7 events that fit these criteria are displayed in fig 6 and the details are documented in table 3 next we statistically tested whether the groundwater temperature dataset successfully identified the precursor in some earthquake precursor studies the false positive and false negative statistic have sometimes been ignored and just the true positive events have been documented this may not be objective enough ingebritsen and manga 2014 andrén et al 2016 for this work we have tried to examine false positives and false negatives using the following steps 1 take a 3 day time window to perform hht analysis and shift one day sequentially to cover all the instrument deployment periods we want to identify and calculate the percentage of strong fluctuation amplitudes with periods under 10 min just like those displayed in figs 2c 4b and 5b the reason why we choose 3 day time window is empirical based on our testing 2 for each hilbert spectrum list all the amplitudes bigger than the mean value of the amplitude plus 2 times the standard deviation meaning that we select all different periods that dominate in this 3 day time window waveform this is to reduce the potential issue from persist signals generated by tides with harmonic periods of 12 h in general hsieh et al 1987 3 we select those periods less than 10 min in the dominant amplitudes and calculate the percentage of periods less than 10 min against all primary variation periods that we calculate from step 2 we then have a percentage of dominant waveforms whose periods are under 10 min in every 3 day time window 4 different wells show different geological characteristics so we calculate the mean percentage plus 2 times the standard deviation for each well if the percentage that we calculated at step 3 is larger than this value we define it as an anomaly all percentages derived from our dataset and raw data of groundwater temperature are presented in figs 7 and 8 for different wells respectively we have discussed the false negative cases next we wish to study false positive cases in numerous studies about earthquake precursors it has been argued that ionospheric anomalies have been more successful as earthquake precursors on a useful time scale than other earth science observations liu et al 2001 demonstrate that an electron density anomaly disturbance in the ionosphere happened 1 5 before days the 1999 mw7 3 chi chi earthquake short term forecasts are more important for disaster mitigation therefore if an earthquake that satisfies our conditions in table 3 happened within 5 days of the occurrence of a temperature anomaly we consider it as a precursor fig 7a 7c fig 8a indicates a total of 6 anomaly events and there are 5 earthquakes that occurred over the next 5 days more specifically in fig 7a two anomalies in haiduan taitung well happened in 2018 were followed by earthquakes in the next 1 5 days no 1 april 16th 2018 earthquake and no 2 april 21st 2018 earthquake in fig 7c an anomaly happened in 2019 were followed by earthquake no 7 june 4th 2019 the locations and information are shown in fig 6 and table 3 fig 7b and 7d are raw data log of groundwater temperature in haiduan well for 2018 and 2019 respectively and the obvious coseismic phenomenon are discussed in the results section however for shuiyuan hualien well three anomalies indicated in fig 8a only have two corresponding earthquakes the no 4 and no 5 events including the event that demonstrates an obvious pre seismic perturbation that we discussed in the first part of the results and discussion the june 4th 2018 anomaly is the only one with no following earthquake in our study there are two earthquakes without pre seismic anomalies namely the no 3 and no 6 events according to fig 6 and table 3 those two earthquakes have more considerable epicentral distances from the wells and their magnitudes are not as large as the no 4 event we discussed if the epicenter of an earthquake is too far from the well and if the earthquake magnitude is not large enough we may not observe a pre seismic anomaly perturbation in groundwater temperature moreover we presented the standard deviation of groundwater temperature with the distribution of earthquake magnitude and distance from the epicenter to well in fig 9 for all seven events the statistical interval starts from 3 days before the earthquake and continues to the earthquake origin time and the values are stated in table 4 the size of circles in fig 9 correspond to the scale of standard deviation and the minimum value of different wells are 0 0156 for no 7 event in haiduan well red color and 0 0016 for no 6 event in shuiyuan well blue color basically the standard deviation of groundwater temperature can be considered as the usual background levels of temperature perturbation for the earthquake events without an anomaly we showed as blanked circles the standard deviations of groundwater temperature are smaller than the other events for the same well shuiyuan hualien thus the overall groundwater temperature fluctuation of anomaly events is usually stronger than those without an anomaly also compared to shuiyuan well the groundwater temperature in haiduan taitung well is more sensitive for earthquake precursory purposes in fig 9 we plotted the scaling between earthquake rupture length and the magnitude according to wells and coppersmith 1994 m 4 38 1 49 log rupture length is shown in black dashed line and the solid red line roughly separates the successful cases from the unsuccessful cases although more datasets are required this limited dataset indicates that the precursors are sensitive to an earthquake within an epicentral distance that is about 20 to 25 times of the earthquake rupture length additionally the standard deviations of groundwater temperature in all events are higher than the resolution of corresponding equipment namely the resolution of level troll in haiduan taitung well is better than 0 01 k and chtl in shuiyuan hualien is 0 1 mk wang et al 2015 proposes that water level data from wells near the coastline give clear precursory signals both of the wells we have studied are near the coast consistent with his interpretation however there are also cases where an earthquake occurred after a groundwater temperature anomaly that was not associated with water level changes it is difficult to interpret such results one possibility is that the temperature gradient is much larger than the hydraulic pressure gradient for some of these cases additional data are needed paudel et al 2018 review possible earthquake precursory signs in groundwater chemistry the paper discussed many proxies as the precursory including ph total dissolved solids electrical conductivity carbon dioxide methane hydrogen radon argon nitrogen and helium etc the endothermic and exothermic reaction may happen during the chemical interaction procedure that is to say we may not know precisely about which anomaly parameters in groundwater chemistry is the precursory signals but we document this work to show the perturbation of groundwater temperature to conclude the rates of false positives and false negatives are 16 7 and 28 6 respectively the percentage of the rates and the higher standard deviation than the resolutions of equipment give us confident that our results are worth documenting in the future we may need more earthquake events and well data to validate or even modify our results and hypothesis it is difficult but important to compile different geochemical and geophysical datasets for earthquake precursory research with the limited dataset presented in this work we propose that additional near real time ground water temperature data might provide low cost and complementary information for earthquake precursory research 5 conclusion we have conducted taiwan s first groundwater temperature precursory and co seismic study using two wells an obvious groundwater temperature anomaly in shuiyuan hualian well began nearly 27 h before an mw 5 5 earthquake on may 2nd 2018 we determined that the perturbation was not influenced by other factors since we have cross checked meteorological observations and water level data furthermore the hht analysis shows that the perturbation was mainly composed of signals with periods between one and ten minutes similar results were found in another well in haiduan taitung our results indicate that a pre seismic groundwater temperature anomaly may exist 1 5 days before an mw 4 7 earthquake the assumption is based on the above mentioned false positive and false negative examination of earthquakes over mw4 7 with depths smaller than 50 km in time interval when we have the observed groundwater temperature data if there is an anomaly based on the criteria we documented in this work the probability that an mw 4 7 earthquakes will occur subsequently in 1 5 days is about 80 i e totally six anomaly cases followed by five earthquakes in addition five of seven mw 4 7 earthquakes table 3 have a pre seismic groundwater temperature anomaly in our limited dataset still more cases are needed in the future to make this interpretation more robust in addition we discovered that if there is a groundwater temperature precursor that occurred before an earthquake the overall groundwater temperature fluctuation during the precursory period is usually stronger than those without an anomaly there are many proposed groundwater hydrological precursors such as water level temperature and chemical composition changes etc however the geophysical mechanisms on how crust generates those precursory anomalies are still active research topics for practical purposes we hope to continue this line of research by collecting more data some in real time however at the same time efforts are needed to explain the physics of the proposed precursor which is out of the scope of this work we believe the above mentioned studies and routine monitoring may provide some new and beneficial insights for the future study of hydrological earthquake precursors in our opinion hydrological earthquake precursors are not only presented on long term time scales such as monthly quarterly or semi annually but also have a potential for short term forecasts most importantly by combining other possible pre seismic observations such as ionospheric electron density oscillation abnormalities latent heat flux and land surface temperature changes and geomagnetic variate anomalies

can happen naturally fig 4 a depicts the location of the april 2018 event compared to the may 2nd earthquake shown in figs 1 and 2 the epicentral distance for the april event is only 19 8 km we performed hht analysis using the same method the hilbert spectrum from 3 days prior to the earthquake is plotted in fig 4b we found similar anomalies such pre seismic perturbations have dominant periods of less than 10 min and with a duration of nearly 12 h as well as an hour before earthquake however the amplitude of the precursory signal is not as long as that in the first case the reasons may be the smaller magnitude of the april earthquake moreover another mw 5 9 earthquake occurred at 17 46 june 4 2019 near the haiduan taitung well and the focal depth is 14 7 km the coseismic signals are shown in fig 5 a the groundwater pressure and depth between the water level and the instrument increased immediately after the earthquake occurred by 20 68 hpa and 20 cm respectively besides the temperature of groundwater drops dramatically near 0 2 c which is differ from the case discussed in fig 3 in fig 5b the location of the 2019 event and the hilbert spectrum from 3 days prior to the earthquake are demonstrated and the distance between epicenter and well is 56 km the perturbations have dominant periods of less than 10 min and with a duration of nearly 20 h on the other hand the amplitude of the precursory signal is not as large as that in the first case even though the magnitude is larger to sum up despite the smaller magnitude we still observe a similar significant anomaly in the hht spectrum however the larger magnitude is not necessarily matched to the stronger precursory signal in different well results as a result in addition to earthquake magnitude the epicentral distance to the well and different well characteristics may also affect groundwater temperature precursory signals a similar perspective was published by wang et al 2015 who suggested that ground water variations may influence by earthquake with a limited distance or specific regions 4 validation and discussion we attempted to use our limited dataset to conduct statistical analysis on our results we first compiled all the earthquakes that satisfy our requirements namely ones with mw magnitude over 4 7 and focal depth less than 50 km and which occurred during our instrument deployment period march 21st may 21st 2018 and may 10th july 9th for haiduan taitung and march 21st august 31st for shuiyuan hualian the earthquake must be located within longitude between 121 e to 123 e and latitude between 22 n to 25 n the reason why we determine the standard of magnitude to be 4 7 is because the clear magnitude distance relationship for earthquakes that induce springs discharge responses manga and rowland 2009 in total 7 events that fit these criteria are displayed in fig 6 and the details are documented in table 3 next we statistically tested whether the groundwater temperature dataset successfully identified the precursor in some earthquake precursor studies the false positive and false negative statistic have sometimes been ignored and just the true positive events have been documented this may not be objective enough ingebritsen and manga 2014 andrén et al 2016 for this work we have tried to examine false positives and false negatives using the following steps 1 take a 3 day time window to perform hht analysis and shift one day sequentially to cover all the instrument deployment periods we want to identify and calculate the percentage of strong fluctuation amplitudes with periods under 10 min just like those displayed in figs 2c 4b and 5b the reason why we choose 3 day time window is empirical based on our testing 2 for each hilbert spectrum list all the amplitudes bigger than the mean value of the amplitude plus 2 times the standard deviation meaning that we select all different periods that dominate in this 3 day time window waveform this is to reduce the potential issue from persist signals generated by tides with harmonic periods of 12 h in general hsieh et al 1987 3 we select those periods less than 10 min in the dominant amplitudes and calculate the percentage of periods less than 10 min against all primary variation periods that we calculate from step 2 we then have a percentage of dominant waveforms whose periods are under 10 min in every 3 day time window 4 different wells show different geological characteristics so we calculate the mean percentage plus 2 times the standard deviation for each well if the percentage that we calculated at step 3 is larger than this value we define it as an anomaly all percentages derived from our dataset and raw data of groundwater temperature are presented in figs 7 and 8 for different wells respectively we have discussed the false negative cases next we wish to study false positive cases in numerous studies about earthquake precursors it has been argued that ionospheric anomalies have been more successful as earthquake precursors on a useful time scale than other earth science observations liu et al 2001 demonstrate that an electron density anomaly disturbance in the ionosphere happened 1 5 before days the 1999 mw7 3 chi chi earthquake short term forecasts are more important for disaster mitigation therefore if an earthquake that satisfies our conditions in table 3 happened within 5 days of the occurrence of a temperature anomaly we consider it as a precursor fig 7a 7c fig 8a indicates a total of 6 anomaly events and there are 5 earthquakes that occurred over the next 5 days more specifically in fig 7a two anomalies in haiduan taitung well happened in 2018 were followed by earthquakes in the next 1 5 days no 1 april 16th 2018 earthquake and no 2 april 21st 2018 earthquake in fig 7c an anomaly happened in 2019 were followed by earthquake no 7 june 4th 2019 the locations and information are shown in fig 6 and table 3 fig 7b and 7d are raw data log of groundwater temperature in haiduan well for 2018 and 2019 respectively and the obvious coseismic phenomenon are discussed in the results section however for shuiyuan hualien well three anomalies indicated in fig 8a only have two corresponding earthquakes the no 4 and no 5 events including the event that demonstrates an obvious pre seismic perturbation that we discussed in the first part of the results and discussion the june 4th 2018 anomaly is the only one with no following earthquake in our study there are two earthquakes without pre seismic anomalies namely the no 3 and no 6 events according to fig 6 and table 3 those two earthquakes have more considerable epicentral distances from the wells and their magnitudes are not as large as the no 4 event we discussed if the epicenter of an earthquake is too far from the well and if the earthquake magnitude is not large enough we may not observe a pre seismic anomaly perturbation in groundwater temperature moreover we presented the standard deviation of groundwater temperature with the distribution of earthquake magnitude and distance from the epicenter to well in fig 9 for all seven events the statistical interval starts from 3 days before the earthquake and continues to the earthquake origin time and the values are stated in table 4 the size of circles in fig 9 correspond to the scale of standard deviation and the minimum value of different wells are 0 0156 for no 7 event in haiduan well red color and 0 0016 for no 6 event in shuiyuan well blue color basically the standard deviation of groundwater temperature can be considered as the usual background levels of temperature perturbation for the earthquake events without an anomaly we showed as blanked circles the standard deviations of groundwater temperature are smaller than the other events for the same well shuiyuan hualien thus the overall groundwater temperature fluctuation of anomaly events is usually stronger than those without an anomaly also compared to shuiyuan well the groundwater temperature in haiduan taitung well is more sensitive for earthquake precursory purposes in fig 9 we plotted the scaling between earthquake rupture length and the magnitude according to wells and coppersmith 1994 m 4 38 1 49 log rupture length is shown in black dashed line and the solid red line roughly separates the successful cases from the unsuccessful cases although more datasets are required this limited dataset indicates that the precursors are sensitive to an earthquake within an epicentral distance that is about 20 to 25 times of the earthquake rupture length additionally the standard deviations of groundwater temperature in all events are higher than the resolution of corresponding equipment namely the resolution of level troll in haiduan taitung well is better than 0 01 k and chtl in shuiyuan hualien is 0 1 mk wang et al 2015 proposes that water level data from wells near the coastline give clear precursory signals both of the wells we have studied are near the coast consistent with his interpretation however there are also cases where an earthquake occurred after a groundwater temperature anomaly that was not associated with water level changes it is difficult to interpret such results one possibility is that the temperature gradient is much larger than the hydraulic pressure gradient for some of these cases additional data are needed paudel et al 2018 review possible earthquake precursory signs in groundwater chemistry the paper discussed many proxies as the precursory including ph total dissolved solids electrical conductivity carbon dioxide methane hydrogen radon argon nitrogen and helium etc the endothermic and exothermic reaction may happen during the chemical interaction procedure that is to say we may not know precisely about which anomaly parameters in groundwater chemistry is the precursory signals but we document this work to show the perturbation of groundwater temperature to conclude the rates of false positives and false negatives are 16 7 and 28 6 respectively the percentage of the rates and the higher standard deviation than the resolutions of equipment give us confident that our results are worth documenting in the future we may need more earthquake events and well data to validate or even modify our results and hypothesis it is difficult but important to compile different geochemical and geophysical datasets for earthquake precursory research with the limited dataset presented in this work we propose that additional near real time ground water temperature data might provide low cost and complementary information for earthquake precursory research 5 conclusion we have conducted taiwan s first groundwater temperature precursory and co seismic study using two wells an obvious groundwater temperature anomaly in shuiyuan hualian well began nearly 27 h before an mw 5 5 earthquake on may 2nd 2018 we determined that the perturbation was not influenced by other factors since we have cross checked meteorological observations and water level data furthermore the hht analysis shows that the perturbation was mainly composed of signals with periods between one and ten minutes similar results were found in another well in haiduan taitung our results indicate that a pre seismic groundwater temperature anomaly may exist 1 5 days before an mw 4 7 earthquake the assumption is based on the above mentioned false positive and false negative examination of earthquakes over mw4 7 with depths smaller than 50 km in time interval when we have the observed groundwater temperature data if there is an anomaly based on the criteria we documented in this work the probability that an mw 4 7 earthquakes will occur subsequently in 1 5 days is about 80 i e totally six anomaly cases followed by five earthquakes in addition five of seven mw 4 7 earthquakes table 3 have a pre seismic groundwater temperature anomaly in our limited dataset still more cases are needed in the future to make this interpretation more robust in addition we discovered that if there is a groundwater temperature precursor that occurred before an earthquake the overall groundwater temperature fluctuation during the precursory period is usually stronger than those without an anomaly there are many proposed groundwater hydrological precursors such as water level temperature and chemical composition changes etc however the geophysical mechanisms on how crust generates those precursory anomalies are still active research topics for practical purposes we hope to continue this line of research by collecting more data some in real time however at the same time efforts are needed to explain the physics of the proposed precursor which is out of the scope of this work we believe the above mentioned studies and routine monitoring may provide some new and beneficial insights for the future study of hydrological earthquake precursors in our opinion hydrological earthquake precursors are not only presented on long term time scales such as monthly quarterly or semi annually but also have a potential for short term forecasts most importantly by combining other possible pre seismic observations such as ionospheric electron density oscillation abnormalities latent heat flux and land surface temperature changes and geomagnetic variate anomalies

5833,ongoing challenges from population growth and climate stress on the water resources of the volta river basin raise the importance of finding economically sustainable water development and use patterns much research has been conducted on the impacts of water supply fluctuations climate change and population growth on effective economic access to water resources of the basin however no work to date has comprehensively investigated the sustainable economic performance of additional infrastructure development in the basin for handling ongoing challenges of climate water stress at the entire basin scale the original contribution of this work is to investigate the capacity to mitigate poverty from new reservoir storage capacity if established in a flood prone region in northern ghana using a basin scale hydro economic optimization framework while accounting for five major water uses for six riparian countries an integrated approach is formulated to link the hydrologic agronomic institutional and economic dimensions of the basin into a unified framework for policy analysis a dynamic optimization model is developed and applied to discover the level and distribution of economic impacts from the additional storage infrastructure development results indicate the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana and burkina faso with no economic loss to any other riparian from the development and operation of additional storage infrastructure results show considerable potential to secure an actual pareto improvement by which ghana and burkina faso are better off with the new storage infrastructure than without it and no other riparian country in the basin is worse off additional storage infrastructure in the flood prone area of the basin in northern ghana carries the potential to store water during wet seasons and years and release water for use in dry seasons and years reallocating water among seasons and years elevating economic development to the basin s riparian countries despite our optimistic findings considerable stakeholder negotiations and cooperation will be needed to secure the potential welfare gains uncovered keywords optimal growth river basin volta infrastructure poverty mitigation 1 introduction 1 1 background access to water resources of the volta river basin continues to face ongoing stress from high population growth climate change and variability and weak economic capacity to handle water of the wrong quantity quality timing location price and cost methods to address all these dimensions of a water problem have occupied the attention of politicians scientists and water managers in this basin and elsewhere for years booker et al 2012 with only limited success to date an integrated approach to achieve success requires a comprehensive and data driven optimization framework to discover a package of improvements for which the discounted net present value of those improvements is made as high as possible while respecting existing or potential financial hydrologic technical and legal constraints the development as well as practical use of an economically optimized multi sector economic model at a basin scale for improving water related welfare has presented an ongoing scientific and policy challenge for years briscoe 2011 kotir et al 2017 maass et al 1962 rouamba et al 2009 with a special need for

remain low income economies amongst the poorest in the world world bank 2019 the causes of water related poverty in the basin s semi arid regions include low agricultural productivity water insecurity rainfall variability poor water access weak capacity to adapt to floods and droughts water related diseases with significant consequences for lives and labor productivity however financial infrastructure and institutional constraints hinder actions to mitigate poverty lemoalle and de condappa 2013 with the basin s population forecast by some scholars to grow at an average rate of about 3 per year the basin s water resources will be under intense stress amisigo et al 2015 kolavalli and williams 2016 van de giesen et al 2001 moreover high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall

the incidence of poverty is higher in the drier upper and middle parts of the basin than the wetter lower regions lemoalle and de condappa 2013 the climate of the basin is strongly influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz which produces a unimodal rainy season with annual rainfall less than 500 mm in the upper basin and between 900 and 1100 mm in the middle basin from late may to early october with peak rainfall occurring in august september as well as bimodal rainy seasons with annual rainfall greater than 1100 mm in the lower basin from mid april to early november with peaks in june july and september october mul et al 2016 rodgers et al 2006 average annual potential open water evaporation ranges between 1350 to 1500 mm in the lower basin 1501 to 2000 mm in the middle basin and 2001 to 2500 mm in the upper basin mul et al 2015 van edig et al 2002 the climate conditions mean that rainfall decreases whereas evaporation increases from the lower to the upper basin which produces more limited water availability in the upper and middle regions of the basin than in its lower reaches the white volta river catchment area in northern ghana is one of the regions in the middle basin where climate water stress has historically contributed to both floods and droughts bond et al 2018 kasei et al 2013 udo et al 2012 climatic conditions in this region have high rainfall and temperature variability causing a corresponding high variability in stream flows with high flows during the wet rainy season and little to no streamflow during the dry season de condappa et al 2009 mul et al 2015 this climate variability has always negatively affected the largely rain fed economy of northern ghana barry et al 2005 bond et al 2018 sidibe et al 2016 even though

2004 hunter 2003 post et al 2013 burkina faso northern ghana and northern togo face both physical and economic water scarcity physical water scarcity occurs when there is not enough water to meet both human demands and those of ecosystems to function effectively based on the gadner outlaw and englaman 1997 threshold a region endowed with less than 1700 m3 of water per capita per year is considered water scarce eguavoen 2007 mul et al 2016 van de giesen et al 2001 2006 in the semi arid upper and middle basin in burkina faso and northern ghana less water is available in the dry seasons and dry years water resources per capita in burkina faso and northern ghana are 900 m3 year and 1200 m3 year respectively lemoalle and de condappa 2013 economic water scarcity occurs when inadequate infrastructure and financial institutional capacity limits people from accessing the water they need affordably and at the time they need it a weakness of effective water infrastructure to satisfy growing demand due to high population growth gives rise to economic scarcity as a significant problem for the basin s communities mul et al 2016 the 1992 completion and operation of the bagre dam on the white volta river in southern burkina faso upstream of the burkina faso ghana border fig 1 has altered the flow and use patterns of the white volta river in northern ghana historically reduced flow of the river in dry periods has been replaced by a more steady flow regime of 30 40 m3 s mul and gao 2016 mul et al 2018 since hydropower production in burkina faso is historically low the bagre dam with an installed hydropower capacity of 16 mw and a potential irrigated area of 30 000 ha with 3300 ha currently developed is operated to increase hydropower production and food production from downstream irrigation as part of a larger agro industrial project the bagre growth pole project mul et al 2018 although the bagre dam has contributed to elevated flows in dry seasons in northern ghana there have been incidents of flooding in wet seasons since its construction and operation because of its limited size to contain flood flows this has historically caused significant flood damages in northern ghana armah et al 2010 bond et al 2018 evidence shows that about 22 of the inflow into the bagre dam is spilled annually mul et al 2018 however during the peak flow period usually august september historically more than 80 of the inflow into the dam is spilled mul et al 2018 bagre spillage combined with heavy localized rainfall concentrating in tributaries joining the white volta river catchment in northern ghana causes downstream flooding with the channel overtopping its banks kasei et al 2016 udo et al 2012 flooding has historically reached up to 1 km or 0 62 miles inland balana et al 2016 for instance in 2018 flooding in northern ghana caused by long term heavy rainfall combined with water releases from the bagre dam led to the death of 34 displacement of over 100 000

houses property and the death of 29 in northern ghana ifrc 2019 institutionally the basin is characterized by weakly coordinated policies and development initiatives among riparian countries even though individual states have established some active national water institutions ampomah et al 2016 bond et al 2018 with the establishment of a basin agency the volta basin authority vba which began operation in 2009 the countries are attempting to forge a transboundary institutional cooperative framework to guide future water use patterns for the basin meanwhile ghana and burkina faso have increased their collaboration resulting in burkina faso supplying two weeks notice every year before the start of bagre dam spillage in late august to early september in anticipation of reducing flood damages and casualties in northern ghana obrecht and mead 2014 to limit flood damages and casualties mitigate water related poverty promote agricultural growth and economic development in northern ghana the government of ghana has proposed a development plan for constructing the pwalugu multipurpose dam pmd on the white volta river in the upper east region of ghana downstream of the bagre dam in burkina faso the highly publicized groundbreaking sod cutting for this project occurred on november 29 2019 the total cost of the entire hydro solar hybrid project is estimated at us 993 million with the dam construction and its related hydropower and downstream irrigation components expected to cost about us 938 million government of ghana 2019 the policy objective of the pmd project is to reduce the level and costs of water scarcity and floods make water available in the face of climate stress and meet the water demands of the increasing population in the white volta catchment of northern ghana in basins where there is high outflow to sinks such as seas and saline aquifers during high flow periods and limited discharge to sinks during low flow periods storing and reallocating water among seasons and years could potentially lead to significant increases in the economic performance of the water system eguavoen and mccartney 2013 keller et al 2000 mccartney et al 2012 2013 1 2 previous work numerous investigations have been conducted for transboundary river basin management to address issues of water related conflict and poverty existing works have found that water scarcity is experienced by one third of the world s population due to weak institutions limited water infrastructure development increasing population growing water demand climate change and urbanization who 2015 some works have found that with climate change and the existing water infrastructure in the volta river basin only 86 of the water demand in the basin will be met by 2050 with reductions to 52 by 2100 andah et al 2003 mccartney et al 2012 lower rainfall amounts in the volta basin over the years due to longer dry seasons have led to more tributaries as well as mainstem rivers facing considerably reduced native supplies leading to reduced surface water available for the increasing population andah et al 2003 water scarcity in the volta basin as a result of climate water stress has the potential for elevated future conflict between riparian countries kolavalli and williams 2016 several efforts have used various basin scale models such as the water evaluation and planning waep system amisigo et al 2015 andah et al 2003 de condappa et al 2008 friesen et al 2005 and the soil and water assessment tool swat awotwi et al 2015 sood et al 2013 to assess the impact of climate variability and land management practices on water allocation in the volta basin these studies often find that with climate change continued upper basin storage development that causes even modest flow reductions in ghana s lake volta in the lower basin reduces power generation capacity in ghana de condappa et al 2008 mccartney et al 2012 however using the joint climate hydrological modeling approach meteorological model mm5 and water flow and balancesimulationmodel wasim eth to assess the impact of the development of small and medium scale reservoirs in the upper part of the volta basin on downstream lake volta leemhuis et al 2009 concluded that the impact of upper basin reservoir development on the water storage of lake volta is marginal compared to their benefits in securing food production and livestock improvement during the dry season the authors found that evaporation losses of lake volta are three times higher than the mean annual storage losses due to small and medium scale reservoir development upstream of the lake storage infrastructure expansion can promote economic development however there is a need to find better ways to plan build and operate dams and related reservoirs to minimize their negative impact on society and the environment chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 regions facing economic water scarcity can develop infrastructure to store water in times of high flows and release it for use in times of reduced water flow however with transboundary basins uncoordinated storage infrastructure development policies may result in conflict amisigo 2005 some work has been done to integrate climate hydrology agronomy institutions and economics of the volta basin for example a 2004 investigation analyzed the profitability of allocating the basin s water to irrigated agriculture urban water supply and hydropower production using existing infrastructure for burkina faso and ghana obeng asiedu 2004 that work aimed to establish a rigorous decision support system dss for water resources management of the volta river basin rodgers et al 2006 some investigations have used reservoir optimization models to analyze tradeoffs between economic social and environmental costs and benefits of multipurpose dam reservoir operation bejarano et al 2019 huang et al 2019 wu and chen 2013 while other works have used hydro economic optimization models to analyze the implication of integrating climate change impacts into water storage development planning accounting for the degree of economic interdependence in transboundary river basins jeuland 2010 lauri et al 2012 wu et al 2013 other works have found that storage infrastructure development and operation in transboundary river basins improve basin wide economic welfare habteyes et al 2015 jalilov et al 2013 2016 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008a 2008b it is against this background that the present investigation seeks to examine potential basin wide economic effects of the new pmd infrastructure development in the flood prone northern ghana part of the volta basin accounting for five major water management purposes and all riparian countries by way of an integrated water management framework 1 3 gaps contribution objectives while attempts at establishing scientifically rigorous framework to guide policy choices in the volta basin are still ongoing most existing studies investigating volta basin improvements have assessed technical biological and other non economic impacts of various improvements in the basin de condappa et al 2008 leemhuis et al 2009 mccartney et al 2012 ndehedehe et al 2017 okyereh et al 2019 sood et al 2013 despite some excellent investigations these works typically lack economic information that could be used to improve the overall system economic performance of improvements at the basin scale bharati et al 2008 leemhuis et al 2009 sood et al 2013 despite the availability of several published works in this basin most have shown limited economic content however one early significant economic contribution from 2004 did successfully integrate hydrologic and economic performance obeng asiedu 2004 while the obeng asiedu 2004 investigation broke new ground for the kind of basin scale optimization work for which there had long been a need in the volta basin it left untouched some important dimensions of policy analytic capacity for the basin it did not attempt to address the economic benefits of flood control or environmental improvements or the benefits and costs of new reservoir storage capacity expansion ghana and burkina faso entered into a series of negotiations about reducing seasonal flooding in northern ghana however no economically effective policies have been implemented to reduce the considerable historical damages from a long history of flooding no peer reviewed work to date has systematically investigated policy designs for reducing extensive damages from long standing and well documented flooding in various parts of the basin such as some flood prone regions in northern ghana despite its excellence the obeng asiedu 2004 work analyzed only two of the basin s six countries ghana and burkina faso in light of the above existing achievements as well as gaps in the literature the original contribution of this work to the literature is to investigate the capacity to mitigate water poverty from new reservoir storage capacity that would be established in a flood prone region in northern ghana using a basin scale hydro economic optimization framework this investigation s originality comes from its accounting for the potential to mitigate poverty through the discovery of detailed changes in water quantity timing location and price from the development of new reservoir

2 benin with 3 8 and côte d ivoire with 3 1 of basin areas kolavalli and williams 2016 the akosombo dam was constructed on the lower volta river in 1965 about 62 miles from the sea to form lake volta which is the biggest artificial lake in the world in terms of area with an area of 3287 square miles 4 of ghana s land area and a length of about 240 mi the dam and the lake support ghana s industrial fishing tourism and agricultural industries and highly depend on flows from upstream countries thus ghana seeks more nearly constant inflows to lake volta from upstream countries historical evidence show that whenever the water level of the lake drops it produces a reduction in power generation leading to power outages in ghana undermining economic development outcomes despite considerable efforts at their implementation johnston and mccartney 2010 leemhuis et al 2009 lemoalle and de condappa 2013 the white volta river sub basin area in northern ghana where the new pmd is planned faces high climate water stress the catchment area has a wet season from late may to early october with 80 of rain occurring between july and september and a dry season from mid october to mid may with a mean rainfall of 39 in 990 6 mm per year and a mean potential evaporation of 2 0 034 m per year kadyampakeni et al 2017 kasei et al 2013 mul et al 2016 northern ghana has low rainfall and high potential evaporation whereas southern ghana has high precipitation and low potential evaporation the streamflow in the white volta river follows the wet and dry seasonal pattern and varies considerably from year to year with the peak flows occurring on an annual basis in august september typically overtopping river banks kasei et al 2016 mul and gao 2016 fig 2 s schematic shows several

hydrology of the volta river basin was used as a foundation to configure the geometry and network of the flow of the rivers of the volta basin in the construction of an economic optimization model

are observed historical average seasonal wet and dry discharge from the global runoff data center grdc 2019 headwater supply is characterized by two climate scenarios historical flow and climate stressed flow the historical flow scenario reflects stochastic inflows matching the historically observed mean water runoff data provided by the global runoff data center grdc 2019 the climate stressed flow water supply scenario reflects similar stochastic supplies for a uniform 30 reduction in runoff compared to the historical flow scenario this assumption is based on the study by mahé et al 2013 who showed that on average in west african basins a reduction in rainfall by 10 reduces streamflow by 30 the assumption is supported by existing studies finding that small changes in precipitation can lead to proportionately larger changes in runoff kasei 2010 roudier et al 2014 environmental flow data were secured from mul and gao 2016 historically observed irrigated land in production crop et crop price data were sourced from mccartney et al 2012 unep gef volta project 2013 mul et al 2015 van der schaaf 2008 and fao 2012 historically the most important crops irrigated in the basin are rice legumes e g cowpea beans and groundnuts and vegetables e g tomatoes onions pepper okra lettuce cabbage and sweet potatoes burkina faso and ghana use the basin s water to irrigate

emerge from irrigated agriculture hydropower production domestic urban water supply recreational use from boating fishing hiking photography and other related tourism activities and riverine flood damage reduction irrigated agriculture benefits are valued as net revenue crop price multiplied by yield minus cost of production multiplied by hectares in production hydropower gross benefits are measured as the price of electricity multiplied by the quantity produced in the current implementation of the model electricity prices were set to 2019 observed average levels reduced power prices from additional hydropower production due to water availability will raise consumer surplus and for a region like the volta basin with limited access to electricity increases in consumer surplus are economically and politically important to achieve urban water supply benefits measure consumer surplus from urban water use recreation benefits depend on a reservoir storage volume the flood damage function tracks the cost of flood damages based on flood stage multiplied by a known assessed value of the flooded land for which any river s flood stage is unknown until an optimization occurs the main goals of integrated water resources management economic efficiency distributional justice and sustainability are three important principles that guide this study 2 3 1 economic efficiency this work investigated alternative water allocations for irrigated agriculture domestic urban water supply hydropower production flood control and reservoir based recreation over space and time aimed at maximizing basin wide benefits for all users possible with available financial institutional technical hydrologic and environmental constraints mathematical appendix for details riverine flood damage reduction in the white volta river sub basin catchment in northern ghana was included as a significant and economically important benefit in the objective function briscoe 2011 2 3 2 distributional justice distributional justice in water management for this work is achieved in a way to protect an adequate access to water necessary to sustain water access for the marginalized and poor hutton 2013 one example of distributional justice is the achievement of safe and affordable access to water as well as the right of all users to the benefits gained from the use of water for basic needs ofori et al 2016 the present work defines distributional justice as water allocations in the face of climate stressed water supplies that ensure access to adequate water by all water users in our basin it is achieved in this paper by using a series of mathematical constraints mathematical appendix for details facing climate stressed water supplies dry areas in the basin especially burkina faso and northern ghana would have with the proposed infrastructure improved access to all water uses including environmental flow constraints due to the experience of negative effects of large dams on downstream ecosystem services such as flood recession farming fishing livestock production and drinking water supply in the basin environmental flow targets have been recommended by some scholars to be included in cost benefit analysis in the design and construction of new dam storage capacity mul and gao 2016 the implementation of environmental flows is beneficial to the basin s riparian communities mul and gao 2016 in the absence of research grade ecological data on which to base our minimum environmental flows that mimic the natural flow regime proposed by mul and gao 2016 simplified wet and dry season flow targets were implemented in our model to ensure the efficient operation of the pmd and safeguard fresh water dependent ecosystems as well as indigenous water dependent culture these target flows would help us to gauge the water use benefits forgone by upstream water users providing the opportunity cost of environmental water use 2 3 3 sustainability a sustainable policy produces lasting outcomes sustainable water management requires that adequate water allocation is made to sustain the natural functioning of the ecosystem such as maintenance of wetlands wildlife refuges and river flows for cultural purposes the study implements a sustainability goal by way of setting lower bounds on the sustainable use of water resources as well as sustained ecosystem stability and resilience the study also implements a sustainability goal for the major reservoirs in the basin where a constraint is established which requires that reservoir storage must be at least at their initial level in the last year and last season of the 20 year planning period this approach avoids a system management plan that depletes reservoir stocks in the last period effectively protecting the starting period supply for future generations mathematical appendix for details 2 4 integrated basin scale framework the basin scale analysis treats the entire volta river basin as an integrated unit the integrated method is formulated to bring the hydrology agronomy environment economics and institutions of the basin into a unified framework for policy analysis the volta basin hydro economic optimization model is formulated as a nonlinear dynamic constrained optimization problem with a twice a year seasonal time step the model discovers the seasonal pattern of water allocation that maximizes system wide economic benefits in present value terms from irrigated agriculture hydropower production urban water withdrawals recreation and riverine flood control using the grdc data on historical water supplies entering the basin the constrained optimization framework was developed using gams software gams development corporation 2019 this software and its economic optimization capabilities were developed and applied with special consideration given to local and regional conditions to discover water uses and allocations that secure maximum net economic benefits consistent with both existing and new storage infrastructure and historical as well as climate stressed water supplies the model structure contains two food crops grains and vegetables grown in 45 irrigation areas and 17 urban water supply areas across the six riparian countries containing a total of 62 water diversion points and 12 dams reservoirs single purpose and multi purpose with storage capacities greater than 90 million cubic meters and 20 river gauges water diversion points are distributed across the basin 2 in southeast mali 18 in burkina faso 2 in northwest benin 2 in northeast côte d ivoire 2 in northwest togo and 36 in ghana table appendix for details fig 2 shows the location of some of the dams reservoirs river gauges and diversion points environmental flow constraints were implemented in the model by setting minimum flow levels at selected gauges in the basin mathematical appendix to assure that the basin s water is used to support the freshwater ecosystem and the services provided by the ecosystem the model takes into consideration the economic importance of irrigated agriculture hydropower production urban water supply reservoir based recreation and riverine flood reduction the objective of the integrated model is implemented by discovering the maximized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over all water uses water management purposes years seasons within years riparian countries climate water supply scenarios and reservoir development policy plans subject to a number of hydrologic agronomic institutional environmental and economic constraints the model calculates economic benefits by type of water use management purpose season climate water supply and reservoir development policy scenarios and water users the model also optimizes irrigated land in production irrigation water use hydropower production urban water use recreation reservoir storage volumes and flood damages avoided mathematical appendix for details 3 results 3 1 overview results from our investigation presented in more detail below reveal findings that carry several headline messages the development and operation of the pmd on the white volta river carry the potential to produce a pareto improving outcome if operated efficiently it could make upstream burkina faso and downstream ghana better off and no other riparian needs to be worse off with the pmd compared to without it due to the interdependence among rivers of the volta basin and ghana s lake volta pmd s additional storage capacity has the potential to augment flows to lake volta it also could relieve upstream countries of the responsibility wished by ghana to deliver increased flows to ghana in dry seasons and dry years the economic value of irrigated agricultural production of burkina faso and northern ghana has the potential to increase in the face of better timed water application to irrigated dry season agriculture as a consequence of the reservoir regulating capacity of the pmd complementing burkina faso s bagre dam particularly under a climate stressed setting pmd s large additional storage capacity would complement the bagre dam s capacity allowing burkinabe s bagre growth pole irrigation project to optimally divert more water for its expansion while pmd s releases offer opportunity for irrigation expansion in ghana and flow augmentation to ghana s lake volta overall the total economic benefits of irrigated agriculture for each riparian country is higher in the historical flow scenario compared to the climate stressed flow scenario with or without the pmd yet remarkably increases in national farm income for burkina faso and ghana are higher with the pmd than without it under the climate stressed scenario compared to the increases in farm income under the historical flow scenario the pmd if managed efficiently has the potential to increase total basin wide discounted total national irrigation farm income by 26 under the historical flow scenario and 50 under the climate stressed flow scenario due to its storage greater water scarcity increases the agricultural benefits of measures to reduce that scarcity ghana has the potential to produce on average 128 gwh of hydropower per year with the pmd under the historical flow scenario and 93 gwh of hydropower per year under climate stressed flow scenario than without the pmd the addition of the pmd in the volta basin is predicted to provide an annual average net addition i e with pmd minus without pmd of 83 gwh and 26gwh of hydropower to the total hydropower generation of ghana which may put ghana in a better position to continue to supply electricity to neighboring burkina faso togo benin and other west african countries the development and operation of the pmd offer the potential to reduce the frequency of flooding downstream of the pwalugu gauge typically occasioned by heavy downpours and perennially compounded by the annual spillage of upstream burkina faso s bagre dam that have for decades caused considerable damages to people and property the dam if built and operated efficiently is predicted to potentially reduce average annual total flood damages by 78 the pmd if effectively managed has the potential to release environmental flows and contribute to sustaining downstream ecosystems by moderating the releases from the upstream bagre dam the basin wide total net water related economic benefits harnessed by the pmd project are up to 32 higher with the dam compared to without it for the historical flow scenario and up to 7 higher for the climate stressed flow scenario additional details are presented below 3 2 water 3 2 1 headwater flows table 1 shows synthesized flows for the five main headwater sources of the volta river basin applied to the volta basin hydro economic model these sources include the black volta river the white volta river and its major tributary the red volta river as well as the oti river and lower volta river tributaries these synthesized flows replicate the season to season mean and variance of observed supplies from the data sources described above at those five sources for the historical flow climate scenario as well as replicating 70 of historical flows described above in table 1 as well as the other tables the abbreviation wo dam stands for basin optimization with only existing dams without the pmd and wi dam stands for basin optimization with existing dams plus the pmd headwater supplies in the volta basin are identical with and without the pmd since except for limited micro climate effects building dams are expected to have no significant effect on headwater supplies into the volta river system 3 2 2 gauged streamflow table 2 shows optimized stream flows by river gauge sub basin climate water supply scenario reservoir development policy scenario and season averaged over a 20 year planning period the flows are shown only for a 20 year average because of space constraints full season by season optimized predicted flows are available from the authors upon request these optimized stream flows are shown and numbered for 20 gauges along the mainstem and major tributary locations of the volta river basin system table 2 and fig 2 for details international river gauges on the borders of benin and burkina faso gauge 11 burkina faso and togo gauge 12 burkina faso côte d ivoire and ghana gauges 3 and 4 burkina faso and ghana gauges 6 and 7 and togo and ghana gauge 13 are shown in fig 2 the international gauges indicate transboundary flows how much water flows into and out of each country and the impact of upstream country s water diversion use on the downstream country while there are 60 gauging stations in the entire volta basin benarrrosh and tumbulto 2010 only 20 were reliable enough to be used in the model based on the frequency of long term flow data and consistency with previous studies goes 2005 mccartney et al 2012 using only 20 limits our ability to measure all flows into and out of a country accurately under alternative as well as current policies nonetheless with the incorporation of water withdrawal data of each riparian country in our model s hydrologic balance framework the gauges used could give some idea of the impact of any upstream water withdrawal on downstream points for example on the black volta river the impact of water withdrawal in mali and burkina faso on water availability in ghana is measured by gauges 3 and 4 likewise on the white volta river the impact of burkina faso s water withdrawal on water availability in ghana is measured by gauges 6 and 7 also on the oti river the impact of benin s withdrawal on burkina faso is measured by gauge 11 burkina faso on togo gauge 12 and impacts water withdrawal of benin burkina faso and togo on ghana is measured by gauge 13 fig 2 reductions in river flow between any two gauges indicate net quantities of water depleted by water users in the river reach between the gauges net depletions are irrigated agriculture and urban water supply diversions minus return flows that make it back to the river subsequent to diversions the dependence on irrigated agriculture is growing in the volta basin though at a slow pace with sowing and growing of mostly rice legume and vegetable crops within the dry season fao 2012 2014 sidibe et al 2016 irrigation systems e g burkina faso s bagre and ghana s pwalugu irrigation projects have been developed downstream of the bagre dam and the pmd respectively the non consumptive water use of the hydropower plants will be diverted for agricultural use irrigation and hydropower water demand occur mostly in the dry season with virtually no irrigation water demand in the wet season our model s optimization results reflect the changes in water demand for hydropower and irrigated agriculture in the basin that would occur with the pmd the pmd s operation is optimized such that increases in hydropower demand and irrigated crop water demand in the dry season support complementary releases for both purposes however with the akosombo dam depending on flows from upstream uses in northern ghana and upstream riparian countries to generate hydropower flow reduction from the white volta black volta and oti rivers due to upstream agricultural urban diversion may reduce the dam s hydropower generation table 2 presents important messages about the development and the operation of the pmd on both downstream and upstream gauged flows as well as the overall streamflow pattern of the entire basin the table shows that with the pmd streamflow will be significantly influenced by the reservoir storage impounded by the pmd reallocating the volta basin stocks and flows especially along the white volta river with the pmd built discounted net present value of economic benefits are optimized while respecting the constraint that each country receives at least as much water related economic benefit with the pmd as without it while also respecting important hydrological environmental and institutional constraints governing water use with the pmd the politically constrained optimized reservoir operation produces a pareto improvement for which management of the pmd would attenuate high flood peaks by partially storing flood waves in its reservoir the constrained optimized reservoir operation requires that the accumulation of water stocks during the wet season build up a high reservoir storage volume and associated higher head for hydropower production and downstream irrigation this discussion shows but a partial reflection of a very large number of moving parts in our model of the volta basin and the complex array of interdependent policy choices facing the basin s managers operating the pmd to build up storage model optimized pmd reservoir releases take place largely in the dry season for joint energy and irrigated agricultural production in northern ghana while ensuring minimum environmental flows high releases of water occur in the dry period to generate more hydroelectric power to satisfy increased domestic demands for cooling in the warming scenario while making water available on demand for irrigation farming the pmd is optimized to augment the upstream bagre dam to avoid additional flows released to downstream northern ghana during the dry season while ensuring that perennial spillage of the bagre dam historically observed most wet seasons will be captured by the pmd reducing devastating costs of periodic floods that have historically struck the region periodically the reduction in the release of water from bagre dam to northern ghana in the dry season is protecting water availability for the downstream burkina faso s celebrated bagre growth pole project with the potential for elevating agriculture productivity and other agro industrial activities table 2 shows that burkina faso s flow to ghana at the bagre gauge gauge 6 falls in the dry season with the pmd compared to without it implying more capacity for irrigation water diversions for burkina faso s irrigation project even though the pmd is planned for location on the white volta river in the middle basin in northern ghana the interdependence among the streamflow gauges in ghana takes on some importance the optimized operation of the downstream akosombo dam would be affected by the operation of the pmd s addition to system storage capacity table 2 shows that due to wet season flows captured in the pmd optimized inflows to lake volta will be reduced however dry season releases for hydropower has the potential to increase lake volta s dry season inflows despite irrigation withdrawal for the irrigation scheme below the pwalugu gauge all system reservoirs store water in wet seasons and release it for use in dry seasons enhancing dry season flows and raising the total economic value of water the model optimization gives insights into the importance of timed water flows released from the pmd and existing reservoirs increasing water related economic benefits in dry seasons 3 3 irrigation water use and land in production table 3 shows optimized water use and irrigated land in production by country sub basin crop policy and climate scenario average over 20 years under the hydrological institutional constrained optimization mali is predicted to optimally use a seasonal average of 81 09 million cubic meters of water from the volta river system to irrigate 9050 ha of grain crops under the historical flow scenario both with and without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario mali would use 56 76 million cubic meters to irrigate 6340 ha both with and without the pmd benin is predicted to optimally use a seasonal average of 26 73 million cubic meters of water from the basin to irrigate 2930 ha of grain crops under the historical flow scenario with and without the pmd while water use and irrigated hectares are reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario the model optimization shows togo and côte d ivoire using seasonal averages of 26 3 million and 31 5 million cubic meters to irrigate 2920 and 3440 ha of grain crops both with and without the pmd however water use and land irrigated would be reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario as grains are the lowest valued crops and would be the first to drop out of production in a climate stressed flow scenario based on available data mali benin togo and côte d ivoire have not historically used volta system waters for vegetable irrigation unep gef volta project 2013 this finding carries significant implications for the economic value of measures to food security in west africa as in other places where food secure irrigation depends on highly fluctuating surface water supplies the table shows burkina faso predicted to use a seasonal average of 212 5 million cubic meters of water from the basin system to irrigate 24 280 ha of grain crops and 203 46 million cubic meters to irrigate 32 710 ha of vegetable crops under the historical flow scenario both with and without the pmd burkina faso s irrigation water use and land in production are predicted by the model s optimization to decrease under the climate stressed flow scenario however with the pmd irrigated grain land would increase from 5760 to 20 790 ha with a seasonal average of 180 43 million cubic meters of water with the pmd while irrigated vegetable hectares would increase by about 12 with pmd under the historical flow scenario without the pmd ghana is predicted to optimally use on average 43 79 million and 220 83 million cubic meters of water seasonally to grow 4730 and 38 710 ha of grain and vegetable crops respectively which carries important implications for food security however with the pmd 14 730 and 48 710 ha of grain and vegetable crops is predicted to be grown with seasonal average water use of 133 79 and 279 63 million cubic meters ghana s total crop production would fall slightly under the climate stressed flow scenario since most large irrigation sites in ghana are in the wet areas of the lower volta basin 3 4 hydropower 3 4 1 reservoir storage table 4 shows hydro reservoir storage volumes and associated power production by country sub basin reservoir policy and climate water supply scenario averaged over 20 years results show that the bagre reservoir upstream of the pmd on the white volta river is optimized to store an average of 1610 million cubic meters without the pmd and 1529 million cubic meters with the pmd in the wet season june to october in burkina faso under the historical flow scenario however this optimized policy would store more water in the bagre reservoir in the dry season with the pmd than without it this occurs because more water under the optimized policy needs to be released for hydropower and irrigation downstream of the bagre which requires less water stored at that reservoir under the climate stressed supply scenario the kompienga dam on the ouale river a tributary of the oti river is predicted to optimally store more water due to its large capacity and release for hydropower generation with the pmd the kompienga reservoir would optimally hold more water storage and make available releases for power production under the climate stressed flow scenario the bui reservoir in ghana but upstream of lake volta is predicted to store optimally an average of 6610 million cubic meters without the pmd and 6607 million cubic meters with the pmd under the historical flow scenario during the wet season but storage would fall under the climate stressed flow scenario due to water releases for hydropower generation while also supplying the downstream bui irrigation scheme like the kompienga reservoir the bui reservoir will have higher optimized storage with the pmd compared to without it the pmd would optimally carry low storage volumes before the wet season so that it can capture flood flows on average the pmd will store 1858 and 1313 cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons under the historical flow scenario storage falls to 1351 and 540 cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons respectively under the climate stressed flow scenario due to water releases for use the dam would release water for hydropower and downstream irrigation in the dry season producing lower storage in the dry season which also means that more water would be captured in the wet season the optimization process uncovered an economic advantage for pmd managers to capture more floodwaters coming from localized rainfall and spillage from the upstream bagre dam in the wet season while attenuating high flood peaks by partially storing flood flows in the pmd reservoir a closer look at table 4 shows that the trends in the pmd filling process throughout the 20 years will have no significant effect on upstream bagre dam with little impact on downstream akosombo dam and its lake volta pmd will store more water in the wet season and release it for hydropower and downstream irrigation use in the dry season thus the upstream bagre dam can release more water in the wet season with the pmd since the pmd will capture those high wet season flows an advantage of the pmd to burkina faso is that as bagre dam managers release water for hydropower in the dry season water released for the turbines can be used to expand irrigation for the bagre growth pole irrigation project since pmd releases can also be used for ghana s pwalugu irrigation project the storing of added water by the pmd in the wet season will also reduce the storage in lake volta in that season with the pmd however lake volta as a byproduct would secure more inflow and storage in the climate stressed flow scenario when the pmd releases water for hydropower production and irrigation downstream results also indicate that lake volta the largest artificial reservoir in the world based on surface area is predicted to store on average 145 353 and 145 452 million cubic meters of water with and without the pmd in the wet season respectively it would also store 131 745 and 131 729 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the dry season respectively however optimized water storage in that reservoir is predicted to fall to 143 427 and 142 929 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the wet season whereas storage would optimally increase to 136 322 and 134 958 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the dry season under the climate stressed flow scenario it is worthy of note that lake volta would gain more inflows to increase storage for use during the dry season with the pmd compared to without the pmd respectively under the climate stressed flow scenario compared to the historical flow scenario the kpong reservoir downstream of lake volta which stores water behind a run of the river power plant is optimally predicted to maintain its volume at 200 million cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons under both historical and climate stressed flow scenarios however the upstream hydro reservoirs are estimated to optimally hold a smaller percentage of their designed capacity than the lake volta and kpong reservoir due to evaporation loses and low rainfall owing to their location in the semi arid upper and middle parts of the basin 3 4 2 hydropower production table 4 also summarizes optimized outputs from the power plants of the basin s hydro reservoirs the table summarizes the results of hydropower production for the four hydro dams in ghana as well as the two hydro dams in burkina faso by climate headwater supply scenario the four dams in ghana have far higher installed capacities than the two dams in burkina faso the akosombo power plant of the basin s largest reservoir which impounds lake volta has the highest installed capacity of 1020 mw followed by the bui power plant with 400 mw and the kpong power plant with 160 mw the power plant of the new pmd is estimated to have 60 mw of installed capacity the bagre and kompienga power plants in burkina faso have 16 mw and 14 mw installed capacities respectively considering the capacities of the power plants in the model the results of electricity generation from the model are shown in the table results indicate that the optimized electricity generation from the akosombo dam would be 5165 gwh per year without the pmd and 5127 gwh per year with the pmd under the historical flow climate scenario on the other hand the akosombo dam is estimated to generate 3425 gwh per year without the pmd and 3370 gwh per year with the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario a minimum hydropower of 545 gwh per year under climate stressed flow scenario and a maximum of 814 gwh per year under historical flow climate scenario is forecast for the bui dam by the model optimization with the pmd while the optimized hydropower generation from the kpong dam is 934 and 941 gwh per year with and without pmd under the historical flow scenario as well as 607 and 618 gwh with and without pwd under the climate stressed flow scenario respectively table 4 also shows that the bagre dam is forecast to generate 72 and 63 gwh per year with and without the pmd under historical flow scenario and 39 and 34 gwh per year with and without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario while the kompienga dam is estimated to generate 29 gwh per year and 17 gwh per year whether with or without the pmd under the historical flow and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively results show that climate water stress will reduce the electricity generation output of the power plants because of the reduced flow of water as predicted by the optimization model however power generation at akosombo and kpong plants will fall only slightly with the pmd compared to without it the reason for the reduction in average inflow into lake volta is likely water loss through evaporation at the surface of the new pmd reservoir and through water diversion for the development of irrigated agriculture downstream of the pmd nonetheless the addition of the pmd to the hydropower generation capacities of ghana carries the potential to produce an annual average net addition i e with pmd minus without pmd of 83 gwh and 26 gwh of power to ghana s energy mix even with water withdrawal for the 20 000 ha of irrigated land below the pmd under the historical flow and climate stressed flow scenarios 3 5 economics 3 5 1 countries sectors climate scenarios and policies table 5 shows economic performance for all countries sectors and climate scenarios with and without the pmd the table shows farm income urban water supply economic benefit flood control benefits hydropower benefits recreation benefit and dam construction costs by country water supply scenario and reservoir development policy scenario the economic benefits from various water use with and without the pmd varies from season to season throughout the 20 year forecast period the value of flood damages avoided with and without the pmd also varies from season to season throughout the forecast period table 5 presents discounted net economic benefits summed over wet and dry seasons by country water use sectors climate headwater supply and dam development policy scenarios a detailed description of results for irrigated agriculture urban water supply and hydropower follows without a special discussion of recreation or flood control to conserve space despite the importance of both 3 5 2 irrigated agriculture farm production and income carry significant implications for food security in all the basin s countries for mali potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of rice crop is predicted at a total discounted value of 57 million and 40 million over the forecast period with and without the pmd under historical flow and climate stressed flow water supply scenarios respectively as the dam would carry little direct agricultural sector impact to that country for the case of burkina faso potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of grain rice and legumes and vegetable crops are an optimized discounted total of 380 million over the forecast period with and without the pmd under the historical flow scenario noticeably optimized farm income falls to a discounted total of 335 million with pmd and 231 million without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario although potential farm income falls for burkina faso in the climate stressed setting it falls by less with the pmd than without it with the pmd there is an optimized estimated 45 increase in farm income arising from the pmd s capacity to complement storage at the bagre this complementarity comes from the fact that the bagre dam releases in the climate stressed scenario need not be sent to ghana if the pmd storage is in place bagre dam releases would therefore increase water availability for burkina faso s irrigation scheme downstream of the bagre dam producing a potential increase in burkina faso s national farm income with the pmd for benin togo and côte d ivoire potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of rice crop is predicted by our optimization exercise to be a discounted total of 24 million 20 million and 22 million respectively over the forecast period with and without the pmd under the historical flow scenario and 17 million 14 million and 16 million under the climate stressed flow scenario with and without the pmd it is important to note that no country in the volta basin needs to experience a reduction in its total national farm income from optimally operating the river system as a result of the development of the pmd based on the results of our optimization model that mathematically constrained farm income for every country to never be lower with the pmd than without it burkina faso is forecast to gain national farm income with the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario these findings provide evidence that the presence and operation of the pmd can be pareto improving as it can be managed to avoid adverse impact on the riparian countries all five other riparian countries sharing the basin with ghana are in the upstream parts of the basin with respect to ghana potential farm income that could be earned with the pmd is predicted to be a discounted total of 552 million and 549 million under historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively without the pmd the model predicts ghana s potential national farm income to be a discounted total of 336 million and 329 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively the results let us conclude that pmd s storage could potentially increase water availability for irrigation in dry periods in northern ghana with implications for increasing agricultural productivity and food security all the basin s national economies have historically depended on rain fed agricultural production which has been exceedingly vulnerable to intra annual and inter annual fluctuations in rainfall and associated stream flows farmers in semi arid regions including burkina faso and northern ghana have historically grappled with water supply fluctuations including a lack of available water for dry season farming and floods in the rainy season our model suggests that overall national farm incomes would be lower under the climate stressed scenario compared to the historical flow scenario however increases in income with the pmd are higher under the climate stressed setting for burkina faso and ghana than without the pmd with the pmd s storage there can be an increase in water availability for more irrigated hectares in crop production in burkina faso and ghana with implications for improved agricultural productivity and food security generation of agro industrial jobs higher incomes and poverty reduction 3 5 3 urban water table 5 also shows the economic value of urban water supply for all riparian countries with the pmd burkina faso would secure a discounted total of 255 million and 101 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively without pmd urban water supply benefit is predicted at 182 million and 101 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios mali benin togo and côte d ivoire are predicted to attain a discounted total of 42 million 18 million 96 million and 41 million respectively under both the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios with and without the pmd ghana would secure a discounted total of 585 million with pmd under the historical flow and 584 million under the climate stressed flow scenario without the pmd the model optimization finds 576 million and 570 million for ghana under the historical flow and climate stressed flow settings 3 5 4 hydropower table 5 also shows the economic benefits of hydropower production by country climate scenario and reservoir development policy scenario the average hydropower price is set constant in the model based on currently observed average grid electricity end user tariff levels at 0 25 per kwh in burkina faso and 0 17 per kwh in ghana multiplying the hydropower production by the power price gives the total revenue for hydropower generation from the five existing dams as well as the new pmd summed over 20 years there is an optimized discounted total hydropower economic benefit of 687 million with the pmd and 639 million without the pmd for burkina faso under the historical flow scenario hydropower benefits would fall to 391 million with pmd and 351 million without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario potential hydropower benefits for ghana under the historical flow scenario are a discounted total of 30 617 million with the pmd and 30 276 million without the pmd however under the climate stressed flow scenario optimized discounted hydropower total benefit will be 19 904 million with the pmd and 19 838 without the pmd hydropower water use benefits are significantly higher in ghana than burkina faso since ghana has 98 2 of the basin s total 1670 mw installed capacity 3 6 total economic benefits table 5 also shows total discounted economic benefits summed over 20 years by country climate water supply scenario and reservoir development policy results show that each riparian country would secure some economic benefits based on the water use pattern of the country and no country will be worse off in any sector or with any climate scenario with the pmd in the basin the results predict that ghana the only downstream country in the basin which we assume to shoulder all costs of the pmd dam of 938 million would be much better off economically with the pmd than without it the reservoir that will be created by the pmd will store floodwater during higher flow seasons and years and release for joint hydropower and irrigation use in dry seasons and dry years thus distributing water among seasons and years pmd s floodwater storage has the potential to reduce floods in the wet seasons and increase water availability and access reducing both physical and economic water scarcity problems that northern ghana and southern burkina faso have faced for years during the dry seasons our model predicts that the pmd would reduce annual average flood damages by 78 in locations below the pwalugu gauge from our results the threshold 800 m3 s flow beyond which flood damages would occur will sufficiently inundate the floodplains replenish ponds and support flood recession agriculture in northern ghana based on the minimum environmental flow requirement implemented in our model 41 76 m3 s the pmd would be able to release minimum flows to a level where key ecological areas fall dry for flood recession farming and provide for domestic drinking water as well as ecosystem support in dry seasons the model results provide important insights the pmd if effectively managed and operated has the potential to release environmental flows thus contributing to sustaining downstream ecosystems by moderating the releases from the upstream bagre dam our model predicts that ghana would receive a higher total national farm income hydropower urban water supply recreation benefits and significantly reduced flood damages with the pmd in the basin than without it burkina faso would secure higher total national farm income and hydropower benefits under the climate stressed flow scenario with the pmd in the basin than without it while no other riparian will be worse off the policy implication of the model results show that both burkina faso s bagre and ghana s pwalugu irrigation schemes have the potential to increase irrigated land based on the pmd s storage complementing bagre dam storage and diversify their agricultural production by promoting dry season agriculture increases in hydropower production as well as expanded agricultural production can potentially boost food security generate agro industrial jobs improve national farm income and reduce poverty the optimization model for a 20 year time horizon forecasts that the gains from upstream irrigated agricultural development in northern ghana and burkina faso outweigh the losses in hydropower production revenue in southern ghana however the creation of future dams with large surface areas and continuous expansion of irrigated areas upstream of lake volta can create significant water use tradeoffs between energy and irrigated agriculture 4 discussion this study has investigated impacts of an optimized plan to develop and operate the pwalugu multipurpose dam pmd based on potential total basin wide economic welfare of all riparian countries in the volta basin that would be affected the study analyzed the timing and location of water allocation and use in the volta basin with existing dams and with the pmd versus with existing dams without the pmd results allow us to conclude that water allocation in the volta basin with the pmd has the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana by increasing farm income hydropower recreational benefits and flood damage reductions while also increasing farm income and hydropower benefits for burkina faso in a climate stressed flow scenario while also protecting all other riparian countries from becoming worse off if the pmd is managed for optimal economic benefits it has the potential to help the people of northern ghana reduce the burdens imposed by an ancient and perennial flood hazard experienced over its long history while ensuring water availability for burkina faso in climate stressed flow periods even if ghana bears all the cost of the dam project a constrained dynamic nonlinear optimization model was formulated to examine the potential for a pareto improving dam operation that guards against negative impacts associated with the development of the pmd for all riparian states headwater flows stream flows water use patterns reservoir storage volume guided by their economic impacts were adjusted for total economic benefit optimization to examine the potential impacts and benefits of the pmd the model structure contains two food crops types grains and vegetables grown in 45 irrigation areas across the six riparian countries 17 urban water supply areas and 12 single and multi purpose dams reservoirs with storage capacities greater than 90 million cubic meters with 20 river gauges findings from this investigation show that discounted total economic benefits over a 20 year time horizon for ghana and burkina faso can be at least as large with the pmd and the existing dams in the basin as with only the existing dams with no other basin country being worse off findings point to the importance of timed water flows released from the pmd for dry season water related activities and an opportunity for total basin wide benefits and increased benefit for ghana and burkina faso information from this study could provide informed motivation for ghana to engage more confidently with burkina faso and the other riparian countries of the volta basin to guide debates over the pmd development the methods and results from this study could also guide unilateral water resources decision making for each riparian country about economically optimized cropping urban water supply hydropower production and recreation to pursue bearing in mind the effect of each country s water use and development on other countries hydrologic and economic outcomes with ghana planning to increase its hydropower generation through the construction of the pmd burkina faso may anticipate access to more imported electric power for purchase from ghana at a lower price than their next best current alternative our results show that ghana would have the economic capacity to offer a discounted price for hydropower exports to the upstream country burkina faso since current electricity prices are typically about 47 higher in burkina faso than ghana such potential outcomes could discourage burkina faso from building more dams for hydropower which may be detrimental to flows to ghana ghana can also continue to export more electricity to togo and benin the findings of this study could serve as a guide for a win win negotiation between upstream countries burkina faso togo and benin and downstream country ghana one limitation of the study is the lack of research grade hydrologic information in the basin making it challenging to track recent data on surface water supplies in the basin motivating us to rely more heavily on historical data although there are 60 gauge stations in the entire volta basin only 20 gauges with sufficiently long periods of historical data were used this may limit our ability to measure all flows accurately in and out of a country as some gauges on tributaries within a country monitor the contribution of tributary flows to mainstems which can indicate an increase decrease inflows within a country and across countries due to monthly data gaps long term seasonal data from the global runoff data center were used with emerging improvements in hydrologic data availability by various international and regional initiatives such as volta hycos we anticipate that future studies could secure updated and high frequency hydrologic data for analysis also the study is limited in terms of including comprehensive sources of water abstraction from the basin due to the difficulty in securing complete data on all irrigation and domestic water use sites both small and large for all riparian countries data from several large irrigation schemes and urban areas in published articles and reports were used the study excluded privately owned small scale irrigation schemes which use about 11 more of basin s water than is used by larger irrigation projects lemoalle and de condappa 2013 estimate the total storage of small reservoirs and dugouts as 232 million cubic meters and these small reservoirs are used for livestock production as well as irrigation command areas greater than 1 ha mainly in the upper and middle parts of the basin by 2009 there were more than 1700 small reservoirs and dugouts in burkina faso and more than 1000 in ghana used for small scale irrigation though many were not functioning efficiently andreini et al 2009a 2009b venot et al 2011 2012 furthermore the impact of land use changes and groundwater on river discharge in the basin were not modelled due to the lack of research grade data another limitation is the difficulty of formulating an accurate and precise economic flood damage function due to a lack of historically reliable flood damage data a mathematical function was specified for the pwalugu gauge downstream of the pmd to approximate the extent of flood flows overtopping the white volta river banks this function was specified to capture flood damages that could be reduced with the pmd through reduced flood flows and reduced damages from those more controlled flows however some tributaries join the white volta below the pwalugu gauge that can also cause flood damage excluded by our model also the model largely relies on empirical hydrologic agronomic and economic relationships with assumptions on some parameters such as the cost per unit irrigated land crop prices cropping patterns energy demand energy prices based on current historical values future studies could explore many modeling extensions further analysis of the implications of changing parameters such as crop prices cropping patterns energy demand and energy prices are profitable endeavors the inclusion of more climate scenarios and infrastructure projects would provide more needed information future studies can be guided by recent data and parameters from empirical surveys that are specific to the various areas of the basin considering a larger population of large medium and small reservoirs small scale water uses and other uses such as mining and industrial water use since industrial water use is anticipated to grow in the basin future research could also profitably take advantage of flood data specific to the flooding areas if available in analysis of flood control potential of reservoirs future work could also develop an expanded basin wide benefits analysis of industries that developed as a result of additional affordable hydropower production in the basin due to reservoir development by considering the consumer surplus associated with reduced power prices compared to existing levels or greater quantities of power that could be available at existing prices this could be achieved by including a hydropower price forecasting function in the hydro economic model for which price would partly be influenced by future hydropower developments including a hydropower price forecasting function in the model could enhance reservoir development policy analysis in the basin despite these limitations of this work it is a first attempt at analyzing the economic performance of a proposed large reservoir development policy in the volta basin guided by basin wide economic well being although our work did not undertake a comprehensive valuation of water use for the environment simplified wet and dry season flow targets that mimic the natural flow regime proposed by mul and gao 2016 was implemented in our model as constraints these target flows could help us to gauge the water use benefits forgone by upstream water users providing the opportunity cost of environmental water use this study has shown the potential for welfare gains for ghana and burkina faso from the development of the pmd with no other riparian country being worse off of course in a transboundary river basin appreciable riparian stakeholder negotiations at the local level and basin wide cooperation are necessary for water resource development produce real mutually beneficial outcomes 5 conclusions current stress from high population growth climate change and variability affecting both the demand and supply of the water resources of the volta river basin increase the importance of discovering and implementing sustainable policies to adapt to this stress with few exceptions most existing studies have focused on assessing technical biological and other various improvements in the basin without explicit economic accounting an important gap in most of the existing literature for the volta basin that integrated hydrologic and economic performance for the basin is lack of policy designs for reducing water related poverty as well as extensive damages from ancient and well documented flooding in various parts of the basin such as flood prone regions in northern ghana this work has addressed some existing gaps in the literature by presenting an original and innovative approach to examine benefits and costs of a new reservoir storage capacity that would be established in a flood prone and economically weak economic region in northern ghana we used a basin scale hydro economic framework accounting for five major water management purposes and all six riparian countries a dynamic optimization model using a fully integrated framework was formulated to link the hydrologic agronomic institutional and economic dimensions of the basin analyzing the impact of additional storage infrastructure development policy results indicate that the development and operation of the additional storage infrastructure have the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana and burkina faso with no loss in benefits to any other riparian results show considerable potential for an actual pareto improvement by which ghana and burkina faso will be better off with the new storage infrastructure than without it and no other riparian country in the basin will be worse off additional storage infrastructure in the flood prone area of the basin in northern ghana carries the potential to store water during seasons and years of high native supply with release for use in dry seasons and dry years reallocating water among seasons and years results show an approach to elevate economic development potential to the volta river basin riparian states in terms increased incomes improved food security job creation and poverty reduction despite our optimistic findings considerable domestic and transboundary stakeholder negotiations and cooperation will be needed to secure the potential

5833,ongoing challenges from population growth and climate stress on the water resources of the volta river basin raise the importance of finding economically sustainable water development and use patterns much research has been conducted on the impacts of water supply fluctuations climate change and population growth on effective economic access to water resources of the basin however no work to date has comprehensively investigated the sustainable economic performance of additional infrastructure development in the basin for handling ongoing challenges of climate water stress at the entire basin scale the original contribution of this work is to investigate the capacity to mitigate poverty from new reservoir storage capacity if established in a flood prone region in northern ghana using a basin scale hydro economic optimization framework while accounting for five major water uses for six riparian countries an integrated approach is formulated to link the hydrologic agronomic institutional and economic dimensions of the basin into a unified framework for policy analysis a dynamic optimization model is developed and applied to discover the level and distribution of economic impacts from the additional storage infrastructure development results indicate the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana and burkina faso with no economic loss to any other riparian from the development and operation of additional storage infrastructure results show considerable potential to secure an actual pareto improvement by which ghana and burkina faso are better off with the new storage infrastructure than without it and no other riparian country in the basin is worse off additional storage infrastructure in the flood prone area of the basin in northern ghana carries the potential to store water during wet seasons and years and release water for use in dry seasons and years reallocating water among seasons and years elevating economic development to the basin s riparian countries despite our optimistic findings considerable stakeholder negotiations and cooperation will be needed to secure the potential welfare gains uncovered keywords optimal growth river basin volta infrastructure poverty mitigation 1 introduction 1 1 background access to water resources of the volta river basin continues to face ongoing stress from high population growth climate change and variability and weak economic capacity to handle water of the wrong quantity quality timing location price and cost methods to address all these dimensions of a water problem have occupied the attention of politicians scientists and water managers in this basin and elsewhere for years booker et al 2012 with only limited success to date an integrated approach to achieve success requires a comprehensive and data driven optimization framework to discover a package of improvements for which the discounted net present value of those improvements is made as high as possible while respecting existing or potential financial hydrologic technical and legal constraints the development as well as practical use of an economically optimized multi sector economic model at a basin scale

remain low income economies amongst the poorest in the world world bank 2019 the causes of water related poverty in the basin s semi arid regions include low agricultural productivity water insecurity rainfall variability poor water access weak capacity to adapt to floods and droughts water related diseases with significant consequences for lives and labor productivity however financial infrastructure and institutional constraints hinder actions to mitigate poverty lemoalle and de condappa 2013 with the basin s population forecast by some scholars to grow at an average rate of about 3 per year the basin s water resources will be under intense stress amisigo et al 2015 kolavalli and williams 2016 van de giesen et al 2001 moreover high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and high potential evapotranspiration limit effective water availability in the semi arid regions amisigo et al 2015 kasei 2010 mccartney et al 2012 given the close link between water scarcity and

floods to reduce water related poverty promote economic growth and advance social improvement dadson et al 2017 climate water stress including increased temperatures and highly erratic rainfall has increased the damages from floods and droughts especially in the middle part southern burkina faso northern ghana northwest togo and northwest benin of the basin conway 2009 kasei et al 2013 2016 mul

the incidence of poverty is higher in the drier upper and middle parts of the basin than the wetter lower regions lemoalle and de condappa 2013 the climate of the basin is strongly influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz which produces a unimodal rainy season with annual rainfall less than 500 mm in the upper basin and between 900 and 1100 mm in the middle basin from late may to early october with peak rainfall occurring in august september as well as bimodal rainy seasons with annual rainfall greater than 1100 mm in the lower basin from mid april to early november with peaks in june july and september october mul et al 2016 rodgers et al 2006 average annual potential open water evaporation ranges between 1350 to 1500 mm in the lower basin 1501 to 2000 mm in the middle basin and 2001 to 2500 mm in the upper basin mul et al 2015 van edig et al 2002 the climate conditions mean that rainfall decreases whereas evaporation increases from the lower to the upper basin which produces more limited water availability in the upper and middle regions of the basin than in its lower reaches the white volta river catchment area in northern ghana is one of the regions in the middle basin where climate water stress has historically contributed to both floods and droughts bond et al 2018 kasei et al 2013 udo et al 2012 climatic conditions in this region have high rainfall and temperature variability causing a corresponding high variability in stream flows with high flows during the wet rainy season and little to no streamflow during the dry season de condappa et al 2009 mul et al 2015 this climate variability has always negatively affected the largely rain fed economy of northern ghana barry et al 2005 bond et al 2018 sidibe et al 2016 even though ghana is the first country in sub saharan africa to meet the first millennium development goal mdg target of halving extreme poverty by 2015 poverty remains endemic in northern ghana due to climate

human demands and those of ecosystems to function effectively based on the gadner outlaw and englaman 1997 threshold a region endowed with less than 1700 m3 of water per capita per year is considered water scarce eguavoen 2007 mul et al 2016 van de giesen et al 2001 2006 in the semi arid upper and middle basin in burkina faso and northern ghana less water is available in the dry seasons and dry years water resources per capita in burkina faso and northern ghana are 900 m3 year and 1200 m3 year respectively lemoalle and de condappa 2013 economic water scarcity occurs when inadequate infrastructure and financial institutional capacity limits people from accessing the water they need affordably and at the time they need it a weakness of effective water infrastructure to satisfy growing demand due to high population growth gives rise to economic scarcity as a significant problem for the basin s communities mul et al 2016 the 1992 completion and operation of the bagre dam on the white volta river in southern burkina faso upstream of the burkina faso ghana border fig 1 has altered the flow and use patterns of the white volta river in northern ghana historically reduced flow of the river in dry periods has been replaced by a more steady flow regime of 30 40 m3 s mul and gao 2016 mul et al 2018 since hydropower production in burkina faso is historically low the bagre dam with an installed hydropower capacity of 16 mw and a potential irrigated area of 30 000 ha with 3300 ha currently developed is operated to increase hydropower production and food production from downstream irrigation as part of a larger agro industrial project the bagre growth pole project mul et al 2018 although the bagre dam has contributed to elevated flows in dry seasons in northern ghana there have been incidents of flooding in wet seasons since its construction and operation because of its limited size to contain flood flows this has historically caused significant flood damages in northern ghana armah et al 2010 bond et al 2018 evidence shows that about 22 of the inflow into the bagre dam is spilled annually mul et al 2018 however during the peak flow period usually august september historically more than 80 of the inflow into the dam is spilled mul et al 2018 bagre spillage combined with heavy localized rainfall concentrating in tributaries joining the white volta river catchment in northern ghana causes downstream flooding with the channel overtopping its banks kasei et al 2016 udo et al 2012 flooding has historically reached up to 1 km or 0 62 miles inland balana et al 2016 for instance in 2018 flooding in northern ghana caused by long term heavy rainfall combined with water releases from the bagre dam led to the death of 34 displacement of over 100 000

houses property and the death of 29 in northern ghana ifrc 2019 institutionally the basin is characterized by weakly coordinated policies and development initiatives among riparian countries even though individual states have established some active national water institutions ampomah et al 2016 bond et al 2018 with the establishment of a basin agency the volta basin authority vba which began operation in 2009 the countries are attempting to forge a transboundary institutional cooperative framework to guide future water use patterns for the basin meanwhile ghana and burkina faso have increased their collaboration resulting in burkina faso supplying two weeks notice every year before the start of bagre dam spillage in late august to early september in anticipation of reducing flood damages and casualties in northern ghana obrecht and mead 2014 to limit flood damages and casualties mitigate water related poverty promote agricultural growth and economic development in northern ghana the government of ghana has proposed a development plan for constructing the pwalugu multipurpose dam pmd on the white volta river in the upper east region of ghana downstream of the bagre dam in burkina faso the highly publicized groundbreaking sod cutting for this project occurred on november 29 2019 the total cost of the entire hydro solar hybrid project is estimated at us 993 million with the dam construction and its related hydropower and downstream irrigation components expected to cost about us 938 million government of ghana 2019 the policy objective of the pmd project is to reduce the level and costs of water scarcity and floods make water available in the face of climate stress and meet the water demands of the increasing population in the white volta catchment of northern ghana in basins where there is high outflow to sinks such as seas and saline aquifers during high flow periods and limited discharge to sinks during low flow periods storing and reallocating water among seasons and years could potentially lead to significant increases in the economic performance of the water system eguavoen and mccartney 2013 keller et al 2000 mccartney et al 2012 2013 1 2 previous work numerous investigations have been conducted for transboundary river basin management to address issues of water related conflict and poverty existing works have found that water scarcity is experienced by one third of the world s population due to weak institutions limited water infrastructure development increasing population growing water demand climate change and urbanization who 2015 some works have found that with climate change and the existing water infrastructure in the volta river basin only 86 of the water demand in the basin will be met by 2050 with reductions to 52 by 2100 andah et al 2003 mccartney et al 2012 lower rainfall amounts in the volta basin over the years due to longer dry seasons have led to more tributaries as well as mainstem rivers facing considerably reduced native supplies leading to reduced surface water available for the increasing population andah et al 2003 water scarcity in the volta basin as a result of climate water stress has the potential for elevated future conflict between riparian countries kolavalli and williams 2016 several efforts have used various basin scale models such as the water evaluation and planning waep system amisigo et al 2015 andah et al 2003 de condappa et al 2008 friesen et al 2005 and the soil and water assessment tool swat awotwi et al 2015 sood et al 2013 to assess the impact of climate variability and land management practices on water allocation in the volta basin these studies often find that with climate change continued upper basin storage development that causes even modest flow reductions in ghana s lake volta in the lower basin reduces power generation capacity in ghana de condappa et al 2008 mccartney et al 2012 however using the joint climate hydrological modeling approach meteorological model mm5 and water flow and balancesimulationmodel wasim eth to assess the impact of the development of small and medium scale reservoirs in the upper part of the volta basin on downstream lake volta leemhuis et al 2009 concluded that the impact of upper basin reservoir development on the water storage of lake volta is marginal compared to their benefits in securing food production and livestock improvement during the dry season the authors found that evaporation losses of lake volta are three times higher than the mean annual storage losses due to small and medium scale reservoir development upstream of the lake storage infrastructure expansion can promote economic development however there is a need to find better ways to plan build and operate dams and related reservoirs to minimize their negative impact on society and the environment chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 regions facing economic water scarcity can develop infrastructure to store water in times of high flows and release it for use in times of reduced water flow however with transboundary basins uncoordinated storage infrastructure development policies may result in conflict amisigo 2005 some work has been done to integrate climate hydrology agronomy institutions and economics of the volta basin for example a 2004 investigation analyzed the profitability of allocating the basin s water to irrigated agriculture urban water supply and hydropower production using existing infrastructure for burkina faso and ghana obeng asiedu 2004 that work aimed to establish a rigorous decision support system dss for water resources management of the volta river basin rodgers et al 2006 some investigations have used reservoir optimization models to analyze tradeoffs between economic social and environmental costs and benefits of multipurpose dam reservoir operation bejarano et al 2019 huang et al 2019 wu and chen 2013 while other works have used hydro economic optimization models to analyze the implication of integrating climate change impacts into water storage development planning accounting for the degree of economic interdependence in transboundary river basins jeuland 2010 lauri et al 2012 wu et al 2013 other works have found that storage infrastructure development and operation in transboundary river basins improve basin wide economic welfare habteyes et al 2015 jalilov et al 2013 2016 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008a 2008b it is against this background that the present investigation seeks to examine potential basin wide economic effects of the new pmd infrastructure development in the flood prone northern ghana part of the volta basin accounting for five major water management purposes and all riparian countries by way of an integrated water management framework 1 3 gaps contribution objectives while attempts at establishing scientifically rigorous framework to guide policy choices in the volta basin are still ongoing most existing studies investigating volta basin improvements have assessed technical biological and other non economic impacts of various improvements in the basin de condappa et al 2008 leemhuis et al 2009 mccartney et al 2012 ndehedehe et al 2017 okyereh et al 2019 sood et al 2013 despite some excellent investigations these works typically lack economic information that could be used to improve the overall system economic performance of improvements at the basin scale bharati et al 2008 leemhuis et al 2009 sood et al 2013 despite the availability of several published works in this basin most have shown limited economic content however one early significant economic contribution from 2004 did successfully integrate hydrologic and economic performance obeng asiedu 2004 while the obeng asiedu 2004 investigation broke new ground for the kind of basin scale optimization work for which there had long been a need in the volta basin it left untouched some important dimensions of policy analytic capacity for the basin it did not attempt to address the economic benefits of flood control or environmental improvements or the benefits and costs of new reservoir storage capacity expansion ghana and burkina faso entered into a series of negotiations about reducing seasonal flooding in northern ghana however no economically effective policies have been implemented to reduce the considerable historical damages from a long history of flooding no peer reviewed work to date has systematically investigated policy designs for reducing extensive damages from long standing and well documented flooding in various parts of the basin such as some flood prone regions in northern ghana despite its excellence the obeng asiedu 2004 work analyzed only two of the basin s six countries ghana and burkina faso in light of the above existing achievements as well as gaps in the literature the original contribution of this work to the literature is to investigate the capacity to mitigate water poverty from new reservoir storage capacity that would be established in a flood prone region in northern ghana using a basin scale hydro economic optimization framework this investigation s originality comes from its accounting for the potential to mitigate poverty through the discovery of detailed changes in water quantity timing location and price from the development of new reservoir capacity five water management purposes in the basin with special attention devoted to a comprehensive treatment of flood damage control water uses for all six riparian countries impacts of climate water stress 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area the volta basin figs 1 and 2 has five main tributaries black white red oti and lower volta tributaries the black volta river known as mouhoun in burkina faso originates from southwest burkina faso flows northwards to meet the sourou river from mali and then flows southwards in burkina faso becomes a burkina faso ghana border as well as a border for burkina faso côte d ivoire ghana the river then flows eastwards in ghana and meet the white volta river before discharging into lake volta in ghana the white volta river known as nakambe in burkina faso and its main tributary the red volta river known as nazinon in burkina faso originate from northern and central burkina faso flow across the burkina faso ghana border and meet in northern ghana the river then flows southwards and meets the black volta river before draining into lake volta the oti river known as pendjari in benin originates from northwest benin becomes benin burkina faso border and then burkina faso togo border where it meets the oualé river from burkina faso the river then flows east to west downwards across togo then becomes togo ghana border meeting other tributaries from togo and then flows southwards in ghana before discharging into lake volta the lower volta tributaries e g daka and pru rivers originate in ghana and flow into lake volta the main tributaries of the basin contribute to water supplies the black volta river 23 the white volta river and its red volta tributary 23 and the oti river 37 while the other tributaries of the lower volta in ghana contributes 17 goes 2005 burkina faso has the largest share of the basin s 158 300 square miles land area with 42 ghana has 40 5 share of the basin area followed by togo with 6 4 mali with 4 2 benin with 3 8 and côte d ivoire with 3 1 of basin areas kolavalli and williams 2016 the akosombo dam was constructed on the lower volta river in 1965 about 62 miles from the sea to form lake volta which is the biggest artificial lake in the world in terms of area with an area of 3287 square miles 4 of ghana s land area and a length of about 240 mi the dam and the lake support ghana s industrial fishing tourism and agricultural industries and highly depend on flows from upstream countries thus ghana seeks more nearly constant inflows to lake volta from upstream countries historical evidence show that whenever the water level of the lake drops it produces a reduction in power generation leading to power outages in ghana undermining economic development outcomes despite considerable efforts at their implementation johnston and mccartney 2010 leemhuis et al 2009 lemoalle and de condappa 2013 the white volta river sub basin area in northern ghana where the new pmd is planned faces high climate water stress the catchment area has a wet season from late may to early october with 80 of rain occurring between july and september and a dry season from mid october to mid may with a mean rainfall of 39 in 990 6 mm per year and a mean potential evaporation of 2 0 034 m per year kadyampakeni et al 2017 kasei et al 2013 mul et al 2016 northern ghana has low rainfall and high potential evaporation whereas southern ghana has high precipitation and low potential evaporation the streamflow in the white volta river follows the wet and dry seasonal pattern and varies considerably from year to year with the peak flows occurring on an annual basis in august september typically overtopping river banks kasei et al 2016 mul and gao 2016 fig 2 s schematic shows several important river gauges as well as agricultural and urban water diversions and use nodes it also shows existing tributaries of the basin river flow measuring gauges urban domestic water use areas and irrigated areas along the rivers of the basin in each of the six riparian countries also shown are the major existing dams and reservoirs as well as the new pmd a reservoir mass balance of the hydrology of the volta river basin was used as a foundation to configure the geometry and network of the flow of the rivers of the volta basin in the construction of an economic optimization model implemented using the general algebraic modelling system gams development corporation 2019 detailed model documentation is in the mathematical appendix 2 2 data the hydrologic data used in this study are observed historical average seasonal wet and dry discharge from the global runoff data center grdc 2019 headwater supply is characterized by two climate scenarios historical flow and climate stressed flow the historical flow scenario reflects stochastic inflows matching the historically observed mean water runoff data provided by the global runoff data center grdc 2019 the climate stressed flow water supply scenario reflects similar stochastic supplies for a uniform 30 reduction in runoff compared to the historical flow scenario this assumption is based on the study by mahé et al 2013 who showed that on average in west african basins a reduction in rainfall by 10 reduces streamflow by 30 the assumption is supported by existing studies finding that small changes in precipitation can lead to proportionately larger changes in runoff kasei 2010 roudier et al 2014 environmental flow data were secured from mul and gao 2016 historically observed irrigated land in production crop et crop price data were sourced from mccartney et al 2012 unep gef volta project 2013 mul et al 2015 van der schaaf 2008 and fao 2012 historically the most important crops irrigated in the basin are rice legumes e g cowpea beans and groundnuts and vegetables e g tomatoes onions pepper okra lettuce cabbage and sweet potatoes burkina faso and ghana use the basin s water to irrigate rice vegetables and legumes whereas benin togo mali and côte d ivoire use the basin s water to irrigate rice mul et al 2015 unep gef volta project 2013 van der schaaf 2008 urban water price data were sourced from dwumfour asare et al 2014 and onea 2019 urban population and household data were sourced from unep gef volta project 2013 installed hydropower capacities and dam reservoir characteristics such as dam height storage capacity surface area depth power prices and estimated dam reservoir project costs of the pmd were sourced from the volta river authority 2014 energy commission of ghana

emerge from irrigated agriculture hydropower production domestic urban water supply recreational use from boating fishing hiking photography and other related tourism activities and riverine flood damage reduction irrigated agriculture benefits are valued as net revenue crop price multiplied by yield minus cost of production multiplied by hectares in production hydropower gross benefits are measured as the price of electricity multiplied by the quantity produced in the current implementation of the model electricity prices were set to 2019 observed average levels reduced power prices from additional hydropower production due to water availability will raise consumer surplus and for a region like the volta basin with limited access to electricity increases in consumer surplus are economically and politically important to achieve urban water supply benefits measure consumer surplus from urban water use recreation benefits depend on a reservoir storage volume the flood damage function tracks the cost of flood damages based on flood stage multiplied by a known assessed value of the flooded land for which any river s flood stage is unknown until an optimization occurs the main goals of integrated water resources management economic efficiency distributional justice and sustainability are three important principles that guide this study 2 3 1 economic efficiency this work investigated alternative water allocations for irrigated agriculture domestic urban water supply hydropower production flood control and reservoir based recreation over space and time aimed at maximizing basin wide benefits for all users possible with available financial institutional technical hydrologic and environmental constraints mathematical appendix for details riverine flood damage reduction in the white volta river sub basin catchment in northern ghana was included as a significant and economically important benefit in the objective function briscoe 2011 2 3 2 distributional justice distributional justice in water management for this work is achieved in a way to protect an adequate access to water necessary to sustain water access for the marginalized and poor hutton 2013 one example of distributional justice is the achievement of safe and affordable access to water as well as the right of all users to the benefits gained from the use of water for basic needs ofori et al 2016 the present work defines distributional justice as water allocations in the face of climate stressed water supplies that ensure access to adequate water by all water users in our basin it is achieved in this paper by using a series of mathematical constraints mathematical appendix for details facing climate stressed water supplies dry areas in the basin especially burkina faso and northern ghana would have with the proposed infrastructure improved access to all water uses including environmental flow constraints due to the experience of negative effects of large dams on downstream ecosystem services such as flood recession farming fishing livestock production and drinking water supply in the basin environmental flow targets have been recommended by some scholars to be included in cost benefit analysis in the design and construction of new dam storage capacity mul and gao 2016 the implementation of environmental flows is beneficial to the basin s riparian communities mul and gao 2016 in the absence of research grade ecological data on which to base our minimum environmental flows that mimic the natural flow regime proposed by mul and gao 2016 simplified wet and dry season flow targets were implemented in our model to ensure the efficient operation of the pmd and safeguard fresh water dependent ecosystems as well as indigenous water dependent culture these target flows would help us to gauge the water use benefits forgone by upstream water users providing the opportunity cost of environmental water use 2 3 3 sustainability a sustainable policy produces lasting outcomes sustainable water management requires that adequate water allocation is made to sustain the natural functioning of the ecosystem such as maintenance of wetlands wildlife refuges and river flows for cultural purposes the study implements a sustainability goal by way of setting lower bounds on the sustainable use of water resources as well as sustained ecosystem stability and resilience the study also implements a sustainability goal for the major reservoirs in the basin where a constraint is established which requires that reservoir storage must be at least at their initial level in the last year and last season of the 20 year planning period this approach avoids a system management plan that depletes reservoir stocks in the last period effectively protecting the starting period supply for future generations mathematical appendix for details 2 4 integrated basin scale framework the basin scale analysis treats the entire volta river basin as an integrated unit the integrated method is formulated to bring the hydrology agronomy environment economics and institutions of the basin into a unified framework for policy analysis the volta basin hydro economic optimization model is formulated as a nonlinear dynamic constrained optimization problem with a twice a year seasonal time step the model discovers the seasonal pattern of water allocation that maximizes system wide economic benefits in present value terms from irrigated agriculture hydropower production urban water withdrawals recreation and riverine flood control using the grdc data on historical water supplies entering the basin the constrained optimization framework was developed using gams software gams development corporation 2019 this software and its economic optimization capabilities were developed and applied with special consideration given to local and regional conditions to discover water uses and allocations that secure maximum net economic benefits consistent with both existing and new storage infrastructure and historical as well as climate stressed water supplies the model structure contains two food crops grains and vegetables grown in 45 irrigation areas and 17 urban water supply areas across the six riparian countries containing a total of 62 water diversion points and 12 dams reservoirs single purpose and multi purpose with storage capacities greater than 90 million cubic meters and 20 river gauges water diversion points are distributed across the basin 2 in southeast mali 18 in burkina faso 2 in northwest benin 2 in northeast côte d ivoire 2 in northwest togo and 36 in ghana table appendix for details fig 2 shows the location of some of the dams reservoirs river gauges and diversion points environmental flow constraints were implemented in the model by setting minimum flow levels at selected gauges in the basin mathematical appendix to assure that the basin s water is used to support the freshwater ecosystem and the services provided by the ecosystem the model takes into consideration the economic importance of irrigated agriculture hydropower production urban water supply reservoir based recreation and riverine flood reduction the objective of the integrated model is implemented by discovering the maximized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over all water uses water management purposes years seasons within years riparian countries climate water supply scenarios and reservoir development policy plans subject to a number of hydrologic agronomic institutional environmental and economic constraints the model calculates economic benefits by type of water use management purpose season climate water supply and reservoir development policy scenarios and water users the model also optimizes irrigated land in production irrigation water use hydropower production urban water use recreation reservoir storage volumes and flood damages avoided mathematical appendix for details 3 results 3 1 overview results from our investigation presented in more detail below reveal findings that carry several headline messages the development and operation of the pmd on the white volta river carry the potential to produce a pareto improving outcome if operated efficiently it could make upstream burkina faso and downstream ghana better off and no other riparian needs to be worse off with the pmd compared to without it due to the interdependence among rivers of the volta basin and ghana s lake volta pmd s additional storage capacity has the potential to augment flows to lake volta it also could relieve upstream countries of the responsibility wished by ghana to deliver increased flows to ghana in dry seasons and dry years the economic value of irrigated agricultural production of burkina faso and northern ghana has the potential to increase in the face of better timed water application to irrigated dry season agriculture as a consequence of the reservoir regulating capacity of the pmd complementing burkina faso s bagre dam particularly under a climate stressed setting pmd s large additional storage capacity would complement the bagre dam s capacity allowing burkinabe s bagre growth pole irrigation project to optimally divert more water for its expansion while pmd s releases offer opportunity for irrigation expansion in ghana and flow augmentation to ghana s lake volta overall the total economic benefits of irrigated agriculture for each riparian country is higher in the historical flow scenario compared to the climate stressed flow scenario with or without the pmd yet remarkably increases in national farm income for burkina faso and ghana are higher with the pmd than without it under the climate stressed scenario compared to the increases in farm income under the historical flow scenario the pmd if managed efficiently has the potential to increase total basin wide discounted total national irrigation farm income by 26 under the historical flow scenario and 50 under the climate stressed flow scenario due to its storage greater water scarcity increases the agricultural benefits of measures to reduce that scarcity ghana has the potential to produce on average 128 gwh of hydropower per year with the pmd under the historical flow scenario and 93 gwh of hydropower per year under climate stressed flow scenario than without the pmd the addition of the pmd in the volta basin is predicted to provide an annual average net addition i e with pmd minus without pmd of 83 gwh and 26gwh of hydropower to the total hydropower generation of ghana which may put ghana in a better position to continue to supply electricity to neighboring burkina faso togo benin and other west african countries the development and operation of the pmd offer the potential to reduce the frequency of flooding downstream of the pwalugu gauge typically occasioned by heavy downpours and perennially compounded by the annual spillage of upstream burkina faso s bagre dam that have for decades caused considerable damages to people and property the dam if built and operated efficiently is predicted to potentially reduce average annual total flood damages by 78 the pmd if effectively managed has the potential to release environmental flows and contribute to sustaining downstream ecosystems by moderating the releases from the upstream bagre dam the basin wide total net water related economic benefits harnessed by the pmd project are up to 32 higher with the dam compared to without it for the historical flow scenario and up to 7 higher for the climate stressed flow scenario additional details are presented below 3 2 water 3 2 1 headwater flows table 1 shows synthesized flows for the five main headwater sources of the volta river basin applied to the volta basin hydro economic model these sources include the black volta river the white volta river and its major tributary the red volta river as well as the oti river and lower volta river tributaries these synthesized flows replicate the season to season mean and variance of observed supplies from the data sources described above at those five sources for the historical flow climate scenario as well as replicating 70 of historical flows described above in table 1 as well as the other tables the abbreviation wo dam stands for basin optimization with only existing dams without the pmd and wi dam stands for basin optimization with existing dams plus the pmd headwater supplies in the volta basin are identical with and without the pmd since except for limited micro climate effects building dams are expected to have no significant effect on headwater supplies into the volta river system 3 2 2 gauged streamflow table 2 shows optimized stream flows by river gauge sub basin climate water supply scenario reservoir development policy scenario and season averaged over a 20 year planning period the flows are shown only for a 20 year average because of space constraints full season by season optimized predicted flows are available from the authors upon request these optimized stream flows are shown and numbered for 20 gauges along the mainstem and major tributary locations of the volta river basin system table 2 and fig 2 for details international river gauges on the borders of benin and burkina faso gauge 11 burkina faso and togo gauge 12 burkina faso côte d ivoire and ghana gauges 3 and 4 burkina faso and ghana gauges 6 and 7 and togo and ghana gauge 13 are shown in fig 2 the international gauges indicate transboundary flows how much water flows into and out of each country and the impact of upstream country s water diversion use on the downstream country while there are 60 gauging stations in the entire volta basin benarrrosh and tumbulto 2010 only 20 were reliable enough to be used in the model based on the frequency of long term flow data and consistency with previous studies goes 2005 mccartney et al 2012 using only 20 limits our ability to measure all flows into and out of a country accurately under alternative as well as current policies nonetheless with the incorporation of water withdrawal data of each riparian country in our model s hydrologic balance framework the gauges used could give some idea of the impact of any upstream water withdrawal on downstream points for example on the black volta river the impact of water withdrawal in mali and burkina faso on water availability in ghana is measured by gauges 3 and 4 likewise on the white volta river the impact of burkina faso s water withdrawal on water availability in ghana is measured by gauges 6 and 7 also on the oti river the impact of benin s withdrawal on burkina faso is measured by gauge 11 burkina faso on togo gauge 12 and impacts water withdrawal of benin burkina faso and togo on ghana is measured by gauge 13 fig 2 reductions in river flow between any two gauges indicate net quantities of water depleted by water users in the river reach between the gauges net depletions are irrigated agriculture and urban water supply diversions minus return flows that make it back to the river subsequent to diversions the dependence on irrigated agriculture is growing in the volta basin though at a slow pace with sowing and growing of mostly rice legume and vegetable crops within the dry season fao 2012 2014 sidibe et al 2016 irrigation systems e g burkina faso s bagre and ghana s pwalugu irrigation projects have been developed downstream of the bagre dam and the pmd respectively the non consumptive water use of the hydropower plants will be diverted for agricultural use irrigation and hydropower water demand occur mostly in the dry season with virtually no irrigation water demand in the wet season our model s optimization results reflect the changes in water demand for hydropower and irrigated agriculture in the basin that would occur with the pmd the pmd s operation is optimized such that increases in hydropower demand and irrigated crop water demand in the dry season support complementary releases for both purposes however with the akosombo dam depending on flows from upstream uses in northern ghana and upstream riparian countries to generate hydropower flow reduction from the white volta black volta and oti rivers due to upstream agricultural urban diversion may reduce the dam s hydropower generation table 2 presents important messages about the development and the operation of the pmd on both downstream and upstream gauged flows as well as the overall streamflow pattern of the entire basin the table shows that with the pmd streamflow will be significantly influenced by the reservoir storage impounded by the pmd reallocating the volta basin stocks and flows especially along the white volta river with the pmd built discounted net present value of economic benefits are optimized while respecting the constraint that each country receives at least as much water related economic benefit with the pmd as without it while also respecting important hydrological environmental and institutional constraints governing water use with the pmd the politically constrained optimized reservoir operation produces a pareto improvement for which management of the pmd would attenuate high flood peaks by partially storing flood waves in its reservoir the constrained optimized reservoir operation requires that the accumulation of water stocks during the wet season build up a high reservoir storage volume and associated higher head for hydropower production and downstream irrigation this discussion shows but a partial reflection of a very large number of moving parts in our model of the volta basin and the complex array of interdependent policy choices facing the basin s managers operating the pmd to build up storage model optimized pmd reservoir releases take place largely in the dry season for joint energy and irrigated agricultural production in northern ghana while ensuring minimum environmental flows high releases of water occur in the dry period to generate more hydroelectric power to satisfy increased domestic demands for cooling in the warming scenario while making water available on demand for irrigation farming the pmd is optimized to augment the upstream bagre dam to avoid additional flows released to downstream northern ghana during the dry season while ensuring that perennial spillage of the bagre dam historically observed most wet seasons will be captured by the pmd reducing devastating costs of periodic floods that have historically struck the region periodically the reduction in the release of water from bagre dam to northern ghana in the dry season is protecting water availability for the downstream burkina faso s celebrated bagre growth pole project with the potential for elevating agriculture productivity and other agro industrial activities table 2 shows that burkina faso s flow to ghana at the bagre gauge gauge 6 falls in the dry season with the pmd compared to without it implying more capacity for irrigation water diversions for burkina faso s irrigation project even though the pmd is planned for location on the white volta river in the middle basin in northern ghana the interdependence among the streamflow gauges in ghana takes on some importance the optimized operation of the downstream akosombo dam would be affected by the operation of the pmd s addition to system storage capacity table 2 shows that due to wet season flows captured in the pmd optimized inflows to lake volta will be reduced however dry season releases for hydropower has the potential to increase lake volta s dry season inflows despite irrigation withdrawal for the irrigation scheme below the pwalugu gauge all system reservoirs store water in wet seasons and release it for use in dry seasons enhancing dry season flows and raising the total economic value of water the model optimization gives insights into the importance of timed water flows released from the pmd and existing reservoirs increasing water related economic benefits in dry seasons 3 3 irrigation water use and land in production table 3 shows optimized water use and irrigated land in production by country sub basin crop policy and climate scenario average over 20 years under the hydrological institutional constrained optimization mali is predicted to optimally use a seasonal average of 81 09 million cubic meters of water from the volta river system to irrigate 9050 ha of grain crops under the historical flow scenario both with and without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario mali would use 56 76 million cubic meters to irrigate 6340 ha both with and without the pmd benin is predicted to optimally use a seasonal average of 26 73 million cubic meters of water from the basin to irrigate 2930 ha of grain crops under the historical flow scenario with and without the pmd while water use and irrigated hectares are reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario the model optimization shows togo and côte d ivoire using seasonal averages of 26 3 million and 31 5 million cubic meters to irrigate 2920 and 3440 ha of grain crops both with and without the pmd however water use and land irrigated would be reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario as grains are the lowest valued crops and would be the first to drop out of production in a climate stressed flow scenario based on available data mali benin togo and côte d ivoire have not historically used volta system waters for vegetable irrigation unep gef volta project 2013 this finding carries significant implications for the economic value of measures to food security in west africa as in other places where food secure irrigation depends on highly fluctuating surface water supplies the table shows burkina faso predicted to use a seasonal average of 212 5 million cubic meters of water from the basin system to irrigate 24 280 ha of grain crops and 203 46 million cubic meters to irrigate 32 710 ha of vegetable crops under the historical flow scenario both with and without the pmd burkina faso s irrigation water use and land in production are predicted by the model s optimization to decrease under the climate stressed flow scenario however with the pmd irrigated grain land would increase from 5760 to 20 790 ha with a seasonal average of 180 43 million cubic meters of water with the pmd while irrigated vegetable hectares would increase by about 12 with pmd under the historical flow scenario without the pmd ghana is predicted to optimally use on average 43 79 million and 220 83 million cubic meters of water seasonally to grow 4730 and 38 710 ha of grain and vegetable crops respectively which carries important implications for food security however with the pmd 14 730 and 48 710 ha of grain and vegetable crops is predicted to be grown with seasonal average water use of 133 79 and 279 63 million cubic meters ghana s total crop production would fall slightly under the climate stressed flow scenario since most large irrigation sites in ghana are in the wet areas of the lower volta basin 3 4 hydropower 3 4 1 reservoir storage table 4 shows hydro reservoir storage volumes and associated power production by country sub basin reservoir policy and climate water supply scenario averaged over 20 years results show that the bagre reservoir upstream of the pmd on the white volta river is optimized to store an average of 1610 million cubic meters without the pmd and 1529 million cubic meters with the pmd in the wet season june to october in burkina faso under the historical flow scenario however this optimized policy would store more water in the bagre reservoir in the dry season with the pmd than without it this occurs because more water under the optimized policy needs to be released for hydropower and irrigation downstream of the bagre which requires less water stored at that reservoir under the climate stressed supply scenario the kompienga dam on the ouale river a tributary of the oti river is predicted to optimally store more water due to its large capacity and release for hydropower generation with the pmd the kompienga reservoir would optimally hold more water storage and make available releases for power production under the climate stressed flow scenario the bui reservoir in ghana but upstream of lake volta is predicted to store optimally an average of 6610 million cubic meters without the pmd and 6607 million cubic meters with the pmd under the historical flow scenario during the wet season but storage would fall under the climate stressed flow scenario due to water releases for hydropower generation while also supplying the downstream bui irrigation scheme like the kompienga reservoir the bui reservoir will have higher optimized storage with the pmd compared to without it the pmd would optimally carry low storage volumes before the wet season so that it can capture flood flows on average the pmd will store 1858 and 1313 cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons under the historical flow scenario storage falls to 1351 and 540 cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons respectively under the climate stressed flow scenario due to water releases for use the dam would release water for hydropower and downstream irrigation in the dry season producing lower storage in the dry season which also means that more water would be captured in the wet season the optimization process uncovered an economic advantage for pmd managers to capture more floodwaters coming from localized rainfall and spillage from the upstream bagre dam in the wet season while attenuating high flood peaks by partially storing flood flows in the pmd reservoir a closer look at table 4 shows that the trends in the pmd filling process throughout the 20 years will have no significant effect on upstream bagre dam with little impact on downstream akosombo dam and its lake volta pmd will store more water in the wet season and release it for hydropower and downstream irrigation use in the dry season thus the upstream bagre dam can release more water in the wet season with the pmd since the pmd will capture those high wet season flows an advantage of the pmd to burkina faso is that as bagre dam managers release water for hydropower in the dry season water released for the turbines can be used to expand irrigation for the bagre growth pole irrigation project since pmd releases can also be used for ghana s pwalugu irrigation project the storing of added water by the pmd in the wet season will also reduce the storage in lake volta in that season with the pmd however lake volta as a byproduct would secure more inflow and storage in the climate stressed flow scenario when the pmd releases water for hydropower production and irrigation downstream results also indicate that lake volta the largest artificial reservoir in the world based on surface area is predicted to store on average 145 353 and 145 452 million cubic meters of water with and without the pmd in the wet season respectively it would also store 131 745 and 131 729 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the dry season respectively however optimized water storage in that reservoir is predicted to fall to 143 427 and 142 929 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the wet season whereas storage would optimally increase to 136 322 and 134 958 million cubic meters with and without the pmd in the dry season under the climate stressed flow scenario it is worthy of note that lake volta would gain more inflows to increase storage for use during the dry season with the pmd compared to without the pmd respectively under the climate stressed flow scenario compared to the historical flow scenario the kpong reservoir downstream of lake volta which stores water behind a run of the river power plant is optimally predicted to maintain its volume at 200 million cubic meters in the wet and dry seasons under both historical and climate stressed flow scenarios however the upstream hydro reservoirs are estimated to optimally hold a smaller percentage of their designed capacity than the lake volta and kpong reservoir due to evaporation loses and low rainfall owing to their location in the semi arid upper and middle parts of the basin 3 4 2 hydropower production table 4 also summarizes optimized outputs from the power plants of the basin s hydro reservoirs the table summarizes the results of hydropower production for the four hydro dams in ghana as well as the two hydro dams in burkina faso by climate headwater supply scenario the four dams in ghana have far higher installed capacities than the two dams in burkina faso the akosombo power plant of the basin s largest reservoir which impounds lake volta has the highest installed capacity of 1020 mw followed by the bui power plant with 400 mw and the kpong power plant with 160 mw the power plant of the new pmd is estimated to have 60 mw of installed capacity the bagre and kompienga power plants in burkina faso have 16 mw and 14 mw installed capacities respectively considering the capacities of the power plants in the model the results of electricity generation from the model are shown in the table results indicate that the optimized electricity generation from the akosombo dam would be 5165 gwh per year without the pmd and 5127 gwh per year with the pmd under the historical flow climate scenario on the other hand the akosombo dam is estimated to generate 3425 gwh per year without the pmd and 3370 gwh per year with the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario a minimum hydropower of 545 gwh per year under climate stressed flow scenario and a maximum of 814 gwh per year under historical flow climate scenario is forecast for the bui dam by the model optimization with the pmd while the optimized hydropower generation from the kpong dam is 934 and 941 gwh per year with and without pmd under the historical flow scenario as well as 607 and 618 gwh with and without pwd under the climate stressed flow scenario respectively table 4 also shows that the bagre dam is forecast to generate 72 and 63 gwh per year with and without the pmd under historical flow scenario and 39 and 34 gwh per year with and without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario while the kompienga dam is estimated to generate 29 gwh per year and 17 gwh per year whether with or without the pmd under the historical flow and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively results show that climate water stress will reduce the electricity generation output of the power plants because of the reduced flow of water as predicted by the optimization model however power generation at akosombo and kpong plants will fall only slightly with the pmd compared to without it the reason for the reduction in average inflow into lake volta is likely water loss through evaporation at the surface of the new pmd reservoir and through water diversion for the development of irrigated agriculture downstream of the pmd nonetheless the addition of the pmd to the hydropower generation capacities of ghana carries the potential to produce an annual average net addition i e with pmd minus without pmd of 83 gwh and 26 gwh of power to ghana s energy mix even with water withdrawal for the 20 000 ha of irrigated land below the pmd under the historical flow and climate stressed flow scenarios 3 5 economics 3 5 1 countries sectors climate scenarios and policies table 5 shows economic performance for all countries sectors and climate scenarios with and without the pmd the table shows farm income urban water supply economic benefit flood control benefits hydropower benefits recreation benefit and dam construction costs by country water supply scenario and reservoir development policy scenario the economic benefits from various water use with and without the pmd varies from season to season throughout the 20 year forecast period the value of flood damages avoided with and without the pmd also varies from season to season throughout the forecast period table 5 presents discounted net economic benefits summed over wet and dry seasons by country water use sectors climate headwater supply and dam development policy scenarios a detailed description of results for irrigated agriculture urban water supply and hydropower follows without a special discussion of recreation or flood control to conserve space despite the importance of both 3 5 2 irrigated agriculture farm production and income carry significant implications for food security in all the basin s countries for mali potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of rice crop is predicted at a total discounted value of 57 million and 40 million over the forecast period with and without the pmd under historical flow and climate stressed flow water supply scenarios respectively as the dam would carry little direct agricultural sector impact to that country for the case of burkina faso potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of grain rice and legumes and vegetable crops are an optimized discounted total of 380 million over the forecast period with and without the pmd under the historical flow scenario noticeably optimized farm income falls to a discounted total of 335 million with pmd and 231 million without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario although potential farm income falls for burkina faso in the climate stressed setting it falls by less with the pmd than without it with the pmd there is an optimized estimated 45 increase in farm income arising from the pmd s capacity to complement storage at the bagre this complementarity comes from the fact that the bagre dam releases in the climate stressed scenario need not be sent to ghana if the pmd storage is in place bagre dam releases would therefore increase water availability for burkina faso s irrigation scheme downstream of the bagre dam producing a potential increase in burkina faso s national farm income with the pmd for benin togo and côte d ivoire potential total national farm income that could be earned from the dry season irrigation of rice crop is predicted by our optimization exercise to be a discounted total of 24 million 20 million and 22 million respectively over the forecast period with and without the pmd under the historical flow scenario and 17 million 14 million and 16 million under the climate stressed flow scenario with and without the pmd it is important to note that no country in the volta basin needs to experience a reduction in its total national farm income from optimally operating the river system as a result of the development of the pmd based on the results of our optimization model that mathematically constrained farm income for every country to never be lower with the pmd than without it burkina faso is forecast to gain national farm income with the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario these findings provide evidence that the presence and operation of the pmd can be pareto improving as it can be managed to avoid adverse impact on the riparian countries all five other riparian countries sharing the basin with ghana are in the upstream parts of the basin with respect to ghana potential farm income that could be earned with the pmd is predicted to be a discounted total of 552 million and 549 million under historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively without the pmd the model predicts ghana s potential national farm income to be a discounted total of 336 million and 329 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively the results let us conclude that pmd s storage could potentially increase water availability for irrigation in dry periods in northern ghana with implications for increasing agricultural productivity and food security all the basin s national economies have historically depended on rain fed agricultural production which has been exceedingly vulnerable to intra annual and inter annual fluctuations in rainfall and associated stream flows farmers in semi arid regions including burkina faso and northern ghana have historically grappled with water supply fluctuations including a lack of available water for dry season farming and floods in the rainy season our model suggests that overall national farm incomes would be lower under the climate stressed scenario compared to the historical flow scenario however increases in income with the pmd are higher under the climate stressed setting for burkina faso and ghana than without the pmd with the pmd s storage there can be an increase in water availability for more irrigated hectares in crop production in burkina faso and ghana with implications for improved agricultural productivity and food security generation of agro industrial jobs higher incomes and poverty reduction 3 5 3 urban water table 5 also shows the economic value of urban water supply for all riparian countries with the pmd burkina faso would secure a discounted total of 255 million and 101 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios respectively without pmd urban water supply benefit is predicted at 182 million and 101 million under the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios mali benin togo and côte d ivoire are predicted to attain a discounted total of 42 million 18 million 96 million and 41 million respectively under both the historical and climate stressed flow scenarios with and without the pmd ghana would secure a discounted total of 585 million with pmd under the historical flow and 584 million under the climate stressed flow scenario without the pmd the model optimization finds 576 million and 570 million for ghana under the historical flow and climate stressed flow settings 3 5 4 hydropower table 5 also shows the economic benefits of hydropower production by country climate scenario and reservoir development policy scenario the average hydropower price is set constant in the model based on currently observed average grid electricity end user tariff levels at 0 25 per kwh in burkina faso and 0 17 per kwh in ghana multiplying the hydropower production by the power price gives the total revenue for hydropower generation from the five existing dams as well as the new pmd summed over 20 years there is an optimized discounted total hydropower economic benefit of 687 million with the pmd and 639 million without the pmd for burkina faso under the historical flow scenario hydropower benefits would fall to 391 million with pmd and 351 million without the pmd under the climate stressed flow scenario potential hydropower benefits for ghana under the historical flow scenario are a discounted total of 30 617 million with the pmd and 30 276 million without the pmd however under the climate stressed flow scenario optimized discounted hydropower total benefit will be 19 904 million with the pmd and 19 838 without the pmd hydropower water use benefits are significantly higher in ghana than burkina faso since ghana has 98 2 of the basin s total 1670 mw installed capacity 3 6 total economic benefits table 5 also shows total discounted economic benefits summed over 20 years by country climate water supply scenario and reservoir development policy results show that each riparian country would secure some economic benefits based on the water use pattern of the country and no country will be worse off in any sector or with any climate scenario with the pmd in the basin the results predict that ghana the only downstream country in the basin which we assume to shoulder all costs of the pmd dam of 938 million would be much better off economically with the pmd than without it the reservoir that will be created by the pmd will store floodwater during higher flow seasons and years and release for joint hydropower and irrigation use in dry seasons and dry years thus distributing water among seasons and years pmd s floodwater storage has the potential to reduce floods in the wet seasons and increase water availability and access reducing both physical and economic water scarcity problems that northern ghana and southern burkina faso have faced for years during the dry seasons our model predicts that the pmd would reduce annual average flood damages by 78 in locations below the pwalugu gauge from our results the threshold 800 m3 s flow beyond which flood damages would occur will sufficiently inundate the floodplains replenish ponds and support flood recession agriculture in northern ghana based on the minimum environmental flow requirement implemented in our model 41 76 m3 s the pmd would be able to release minimum flows to a level where key ecological areas fall dry for flood recession farming and provide for domestic drinking water as well as ecosystem support in dry seasons the model results provide important insights the pmd if effectively managed and operated has the potential to release environmental flows thus contributing to sustaining downstream ecosystems by moderating the releases from the upstream bagre dam our model predicts that ghana would receive a higher total national farm income hydropower urban water supply recreation benefits and significantly reduced flood damages with the pmd in the basin than without it burkina faso would secure higher total national farm income and hydropower benefits under the climate stressed flow scenario with the pmd in the basin than without it while no other riparian will be worse off the policy implication of the model results show that both burkina faso s bagre and ghana s pwalugu irrigation schemes have the potential to increase irrigated land based on the pmd s storage complementing bagre dam storage and diversify their agricultural production by promoting dry season agriculture increases in hydropower production as well as expanded agricultural production can potentially boost food security generate agro industrial jobs improve national farm income and reduce poverty the optimization model for a 20 year time horizon forecasts that the gains from upstream irrigated agricultural development in northern ghana and burkina faso outweigh the losses in hydropower production revenue in southern ghana however the creation of future dams with large surface areas and continuous expansion of irrigated areas upstream of lake volta can create significant water use tradeoffs between energy and irrigated agriculture 4 discussion this study has investigated impacts of an optimized plan to develop and operate the pwalugu multipurpose dam pmd based on potential total basin wide economic welfare of all riparian countries in the volta basin that would be affected the study analyzed the timing and location of water allocation and use in the volta basin with existing dams and with the pmd versus with existing dams without the pmd results allow us to conclude that water allocation in the volta basin with the pmd has the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana by increasing farm income hydropower recreational benefits and flood damage reductions while also increasing farm income and hydropower benefits for burkina faso in a climate stressed flow scenario while also protecting all other riparian countries from becoming worse off if the pmd is managed for optimal economic benefits it has the potential to help the people of northern ghana reduce the burdens imposed by an ancient and perennial flood hazard experienced over its long history while ensuring water availability for burkina faso in climate stressed flow periods even if ghana bears all the cost of the dam project a constrained dynamic nonlinear optimization model was formulated to examine the potential for a pareto improving dam operation that guards against negative impacts associated with the development of the pmd for all riparian states headwater flows stream flows water use patterns reservoir storage volume guided by their economic impacts were adjusted for total economic benefit optimization to examine the potential impacts and benefits of the pmd the model structure contains two food crops types grains and vegetables grown in 45 irrigation areas across the six riparian countries 17 urban water supply areas and 12 single and multi purpose dams reservoirs with storage capacities greater than 90 million cubic meters with 20 river gauges findings from this investigation show that discounted total economic benefits over a 20 year time horizon for ghana and burkina faso can be at least as large with the pmd and the existing dams in the basin as with only the existing dams with no other basin country being worse off findings point to the importance of timed water flows released from the pmd for dry season water related activities and an opportunity for total basin wide benefits and increased benefit for ghana and burkina faso information from this study could provide informed motivation for ghana to engage more confidently with burkina faso and the other riparian countries of the volta basin to guide debates over the pmd development the methods and results from this study could also guide unilateral water resources decision making for each riparian country about economically optimized cropping urban water supply hydropower production and recreation to pursue bearing in mind the effect of each country s water use and development on other countries hydrologic and economic outcomes with ghana planning to increase its hydropower generation through the construction of the pmd burkina faso may anticipate access to more imported electric power for purchase from ghana at a lower price than their next best current alternative our results show that ghana would have the economic capacity to offer a discounted price for hydropower exports to the upstream country burkina faso since current electricity prices are typically about 47 higher in burkina faso than ghana such potential outcomes could discourage burkina faso from building more dams for hydropower which may be detrimental to flows to ghana ghana can also continue to export more electricity to togo and benin the findings of this study could serve as a guide for a win win negotiation between upstream countries burkina faso togo and benin and downstream country ghana one limitation of the study is the lack of research grade hydrologic information in the basin making it challenging to track recent data on surface water supplies in the basin motivating us to rely more heavily on historical data although there are 60 gauge stations in the entire volta basin only 20 gauges with sufficiently long periods of historical data were used this may limit our ability to measure all flows accurately in and out of a country as some gauges on tributaries within a country monitor the contribution of tributary flows to mainstems which can indicate an increase decrease inflows within a country and across countries due to monthly data gaps long term seasonal data from the global runoff data center were used with emerging improvements in hydrologic data availability by various international and regional initiatives such as volta hycos we anticipate that future studies could secure updated and high frequency hydrologic data for analysis also the study is limited in terms of including comprehensive sources of water abstraction from the basin due to the difficulty in securing complete data on all irrigation and domestic water use sites both small and large for all riparian countries data from several large irrigation schemes and urban areas in published articles and reports were used the study excluded privately owned small scale irrigation schemes which use about 11 more of basin s water than is used by larger irrigation projects lemoalle and de condappa 2013 estimate the total storage of small reservoirs and dugouts as 232 million cubic meters and these small reservoirs are used for livestock production as well as irrigation command areas greater than 1 ha mainly in the upper and middle parts of the basin by 2009 there were more than 1700 small reservoirs and dugouts in burkina faso and more than 1000 in ghana used for small scale irrigation though many were not functioning efficiently andreini et al 2009a 2009b venot et al 2011 2012 furthermore the impact of land use changes and groundwater on river discharge in the basin were not modelled due to the lack of research grade data another limitation is the difficulty of formulating an accurate and precise economic flood damage function due to a lack of historically reliable flood damage data a mathematical function was specified for the pwalugu gauge downstream of the pmd to approximate the extent of flood flows overtopping the white volta river banks this function was specified to capture flood damages that could be reduced with the pmd through reduced flood flows and reduced damages from those more controlled flows however some tributaries join the white volta below the pwalugu gauge that can also cause flood damage excluded by our model also the model largely relies on empirical hydrologic agronomic and economic relationships with assumptions on some parameters such as the cost per unit irrigated land crop prices cropping patterns energy demand energy prices based on current historical values future studies could explore many modeling extensions further analysis of the implications of changing parameters such as crop prices cropping patterns energy demand and energy prices are profitable endeavors the inclusion of more climate scenarios and infrastructure projects would provide more needed information future studies can be guided by recent data and parameters from empirical surveys that are specific to the various areas of the basin considering a larger population of large medium and small reservoirs small scale water uses and other uses such as mining and industrial water use since industrial water use is anticipated to grow in the basin future research could also profitably take advantage of flood data specific to the flooding areas if available in analysis of flood control potential of reservoirs future work could also develop an expanded basin wide benefits analysis of industries that developed as a result of additional affordable hydropower production in the basin due to reservoir development by considering the consumer surplus associated with reduced power prices compared to existing levels or greater quantities of power that could be available at existing prices this could be achieved by including a hydropower price forecasting function in the hydro economic model for which price would partly be influenced by future hydropower developments including a hydropower price forecasting function in the model could enhance reservoir development policy analysis in the basin despite these limitations of this work it is a first attempt at analyzing the economic performance of a proposed large reservoir development policy in the volta basin guided by basin wide economic well being although our work did not undertake a comprehensive valuation of water use for the environment simplified wet and dry season flow targets that mimic the natural flow regime proposed by mul and gao 2016 was implemented in our model as constraints these target flows could help us to gauge the water use benefits forgone by upstream water users providing the opportunity cost of environmental water use this study has shown the potential for welfare gains for ghana and burkina faso from the development of the pmd with no other riparian country being worse off of course in a transboundary river basin appreciable riparian stakeholder negotiations at the local level and basin wide cooperation are necessary for water resource development produce real mutually beneficial outcomes 5 conclusions current stress from high population growth climate change and variability affecting both the demand and supply of the water resources of the volta river basin increase the importance of discovering and implementing sustainable policies to adapt to this stress with few exceptions most existing studies have focused on assessing technical biological and other various improvements in the basin without explicit economic accounting an important gap in most of the existing literature for the volta basin that integrated hydrologic and economic performance for the basin is lack of policy designs for reducing water related poverty as well as extensive damages from ancient and well documented flooding in various parts of the basin such as flood prone regions in northern ghana this work has addressed some existing gaps in the literature by presenting an original and innovative approach to examine benefits and costs of a new reservoir storage capacity that would be established in a flood prone and economically weak economic region in northern ghana we used a basin scale hydro economic framework accounting for five major water management purposes and all six riparian countries a dynamic optimization model using a fully integrated framework was formulated to link the hydrologic agronomic institutional and economic dimensions of the basin analyzing the impact of additional storage infrastructure development policy results indicate that the development and operation of the additional storage infrastructure have the potential to increase economic benefits to ghana and burkina faso with no loss in benefits to any other riparian results show considerable potential for an actual pareto improvement by which ghana and burkina faso will be better off with the new storage infrastructure than without it and no other riparian country in the basin will be worse off additional storage infrastructure in the flood prone area of the basin in northern ghana carries the potential to store water during seasons and years of high native supply with release for use in dry seasons and dry years reallocating water among seasons and years results show an approach to elevate economic development potential to the volta river basin riparian states in terms increased incomes improved food security job creation and poverty reduction despite our optimistic findings considerable domestic and transboundary stakeholder negotiations and cooperation will be needed to secure the potential

quality in rangeland systems elledge and thornton 2017 peña arancibia et al 2012 thornton et al 2007 but very few have evaluated how these systems respond following reductions in grazing pressure bartley et al 2014 wilcox et al 2008 given the large investments in improved grazing land management in gbr catchments and internationally more evidence is needed to evaluate the effect of reducing

130 000 km2 which drains to the gbr south of townsville fig 1 the upper burdekin is estimated to have anthropogenic erosion rates that are 3 6 0 5 times higher than the long term geological rates bartley et al 2015 all three of the study catchments have granodiorite lithology isbell 1996 the predominant soil type is a red chromosol a duplex sandy clay loam known locally as as red goldfields soil chromosol soils cover approximately 12 of the burdekin river basin and have been identified as erosion hotspots and are therefore a priority for management gilad et al 2012 the climate is dry tropical with two distinct seasons a summer wet season between december and april and a dry season between may and november the mean annual rainfall 1900 2012 across the catchments is 686 to 782 mm

accompanying anti enso la niña events nicholls 1991 stream flow from all catchments is ephemeral and responds rapidly to localised rainfall events bartley et al 2010b previous research e g bartley et al 2010a bonell and williams 1987 mcivor et al 1995 roth 2004 and observations from field studies suggests that infiltration excess or hortonian overland flow horton 1933 is a primary runoff generation process in this landscape owing to the typically high rainfall intensities and generally low soil infiltration capacity saturation overland flow may also generate runoff during and following prolonged wet periods most likely confined to saturated soils in riparian corridors swales and areas of shallow soil jarihani et al 2017 vegetation in the upper burdekin catchment varies

increasingly the introduced but naturalised stoloniferous indian couch bothriocloa pertusa dominates pasture composition livestock grazing predominantly cattle was introduced after 1850 wilkinson et al 2018 stocking rates in wheel creek catchment were approximately 40 head per km2 prior to 2001 and 25 head per km2 since stocking rates in weany creek catchment were approximately 25 head per km2 prior to 2001 and 5 20 head per km2 average of 13 head per km2 thereafter when pasture resting in alternate summer wet seasons and forage budgeting were introduced bartley et al 2014 this approach was seen to be industry best practice at the time of implementation the predominant herbaceous ground vegetation in weany creek changed from native perennial tussock grasses to exotic stoloniferous indian couch bothriochloa pertusa in the 1980s gardener et al 1990 this invasive grass provides much lower biomass than the native grasses by contrast main creek catchment was acquired by the department of defence in 1989 stocking rates there remained generally much lower except during temporary agistment in several drought years in the 1990s since 2000 cattle have been excluded wilkinson et al 2018 while ground cover was very low during the 1990s native perennial tussock grasses recovered and remain the predominant herbaceous ground vegetation this is likely a response to the historically lower grazing pressure in the main creek catchment the military training land use in main creek catchment involved ground disturbance by vehicles over a very small proportion of area in place of livestock grazing the grass is managed by burning in the early part of the dry season with the burn interval being several years on average 2 2 rainfall and stream monitoring rainfall was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges in wheel and weany creeks hourly rainfall was averaged between two rain gauges located in the upper and lower parts of each catchment fig 1 with observations available from 2000 01 in main creek only one rain gauge located at the catchment outlet was available with observations available from 2002 03 a rainfall event is defined as occurring when rainfall was sufficient to generate a stream runoff event total event rainfall was calculated as the sum of all rainfall in the 24 h prior to runoff initiation and all rainfall during the runoff event an automatic stream gauging station was installed at the outlets of weany and wheel creeks in 1999 and main creek in 2002 water stage was monitored with a pressure transducer greenspan analytical ps7000 mounted within 0 1 m of the bed velocity was measured with sensors suited to the flow depths experienced at each site weany and main creeks used upwards looking sontek multi cell acoustic doppler sensors while wheel creek used a single cell upwards looking unidata starflow ultrasonic sensor while the sensor in wheel creek measured velocity only up to 0 6 m from the bed it represented mean velocity adequately since the flow depth across this wider cross section exceeded 1 m only twice during the monitoring period the velocity sensors were mounted 0 3 m above the bed to ensure that they were above active bedload movement yet low enough to be submerged in all but very small runoff events stage discharge rating curves of polynomial form were fitted to the discharge estimates and used to estimate discharge throughout the study period a runoff event was defined as occurring when the water depth exceeded 0 3 m preceded by 12 h since the previous event results are presented for individual runoff events and for annual water years july 1 to june 30 water samples were collected with an automatic isco water sampler which can retrieve up to 24 1l samples across the event based on change in stage and stores them at ambient temperature the intake for the isco sampler was mounted 0 3 m above the bed and had a 2 mm strainer to prevent gravel particles from blocking the hose unfiltered water samples were analysed in accordance with apha standards apha 1998 at james cook university analytes include total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp tn and tp were only analysed if 14 days had elapsed between sampling and laboratory analysis typically 3 days a turbidity sensor mcvan analite nep390 or nep180 series sensor was also mounted 0 3 m above the bed 2 3 sediment and nutrient load estimation as in many field studies due to logistical and resource constraints water samples were collected in a majority but not every runoff event supplementary table 1 each event had a unique water sampling distribution requiring estimation of concentration during unsampled periods in this investigation tss turbidity relationships were used to estimate tss concentration linear interpolation was used to estimate tn and tp concentrations during unsampled periods within each runoff event in which at least three samples were available for events with fewer than three samples the mean concentration of all samples collected in the year was used to estimate event loads for years with no samples the mean concentration of all samples from years of similar runoff was used to estimate event loads a load estimation uncertainty analysis associated with each of these methods is described in section 2 5 the tss turbidity technique was applied as follows linear relationships between tss concentrations and turbidity were derived for weany and main creek catchments while second order polynomial relationships were derived for wheel creek catchment when turbidity meters were replaced due to malfunction or storm damage a new tss turbidity relationship was developed table 2 turbidity measurements were unavailable due to instrument damage in weany creek during 2007 08 2008 09 and 2014 15 and in main creek in 2003 04 during these years tss concentrations during unsampled periods were estimated using linear interpolation the linear interpolation technique was applied as follows for events having three or more samples concentrations through the event were estimated by linearly interpolating between samples as 1 c i c i 1 c i 1 t i 1 t i 1 t i t i 1 c i 1 where ci is the estimated concentration at time ti ti 1 and ti 1 are times of sampling for ci 1 and ci 1 which are the preceding and following measured concentrations constituent concentration during the generally short time from the start of the event to the first sample was assumed to equal the concentration of the first sample concentration during the period from the last sample to the end of the event was assumed to equal the concentration of the last sample tss tn and tp loads for individual events were calculated according to equation 2 2 load i 1 n c i q i t i where ci is estimated concentration at time i qi is corresponding flow and ti is the time interval represented annual tss tn and tp loads were calculated by summing loads for individual events across the water year 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were completed in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2019 differences among the catchments in i tss tn and tp sample concentrations in each year of the study period see supplementary table 2 and ii annual tss tn and tp loads over the study period were tested using a kruskal wallis h test pairwise comparisons were performed using dunn s 1964 procedure with a bonferroni correction if samples were only available for two catchments in a given year a mann whitney u test was used to test for concentration differences tss tn and tp concentration data in each year of the study period and annual load data were typically not normally distributed and transforming the data did not improve normality necessitating the use of non parametric statistical tests differences among the catchments in event i rainfall ii runoff iii rainfall runoff ratio iv runoff duration v peak rainfall intensity and vi tss tn and tp loads were also tested using a kruskal wallis h test as described earlier as the number of runoff events in a given year was typically low average of 5 events per year across all catchments events were grouped into three distinct time periods described in section 3 1 relationships between i tss concentration and tn and tp concentration ii event rainfall and event runoff iii event tss tn and tp load and event runoff and iv event tss tn and tp load and event rainfall were tested using linear regression analysis catchment site was included as an interaction term in the regression to determine if there was a significant difference in the regression coefficients intercept and slope among the catchments linear regression analysis was performed on log10 transformed data as this transformation improved normality of the distribution of residuals a number of events were excluded from event based statistical analysis summarised in supplementary table 3 three runoff events in wheel creek seven runoff events in weany creek and three runoff events in main creek were excluded as the rainfall runoff ratio exceeded 75 observations from field studies and previous investigations e g bartley et al 2014 suggest rainfall runoff ratios in excess of 75 do not occur in this landscape at the monitored scale 10 km2 events with calculated rainfall runoff ratios 75 suggest that spatially variable rainfall was not adequately captured by available rain gauges during these events jarihani et al 2017 and or stream flow may have been overestimated events where sediment and nutrient loads were estimated using the mean concentration of all samples from similar runoff years identified in supplementary table 1 were also excluded from event based statistical analysis as there is higher uncertainty in the load estimation associated with this method quantified in supplementary table 4 2 5 load estimation uncertainty analysis to quantify uncertainty in the load estimation methods they were each evaluated against loads estimated by linear interpolation of concentration for a number of well sampled reference events supplementary table 4 the reference events provide the best estimate of true load based on available data reference events each had 7 samples with at least three samples on the rising limb and three samples on the falling limb of the hydrograph this sample distribution was considered appropriate given the short duration of runoff events i e hours eight reference events were selected in total comprising three events from wheel and weany creeks and two events from main creek at least one event occurred in each of the three distinct time periods reported in this study see section 3 1 linear interpolation between sample concentrations was evaluated using multiple groups of three samples four different sampling strategies were tested each executed multiple times depending on the number of samples up to a maximum of five times 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff annual time scale mean annual rainfall in wheel weany and main creek catchments during the study period 2002 03 2016 17 is 739 mm range of 327 1547 mm yr 1 620 mm range of 315 1237 mm yr 1 and 643 mm range of 322 1352 mm yr 1 respectively fig 2 three distinct rainfall periods are apparent including 1 a run of drier than long term average years from 2000 01 to 2005 06 first dry with the exception 2004 05 in wheel 2 a wetter period from 2006 07 to 2011 12 middle wet with the exception of 2009 10 in all catchments 3 and a drier period from 2012 13 to 2016 17 second dry the mean annual rainfall runoff ratios during the study period in wheel weany and main creeks are 16 0 range 0 3 37 5 9 2 range 0 5 29 5 and 6 8 range 0 18 8 respectively no runoff was recorded in main creek in 2013 14 and 2016 17 despite receiving similar annual rainfall to the other catchments 3 2 sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads annual time scale tss tn and tp concentrations are variable both within and across years and periods but generally higher during the dry periods and lower during the wetter period fig 3 main creek has significantly lower tss concentrations p 0 05 than one or both of the grazed catchments in seven out of the eight years where comparison is possible supplementary table 2 the year 2003 04 is an exception when tss concentrations in main creek are significantly higher p 0 05 than the other catchments attributed to extensive roadworks in that catchment during that wet season comparing wheel and weany creeks significant differences p 0 05 in tss concentrations occur in five out of the 13 years where comparison is possible with concentrations in weany creek higher in four of these years there are significant differences p 0 05 in tn and tp concentrations between main creek and one or both of the grazed catchments in four out of the seven years where comparison is possible being lower in two years 2005 06 and 2011 12 and higher in two years 2003 04 and 2006 07 no significant differences p 0 05 in tn concentrations occur between wheel and weany creek across the nine years where comparison is possible tp concentrations however are significantly p 0 05 higher in weany creek in three of these years at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationship between log10 tss concentration and i log10 tn concentration fig 4 a and ii log10 tp concentration fig 4b catchment site had a significant effect on the intercept of the regression of tss concentration and tn concentration p 0 01 being higher in main creek than in wheel and weany creeks fig 4a catchment site also had a significant effect on the slope of the regression of tp concentration and tss concentration p 0 01 the rate of increase in tp concentration with tss concentration is greater in main creek than in both wheel and weany creeks fig 4b across the study period 2002 03 2016 17 estimated mean annual tss loads are similar in wheel and weany creeks 1 4 and 1 5 t ha 1 respectively and lower in main creek 0 6 t ha 1 although the difference is not significant p 0 062 mean annual tn loads are significantly higher p 0 05 in wheel creek 3 0 kg ha 1 and similar in weany creek and main creeks 1 4 and 1 3 kg ha 1 respectively mean annual tp loads are similar p 0 05 across all catchments 0 3 0 5 kg ha 1 table 3 annual tss tn and tp loads display high inter annual variability which broadly correspond to patterns in annual runoff higher loads typically occur during higher runoff years fig 5 with the exception of 2004 05 the first relatively wet year following roadworks annual tss loads in main creek are typically similar or lower than the other catchments 3 3 rainfall and runoff event time scale in all catchments rainfall typically occurs in short duration high intensity events resulting in flashy storm hydrographs with short flow durations fig 6 between 2002 03 and 2016 17 90 83 and 44 runoff events occurred in wheel weany and main creeks respectively event rainfall amount is significantly higher in weany creek than in wheel creek during the second dry period p 0 01 fig 6a event runoff is significantly higher in both wheel and main creeks than in weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 01 fig 6b the rainfall runoff ratio is significantly higher in wheel creek than in weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 01 fig 6c peak rainfall intensity is significantly higher p 0 01 in main creek than in both wheel and weany creeks during the middle wet period and during the second dry period wheel only fig 6e there is a signficant positive linear relationship between event log10 rainfall and event log10 runoff p 0 01 in each catchment fig 6f catchment site had a significant effect on the intercept of the regression p 0 01 being higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks fig 6f during the study period only 21 16 and 25 of runoff events in wheel weany and main creeks respectively have total runoff 20 mm while the proportion of total measured runoff volume represented by these events is 85 79 and 82 respectively 3 4 sediment and nutrient loads event time scale in each period i e first dry middle wet second dry there is no significant difference p 0 05 in event tss or tp loads among the catchments fig 7 tn loads in main creek are significantly higher than weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 05 in all three catchments total sediment and nutrient loads are dominated by a few large runoff events i e events with 20 mm runoff these larger runoff events produce 73 74 71 78 and 74 77 of the total tss tn and tp loads respectively at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between event log10 runoff and event i log10 tss load fig 8 a ii log10 tn load fig 8b and iii log10 tp load fig 8c catchment site had a significant effect p 0 01 on the intercept of the regression of event runoff and event tss load being higher in weany creek than in wheel and main creeks catchment site also had a significant effect p 0 01 on the intercept of the regression of event runoff and event tn load being higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between event log10 rainfall and event i log10 tss load fig 8d ii log10 tn load fig 8e and iii log10 tp load fig 8f catchment site had a significant effect p 0 05 on the intercept of the regression of event rainfall with event tss load and with event tn load in both cases the intercept is significantly higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks 3 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty of estimated tss tn and tp loads varies depending on the method used to estimate concentration for unsampled time periods the number of samples collected during an event and the position of those samples on the storm hydrograph supplementary table 4 in most years tss loads were estimated using tss turbidity relationships between 77 and 94 of the variation in tss concentrations is explained by the various tss turbidity models applied table 2 tss loads estimated using the tss turbidity method are on average within 16 of the reference load in the few years where turbidity data were unavailable tss loads were estimated using the linear interpolation method in line with the approach used to estimate tn and tp loads tss tn and tp loads estimated using the linear interpolation method with 3 samples are within 12 16 of the reference load tss tn and tp loads estimated using the mean concentration of all samples collected in that year are within 7 11 of the reference load tn and tp loads estimated using a mean concentration of all samples collected in years with similar runoff are within 29 49 of the reference load it is acknowledged that reference events used to provide the best estimate of true load in this analysis will have their own degree of error but this error cannot be quantified with the available data 4 discussion 4 1 influence of rangeland management on runoff sediment and nutrient yields at the annual time scale main creek has typically lower rainfall runoff ratios fig 2 fewer runoff events supplementary table 1 and lower annual sediment concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 5 table 3 compared to the two grazed catchments further in two of the last five years of the record 2013 14 and 2016 17 no runoff was recorded in main creek despite receiving similar annual rainfall to the other catchments fig 2 overall the results suggest that historically lower grazing pressure and exclusion of cattle over 17 years in main creek may have facilitated increased infiltration capacity soil water storage and soil surface protection relative to other catchments ultimately reducing runoff and erosion and therefore sediment and nutrient yields the difference in annual runoff and sediment loads in main creek compared to the grazed catchments is likely associated with three specific differences in catchment condition firstly subsoil from gullies is understood to be the largest contributor to sediment yields in this environment wilkinson et al 2013 and in main creek catchment gullies tend to be shorter have much higher vegetation cover and biomass lower wall erosion rates and lower sediment yields wilkinson et al 2018 a smaller contribution of subsoil erosion in main creek is consistent with tn concentrations for a given tss concentration being significantly higher in main creek compared to the other catchments fig 4a in that nitrogen is more strongly associated with sediment derived from surface material i e hillslope erosion sources or areas with higher biomass as opposed to nutrient depleted subsurface i e gully derived soil garzon garcia et al 2014 secondly the predominant ground vegetation in main creek catchment is native perennial tussock grasses table 1 these grasses typically have higher biomass offer greater soil surface protection and promote more infiltration compared to the exotic stoloniferous indian couch that is prevalent in the other catchments ash et al 2011 bartley et al 2014 the prevalence of native perennial grasses in main creek catchment is likely to have reduced the amount and erosive potential of infiltration excess overland flow as has been demonstrated in previous plot scale studies mcivor et al 1995 roth 2004 the higher biomass in main creek can also be expected to have greater evapotranspiration which would increase the available soil water storage capacity at the start of rainfall events and therefore reduce the potential for sub surface overland flow although this effect is yet to be quantified finally main creek catchment had generally higher vegetation cover levels throughout the study supplementary fig 1 which would help to suppress sheetwash and rill erosion rates hernandez et al 2017 mcivor et al 1995 it must be noted the mean annual rainfall over the study period was 14 higher in wheel creek compared to main creek and wheel creek had eight 53 more large runoff events i e events with 20 mm runoff this could account for some of the differences in annual runoff and sediment loads between these two catchments fewer larger runoff events in main creek however may also reflect greater capacity for main creek to store more rainfall particularly given that event rainfall intensities in main creek tend to be higher fig 6e it is also possible that differences among the catchments in drainage structure fig 1 and overall hydrological and sediment connectivity may have contributed to differences in runoff and loads between main creek and the grazed catchments bracken and croke 2007 fryirs et al 2007 richards 2002 but quantifying such effects was beyond the scope of this study annual sediment and nutrient concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 5 table 3 in weany creek catchment where grazing pressure was reduced from 25 to 13 cattle per km2 at the commencement of monitoring are similar in magnitude to wheel creek catchment which maintained higher levels of grazing pressure 25 head per km2 during this study and 40 head per km2 historically failure to detect load reductions in weany creek during the study period does not necessarily mean that reducing grazing pressure will not reduce loads but does indicate that the recovery trajectory of erosion processes particularly gully erosion is slow in these degraded savanna systems requiring 15 years to become measurable o reagain et al 2005 indeed catchment systems are known to have an inherent lag time between management interventions and system response meals et al 2010 melland et al 2018 particularly in areas of low precipitation sidle and sharma 1996 walling and kleo 1979 it may also be possible that these degraded savanna ecosystems have crossed a critical tipping point beyond which major recovery in ecosystem function is very difficult to achieve bestelmeyer 2006 laurance et al 2011 in parts of the catchment particularly around gullies the a horizon is completely removed due to past grazing pressure leading to chronic exposure of poor fertility subsoils which have higher dry bulk density than do areas with an intact soil organic layer bartley et al 2010a recovery of soil hydrological function in such areas is extremely difficult bartley et al 2014 roth 2004 it can be expected that gullies will also recover more slowly than flatter areas away from drainage lines koci et al 2019 priorities for investments to improve water quality must recognise the apparent slow recovery rates in catchment runoff sediment and nutrient yields which result from reductions in grazing pressure alone additional remediation interventions e g gully erosion control may be needed to expedite improvements in water quality gully erosion is believed to provide the dominant source of sediments and particulate nutrients to the gbr koci et al 2017 waterhouse et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2018 it is commonly assumed that areas with high gully density will produce higher sediment yields than areas of lower gully density but this was not demonstrated in our study despite wheel creek catchment having almost twice the linear gully density of weany creek catchment table 1 the rate of increase in event tss load with event runoff is similar between the two catchments fig 8a this suggests that gullies in wheel creek catchment are more stable than in weany creek catchment and produce less sediment per unit area sidorchuk 1999 it could also suggest that gullies in weany catchment are more connected to the main stream channel or that there is less opportunity for sediment deposition bracken and croke 2007 indeed runoff events in weany creek tend to have higher tss loads fig 8a than equivalent runoff events in terms of runoff amount in the other catchments indicating that there may be more available sediment higher sediment connectivity and or lower storage potential in this catchment in contrast rainfall events in wheel creek tend to produce more runoff fig 6f and have higher tss fig 8d and tn loads fig 8e than equivalent rainfall events in terms of rainfall amount in the other catchments indicating that hillslopes in wheel creek may have lower infiltration capacity soil water storage and surface protection relative to other catchments rigorous analysis of the influence of catchment geomorphic features e g gully density hydrological connectivity sediment storage on rainfall runoff response and sediment and nutrient loads was beyond the scope of this study but may deserve further investigation e g bracken and croke 2007 koci et al 2019 large runoff events have a profound effect on total sediment and nutrient yields across all catchments over the study period 71 78 of the total tss tn and tp loads were generated from only 16 25 of events with runoff 20 mm these large runoff events typically have 100 mm rainfall with peak rainfall intensities up to 55 mm hr 1 and runoff durations 5 hr such events are likely to mobilise sediments and nutrients regardless of ground cover at the time of the event as has been demonstrated in previous studies e g mcivor et al 1995 scanlan et al 1996 grazing management practices that promote increased ground cover and biomass are therefore likely to have the greatest effect on reducing loads during smaller to moderate less intense rainfall events overall at the event timescale there are not clear differences in runoff sediment and nutrient loads among the catchments for example in each period i e first dry middle wet second dry there are not significant differences in event sediment loads among the catchments fig 7 further across all runoff events the rate of increase in event runoff with event rainfall fig 6f and the rate of increase in event sediment and nutrient loads with event runoff and event rainfall fig 8 is similar among the catchments variability in the relationships between event rainfall amount and event runoff and event tss tn and tp loads indicated by modest r2 values figs 6f 8 suggests that within and between event variations in factors other than rainfall and runoff amount exert a strong influence on loads the time it takes for sediment and nutrients generated via hillslope and gully erosion processes to reach stream channels for example will vary depending upon the size and intensity of the rainfall event time between successive events and overall hydrological and sediment connectivity meals et al 2010 sidle et al 2017 stream bank erosion processes can also episodically mobilise large amounts of sediment bartley et al 2007 florsheim et al 2008 the load measured for a particular event can therefore be influenced by erosion and transport that occurred during recent prior events we acknowledge that data reported herein may not have adequately captured this variability in many events particularly with regard to nutrients nonetheless our findings provide new insights into the amounts of sediments and nutrients exported from these headwater catchments where there is a dearth of information road construction can significantly increase sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads particularly in the following year or so especially when undertaken during the wet season the roadwork in main creek catchment during the 2003 04 wet season likely explained the elevated sediment and nutrient concentrations that year and the following year fig 3 while rainfall and loads were low in 2003 04 an increase in rainfall and runoff the following year may have mobilised readily available sediment producing higher sediment and nutrient loads in 2004 05 fig 5 numerous studies have documented the environmental impact of roads and trails which not only mobilise large amounts of sediments during construction but also provide direct conduits for flow concentration increasing catchment connectivity croke and mockler 2001 koci et al 2019 sidle et al 2004 given the potential impact on sediment and nutrient loads the timing and extent of road works and other earthworks must be carefully considered in catchment management military training activities in main creek catchment as well as legacy activities such as dispersed mining and previous grazing bartley et al 2018 could also have elevated sediment and nutrient loads at various times throughout the record although we were unable to quantify such impacts 4 2 significance of sediment and nutrient yields from savanna rangelands across all study catchments mean annual tss tn and tp loads were estimated as 1 2 t ha 1 1 9 kg ha 1 0 4 kg ha 1 respectively table 3 considering that the majority of the upper burdekin catchment has grazing pressure consistent with wheel and weany creek rather than main creek the mean annual tss tn and tp loads for these two catchments 1 4 t ha 1 2 2 kg ha 1 and 0 4 kg ha 1 respectively is perhaps more representative of rangelands in this region these estimates are within the range of sediment loads reported in other semi arid rangeland environments e g nearing et al 2007 nichols et al 2013 polyakov et al 2010 our sediment load estimates are similar to those predicted for the entire upper burdekin catchment 1 5 t ha 1 yr 1 bainbridge et al 2012 our estimates of sediment and nutrient loads however are much larger than those predicted for the burdekin river basin as a whole which is consistent with existence of drier areas in the inland part of the basin bainbridge et al 2012 and with the greater opportunities for storage at broader scales bartley et al 2018 sidle et al 2017 for example kroon 2012 estimated mean annual loads of tss tn and tp in the burdekin river basin to be 0 3 t ha 1 0 6 kg ha 1 and 0 1 kg ha 1 respectively while we cannot assume that all sediments and nutrients generated in these headwaters will be transported to the gbr lagoon or that mean estimates of load presented herein are directly applicable to other catchments in the region it is clear that substantial sediments and nutrients are exported from savanna rangelands and that annual sediment and nutrient loads are sensitive to grazing pressure as well as to environmental variables 4 3 findings relevant to future water quality monitoring programs this study demonstrates the importance of long term monitoring of both water quality and catchment condition to adequately capture the effects of land management on sediment and nutrient yields particularly in the context of high climatic variability and long recovery trajectories ideally such monitoring should occur at nested spatial scales and include information on the response e g runoff and concentration as well as factors that will influence the change e g soil condition vegetation land use and climate and the processes driving sediment and nutrient mobilisation and transport e g infiltration excess and saturation overland flow hillslope gully and stream bank erosion sidle et al 2017 detailed measurements at smaller spatial e g plots hillslopes and shorter temporal scales e g 1 5 years may provide the data required to understand how a particular site is responding to land management change e g changes in soil infiltration capacity soil fertility vegetation cover and biomass however such data should always be nested within larger scale stream and catchment monitoring to evaluate how the effect of changing land management propagates throughout the system such information is invaluable not only for the parameterisation and validation of models used to estimate end of catchment sediment and nutrient loads but can also inform the implementation of optimal catchment management strategies mccloskey et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2014 5 conclusion this study compares 15 year records of runoff sediment and nutrient yields in three ephemeral headwater catchments 10 5 13 5 km2 with similar climate and landform characteristics but contrasting grazing management history key conclusions from this study include annual rainfall runoff ratios and total sediment loads are lower in a catchment where cattle were excluded over the study period compared to nearby grazed catchments higher annual sediment loads in the grazed catchments compared to the ungrazed catchment are likely due to degradation of soil water storage capacity soil surface protection and gully erosion rates but may also be influenced by differences in catchment hydrological and sediment connectivity overall at the event timescale there are not clear differences in runoff sediment and nutrient loads among the catchments attributed to variability in catchment conditions e g antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity vegetation that occur within and between events rainfall and runoff are key drivers of variations in annual and event sediment and nutrient loads with most of the total export associated with only a few large events i e 20 mm runoff management interventions focused on improving ground cover and increasing grass biomass are likely to be most effective in reducing sediment and nutrient loads during smaller events recovery of degraded savanna rangelands is slow and strongly influenced by climate and hydrological response it may take several decades before a clear sediment and nutrient load response to reduced grazing pressure becomes detectable in these ephemeral streams this needs to be accounted for in water quality target setting and broader catchment management additional remediation interventions e g gully erosion control will be needed to expedite improvements in water quality road works or other physical disturbances can significantly increase sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads in the short term such activities should be avoided during the rainy season to minimise loads measuring recovery in water quality requires nested spatial monitoring over long time scales that includes information on the response e g runoff and concentration as well as factors that will influence the change e g soil condition vegetation land use and climate and the processes driving sediment and nutrient mobilisation and transport e g hillslope gully and stream bank erosion as this is one of only a few long term studies to evaluate water quality in headwater catchments following changes in grazing management in the gbr catchments

pressure e g agouridis et al 2005 ash et al 2011 mcivor et al 1995 the assumption is that reducing grazing pressure will improve ground cover decrease runoff and improve water quality thorburn and

quality in rangeland systems elledge and thornton 2017 peña arancibia et al 2012 thornton et al 2007 but very few have evaluated how these systems respond following reductions in grazing pressure bartley et al 2014 wilcox et al 2008 given the large investments in improved grazing land management in gbr catchments and internationally more evidence is needed to evaluate the effect of reducing grazing pressure on catchment runoff sediment and nutrient yields modelling is often used to prioritise catchment management activities but is dependent on the availability of monitoring data to inform model parameterisation and validation mccloskey et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 wilkinson et al 2014 this is particularly the case in semi arid and dry tropical rangelands where long term datasets of sediment and nutrient yields are relatively scarce particularly in ephemeral headwater catchments nearing et al 2007 nichols 2006 polyakov et al 2010 in the gbr catchments most monitoring of river loads occurs at basin scales 103 105 km2 encompassing multiple land uses and soil types across rainfall gradients which makes it difficult to isolate the effects of land use and land use

catchments main creek was acquired by the department of defence in 1989 with typically lower grazing pressure and almost complete cattle exclusion since 2000 the area is currently used for military training in contrast a nearby commercial grazing catchment wheel creek continues to experience relatively high cattle stocking rates 25 head per km2 and a third catchment weany creek has had reduced stocking rates 5 20 head per km2 and pasture resting since 2001 in this study a lack of pre treatment data precludes the application of statistical approaches used in classic control treatment or paired catchment studies e g bishop et al 2005 thornton et al 2007 nonetheless these data provide a unique opportunity to further our understanding of the impact of reduced grazing pressure on water quality in savanna rangeland streams 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the three study catchments table 1 are located in the upper burdekin catchment 40 413 km2 part of the burdekin river basin 130 000 km2 which drains to the gbr south of townsville fig 1 the upper burdekin is estimated to have anthropogenic erosion rates that are 3 6 0 5 times higher than the long term geological rates bartley et al 2015 all three of the study catchments have granodiorite lithology isbell 1996 the predominant soil type is a red chromosol a duplex sandy clay loam known locally as as red goldfields soil chromosol soils cover approximately 12 of the burdekin river basin and have been identified as erosion hotspots and are therefore a priority for management gilad et al 2012 the climate is dry tropical with two distinct seasons a summer wet season between december and april and a dry season between may and november the mean annual rainfall 1900 2012 across the catchments is 686 to 782 mm year 1 but is subject to high interannual variability linked to the phase of the southern oscillation with drought conditions coinciding with el niño southern oscillation enso and wetter periods accompanying anti enso la niña events nicholls 1991 stream flow from all catchments is ephemeral and responds rapidly to localised rainfall events bartley et al 2010b previous research e g bartley et al 2010a bonell and williams 1987 mcivor et al 1995 roth 2004 and observations from field studies suggests that infiltration excess or hortonian overland flow horton 1933 is a primary runoff generation process in this landscape owing to the typically high rainfall intensities and generally low soil infiltration capacity saturation overland flow may also generate runoff during and following prolonged wet periods most likely confined to saturated soils in riparian corridors swales and areas of shallow soil jarihani et al 2017 vegetation in the upper burdekin catchment varies with rainfall gradient and soil type and is dominated by sparse eucalypt savanna woodlands overlaying tropical grasses trees are a mixture of ironbark bloodwood communities e g narrow leafed ironbark eucalyptus crebra and red bloodwood corymbia erythrophloia and shrubby species e g currant bush carissa ovate and false sandalwood eremophila mitchellii grasses include a mixture of native species but increasingly the introduced but naturalised stoloniferous indian couch bothriocloa pertusa dominates pasture composition livestock grazing predominantly cattle was introduced after 1850 wilkinson et al 2018 stocking rates in wheel creek catchment were approximately 40 head per km2 prior to 2001 and 25 head per km2 since stocking rates in weany creek catchment were approximately 25 head per km2 prior to 2001 and 5 20 head per km2 average of 13 head per km2 thereafter when pasture resting in alternate summer wet seasons and forage budgeting were introduced bartley et al 2014 this approach was seen to be industry best practice at the time of implementation the predominant herbaceous ground vegetation in weany creek changed from native perennial tussock grasses to exotic stoloniferous indian couch bothriochloa pertusa in the 1980s gardener et al 1990 this invasive grass provides much lower biomass than the native grasses by contrast main creek catchment was acquired by the department of defence in 1989 stocking rates there remained generally much lower except during temporary agistment in several drought years in the 1990s since 2000 cattle have been excluded wilkinson et al 2018 while ground cover was very low during the 1990s native perennial tussock grasses recovered and remain the predominant herbaceous ground vegetation this is likely a response to the historically lower grazing pressure in the main creek catchment the military training land use in main creek catchment involved ground disturbance by vehicles over a very small proportion of area in place of livestock grazing the grass is managed by burning in the early part of the dry season with the burn interval being several years on average 2 2 rainfall and stream monitoring rainfall was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges in wheel and weany creeks hourly rainfall was averaged between two rain gauges located in the upper and lower parts of each catchment fig 1 with observations available from 2000 01 in main creek only one rain gauge located at the catchment outlet was available with observations available from 2002 03 a rainfall event is defined as occurring when rainfall was sufficient to generate a stream runoff event total event rainfall was calculated as the sum of all rainfall in the 24 h prior to runoff initiation and all rainfall during the runoff event an automatic stream gauging station was installed at the outlets of weany and wheel creeks in 1999 and main creek in 2002 water stage was monitored with a pressure transducer greenspan analytical ps7000 mounted within 0 1 m of the bed velocity was measured with sensors suited to the flow depths experienced at each site weany and main creeks used upwards looking sontek multi cell acoustic doppler sensors while wheel creek used a single cell upwards looking unidata starflow ultrasonic sensor while the sensor in wheel creek measured velocity only up to 0 6 m from the bed it represented mean velocity adequately since the flow depth across this wider cross section exceeded 1 m only twice during the monitoring period the velocity sensors were mounted 0 3 m above the bed to ensure that they were above active bedload movement yet low enough to be submerged in all but very small runoff events stage discharge rating curves of polynomial form were fitted to the discharge estimates and used to estimate discharge throughout the study period a runoff event was defined as occurring when the water depth exceeded 0 3 m preceded by 12 h since the previous event results are presented for individual runoff events and for annual water years july 1 to june 30 water samples were collected with an automatic isco water sampler which can retrieve up to 24 1l samples across the event based on change in stage and stores them at ambient temperature the intake for the isco sampler was mounted 0 3 m above the bed and had a 2 mm strainer to prevent gravel particles from blocking the hose unfiltered water samples were analysed in accordance with apha standards apha 1998 at james cook university analytes include total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp tn and tp were only analysed if 14 days had elapsed between sampling and laboratory analysis typically 3 days a turbidity sensor mcvan analite nep390 or nep180 series sensor was also mounted 0 3 m above the bed 2 3 sediment and nutrient load estimation as in many field studies due to logistical and resource constraints water samples were collected in a majority but not every runoff event supplementary table 1 each event had a unique water sampling distribution requiring estimation of concentration during unsampled periods in this investigation tss turbidity relationships were used to estimate tss concentration linear interpolation was used to estimate tn and tp concentrations during unsampled periods within each runoff event in which at least three samples were available for events with fewer than three samples the mean concentration of all samples collected in the year was used to estimate event loads for years with no samples the mean concentration of all samples from years of similar runoff was used to estimate event loads a load estimation uncertainty analysis associated with each of these methods is described in section 2 5 the tss turbidity technique was applied as follows linear relationships between tss concentrations and turbidity were derived for weany and main creek catchments while second order polynomial relationships were derived for wheel creek catchment when turbidity meters were replaced due to malfunction or storm damage a new tss turbidity relationship was developed table 2 turbidity measurements were unavailable due to instrument damage in weany creek during 2007 08 2008 09 and 2014 15 and in main creek in 2003 04 during these years tss concentrations during unsampled periods were estimated using linear interpolation the linear interpolation technique was applied as follows for events having three or more samples concentrations through the event were estimated by linearly interpolating between samples as 1 c i c i 1 c i 1 t i 1 t i 1 t i t i 1 c i 1 where ci is the estimated concentration at time ti ti 1 and ti 1 are times of sampling for ci 1 and ci 1 which are the preceding and following measured concentrations constituent concentration during the generally short time from the start of the event to the first sample was assumed to equal the concentration of the first sample concentration during the period from the last sample to the end of the event was assumed to equal the concentration of the last sample tss tn and tp loads for individual events were calculated according to equation 2 2 load i 1 n c i q i t i where ci is estimated concentration at time i qi is corresponding flow and ti is the time interval represented annual tss tn and tp loads were calculated by summing loads for individual events across the water year 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were completed in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2019 differences among the catchments in i tss tn and tp sample concentrations in each year of the study period see supplementary table 2 and ii annual tss tn and tp loads over the study period were tested using a kruskal wallis h test pairwise comparisons were performed using dunn s 1964 procedure with a bonferroni correction if samples were only available for two catchments in a given year a mann whitney u test was used to test for concentration differences tss tn and tp concentration data in each year of the study period and annual load data were typically not normally distributed and transforming the data did not improve normality necessitating the use of non parametric statistical tests differences among the catchments in event i rainfall ii runoff iii rainfall runoff ratio iv runoff duration v peak rainfall intensity and vi tss tn and tp loads were also tested using a kruskal wallis h test as described earlier as the number of runoff events in a given year was typically low average of 5 events per year across all catchments events were grouped into three distinct time periods described in section 3 1 relationships between i tss concentration and tn and tp concentration ii event rainfall and event runoff iii event tss tn and tp load and event runoff and iv event tss tn and tp load and event rainfall were tested using linear regression analysis catchment site was included as an interaction term in the regression to determine if there was a significant difference in the regression coefficients intercept and slope among the catchments linear regression analysis was performed on log10 transformed data as this transformation improved normality of the distribution of residuals a number of events were excluded from event based statistical analysis summarised in supplementary table 3 three runoff events in wheel creek seven runoff events in weany creek and three runoff events in main creek were excluded as the rainfall runoff ratio exceeded 75 observations from field studies and previous investigations e g bartley et al 2014 suggest rainfall runoff ratios in excess of 75 do not occur in this landscape at the monitored scale 10 km2 events with calculated rainfall runoff ratios 75 suggest that spatially variable rainfall was not adequately captured by available rain gauges during these events jarihani et al 2017 and or stream flow may have been overestimated events where sediment and nutrient loads were estimated using the mean concentration of all samples from similar runoff years identified in supplementary table 1 were also excluded from event based statistical analysis as there is higher uncertainty in the load estimation associated with this method quantified in supplementary table 4 2 5 load estimation uncertainty analysis to quantify uncertainty in the load estimation methods they were each evaluated against loads estimated by linear interpolation of concentration for a number of well sampled reference events supplementary table 4 the reference events provide the best estimate of true load based on available data reference events each had 7 samples with at least three samples on the rising limb and three samples on the falling limb of the hydrograph this sample distribution was considered appropriate given the short duration of runoff events i e hours eight reference events were selected in total comprising three events from wheel and weany creeks and two events from main creek at least one event occurred in each of the three distinct time periods reported in this study see section 3 1 linear interpolation between sample concentrations was evaluated using multiple groups of three samples four different sampling strategies were tested each executed multiple times depending on the number of samples up to a maximum of five times 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff annual time scale mean annual rainfall in wheel weany and main creek catchments during the study period 2002 03 2016 17 is 739 mm range of 327 1547 mm yr 1 620 mm range of 315 1237 mm yr 1 and 643 mm range of 322 1352 mm yr 1 respectively fig 2 three distinct rainfall periods are apparent including 1 a run of drier than long term average years from 2000 01 to 2005 06 first dry with the exception 2004 05 in wheel 2 a wetter period from 2006 07 to 2011 12 middle wet with the exception of 2009 10 in all catchments 3 and a drier period from 2012 13 to 2016 17 second dry the mean annual rainfall runoff ratios during the study period in wheel weany and main creeks are 16 0 range 0 3 37 5 9 2 range 0 5 29 5 and 6 8 range 0 18 8 respectively no runoff was recorded in main creek in 2013 14 and 2016 17 despite receiving similar annual rainfall to the other catchments 3 2 sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads annual time scale tss tn and tp concentrations are variable both within and across years and periods but generally higher during the dry periods and lower during the wetter period fig 3 main creek has significantly lower tss concentrations p 0 05 than one or both of the grazed catchments in seven out of the eight years where comparison is possible supplementary table 2 the year 2003 04 is an exception when tss concentrations in main creek are significantly higher p 0 05 than the other catchments attributed to extensive roadworks in that catchment during that wet season comparing wheel and weany creeks significant differences p 0 05 in tss concentrations occur in five out of the 13 years where comparison is possible with concentrations in weany creek higher in four of these years there are significant differences p 0 05 in tn and tp concentrations between main creek and one or both of the grazed catchments in four out of the seven years where comparison is possible being lower in two years 2005 06 and 2011 12 and higher in two years 2003 04 and 2006 07 no significant differences p 0 05 in tn concentrations occur between wheel and weany creek across the nine years where comparison is possible tp concentrations however are significantly p 0 05 higher in weany creek in three of these years at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationship between log10 tss concentration and i log10 tn concentration fig 4 a and ii log10 tp concentration fig 4b catchment site had a significant effect on the intercept of the regression of tss concentration and tn concentration p 0 01 being higher in main creek than in wheel and weany creeks fig 4a catchment site also had a significant effect on the slope of the regression of tp concentration and tss concentration p 0 01 the rate of increase in tp concentration with tss concentration is greater in main creek than in both wheel and weany creeks fig 4b across the study period 2002 03 2016 17 estimated mean annual tss loads are similar in wheel and weany creeks 1 4 and 1 5 t ha 1 respectively and lower in main creek 0 6 t ha 1 although the difference is not significant p 0 062 mean annual tn loads are significantly higher p 0 05 in wheel creek 3 0 kg ha 1 and similar in weany creek and main creeks 1 4 and 1 3 kg ha 1 respectively mean annual tp loads are similar p 0 05 across all catchments 0 3 0 5 kg ha 1 table 3 annual tss tn and tp loads display high inter annual variability which broadly correspond to patterns in annual runoff higher loads typically occur during higher runoff years fig 5 with the exception of 2004 05 the first relatively wet year following roadworks annual tss loads in main creek are typically similar or lower than the other catchments 3 3 rainfall and runoff event time scale in all catchments rainfall typically occurs in short duration high intensity events resulting in flashy storm hydrographs with short flow durations fig 6 between 2002 03 and 2016 17 90 83 and 44 runoff events occurred in wheel weany and main creeks respectively event rainfall amount is significantly higher in weany creek than in wheel creek during the second dry period p 0 01 fig 6a event runoff is significantly higher in both wheel and main creeks than in weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 01 fig 6b the rainfall runoff ratio is significantly higher in wheel creek than in weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 01 fig 6c peak rainfall intensity is significantly higher p 0 01 in main creek than in both wheel and weany creeks during the middle wet period and during the second dry period wheel only fig 6e there is a signficant positive linear relationship between event log10 rainfall and event log10 runoff p 0 01 in each catchment fig 6f catchment site had a significant effect on the intercept of the regression p 0 01 being higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks fig 6f during the study period only 21 16 and 25 of runoff events in wheel weany and main creeks respectively have total runoff 20 mm while the proportion of total measured runoff volume represented by these events is 85 79 and 82 respectively 3 4 sediment and nutrient loads event time scale in each period i e first dry middle wet second dry there is no significant difference p 0 05 in event tss or tp loads among the catchments fig 7 tn loads in main creek are significantly higher than weany creek during the middle wet period p 0 05 in all three catchments total sediment and nutrient loads are dominated by a few large runoff events i e events with 20 mm runoff these larger runoff events produce 73 74 71 78 and 74 77 of the total tss tn and tp loads respectively at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between event log10 runoff and event i log10 tss load fig 8 a ii log10 tn load fig 8b and iii log10 tp load fig 8c catchment site had a significant effect p 0 01 on the intercept of the regression of event runoff and event tss load being higher in weany creek than in wheel and main creeks catchment site also had a significant effect p 0 01 on the intercept of the regression of event runoff and event tn load being higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks at all sites there is signficant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between event log10 rainfall and event i log10 tss load fig 8d ii log10 tn load fig 8e and iii log10 tp load fig 8f catchment site had a significant effect p 0 05 on the intercept of the regression of event rainfall with event tss load and with event tn load in both cases the intercept is significantly higher in wheel creek than in weany and main creeks 3 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty of estimated tss tn and tp loads varies depending on the method used to estimate concentration for unsampled time periods the number of samples collected during an event and the position of those samples on the storm hydrograph supplementary table 4 in most years tss loads were estimated using tss turbidity relationships between 77 and 94 of the variation in tss concentrations is explained by the various tss turbidity models applied table 2 tss loads estimated using the tss turbidity method are on average within 16 of the reference load in the few years where turbidity data were unavailable tss loads were estimated using the linear interpolation method in line with the approach used to estimate tn and tp loads tss tn and tp loads estimated using the linear interpolation method with 3 samples are within 12 16 of the reference load tss tn and tp loads estimated using the mean concentration of all samples collected in that year are within 7 11 of the reference load tn and tp loads estimated using a mean concentration of all samples collected in years with similar runoff are within 29 49 of the reference load it is acknowledged that reference events used to provide the best estimate of true load in this analysis will have their own degree of error but this error cannot be quantified with the available data 4 discussion 4 1 influence of rangeland management on runoff sediment and nutrient yields at the annual time scale main creek has typically lower rainfall runoff ratios fig 2 fewer runoff events supplementary table 1 and lower annual sediment concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 5 table 3 compared to the two grazed catchments further in two of the last five years of the record 2013 14 and 2016 17 no runoff was recorded in main creek despite receiving similar annual rainfall to the other catchments fig 2 overall the results suggest that historically lower grazing pressure and exclusion of cattle over 17 years in main creek may have facilitated increased infiltration capacity soil water storage and soil surface protection relative to other catchments ultimately reducing runoff and erosion and therefore sediment and nutrient yields the difference in annual runoff and sediment loads in main creek compared to the grazed catchments is likely associated with three specific differences in catchment condition firstly subsoil from gullies is understood to be the largest contributor to sediment yields in this environment wilkinson et al 2013 and in main creek catchment gullies tend to be shorter have much higher vegetation cover and biomass lower wall erosion rates and lower sediment yields wilkinson et al 2018 a smaller contribution of subsoil erosion in main creek is consistent with tn concentrations for a given tss concentration being significantly higher in main creek compared to the other catchments fig 4a in that nitrogen is more strongly associated with sediment derived from surface material i e hillslope erosion sources or areas with higher biomass as opposed to nutrient depleted subsurface i e gully derived soil garzon garcia et al 2014 secondly the predominant ground vegetation in main creek catchment is native perennial tussock grasses table 1 these grasses typically have higher biomass offer greater soil surface protection and promote more infiltration compared to the exotic stoloniferous indian couch that is prevalent in the other catchments ash et al 2011 bartley et al 2014 the prevalence of native perennial grasses in main creek catchment is likely to have reduced the amount and erosive potential of infiltration excess overland flow as has been demonstrated in previous plot scale studies mcivor et al 1995 roth 2004 the higher biomass in main creek can also be expected to have greater evapotranspiration which would increase the available soil water storage capacity at the start of rainfall events and therefore reduce the potential for sub surface overland flow although this effect is yet to be quantified finally main creek catchment had generally higher vegetation cover levels throughout the study supplementary fig 1 which would help to suppress sheetwash and rill erosion rates hernandez et al 2017 mcivor et al 1995 it must be noted the mean annual rainfall over the study period was 14 higher in wheel creek compared to main creek and wheel creek had eight 53 more large runoff events i e events with 20 mm runoff this could account for some of the differences in annual runoff and sediment loads between these two catchments fewer larger runoff events in main creek however may also reflect greater capacity for main creek to store more rainfall particularly given that event rainfall intensities in main creek tend to be higher fig 6e it is also possible that differences among the catchments in drainage structure fig 1 and overall hydrological and sediment connectivity may have contributed to differences in runoff and loads between main creek and the grazed catchments bracken and croke 2007 fryirs et al 2007 richards 2002 but quantifying such effects was beyond the scope of this study annual sediment and nutrient concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 5 table 3 in weany creek catchment where grazing pressure was reduced from 25 to 13 cattle per km2 at the commencement of monitoring are similar in magnitude to wheel creek catchment which maintained higher levels of grazing pressure 25 head per km2 during this study and 40 head per km2 historically failure to detect load reductions in weany creek during the study period does not necessarily mean that reducing grazing pressure will not reduce loads but does indicate that the recovery trajectory of erosion processes particularly gully erosion is slow in these degraded savanna systems requiring 15 years to become measurable o reagain et al 2005 indeed catchment systems are known to have an inherent lag time between management interventions and system response meals et al 2010 melland et al 2018 particularly in areas of low precipitation sidle and sharma 1996 walling and kleo 1979 it may also be possible that these degraded savanna ecosystems have crossed a critical tipping point beyond which major recovery in ecosystem function is very difficult to achieve bestelmeyer 2006 laurance et al 2011 in parts of the catchment particularly around gullies the a horizon is completely removed due to past grazing pressure leading to chronic exposure of poor fertility subsoils which have higher dry bulk density than do areas with an intact soil organic layer bartley et al 2010a recovery of soil hydrological function in such areas is extremely difficult bartley et al 2014 roth 2004 it can be expected that gullies will also recover more slowly than flatter areas away from drainage lines koci et al 2019 priorities for investments to improve water quality must recognise the apparent slow recovery rates in catchment runoff sediment and nutrient yields which result from reductions in grazing pressure alone additional remediation interventions e g gully erosion control may be needed to expedite improvements in water quality gully erosion is believed to provide the dominant source of sediments and particulate nutrients to the gbr koci et al 2017 waterhouse et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2018 it is commonly assumed that areas with high gully density will produce higher sediment yields than areas of lower gully density but this was not demonstrated in our study despite wheel creek catchment having almost twice the linear gully density of weany creek catchment table 1 the rate of increase in event tss load with event runoff is similar between the two catchments fig 8a this suggests that gullies in wheel creek catchment are more stable than in weany creek catchment and produce less sediment per unit area sidorchuk 1999 it could also suggest that gullies in weany catchment are more connected to the main stream channel or that there is less opportunity for sediment deposition bracken and croke 2007 indeed runoff events in weany creek tend to have higher tss loads fig 8a than equivalent runoff events in terms of runoff amount in the other catchments indicating that there may be more available sediment higher sediment connectivity and or lower storage potential in this catchment in contrast rainfall events in wheel creek tend to produce more runoff fig 6f and have higher tss fig 8d and tn loads fig 8e than equivalent rainfall events in terms of rainfall amount in the other catchments indicating that hillslopes in wheel creek may have lower infiltration capacity soil water storage and surface protection relative to other catchments rigorous analysis of the influence of catchment geomorphic features e g gully density hydrological connectivity sediment storage on rainfall runoff response and sediment and nutrient loads was beyond the scope of this study but may deserve further investigation e g bracken and croke 2007 koci et al 2019 large runoff events have a profound effect on total sediment and nutrient yields across all catchments over the study period 71 78 of the total tss tn and tp loads were generated from only 16 25 of events with runoff 20 mm these large runoff events typically have 100 mm rainfall with peak rainfall intensities up to 55 mm hr 1 and runoff durations 5 hr such events are likely to mobilise sediments and nutrients regardless of ground cover at the time of the event as has been demonstrated in previous studies e g mcivor et al 1995 scanlan et al 1996 grazing management practices that promote increased ground cover and biomass are therefore likely to have the greatest effect on reducing loads during smaller to moderate less intense rainfall events overall at the event timescale there are not clear differences in runoff sediment and nutrient loads among the catchments for example in each period i e first dry middle wet second dry there are not significant differences in event sediment loads among the catchments fig 7 further across all runoff events the rate of increase in event runoff with event rainfall fig 6f and the rate of increase in event sediment and nutrient loads with event runoff and event rainfall fig 8 is similar among the catchments variability in the relationships between event rainfall amount and event runoff and event tss tn and tp loads indicated by modest r2 values figs 6f 8 suggests that within and between event variations in factors other than rainfall and runoff amount exert a strong influence on loads the time it takes for sediment and nutrients generated via hillslope and gully erosion processes to reach stream channels for example will vary depending upon the size and intensity of the rainfall event time between successive events and overall hydrological and sediment connectivity meals et al 2010 sidle et al 2017 stream bank erosion processes can also episodically mobilise large amounts of sediment bartley et al 2007 florsheim et al 2008 the load measured for a particular event can therefore be influenced by erosion and transport that occurred during recent prior events we acknowledge that data reported herein may not have adequately captured this variability in many events particularly with regard to nutrients nonetheless our findings provide new insights into the amounts of sediments and nutrients exported from these headwater catchments where there is a dearth of information road construction can significantly increase sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads particularly in the following year or so especially when undertaken during the wet season the roadwork in main creek catchment during the 2003 04 wet season likely explained the elevated sediment and nutrient concentrations that year and the following year fig 3 while rainfall and loads were low in 2003 04 an increase in rainfall and runoff the following year may have mobilised readily available sediment producing higher sediment and nutrient loads in 2004 05 fig 5 numerous studies have documented the environmental impact of roads and trails which not only mobilise large amounts of sediments during construction but also provide direct conduits for flow concentration increasing catchment connectivity croke and mockler 2001 koci et al 2019 sidle et al 2004 given the potential impact on sediment and nutrient loads the timing and extent of road works and other earthworks must be carefully considered in catchment management military training activities in main creek catchment as well as legacy activities such as dispersed mining and previous grazing bartley et al 2018 could also have elevated sediment and nutrient loads at various times throughout the record although we were unable to quantify such impacts 4 2 significance of sediment and nutrient yields from savanna rangelands across all study catchments mean annual tss tn and tp loads were estimated as 1 2 t ha 1 1 9 kg ha 1 0 4 kg ha 1 respectively table 3 considering that the majority of the upper burdekin catchment has grazing pressure consistent with wheel and weany creek rather than main creek the mean annual tss tn and tp loads for these two catchments 1 4 t ha 1 2 2 kg ha 1 and 0 4 kg ha 1 respectively is perhaps more representative of rangelands in this region these estimates are within the range of sediment loads reported in other semi arid rangeland environments e g nearing et al 2007 nichols et al 2013 polyakov et al 2010 our sediment load estimates are similar to those predicted for the entire upper burdekin catchment 1 5 t ha 1 yr 1 bainbridge et al 2012 our estimates of sediment and nutrient loads however are much larger than those predicted for the burdekin river basin as a whole which is consistent with existence of drier areas in the inland part of the basin bainbridge et al 2012 and with the greater opportunities for storage at broader scales bartley et al 2018 sidle et al 2017 for example kroon 2012 estimated mean annual loads of tss tn and tp in the burdekin river basin to be 0 3 t ha 1 0 6 kg ha 1 and 0 1 kg ha 1 respectively while we cannot assume that all sediments and nutrients generated in these headwaters will be transported to the gbr lagoon or that mean estimates of load presented herein are directly applicable to other catchments in the region it is clear that substantial sediments and nutrients are exported from savanna rangelands and that annual sediment and nutrient loads are sensitive to grazing pressure as well as to environmental variables 4 3 findings relevant to future water quality monitoring programs this study demonstrates the importance of long term monitoring of both water quality and catchment condition to adequately capture the effects of land management on sediment and nutrient yields particularly in the context of high climatic variability and long recovery trajectories ideally such monitoring should occur at nested spatial scales and include information on the response e g runoff and concentration as well as factors that will influence the change e g soil condition vegetation land use and climate and the processes driving sediment and nutrient mobilisation and transport e g infiltration excess and saturation overland flow hillslope gully and stream bank erosion sidle et al 2017 detailed measurements at smaller spatial e g plots hillslopes and shorter temporal scales e g 1 5 years may provide the data required to understand how a particular site is responding to land management change e g changes in soil infiltration capacity soil fertility vegetation cover and biomass however such data should always be nested within larger scale stream and catchment monitoring to evaluate how the effect of changing land management propagates throughout the system such information is invaluable not only for the parameterisation and validation of models used to estimate end of catchment sediment and nutrient loads but can also inform the implementation of optimal catchment management strategies mccloskey et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2014 5 conclusion this study compares 15 year records of runoff sediment and nutrient yields in three ephemeral headwater catchments 10 5 13 5 km2 with similar climate and landform characteristics but contrasting grazing management history key conclusions from this study include annual rainfall runoff ratios and total sediment loads are lower in a catchment where cattle were excluded over the study period compared to nearby grazed catchments higher annual sediment loads in the grazed catchments compared to the ungrazed catchment are likely due to degradation of soil water storage capacity soil surface protection and gully erosion rates but may also be influenced by differences in catchment hydrological and sediment connectivity overall at the event timescale there are not clear differences in runoff sediment and nutrient loads among the catchments attributed to variability in catchment conditions e g antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity vegetation that occur within and between events rainfall and runoff are key drivers of variations in annual and event sediment and nutrient loads with most of the total export associated with only a few large events i e 20 mm runoff management interventions focused on improving ground cover and increasing grass biomass are likely to be most effective in reducing sediment and nutrient loads during smaller events recovery of degraded savanna rangelands is slow and strongly influenced by climate and hydrological response it may take several decades before a clear sediment and nutrient load response to reduced grazing pressure becomes detectable in these ephemeral streams this needs to be accounted for in water quality target setting and broader catchment management additional remediation interventions e g gully erosion control will be needed to expedite improvements in water quality road works or other physical disturbances can significantly increase sediment and nutrient concentrations and loads in the short term such activities should be avoided during the rainy season to minimise loads measuring recovery in water quality requires nested spatial monitoring over long time scales that includes information on the response e g runoff and concentration as well as factors that will influence the change e g soil condition vegetation land use and climate and the processes driving sediment and nutrient mobilisation and transport e g hillslope gully and stream bank erosion as this is one of only a few long term studies to evaluate water quality in headwater catchments following changes in grazing management in the gbr catchments it will have important implications for future investments in land management change and will be a reference for catchment and marine monitoring modelling and management both locally and
