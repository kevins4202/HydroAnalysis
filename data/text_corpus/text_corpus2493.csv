reaction between epoxide compound ep and secondary amine in the copolymer pdd of methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and diallylamine daa a branched structure was introduced into the side chain of pdd three kinds of typical industrial wastewater including sodium humate naha solution bentonite suspension and oilfield produced water pw were chosen to be treated by the branched pdd the pollutants in the three wastewaters had different forms and they were water soluble organics solid particles and liquid droplets respectively the effects of flocculant structure and flocculation process on flocculation performance were discussed the experimental results showed that branched pdd can effectively improve the flocculation performance of pdd dre contains an aromatic ring which may enhance the interaction between pdd g dre and naha to promote flocculation the pdd g gte obtained from the reaction of gte and pdd contains many hydroxyl groups which can form hydrogen bonds with the silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface of bentonite to promote flocculation tdm contains two benzene rings which made pdd g tdm have hydrophobicity the flocculation can be enhanced because of the hydrophobic interaction between pdd g tdm and oil droplets this work provides a new understanding of the synthesis and performance of branched cationic polymer flocculants graphical abstract

the most basic materials for human survival daily life and production activities with the development of industrialization water pollution has become the main factor restricting economic and social development 1 2 in order to avoid environmental pollution industrial wastewater needs to be treated before being discharged the removal of pollutants from wastewater by flocculation is one of the main methods for treating industrial wastewater 3 7 and is also the focus of green chemistry research at present the commonly used flocculants include inorganic flocculants organic polymer flocculants and microbial flocculants among them organic polymer flocculants are widely used in various industrial wastewater treatments due to their high molecular weight high charge density and strong resistance to ph change typical organic polymer flocculants include linear polymers prepared by polymerization of acryloyloxyethylenetrimethyl ammonium chloride dac 8 11 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc 12 15 and diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dmdaac 5 16 18 however the disadvantages of high viscosity 19 low charge utilization 20 and easy entanglement of molecular chains 21 make it difficult for linear flocculants to meet the current requirements of efficient wastewater treatment less flocculant dosage and faster flocculation speed therefore developing efficient new flocculant has always been the research focus of wastewater treatment many researchers have found that introducing a branched structure into a polymer chain can improve its flocculation ability in removing solid particles and dissolved organic matter 1 5 17 22 26 compared with linear flocculant branched flocculant has less chain entanglement and higher cation utilization when used in wastewater treatment it can overcome the shortcomings of linear flocculant and show excellent treatment performance wang et al 27 confirmed that a flocculant with a branched structure showed better flocculation performance in flocculating bentonite suspension when the branched flocculant cts g pamd was used to treat bentonite suspension at the dosage of 0 4 mg l the turbidity reduction was 97 while the optimal dosage of linear flocculant cts cta and pac was 3 5 times and 10 times cts g pamd respectively they believed that at the optimal dosage linear flocculant played a flocculation role through charge neutralization while branched flocculant enhanced the flocculation result not only through charge neutralization but also through the bridging action chen et al 28 used maleic anhydride ma as the bridge between chitosan cs and polyacrylamide and successfully prepared a new chelating flocculant with branched structure pam g m cs ma the flocculant was used to capture heavy metals when the flocculant dosage was 20 mg l the removal rates of cu2 and cd2 was 96 12 and 91 58 respectively which were about 2 5 times and 1 5 times cs and cs ma the branched structure of pam g m cs ma promoted the formation of large and stable flocs through adsorption and bridging sweeping effect wu et al 29 prepared a starch based flocculant st g pdmc lpuv by low pressure ultraviolet irradiation and used to remove humic acid ha in water its optimum dosage was 20 mg l and the removal rate of ha was close to 90 guo et al 30 synthesized four flocculants with different charge densities molecular weights and chain architectures a series of flocculation experiments of dyes solution show that the flocculation performance of branched flocculant was better than that of linear flocculant and the maximum dye removal was 95 sodium humate naha solution bentonite suspension and oilfield produced water pw are three common types of wastewaters their pollutants have different characteristics and their treatment has been studied many researchers 31 33 naha is water soluble and wastewater containing naha is a homogeneous solution which is usually produced from aquaculture 34 and naha concentration is in range of 50 1000 mg l for the removal of naha modified natural organic polymers such as starch based 29 32 and alginate based 35 flocculants are commonly used to remove naha the removal rate of naha was over 90 bentonite suspension is produced from drilling it is a heterogeneous suspension system containing solid particles 36 and usually the concentration of bentonite suspension is in range of 1000 2000 mg l polyacrylamide 31 37 38 and quaternary ammonium salt flocculants 39 are commonly used to treat bentonite suspensions the maximum turbidity reduction rate bentonite suspension was 99 pw is produced from oilfield exploitation it is an oil in water emulsion 40 and usually the oil content in water is in range of 500 20 000 mg l usually the flocculation treatment of pw is carried out by pdmc 41 42 pdac 43 and pdmdaac 33 which are representatives of cationic polymer flocculants their oil removal rate was in range from 85 to 99 naha bentonite particles and oil droplets have different densities and surface properties which will affect the flocculation process to our knowledge there is no research on the relationship among wastewater types flocculant structures and flocculation processes in this paper a series of branched flocculants pdd g x were prepared by the reaction between epoxide compound ep and secondary amine in the copolymer pdd of methacryloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride dmc and diallylamine daa taking naha aqueous solution bentonite suspension and pw as treatment objects the influences of pdd g x structure and flocculation process on the flocculation result were investigated the structure requirements of different wastewater on pdd g x and the differences in the flocculation process of different wastewater were discussed 2 experiments 2 1 chemicals dmc 80 wt

purchased from sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd beijing china pw was provided by beijing research center of china national offshore oil corporation and the oil density was 0 946 g cm3 naha aqueous solution and bentonite suspension was made by ourselves the physical parameters of the three kinds of wastewater are shown in table 1 2 2 synthesis of ep modified pdd pdd g x the synthesis route of pdd g x is shown in fig 1 firstly dmc and daa were used as monomers to synthesize pdd according to our previous work 41 the synthesis method was as follows in a 250 ml reaction flask dmc and daa were added successively with stirring and the mass ratio of dmc to daa was 4 1 hcl was added with the same molar as daa and deionized water was added to make the total monomer concentration 50 wt after hcl was fully dissolved nitrogen was passed for 30 min and raise the temperature to 60 c aps 0 4 wt of the monomer was added and reacted for 8 h to obtain a yellow viscous liquid namely pdd then pdd and ep were used as raw materials and pdd g x was obtained by an addition reaction between ep and secondary amine in pdd the process was as follows deionized water was added to the pdd solution to make the pdd concentration to be 20 wt and then naoh was added to adjust the ph to 7 ep was added to the solution and stirred to obtain pdd g x 8 kinds of ep were used in this reaction and their structures are shown in fig 2 2 3 characterization after the reaction the product was freeze dried for 24 h and the solid powder of the flocculant was obtained ir spectrum was conducted by wqf 520 fourier transform infrared spectrometer beifen ruili china 1h nmr spectrum was conducted on bruker avanceiiihd 400 nuclear magnetic analyzer bruker germany by using d2o as solvent 2 4 molecular weight determination after the reaction the apparent viscosity of the product was tested by a dv ii pro rotary viscometer brookfield usa at 25 c under the condition of 0 rotor and 1 rpm rotation speed the apparent viscosity can indirectly reflect the molecular weight the greater the molecular weight the higher the apparent viscosity of the product the intrinsic viscosity Î· of the product was measured in 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution with a ubbelohde viscometer at 30 c and the viscosity average molecular weight mÎ· was calculated according to the m h equation mÎ· 10 000 Î· 4 74 1 25 44 2 5 flocculation test the flocculation test was conducted according to the experimental method in literature 24 45 and 46 firstly the ph adjusted water sample is placed on the a six place programmed paddle flocculator model ta6 wuhan hengling technology co ltd china and the flocculant is added to the water sample after rapid stirring for 1 min at 500 rpm then the wastewater was rapidly stirred for 5 min at 250 rpm and slowly stirred for 10 min at 60 rpm to allow the floc growths at last the bentonite suspension stood for 5 min naha solution and pw stood for 30 min to allow the floc to separate from water after the flocculation test turbidity of the water was measured by turbidimeter 2100an hach usa and the turbidity reduction was calculated according to formula 1 1 turbidity redution t 0 t t 0 100 where t0 and t are the turbidity of the wastewater before and after flocculation respectively in addition during the flocculation test the zeta potential was measured with a zetapals zeta potential analyzer brookhaven corp usa at 25 c the morphology of flocs was observed by an inverted microscope eclipse ts2 nikon japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of synthesis conditions in this part bge was selected as the representative ep to optimize the reaction conditions of ep and pdd in theory after the reaction the molecular structure of pdd will be branched the molecular weight will increase and the apparent viscosity of the product will theoretically increase with the increasing reaction degree kept the molar ratio of bge to daa in pdd was 0 1 1 the effects of reaction temperature reaction time and ph on the reaction of bge with pdd were investigated by using the apparent viscosity of the product as the index under the condition of ph was 7 and reaction time was 6 h the effect of reaction temperature on the reaction result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 a with the increasing temperature the apparent viscosity first increased and then decreased the apparent viscosity had the highest value at the temperature of 60 c when the temperature was lower than 60 c the molecular movement was slow and the contact between bge and pdd was insufficient the reaction degree was low and the apparent viscosity was not high when the temperature was higher than 60 c the molecular chain of pdd curled intensely and the secondary amine in it was embedded the reaction probability between ep and pdd decreased and the apparent viscosity decreased therefore the recommended reaction temperature was 60 c the experimental results of the effect of reaction time on the reaction result are shown in fig 3 b as the reaction time was prolonged the reaction degree increased gradually and the maximum apparent viscosity was obtained at 8 h when the reaction time exceeded 8 h and the reaction degree was too high the product structure changed from a branched structure to a cross linked structure and some of the products were insoluble in water resulting in a viscosity decrease therefore the recommended reaction time was 8 h under the condition of reaction temperature was 60 c and reaction time was 8 h the effect of ph on the reaction result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 c it was found that when ph was 9 there was the highest apparent viscosity because the base can act as a catalyst to promote the ring opening addition reaction therefore the ph of the reaction was recommended to be 9 based on the above experimental results the reaction conditions between ep and pdd were recommended as follows reaction temperature was 60 c reaction time was 8 h and ph 9 3 2 characterization the structure of pdd bge synthesized at recommended condition was characterized fig 4 shows the ir spectra of pdd and pdd g bge 3453 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of nh the peak of pdd g bge at 3453 cm 1 is narrower than that of pdd which proves that there was a reaction for the amine group the peak of 1160 cm 1 in pdd is caused by cn stretching vibration while the peak of pdd g bge is stronger at this wavenumber because there are not only cn stretching peaks but also coc stretching vibration peaks based on the above analysis we believed that pdd g bge had been successfully prepared fig 5 shows the 1h nmr spectra of pdd and pdd g bge compared with pdd there was a broad split peak at a chemical shift of 3 72 ppm in pdd g bge which was due to the formation of ch 2 o ch 2 after bge reacted with pdd the result further proved that the pdd g bge had been successfully prepared 3 3 effects of ep type and amount on pdd g x synthesis a series of products were prepared by changing the ep type and the molar ratio of daa in pdd to ep their appearance and apparent viscosities are shown in table 2 with the increasing molar ratio of daa to ep the apparent viscosity gradually increased but when the molar ratio was too high the product structure changed from branched to cross linked and the product presented a turbid and heterogeneous state in addition with the increasing ep carbon chain the increasing steric hindrance reduced the reaction degree resulting in a viscosity decrease with the increasing number of an epoxy group the apparent viscosity increased significantly because the number of branches of the product increased in order to further confirm the reaction the mÎ· of some products was determined and the results are shown in table 3 the molecular weight of pdd was 1 36 10 6 which was much lower than that of pdd g x the result also proved that the reaction between ep and pdd had happened 3 4 effect of pdd g x type on wastewater treatment the stable products listed in table 2 were used for treating naha solution bentonite suspension and pw the flocculation results are shown in table 4 the turbidity decreasing trend can be directly seen in the supplementary information fig s1 the turbidity reductions of naha solution bentonite suspension and pw by pdd were 40 2 75 1 and 70 3 respectively for naha solution pdd g dre molar ratio of daa to dre was 1 0 08 had the highest turbidity reduction of 83 7 for bentonite suspension pdd g gte molar ratio of daa to gte was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 87 3 for pw pdd g tdm molar ratio of daa to tdm was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 85 2 the results proved that a flocculant with a branched structure had a better flocculation performance than a linear flocculant humic acid is an amorphous natural polymer and it is generally presumed to be a condensation polymer of aromatic heterocycle and ester ring with many sides chains dre contains an aromatic ring which may enhance the interaction between pdd g dre and naha to promote flocculation the pdd g gte obtained from the reaction of gte and pdd contains many hydroxyl groups which can form hydrogen bonds with the silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface of bentonite to promote flocculation tdm contains two benzene rings which made pdd g tdm have hydrophobicity the flocculation can be enhanced because of the hydrophobic interaction between pdd g tdm and oil droplets based on the above experimental results it can be found that introducing groups having interactions with pollutants was a favor for the performance of the flocculant the stable products listed in table 2 were used for treating naha solution bentonite suspension and pw the flocculation results are shown in table 4 the turbidity decreasing trend can be directly seen in the supplementary information fig s1 the turbidity reductions of naha solution bentonite suspension and pw by pdd were 40 2 75 1 and 70 3 respectively for naha solution pdd g dre molar ratio of daa to dre was 1 0 08 had the highest turbidity reduction of 83 7 for bentonite suspension pdd g gte molar ratio of daa to gte was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 87 3 for pw pdd g tdm molar ratio of daa to tdm was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 85 2 the results proved that a flocculant with a branched structure had a better flocculation performance than a linear flocculant humic acid is an amorphous natural polymer and it is generally presumed to be a condensation polymer of aromatic heterocycle and ester ring with many sides chains dre contains an aromatic ring which may enhance the interaction between pdd g dre and naha to promote flocculation the pdd g gte obtained from the reaction of gte and pdd contains many hydroxyl groups which can form hydrogen bonds with the silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface of bentonite to promote flocculation tdm contains two benzene rings which made pdd g tdm have hydrophobicity the flocculation can be enhanced because of the hydrophobic interaction between pdd g tdm and oil droplets based on the above experimental results it can be found that introducing groups having interactions with pollutants was a favor for the performance of the flocculant the micromorphology of flocs formed by pdd and pdd g x were compared and the results are shown in fig 6 it was obvious that the flocs formed by pdd g x were much larger than that of pdd there were two reasons for this result 1 the branched flocculant had the extended multi side chain which had a higher collision probability with pollutants 2 the branched flocculant had stronger interaction with pollutants both reasons can enhance the flocculation bridging and form larger flocs 3 5 investigation of the flocculation process several factors include ph flocculant dosage rapid stirring speed rapid stirring time and temperature have great effects on the flocculation process in this part the flocculation processes of pdd g dre for naha solution pdd g gte for bentonite suspension and pdd g tdm for pw were studied 3 5 1 effect of ph when the temperature was 25 c the stirring speed was 250 rpm and the stirring time was 5 min the effect of ph on the flocculation result was studied and the results are shown in fig 7 after the ph was adjusted the naha solution and pw stood for 30 min and the bentonite suspension stood for 5 min to observe whether the system was stable there are various functional groups in naha molecule such as hydroxyl groups thiol groups carbonyl groups and carboxyl groups which were sensitive to ph 47 the solution system was unstable when ph 3 with the increase of ph the turbidity reduction of pdd g dre decreased first and then increased when ph 10 the flocculation result was poor and when ph was 13 the flocculant result was good before the treatment the naha solution was homogeneous after the flocculant addition the flocs were produced and the solution became the heterogeneous dispersion the flocs were small and were difficult to settle therefore the turbidity increased and the turbidity reduction was negative with the increasing ph the number and size of flocs increased when ph was 13 pdd g dre obtained the best flocculation performance the side group of naha contains carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups the dissociation of h in carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups is directly related to the ph 29 47 when the ph was low carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups existed in the form of cooh and aroh respectively when the ph was high they existed in the form of coo and aro 29 and the electrostatic interaction between naha and pdd g dre was strong therefore the flocculation bridging performance of pdd g dre was good and the ph of the naha solution before treatment was recommended to be 13 for bentonite suspension the presence of amphoteric groups in the bentonite structure such as al oh and si oh gave rise to fluctuating positive and negative charges at the edges of the layers 31 when ph 3 the solution system was unstable when ph 5 the experimental results showed that the turbidity reduction of pdd g gte gradually increased with the increasing ph but the change was not significant when ph was 13 the wastewater was almost completely clear and transparent and the turbidity reduction was 98 4 for pw the turbidity reduction increased with the increasing ph especially when the ph was 7 in conclusion ph had a significant impact on the treatment of naha solution and pw 3 5 2 effect of flocculant dosage under the same flocculating conditions as listed in 3 5 1 the effect of flocculant dosage on flocculation result was investigated and the results are shown in fig 8 with the increasing flocculant dosage the zeta potential of pollutants in water gradually changed from negative to positive and the turbidity reduction of three kinds of wastewater increased first and then decreased when the dosage was insufficient the possibility of polluted particles colliding with flocculants was so low that flocculation performance was poor when the dosage was excessive the excessive flocculant could play a dispersed and stable role 19 the aforementioned phenomena were attributed to the charge neutralization flocculation effects 48 usually the pollutant stability in water is the worst when the zeta potential is about zero and the turbidity reduction has the highest value at this time the initial zeta potential of the naha solution was 78 89 mv when the flocculant dosage was 240 mg l the zeta potential was 5 38 mv and the turbidity reduction was 87 4 this was similar to the flocculation result of synthetic flocculant reported in reference 32 at the same dosage the zeta potential of the bentonite particles was 79 97 mv when the flocculant dosage was 8 mg l the zeta potential changed from negative to positive but the turbidity reduction had a maximum of 93 2 when the dosage was 12 mg l compared with the reference 39 the turbidity reduction rate reported in this reference was 90 only when the flocculant dosage was 450 mg l and this dosage was about 37 times more than pdd g gte dosage the result showed that the flocculation mechanism pdd g gte not only the electrostatic neutralization but also the hydrogen bond adsorption the zeta potential of oil droplets in pw was 43 04 mv when the flocculant dosage was 16 mg l the zeta potential was positive and the turbidity reduction had a maximum of 94 2 in summary there was an appropriate flocculant dosage for treating three kinds of wastewater and the flocculant dosage required for treating water soluble organic pollutants was significantly larger than the other two types of pollutants 3 5 3 effect of stirring speed the effect of stirring speed on the flocculation result was investigated and the results are shown in fig 9 in addition the flocs at different stirring speeds were observed as shown in fig 10 for the naha solution the lower the stirring speed was the better the flocculation result was the floc was much larger at low speed and the floc size decreased with the increasing stirring speed because of naha solution was homogeneous the solution changed from homogeneous to heterogeneous after the flocculant addition and the flocs formed and grew at the slow speed flocs had enough time to grow but when the stirring speed was too high the flocs had no time to become large for bentonite suspension when the stirring speed was in the range of 100 to 300 rpm the stirring speed had little effect on the flocculation performance indicating that the anti crushing performance of bentonite flocs was good for pw with the increasing stirring speed the turbidity reduction gradually increased and then changed slightly the increased stirring speed was conducive to the collision between oil droplets and flocculants but the flocs structure would be destroyed when the stirring speed was too high 49 to sum up the high rapid stirring speed was not conducive to the flocculation of water soluble organic pollutants but had little effect on the flocculation of solid particles and oil droplets 3 5 4 effect of stirring time the effect of stirring time on flocculation result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 11 in the meantime the flocs under different stirring times were observed as shown in fig 12 for the naha solution as the increasing stirring time the turbidity reduction increased first and then decreased the change in floc size had a similar result when the stirring time was 1 min the flocculation result was poor and the turbidity reduction was only 64 3 when the stirring time was 3 min the turbidity reduction had the highest value of 90 4 for bentonite suspension the turbidity reduction increased with stirring time firstly and then had little change when the stirring time was 5 min the turbidity reduction was 93 4 and the highest turbidity reduction was 94 4 when the stirring time was 7 min for pw the effect of stirring time on flocculation result had a similar result as naha solution in a word the stirring time required for the three kinds of wastewater to achieve the best flocculation result was close 3 5 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the flocculation result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 13 with the increasing temperature the turbidity reduction increased first and then decreased for three kinds of wastewater the most suitable temperature was 55 c naha solution 45 c bentonite suspension and 65 c pw respectively the increasing temperature improved the collision probability between the flocculant and the pollutant and promoted flocculation however the increasing temperature was unfavorable to the flocculation because the curling degree of the flocculant molecular increased the two effects competed resulting in an optimal temperature for the treatment it can be found that the effect of temperature on the flocculation of three kinds of wastewater was similar 4 conclusion using ep to modify pdd based on polymer reaction can effectively improve the flocculation performance of pdd pdd g dre 240 mg l reduced the turbidity of naha solution from 208 ntu to 12 9 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 53 6 higher than that of pdd pdd g gte 12 mg l reduced the turbidity of bentonite suspension from 908 ntu to 15 6 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 23 2 higher than that of pdd pdd g gte 16 mg l reduced the turbidity of pw from 770 ntu to 30 8 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 26 2 higher than that of pdd when the cationic polymer flocculant was branched introducing groups interacting with pollutants including hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bond etc would be more conducive to flocculation ph had a significant impact on the flocculation of naha and oil droplets the dosage of flocculant required to treat naha was much higher than that of the other two types of the pollutant high rapid stirring speed was not conducive to the flocculation of naha but had little effect on the flocculation of solid particles and oil droplets the rapid stirring time required for the three kinds of wastewater to achieve the best flocculation result was close the effect of temperature on the flocculation of three kinds of wastewater was similar the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1

linear flocculant cts cta and pac was 3 5 times and 10 times cts g pamd respectively they believed that at the optimal dosage linear flocculant played a flocculation role through charge neutralization

dmc and diallylamine daa taking naha aqueous solution bentonite suspension and pw as treatment objects the influences of pdd g x structure and flocculation process on the flocculation result were investigated the structure requirements of different wastewater on pdd g x and the differences in the flocculation process of different wastewater were discussed 2 experiments 2 1 chemicals dmc 80 wt

purchased from sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd beijing china pw was provided by beijing research center of china national offshore oil corporation and the oil density was 0 946 g cm3 naha aqueous solution and bentonite suspension was made by ourselves the physical parameters of the three kinds of wastewater are shown in table 1 2 2 synthesis of ep modified pdd pdd g x the synthesis route of pdd g x is shown in fig 1 firstly dmc and daa were used as monomers to synthesize pdd according to our previous work 41 the synthesis method was as follows in a 250 ml reaction flask dmc and daa were added successively with stirring and the mass ratio of dmc to daa was 4 1 hcl was added with the same molar as daa and deionized water was added to make the total monomer concentration 50 wt after hcl was fully dissolved nitrogen was passed for 30 min and raise the temperature to 60 c aps 0 4 wt of the monomer was added and reacted for 8 h to obtain a yellow viscous liquid namely pdd then pdd and ep were used as raw materials and pdd g x was obtained by an addition reaction between ep and secondary amine in pdd the process was as follows deionized water was added to the pdd solution to make the pdd concentration to be 20 wt and then naoh was added to adjust the ph to 7 ep was added to the solution and stirred to obtain pdd g x 8 kinds of ep were used in this reaction and their structures are shown in fig 2 2 3 characterization after the reaction the product was freeze dried for 24 h and the solid powder of the flocculant was obtained ir spectrum was conducted by wqf 520 fourier transform infrared spectrometer beifen ruili china 1h nmr spectrum was conducted on bruker avanceiiihd 400 nuclear magnetic analyzer bruker germany by using d2o as solvent 2 4 molecular weight determination after the reaction the apparent viscosity of the product was tested by a dv ii pro rotary viscometer brookfield usa at 25 c under the condition of 0 rotor and 1 rpm rotation speed the apparent viscosity can indirectly reflect the molecular weight the greater the molecular weight the higher the apparent viscosity of the product the intrinsic viscosity Î· of the product was measured in 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution with a ubbelohde viscometer at 30 c and the viscosity average molecular weight mÎ· was calculated according to the m h equation mÎ· 10 000 Î· 4 74 1 25 44 2 5 flocculation test the flocculation test was conducted according to the experimental method in literature 24 45 and 46 firstly the ph adjusted water sample is placed on the a six place programmed paddle flocculator model ta6 wuhan hengling technology co ltd china and the flocculant is added to the water sample after rapid stirring for 1 min at 500 rpm then the wastewater was rapidly stirred for 5 min at 250 rpm and slowly stirred for 10 min at 60 rpm to allow the floc growths at last the bentonite suspension stood for 5 min naha solution and pw stood for 30 min to allow the floc to separate from water after the flocculation test turbidity of the water was measured by turbidimeter 2100an hach usa and the turbidity reduction was calculated according to formula 1 1 turbidity redution t 0 t t 0 100 where t0 and t are the turbidity of the wastewater before and after flocculation respectively in addition during the flocculation test the zeta potential was measured with a zetapals zeta potential analyzer brookhaven corp usa at 25 c the morphology of flocs was observed by an inverted microscope eclipse ts2 nikon japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of synthesis conditions in this part bge was selected as the representative ep to optimize the reaction conditions of ep and pdd in theory after the reaction the molecular structure of pdd will be branched the molecular weight will increase and the apparent viscosity of the product will theoretically increase with the increasing reaction degree kept the molar ratio of bge to daa in pdd was 0 1 1 the effects of reaction temperature reaction time and ph on the reaction of bge with pdd were investigated by using the apparent viscosity of the product as the index under the condition of ph was 7 and reaction time was 6 h the effect of reaction temperature on the reaction result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 a with the increasing temperature the apparent viscosity first increased and then decreased the apparent viscosity had the highest value at the temperature of 60 c when the temperature was lower than 60 c the molecular movement was slow and the contact between bge and pdd was insufficient the reaction degree was low and the apparent viscosity was not high when the temperature was higher than 60 c the molecular chain of pdd curled intensely and the secondary amine in it was embedded the reaction probability between ep and pdd decreased and the apparent viscosity decreased therefore the recommended reaction temperature was 60 c the experimental results of the effect of reaction time on the reaction result are shown in fig 3 b as the reaction time was prolonged the reaction degree increased gradually and the maximum apparent viscosity was obtained at 8 h when the reaction time exceeded 8 h and the reaction degree was too high the product structure changed from a branched structure to a cross linked structure and some of the products were insoluble in water resulting in a viscosity decrease therefore the recommended reaction time was 8 h under the condition of reaction temperature was 60 c and reaction time was 8 h the effect of ph on the reaction result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 c it was found that when ph was 9 there was the highest apparent viscosity because the base can act as a catalyst to promote the ring opening addition reaction therefore the ph of the reaction was recommended to be 9 based on the above experimental results the reaction conditions between ep and pdd were recommended as follows reaction temperature was 60 c reaction time was 8 h and ph 9 3 2 characterization the structure of pdd bge synthesized at recommended condition was characterized fig 4 shows the ir spectra of pdd and pdd g bge 3453 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of nh the peak of pdd g bge at 3453 cm 1 is narrower than that of pdd which proves that there was a reaction for the amine group the peak of 1160 cm 1 in pdd is caused by cn stretching vibration while the peak of pdd g bge is stronger at this wavenumber because there are not only cn stretching peaks but also coc stretching vibration peaks based on the above analysis we believed that pdd g bge had been successfully prepared fig 5 shows the 1h nmr spectra of pdd and pdd g bge compared with pdd there was a broad split peak at a chemical shift of 3 72 ppm in pdd g bge which was due to the formation of ch 2 o ch 2 after bge reacted with pdd the result further proved that the pdd g bge had been successfully prepared 3 3 effects of ep type and amount on pdd g x synthesis a series of products were prepared by changing the ep type and the molar ratio of daa in pdd to ep their appearance and apparent viscosities are shown in table 2 with the increasing molar ratio of daa to ep the apparent viscosity gradually increased but when the molar ratio was too high the product structure changed from branched to cross linked and the product presented a turbid and heterogeneous state in addition with the increasing ep carbon chain the increasing steric hindrance reduced the reaction degree resulting in a viscosity decrease with the increasing number of an epoxy group the apparent viscosity increased significantly because the number of branches of the product increased in order to further confirm the reaction the mÎ· of some products was determined and the results are shown in table 3 the molecular weight of pdd was 1 36 10 6 which was much lower than that of pdd g x the result also proved that the reaction between ep and pdd had happened 3 4 effect of pdd g x type on wastewater treatment the stable products listed in table 2 were used for treating naha solution bentonite suspension and pw the flocculation results are shown in table 4 the turbidity decreasing trend can be directly seen in the supplementary information fig s1 the turbidity reductions of naha solution bentonite suspension and pw by pdd were 40 2 75 1 and 70 3 respectively for naha solution pdd g dre molar ratio of daa to dre was 1 0 08 had the highest turbidity reduction of 83 7 for bentonite suspension pdd g gte molar ratio of daa to gte was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 87 3 for pw pdd g tdm molar ratio of daa to tdm was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 85 2 the results proved that a flocculant with a branched structure had a better flocculation performance than a linear flocculant humic acid is an amorphous natural polymer and it is generally presumed to be a condensation polymer of aromatic heterocycle and ester ring with many sides chains dre contains an aromatic ring which may enhance the interaction between pdd g dre and naha to promote flocculation the pdd g gte obtained from the reaction of gte and pdd contains many hydroxyl groups which can form hydrogen bonds with the silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface of bentonite to promote flocculation tdm contains two benzene rings which made pdd g tdm have hydrophobicity the flocculation can be enhanced because of the hydrophobic interaction between pdd g tdm and oil droplets based on the above experimental results it can be found that introducing groups having interactions with pollutants was a favor for the performance of the flocculant the stable products listed in table 2 were used for treating naha solution bentonite suspension and pw the flocculation results are shown in table 4 the turbidity decreasing trend can be directly seen in the supplementary information fig s1 the turbidity reductions of naha solution bentonite suspension and pw by pdd were 40 2 75 1 and 70 3 respectively for naha solution pdd g dre molar ratio of daa to dre was 1 0 08 had the highest turbidity reduction of 83 7 for bentonite suspension pdd g gte molar ratio of daa to gte was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 87 3 for pw pdd g tdm molar ratio of daa to tdm was 1 0 03 had the highest turbidity reduction of 85 2 the results proved that a flocculant with a branched structure had a better flocculation performance than a linear flocculant humic acid is an amorphous natural polymer and it is generally presumed to be a condensation polymer of aromatic heterocycle and ester ring with many sides chains dre contains an aromatic ring which may enhance the interaction between pdd g dre and naha to promote flocculation the pdd g gte obtained from the reaction of gte and pdd contains many hydroxyl groups which can form hydrogen bonds with the silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface of bentonite to promote flocculation tdm contains two benzene rings which made pdd g tdm have hydrophobicity the flocculation can be enhanced because of the hydrophobic interaction between pdd g tdm and oil droplets based on the above experimental results it can be found that introducing groups having interactions with pollutants was a favor for the performance of the flocculant the micromorphology of flocs formed by pdd and pdd g x were compared and the results are shown in fig 6 it was obvious that the flocs formed by pdd g x were much larger than that of pdd there were two reasons for this result 1 the branched flocculant had the extended multi side chain which had a higher collision probability with pollutants 2 the branched flocculant had stronger interaction with pollutants both reasons can enhance the flocculation bridging and form larger flocs 3 5 investigation of the flocculation process several factors include ph flocculant dosage rapid stirring speed rapid stirring time and temperature have great effects on the flocculation process in this part the flocculation processes of pdd g dre for naha solution pdd g gte for bentonite suspension and pdd g tdm for pw were studied 3 5 1 effect of ph when the temperature was 25 c the stirring speed was 250 rpm and the stirring time was 5 min the effect of ph on the flocculation result was studied and the results are shown in fig 7 after the ph was adjusted the naha solution and pw stood for 30 min and the bentonite suspension stood for 5 min to observe whether the system was stable there are various functional groups in naha molecule such as hydroxyl groups thiol groups carbonyl groups and carboxyl groups which were sensitive to ph 47 the solution system was unstable when ph 3 with the increase of ph the turbidity reduction of pdd g dre decreased first and then increased when ph 10 the flocculation result was poor and when ph was 13 the flocculant result was good before the treatment the naha solution was homogeneous after the flocculant addition the flocs were produced and the solution became the heterogeneous dispersion the flocs were small and were difficult to settle therefore the turbidity increased and the turbidity reduction was negative with the increasing ph the number and size of flocs increased when ph was 13 pdd g dre obtained the best flocculation performance the side group of naha contains carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups the dissociation of h in carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups is directly related to the ph 29 47 when the ph was low carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups existed in the form of cooh and aroh respectively when the ph was high they existed in the form of coo and aro 29 and the electrostatic interaction between naha and pdd g dre was strong therefore the flocculation bridging performance of pdd g dre was good and the ph of the naha solution before treatment was recommended to be 13 for bentonite suspension the presence of amphoteric groups in the bentonite structure such as al oh and si oh gave rise to fluctuating positive and negative charges at the edges of the layers 31 when ph 3 the solution system was unstable when ph 5 the experimental results showed that the turbidity reduction of pdd g gte gradually increased with the increasing ph but the change was not significant when ph was 13 the wastewater was almost completely clear and transparent and the turbidity reduction was 98 4 for pw the turbidity reduction increased with the increasing ph especially when the ph was 7 in conclusion ph had a significant impact on the treatment of naha solution and pw 3 5 2 effect of flocculant dosage under the same flocculating conditions as listed in 3 5 1 the effect of flocculant dosage on flocculation result was investigated and the results are shown in fig 8 with the increasing flocculant dosage the zeta potential of pollutants in water gradually changed from negative to positive and the turbidity reduction of three kinds of wastewater increased first and then decreased when the dosage was insufficient the possibility of polluted particles colliding with flocculants was so low that flocculation performance was poor when the dosage was excessive the excessive flocculant could play a dispersed and stable role 19 the aforementioned phenomena were attributed to the charge neutralization flocculation effects 48 usually the pollutant stability in water is the worst when the zeta potential is about zero and the turbidity reduction has the highest value at this time the initial zeta potential of the naha solution was 78 89 mv when the flocculant dosage was 240 mg l the zeta potential was 5 38 mv and the turbidity reduction was 87 4 this was similar to the flocculation result of synthetic flocculant reported in reference 32 at the same dosage the zeta potential of the bentonite particles was 79 97 mv when the flocculant dosage was 8 mg l the zeta potential changed from negative to positive but the turbidity reduction had a maximum of 93 2 when the dosage was 12 mg l compared with the reference 39 the turbidity reduction rate reported in this reference was 90 only when the flocculant dosage was 450 mg l and this dosage was about 37 times more than pdd g gte dosage the result showed that the flocculation mechanism pdd g gte not only the electrostatic neutralization but also the hydrogen bond adsorption the zeta potential of oil droplets in pw was 43 04 mv when the flocculant dosage was 16 mg l the zeta potential was positive and the turbidity reduction had a maximum of 94 2 in summary there was an appropriate flocculant dosage for treating three kinds of wastewater and the flocculant dosage required for treating water soluble organic pollutants was significantly larger than the other two types of pollutants 3 5 3 effect of stirring speed the effect of stirring speed on the flocculation result was investigated and the results are shown in fig 9 in addition the flocs at different stirring speeds were observed as shown in fig 10 for the naha solution the lower the stirring speed was the better the flocculation result was the floc was much larger at low speed and the floc size decreased with the increasing stirring speed because of naha solution was homogeneous the solution changed from homogeneous to heterogeneous after the flocculant addition and the flocs formed and grew at the slow speed flocs had enough time to grow but when the stirring speed was too high the flocs had no time to become large for bentonite suspension when the stirring speed was in the range of 100 to 300 rpm the stirring speed had little effect on the flocculation performance indicating that the anti crushing performance of bentonite flocs was good for pw with the increasing stirring speed the turbidity reduction gradually increased and then changed slightly the increased stirring speed was conducive to the collision between oil droplets and flocculants but the flocs structure would be destroyed when the stirring speed was too high 49 to sum up the high rapid stirring speed was not conducive to the flocculation of water soluble organic pollutants but had little effect on the flocculation of solid particles and oil droplets 3 5 4 effect of stirring time the effect of stirring time on flocculation result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 11 in the meantime the flocs under different stirring times were observed as shown in fig 12 for the naha solution as the increasing stirring time the turbidity reduction increased first and then decreased the change in floc size had a similar result when the stirring time was 1 min the flocculation result was poor and the turbidity reduction was only 64 3 when the stirring time was 3 min the turbidity reduction had the highest value of 90 4 for bentonite suspension the turbidity reduction increased with stirring time firstly and then had little change when the stirring time was 5 min the turbidity reduction was 93 4 and the highest turbidity reduction was 94 4 when the stirring time was 7 min for pw the effect of stirring time on flocculation result had a similar result as naha solution in a word the stirring time required for the three kinds of wastewater to achieve the best flocculation result was close 3 5 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the flocculation result was investigated and the experimental results are shown in fig 13 with the increasing temperature the turbidity reduction increased first and then decreased for three kinds of wastewater the most suitable temperature was 55 c naha solution 45 c bentonite suspension and 65 c pw respectively the increasing temperature improved the collision probability between the flocculant and the pollutant and promoted flocculation however the increasing temperature was unfavorable to the flocculation because the curling degree of the flocculant molecular increased the two effects competed resulting in an optimal temperature for the treatment it can be found that the effect of temperature on the flocculation of three kinds of wastewater was similar 4 conclusion using ep to modify pdd based on polymer reaction can effectively improve the flocculation performance of pdd pdd g dre 240 mg l reduced the turbidity of naha solution from 208 ntu to 12 9 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 53 6 higher than that of pdd pdd g gte 12 mg l reduced the turbidity of bentonite suspension from 908 ntu to 15 6 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 23 2 higher than that of pdd pdd g gte 16 mg l reduced the turbidity of pw from 770 ntu to 30 8 ntu and the turbidity reduction was 26 2 higher than that of pdd when the cationic polymer flocculant was branched introducing groups interacting with pollutants including hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bond etc would be more conducive to flocculation ph had a significant impact on the flocculation of naha and oil droplets the dosage of flocculant required to treat naha was much higher than that of the other two types of the pollutant high rapid stirring speed was not conducive to the flocculation of naha but had little effect on the flocculation of solid particles and oil droplets the rapid stirring time required for the three kinds of wastewater to achieve the best flocculation result was close the effect of temperature on the flocculation of three kinds of wastewater was similar the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1

12466,this study focuses on the photocatalytic degradation of industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants using modified sulfate process derived titanium dioxide mspd tio2 the mspd tio2 is duly characterized and compared with commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 the industrial effluent is assayed for pollutants and is found to have high sulfur content s 11 37 0 15 and the presence of organic compounds the powder studied mspd tio2 demonstrated a desirable efficiency in treating the industrial wastewater as the cod value decreased from 7680 mg l to 320 mg l after degradation sulfur black and acid orange 7 both of which are in the industrial effluent are degraded using mspd tio2 the efficiency of mspd tio2 in degrading the pollutants is 80 3 for sulfur black and 72 3 for acid orange7 within 2 h this is achieved at a loading of 150 g l tio2 at ph 5 k 0 0125 0 002 min 1 results indicate that the catalyst remained structurally stable after degradation the mspd tio2 exhibited decreased activity during the reusability test due to loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss overall significant degradation of the pollutants is observed this study demonstrates the potential of mspd tio2 for efficient and cost effective treatment of industrial wastewater containing complex sulfur containing organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid orange 7 industrial effluent sulfur black tio2 photocatalysis wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the current rate of industrial growth presents a formidable wastewater management problem also industries are in need to comply with stringent environmental regulations hence releasing industrial wastewater into rivers is just not an option industrial effluents frequently contain dissolved solids organic inorganic compounds toxic metals etc phenols 1 pesticides 2 dioxins 3 herbicides 4 pharmaceuticals 5 and textile dyes 6 have been considered industrial effluents which are particularly challenging to degrade using eco friendly routes 7 also industrial effluent degradation is usually much more complex when compared to the degradation of model pollutants dyes like methylene blue 8 9 methylene orange 10 rhodamine b 11 etc photocatalytic degradation using tio2 has emerged as a promising alternative as it can effectively degrade a wide range of pollutants into harmless products under uv irradiation 6 ilmenite is a mineral resource for tio2 production and is very abundant the sulfate and chloride processes are used to leach the ilmenite mineral ore 12 the chloride process creates titanium tetrachloride ticl4 by using chlorine gas cl2 and coke c at elevated temperatures a secondary oxidation process removes the chlorine gas and creates titanium dioxide tio2 13 in the sulfate process sulfuric acid h2so4 leaches titanium from ilmenite ore fetio3 the resulting reaction produces titanyl sulfate tioso4 and then goes for the secondary hydrolysis stage to break the titanyl sulfate into hydrated tio2 and h2so4 14 the sulfate process has advantages over the chloride process as it is simple technology has low and cheap grade ores used for production and can produce anatase phase tio2 recently a modified sulfate process has been used to produce ultra pure tio2 from ilmenite ore the advantages of the modified sulfate process over the sulfate process are scalability reduction of heat energy and low cost patent application no 3704 mum 2011 the modified sulfate process for tio2 synthesis has been reported to produce highly crystalline and pure nanoparticles thus these nanoparticles have the prospect of being good photocatalysts 12 therefore this method has attracted considerable attention for industrial wastewater treatment applications tio2 is one of the widely used photocatalysts which can degrade a wide range of organic compounds using solar light and moisture available in the environment that is organic compounds are converted to co2 and h2o in the presence of sunlight and moisture 6 tio2 is widely studied for photocatalysis because of its low cost nontoxic nature significant availability and chemical and physical stability 15 the reason for the efficacy of tio2 is that it has a high electron hole pair generation rate and low recombination rate 16 17 industrial effluent degradation is complicated compared to commercially available pollutants as it contains many dissolved solids organic and inorganic compounds salts toxic metals etc industrial effluent or any dye degradation depends mainly on dye concentration 18 ph 18 19 catalyst concentration 20 and light exposure time 21 however analytic grade tio2 presents a scalability challenge from the standpoint of industrial effluents this problem can be bypassed if mspd tio2 can be duly valorized and used for industrial wastewater treatment advanced oxidation process aop is a widely studied method for wastewater treatment and pollutant degradation there have been recent developments in the use of aops for instance landge et al 2021 have developed a rapid and efficient method for preparing a supported binary metal oxide s scheme bi2o3 zno catalyst for use in photocatalytic aops for wastewater treatment applications 22 cako et al 2020 have investigated the use of hydrodynamic cavitation hc as an aop for the degradation of brilliant cresyl blue bcb dye 97 degradation in just 30 min in wastewater 23 aop using tio2 is an effective method for the removal of a wide range of pollutants such as dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals 24 25 the use of tio2 photocatalysis as an aop for industrial wastewater treatment shows substantial promise in addressing the challenge of wastewater pollution 26 27 however the technology is still in the developmental stage and further research is needed to optimize and scale the process and make it more cost effective and energy efficient in this study the mspd tio2 is valorized by studying its photocatalytic properties and performance its performance is benchmarked with respect to commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 this study also

catalyst concentration 50 to 100 g l at 10 g l dye concentration furthermore the reaction pathways for both sulfur black and acid orange 7 have been proposed with kinetics at different ph values 2 materials in this study high purity tio2 is utilized as the material for the degradation of textile industrial effluent modified sulfate process derived high purity tio2 mspd tio2 extracted from the

tio2 nanopowders it is observed that both mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have the same peak positions the anatase tetragonal corner sharing octahedra phase is evident with the peak at 2Î¸ 25 28 which corresponds to the 101 plane 28 on the other hand the rutile tetragonal edge sharing octahedra phase has a peak at 27 43 which corresponds to the 110 respectively the 2Î¸ at peaks 28 35 37 78 54 98 and 65 confirm the firm diffraction peaks of the anatase phase whereas peaks at 32 3 47 5 48 1 and 53 95 can be attributed to rutile phase 28 the debye scherrer equation is used to calculate the crystalline size of both nanopowders it is estimated that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have 22 2 and 34 2 nm crystalline sizes respectively the crystalline size shows a strong influence on the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity by providing more activation sites 29 therefore there is a chance for mspd tio2 with its smaller crystallite size to have more activation sites thus leading to better photocatalytic activity the phase fractions are analyzed using rietveld s analysis it is observed that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have anatase rutile in phase fractions 95 5 and 88 12 respectively it is clear that degussa p 25 tio2 has a lower anatase percentage compared to the mspd tio2 this is interesting given that the anatase phase is considered better for photocatalytic performance when compared to rutile due to its higher surface area and higher electron mobility 30 31 therefore it is expected that mspd tio2 would exhibit better photocatalytic activity than degussa p 25 tio2 4 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem a catalyst s particle size 32 33 and surface morphology 34 can affect its photocatalytic activity hence the particle size distribution and surface morphology of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 are studied using zeiss sem the particle size distribution of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 is found to be 30 3 and 25 2 nm respectively furthermore all of the particles are found to be spherical fig 2 if the particle sizes are less their surface area would be high thereby increasing the reaction rate 35 even though the bulk material bandgap is lower compared to nanomaterial the photocatalytic activity is very high for nanomaterials due to their significant activation sites 36 eds showed that ti and o atomic percentages as 63 3 and 36 2 for mspd tio2 and 70 3 and 30 3 for degussa p 25 tio2 respectively mentioned in supplementary data fig 1 sem analysis shows that the particles in both the mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 samples fig 2 are agglomerated and in the nano regime larger surface area to volume ratio this indicates the potential for high surface activity and photocatalytic performance 32 4 1 3 bet surface area analysis bet surface area of the catalyst is another crucial factor that controls the photocatalytic efficiency by increasing the number of active sites in the material 32 33 the photocatalytic reaction rate would be high if the catalyst has a high surface area in bet surface area pre heating of the mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 powders are done at 200 c to avoid moisture in the powder the measured surface area of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 are 98 19 and 98 23 m2 g respectively here both tio2 bet surface areas are essentially the same and expected that provide the same activation sites for photocatalytic reactions 4 1 4 bandgap studies bandgap influences photocatalytic activity s performance of the catalyst as the material s bandgap decreases it will generate more electron and hole pairs as the energy required to create excitons electron hole pair would be less 37 bandgaps of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 samples are studied using diffusive reflectance spectroscopy kubelka munk function calculations are used to find bandgaps from the reflectance data 38 it is observed that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 have band gaps of 3 2 ev and 3 4 ev respectively fig 3 the band positions of the catalyst decide the photocatalytic performance it may be noted that some semiconductors like si 1 1 ev cuo 1 5 ev etc have lower bandgaps but do not show good photocatalytic performance due to limited oxidation potential 39 so the bandgap position of the catalyst would need to satisfy both oxidation and reduction potentials furthermore the material would have to be stable in an aqueous medium under light irradiation the physico chemical properties of mspd tio2 are compared with commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 and shown in table 1 4 1 5 degussa p 25 vs mspd tio2 the photocatalytic performance of mspd tio2 is observed by comparing degussa p 25 tio2 the studies are observed with 20 g l of degussa p 25 and mspd tio2 with methylene blue solution 10 mg l fig 4 shows that mspd tio2 delivers 100 degradation in 2 h in contrast degussa p 25 offers only 91 degradation here it is seen that mspd tio2 has better photocatalytic activity due to its desirable properties particle shape spherical size 30 5 nm surface area 98 19 m2 g bandgap 3 2 ev phase anatase rutile 95 5 table 1 because mspd tio2 s properties are desirable it is expected to generate more ho2 oh o2 radicals this also implies that the recombination rate is low in mspd tio2 when compared to degussa p 25 tio2 the generated radicals react with methylene blue and form byproducts h2o and co2 as mentioned earlier in the characterization mspd tio2 has better properties and photocatalytic degradation than degussa p 25 tio2 4 2 industrial effluent characterization and degradation 4 2 1 ph measurements the ph of the industrial effluent solution is also a crucial factor that affects degradation 40 41 the effluent s ph modifies the electrical double layer of the solid electrolyte interface this is because ph does change the adsorption desorption process by modifying the catalyst surface and electro hole pair photogeneration 42 in any photocatalytic dye degradation the degradation is done by photogenerated ho2 or oh or o2 radicals if the ph of the solution is low it encourages the oxidation reaction the degradation seen thus in acidic ph primarily involves ho2 oh 32 on the other hand if the ph is high i e alkaline the degradation rate is controlled by the reduction reaction of o2 radicals 43 under such conditions the sulfide ions present in the industrial effluent undergo oxidation at a strongly alkaline ph 44 the industrial effluent has a ph value of 7 5 for reference solution 10 mg l 0 5abs and 11 for as received industrial effluent at 25 c the dyes in the industrial effluent sample have been confirmed to be anionic this implies that degradation efficiency can be improved by using acidic ph 32 4 2 2 uv vis nir spectroscopy the industrial effluent is characterized using uv vis nir spectroscopy in absorbance mode this mode allows us to determine the characteristic bands 45 the characteristic bands are observed at 583 and 483 nm these bands are attributed to the presence of sulfur black 46 and acid orange 47 respectively fig 5 the bands at 305 395 and 483 nm are sub bands and derivatives of sulfur black and acid orange the chemical structure of sulfur black c18h8n4o5s2 and acid orange c16h11n2nao4s are shown in fig 6 there is no sign of bands in the range of 750 3200 nm only background uv vis nir spectra are collected in absorbance mode for the industrial effluent before and after degradation it is observed that before degradation multi organo sulfur industrial effluent is black in color and the absorbance corresponds to 0 5abs it is challenging for light to reach inside the industrial effluent solution as it is black in color hence the photocatalytic degradation reactions of the industrial effluent are mostly on the surface of the solution the absorbance obtained through uv vis nir spectroscopy is directly proportional to the concentration of dyes here we notice that after degradation the absorbance is 0 1abs it is clear that the concentration of the effluents decreases with exposure time in the presence of a catalyst the generated ho2 oh o2 radicals from oxidation and reduction reactions convert the organo sulfur industrial effluent into h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 the transparent industrial effluent is monitored with 80 3 and 72 3 sulfur black and acid orange degradation after 120 min of photocatalytic degradation fig 9 4 2 3 without catalyst loading the study aimed to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of industrial effluent specifically for the removal of sulfur black and ao7 the experiments are conducted using a 10 g l industrial effluent concentration and a 2 hour exposure time with varying ph levels of the effluent the ph is adjusted using hcl and naoh and no catalyst mspd tio2 is used in the preliminary studies to evaluate the sole effect of ph the results show that for the sulfur black removal the degradation efficiency is 8 0 5 2 0 5 0 and 0 for ph solutions of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 respectively at the beginning of the experiment 0 min for ao7 the removal efficiency is 3 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 0 for ph solutions of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 respectively fig 7 table 2 this study demonstrated that the industrial effluent s ph significantly impacts the degradation of sulfur black and ao7 and the removal efficiency decreased as the ph increased the results suggest that optimizing the ph level of the effluent could improve the efficiency of the degradation process hence the removal of this organo sulfur industrial effluent is negligible without a catalyst loading with respect to the exposure time if the industrial effluent solution s ph value is low the h ions from hcl used to maintain ph adsorb the anionic industrial effluent the adsorption is through van der waals attraction and allows it to degrade anionic ions present in the solution by neutralization 32 the acidic solutions 2 5 and 5 ph containing h cations without catalyst and generated by hcl showed 8 0 5 and 3 0 5 degradation for sulfur black and acid orange respectively but if the ph value of the solution is 7 5 there is 0 degradation in sulfur black and acid orange it is due to the absence of h and oh ions in the case of ph 10 the oh ions from naoh used to maintain ph repel the anionic industrial effluent this van der waals repulsion does not allow for degradation 43 48 4 2 4 catalyst loading 4 2 4 1 natural sunlight vs simulated sunlight industrial effluent degradation studies are carried out in natural and simulated sunlight the tests are carried out with 50 g l of mspd tio2 catalyst and 10 g l organo sulfur industrial effluent loading molar ratio oxidant to pollutant is mentioned in supplementary data the duration of these photocatalytic experiments is 2 h the organo sulfur industrial effluent solution showed 40 3 and 14 2 degradation in natural sunlight for sulfur black and acid orange respectively but in stimulated sunlight it showed 28 2 and 7 2 for sulfur black and acid orange respectively fig 8 the mspd tio2 degraded methylene blue completely in just 2 h however in the case of industrial effluent it shows just 28 2 degradation in simulated sunlight over 2 h this indicates that industrial effluent degradation is more complicated when compared to commercially available pollutants like methylene blue rhodamine b etc ph variation the degradation of industrial effluent is studied with mspd tio2 loading by varying ph the reference industrial effluent solution 10 g l ph value is 7 5 there is no significant degradation with respect to time in the absence of the catalyst fig 7 the photocatalytic degradation of the ph 7 5 solution is then studied by varying the catalyst loading table 3 results show that as the mspd tio2 loading increases from 0 to 100 g l the degradation efficiency increase for both sulfur black and ao7 with degradation percentages ranging from 0 to 40 3 and 0 to 14 2 respectively it is observed here that with increasing tio2 loading the degradation efficiency increased this is not surprising since an increase in tio2 loading would cause more concentration of oxidative species in the photocatalytic bath 49 the proposed reaction pathways for both sulfur black and ao7 occurring during the photocatalytic degradation process are presented in fig 13 the effect of ph on the degradation of industrial effluent is studied in the absence and presence of an mspd tio2 catalyst in the absence of tio2 no degradation is observed however studies are carried out with 50 g l mspd tio2 catalyst loading with ph variation the degradation efficiencies of sulfur black and ao7 decreased as the ph of the solution increased from 2 5 to 10 the highest degradation efficiency of sulfur black and ao7 is observed at ph 2 5 with values of 65 3 and 60 3 respectively table 4 it is clear that as the ph value decreases the degradation efficiency increases fig 7 table 4 and shifts the potential of the catalytic reaction the observed ph dependence can be attributed to changes in the surface charge of the tio2 catalyst which shifts the potential of the catalytic reaction as the ph decreases the surface charge of the catalyst becomes more positive enhancing the adsorption of the pollutants and the subsequent degradation conversely at higher ph values the surface charge becomes more negative reducing the adsorption and degradation efficiency these findings suggest that ph optimization is an important parameter for the efficient degradation of industrial effluents using tio2 catalysts the ph of the solution affects the adsorption desorption process it modifies the electrical double layer of the solid electrolyte interface 50 in acidic conditions 2 5 and 5 ph tio2 has a positive surface charge and acts as a strong lewis acid this supports the adsorption of industrial effluent ph 11 negative surface on the tio2 surface and leads to better degradation but in the case of basic ph conditions the tio2 has a negative surface charge and acts as a lewis base this leads to coulomb repulsion between industrial effluent and tio2 surface this in turn results in a decrease in degradation 51 the results of the study suggest that as the ph of the industrial effluent becomes more acidic the degradation efficiency of the tio2 catalyst increases reaching a maximum value of 65 3 these findings provide valuable insights into the role of ph in modulating the efficiency of industrial effluent degradation using tio2 catalysts fig 7 shows that ph 2 5 and ph 5 solutions show much better results than ph 7 and 10 solutions it is due to better adsorption between tio2 cation and industrial effluents to further investigate this phenomenon the degradation studies are carried out by varying the catalyst mspd tio2 concentration at these ph 2 5 and 5 values table 5 fig 9 the ph 5 yielded 77 3 and 71 3 degradation of sulfur black and ao7 for loading 100 g l mspd tio2 in the case of 150 g l mspd tio2 loading it is 80 3 and 72 3 degradation for sulfur black and ao7 the degradation efficiency is very high in the ph 5 industrial effluent as the solution is neutralized the outcomes of the studies are tabulated in table 5 it is observed that the ph 5 solution offered the best degradation with 100 and 150 g l mspd tio2 and saturated at 150 mg these findings suggest that optimizing the catalyst loading and ph value can significantly enhance the degradation efficiency of industrial effluents which can be useful for the development of efficient wastewater treatment systems in the case of ph 2 5 it is 57 3 and 66 3 degradation for sulfur black and 49 3 and 58 3 degradation for ao7 it is observed that first 30 min the ph 2 5 solution efficiency is very high compared to ph 5 it is due to more h ions available in ph 2 5 however with increasing time the adsorption activity decreased by the coagulation of the catalyst it leads to lower the degradation kinetics 52 the results in fig 9 show that at ph 5 industrial effluent degradation is most effective compared to ph 2 5 at both 100 and 150 g l of mspd tio2 the industrial effluent is black in color with a high concentration of sulfur and carbon the effluent solution became semi transparent after 1 h of degradation and fully transparent after 2 h of irradiation fig 9 this color in organo sulfur industrial effluent changes concerning degradation time it clears that the sulfur and organic compounds are degraded successfully the turbidity values for the 25 50 100 and 150 g l loadings are 0 5 ntu 1 27 ntu 1 97 ntu 3 05 ntu and 4 ntu high levels of turbidity can reduce the efficiency of photocatalysis by decreasing the penetration of light into the fluid when light is scattered by the suspended particles in the fluid less light reaches the catalyst reducing its activation and the rate of the photocatalytic reaction in this study the turbidity is optimized through 150 g l loading for optimizing the photocatalysis reaction rate touati et al 2019 conducted an investigation on the degradation of sulfur black effluent using ce tio2 under uv light illumination at a ph of 9 5 which resulted in a 92 degradation rate after 24 h 46 similarly huang et al 2017 studied the degradation of acid orange 7 effluent using cobalt impregnated activated carbon in peroxymonosulfate under uv light illumination at a ph of 8 which resulted in an 85 degradation rate after 60 min 53 however this current study aims to investigate the combined degradation of both sulfur black and acid orange 7 in industrial wastewater the study uses concentration of 150 g l tio2 at a ph of 5 resulting in an 80 3 degradation rate for sulfur black and a 72 3 degradation rate for acid orange 7 within 2 h the degradation rate constant is found to be k 0 0125 0 002 min 1 these findings suggest the potential of tio2 for the efficient degradation of multiple organic pollutants in industrial wastewater under appropriate ph and concentration conditions 4 2 5 total suspended solids tss the total suspended solids of the industrial effluent are calculated by taking 25 g l of industrial effluent solution into the alumina crucibles the solution is evaporated in a hot air oven at 100 c for 24 h 54 the total suspended solids of industrial effluent are observed to be 6 g l and 0 24 g l before and after the degradation respectively it is clear that the industrial effluent tss concentration is high before degradation as it contains suspended solids dissolved solids and organo sulfur compounds after degradation the tss value decreased by the formation of h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 the recommended tss value for any drinking water is 0 038 g l 55 but the industrial effluents solutions tss value is 0 24 g l and not suitable for drinking 4 2 6 total dissolved solids tds tds of the industrial effluent is calculated with varying ph before degradation the tds is observed as 235 4 776 6 854 4 and 900 5 ppm for 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 ph solutions table 6 it is clear that with an increase in the ph of the industrial effluent the tds levels increased at lower ph the conductivity of the solution rises by h ions and leads to an increase in tds value this is consistent with other reports that show higher ph in industrial effluents are concomitant with higher tds 1 the tds of industrial effluent after degradation is calculated for every 30 min interval the tds values are observed as 776 6 223 4 140 3 120 4 and 70 4 ppm for 0 30 60 90 and 120 min time intervals 150 g l mspd tio2 at 5 ph table 7 as the exposure time increases the value of dissolved solids in the industrial effluent is decreased this is expected to be due formation of intermediate products h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 from generated ho2 oh o2 radicals the formation of intermediated products increases with increasing exposure time so with increasing exposure time the value of the dissolved solid decreases 4 2 7 icp oes analysis icp oes carried out elemental analysis studies of industrial effluent to check the percentage of geological rare earth and mining elements the inorganic ions na al ca etc present in the industrial effluent affect photocatalytic degradation these ions decrease photocatalytic activity by neutralizing themselves it leads to a decrease in organic compound degradation in the industrial effluent it is observed that ag as ba al be cd co cr cu mn ni pb se and th are not detected the detected elements ti co zn and fe are 0 01 0 01 0 18 and 0 02 ppm respectively the icp oes analysis is carried out for industrial effluent after degradation to check quantity reduction in the elements after degradation only the tl 0 01 ppm co 0 01 ppm zn 0 07 ppm and fe 0 01 ppm are observed in the industrial effluent it is identified that only zn and fe reduced from 0 18 and 0 02 ppm to 0 07 and 0 01 ppm respectively after degradation the icp oes analysis confirms that as expected there is no discernible change in inorganic ions concentration after degradation see table 8 4 2 8 carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulfur chns analysis the industrial effluent chns content is analyzed before and after degradation before degradation c h n and s in the industrial effluent are observed as c 4 0 1 h 70 25 0 1 n 10 0 1 s 11 37 0 15 respectively uv vis nir spectroscopy tds and tss data show qualitative information and the chns analyzer gives quantitative and qualitative information this study clearly shows that industrial effluent contains organic compounds and sulfur components after degradation c h n and s in the industrial effluent are observed to be c 1 37 0 1 h 15 37 n 3 5 0 1 s 1 12 0 2 respectively the c h n and s percentages decreased after degradation it happened using oxidation and reduction reactions generated ho2 oh o2 radicals these radicals convert industrial effluent into h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 this study shows that the industrial effluent successfully degraded the organic compounds and sulfur components 4 2 9 ft ir analysis ft ir spectroscopy is carried out for both as received and degraded industrial effluents fig 10 a shows peaks at 3250 3350 cm 1 ch oh 2050 2120 cm 1 cc c c o n c s 1630 cm 1 c c 1400 cm 1 sulfate 1100 cm 1 c c c bending and 600 cm 1 ch deformation for industrial effluent this result confirms that the industrial effluent has many organic compounds and sulfates ao7 and sulfur black fig 10 b shows that after mspd tio2 based photocatalytic treatment at 5 ph the ft ir showed no sign of peaks at 1400 cm 1 for sulfate and 1100 cm 1 c c c bending hence it is confirmed that the mspd tio2 degraded all sulfates and organic materials present in the industrial effluent solution 4 2 10 cod analysis the fig 11 shows that the initial concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in the industrial effluent is high 7680 mg l high levels of cod can be indicative of the presence of hazardous or toxic compounds in the wastewater which can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health if not effectively treated however the results show that after degradation with 150 mg of mspd tio2 at a ph of 5 the cod concentration is significantly reduced to 320 mg l this reduction suggests that the use of mspd tio2 is a promising method for treating industrial wastewater containing high levels of organic pollutants fig 11 xiao et al 2023 have shown that the biotoxicity of photocatalytic products decreases with time as the degradation process progresses 56 this is due to the fact that as the pollutant molecules are broken down the reactive oxygen species ros generated during the photocatalytic process also react with the intermediate products leading to further degradation and reduction of toxicity furthermore the degradation of the pollutants also leads to the formation of smaller and less complex molecules which are generally less toxic than their parent compounds hence it is known that the overall toxicity of the treated water decreases with aop making it less harmful to the environment and living organisms the organo sulfur industrial effluent is hence photo catalytically degraded quite completely using mspd tio2 and is analyzed before and after degradation fig 8 the results obtained from the tds tss chns ft ir icp oes and uv vis nir spectroscopy analyses are found to be complementary together these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the degradation of the pollutants in the industrial effluent sample the analyses revealed 80 3 reduction in sulfur black and a 72 3 reduction in ao7 indicating effective degradation of these compounds 4 3 mechanism and kinetics of industrial effluent degradation epr spectroscopy can assist in revealing the reaction mechanisms of tio2 photocatalysis it does so by identifying the types and locations of paramagnetic centers their interactions with each other and with other species and their changes under different conditions 57 when light falls on the catalyst the electron gets excited from the valance band to the conduction band this creates electron hole pairs eq 3 electrons in the conduction band undergo reduction reactions eqs 4 5 and holes in the valence band experience an oxidation reaction eqs 6 7 this generates ho2 oh o2 radicals 58 the generated radicals react with organo sulfur industrial effluent and form byproducts like h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 fig 12 3 tio 2 hÏ tio 2 e cb h vb 4 o 2 e cb o 2 5 o 2 h oh ho 2 6 h 2 o h vb oh h 7 oh h vb oh 8 oh oh h 2 o 2 9 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh oh o 2 10 ho 2 oh o 2 organo sulfur industrial effluent h 2 o co 2 so 3 2 nh 4 4 3 1 ao7 degradation the ao7 is degraded to aromatic intermediates in the first step this is done by photocatalytic oxidation reduction generated ho2 oh o2 radicals through nn cleavage 53 the resultant products are sodium 4 aminocycloheane 1 sulfonate and 1 amino 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol sodium 4 aminocycloheane 1 sulfonate undergoes further oxidation and is finally reduced to co2 h2o so3 2 and nh4 1 amino 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol forms another intermediates 2h chromen 2 one and naphthalene 1 2 dione by oxidation these intermediates are oxidized further and generate five membered heterocyclic ring products afterward they are oxidized to another smaller molecule product phthalic acid and finally reduced to co2 h2o so3 2 and nh4 fig 13 a 53 4 3 2 sulfur black degradation the sulfur black is degraded by cleavage of the dimethyl n sulfane bridge by the attack of photogenerated ho2 oh o2 radicals 46 the resultant intermediate product undergoes oxidation and generates 9 methyl 10h phenothiazin 2 amine and 2 5 dimethyl 4h thiochromene as the reaction time is enhanced this chromophoric system intermediates again undergo oxidation and is finally reduced to co2 h2o so3 2 and nh4 fig 13 b 46 4 3 3 kinetics the kinetics of industrial effluent degradation studies are examined by plot ln c c0 vs time fig 14 where c is the final concentration and c0 is the initial concentration the kinetics associated with various catalyst loadings are tabulated with respect to ph value table 9 it is observed that it followed pseudo first order it is also observed that the reaction rate increases with increasing catalyst concentration which is true regardless of the ph the degradation studies with ph variation show that industrial effluent degradation is good for ph 2 5 and 5 hence the kinetics are studied for ph 2 5 and 5 the ph 2 5 solution shows 0 0037 0 0046 and 0 0060 min 1 rate constants for 50 100 and 150 g l of catalyst mspd tio2 loading also the ph 5 solution has rate constants of 0 0119 0 0124 and 0 0125 min 1 for 50 100 and 150 g l of catalyst table 9 the ph 2 5 solution with catalyst loading has a lower rate constant than the ph 5 industrial effluent solution this is due to the coagulation of the catalyst at lower ph it is clear that the rate constant kinetics is high for the ph 5 solution and increases with catalyst concentration 4 4 recoverability and reusability this study aimed to evaluate the photochemical stability of mspd tio2 at ph 5 during photocatalysis by assessing its performance over five cycles of use the photocatalytic degradation rate of the catalyst after each cycle is measured to determine any changes in its effectiveness the results showed that the industrial effluent degradation rate decreased from 80 in the first cycle to 72 in the fifth cycle for sulfur black and from 72 to 66 for ao7 this decline of 8 can be attributed to the mass loss of the photocatalyst during the recovery and drying process which amounted to 16 67 150 to 125 mg fig 15 and table 10 however the study also found that 100 mg mspd tio2 showed 77 and 71 in sulfur black and ao7 respectively which demonstrated greater degradation percentages compared to the 125 mg reused catalyst this indicates that the reused catalyst had less photocatalytic activity likely due to loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss the study highlights the importance of evaluating the stability and reusability of photocatalysts in industrial applications the results suggest that the loss of activation sites and particle aggregation due to mass loss can significantly affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst the xrd pattern of the mspd tio2 catalyst shown in fig 16 is analyzed to assess any structural changes after the degradation of industrial effluent the absence of any additional peak in the xrd pattern suggests that there is no change in the crystal structure of the catalyst additionally the crystalline size 22 2 nm and phase fractions anatase rutile 95 5 of the mspd tio2 catalyst before and after degradation are found to be similar indicating that the catalyst s structural and compositional stability is unaffected by the industrial effluent fig 16 furthermore the absence of any changes in the ft ir spectrum of the mspd tio2 catalyst before and after the degradation of the industrial effluent indicates that the effluent adsorption on the catalyst s surface is minimal or absent fig 16 these findings suggest that the mspd tio2 catalyst is highly stable and it does not undergo photo dissolution or photo corrosion even after prolonged exposure to industrial effluent these results can be attributed to the unique morphology and composition of the mspd tio2 catalyst which provides excellent stability and durability under harsh environmental conditions when tio2 is used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of industrial effluent it undergoes several transformations before being finally removed from the system these transformations depend on the type and concentration of the effluent the photocatalytic conditions e g uv light intensity tio2 particle size and dosage and the environmental conditions e g ph temperature and presence of other chemicals the fate of tio2 in the environment after the photocatalytic degradation of industrial effluent depends on its physical and chemical properties 59 in general tio2 particles can be removed from the system by settling filtration or centrifugation however some tio2 particles may remain suspended in the treated effluent and they may be discharged into the environment aops have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of wastewater and the removal of contaminants however it is crucial to acknowledge the potential hazards related to these processes 60 nitration nitrogen fixation and the formation of n derivatives are all potential risks that must be carefully monitored and managed during aops to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the process 61 5 conclusions the study found that mspd tio2 is more effective than commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 in treating industrial effluents the mspd tio2 degraded methylene blue completely in just 2 h while it showed only 28 2 degradation in simulated sunlight over 2 h in the case of industrial effluent the industrial wastewater containing sulfur black and acid orange 7 is degraded by 80 3 and 72 3 respectively with 150 g l mspd tio2 at a ph of 5 k 0 0125 0 0702 min 1 results from tds 70 4 ppm tss 0 24 g l chns ft ir absence of sulfate and c c c bonds icp oes and uv vis nir spectroscopy analyses are found to be mutually consistent and complementary providing a comprehensive understanding of the degradation process of organo sulfur industrial effluent this study also investigated the photochemical stability of mspd tio2 by assessing its performance over five cycles of use xrd and ft ir analyses confirmed that the catalyst did not undergo any structural or phase changes during the cycles however the reusability test revealed that the activity of the mspd tio2 decreased due to the loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss moreover the study evaluated the effectiveness of mspd tio2 for treating industrial effluent containing high levels of organic pollutants the cod test showed that the effluent had a cod value of 7680 mg l before degradation and 320 mg l after degradation indicating the efficiency of mspd tio2 for treating industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants this work shows the potential of mspd tio2 for simultaneously addressing scale cost and efficiency related concerns in industrial photocatalysis the reported analytical grade can be a prospective replacement for commercial degussa p25 tio2 used for photocatalytic applications however future work using mspd tio2 films is needed to investigate their effectiveness in degrading biotoxicity of the organo sulfur compounds present in the industrial effluent and the environmental fate of catalyst credit authorship contribution statement harish kuruva conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

12466,this study focuses on the photocatalytic degradation of industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants using modified sulfate process derived titanium dioxide mspd tio2 the mspd tio2 is duly characterized and compared with commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 the industrial effluent is assayed for pollutants and is found to have high sulfur content s 11 37 0 15 and the presence of organic compounds the powder studied mspd tio2 demonstrated a desirable efficiency in treating the industrial wastewater as the cod value decreased from 7680 mg l to 320 mg l after degradation sulfur black and acid orange 7 both of which are in the industrial effluent are degraded using mspd tio2 the efficiency of mspd tio2 in degrading the pollutants is 80 3 for sulfur black and 72 3 for acid orange7 within 2 h this is achieved at a loading of 150 g l tio2 at ph 5 k 0 0125 0 002 min 1 results indicate that the catalyst remained structurally stable after degradation the mspd tio2 exhibited decreased activity during the reusability test due to loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss overall significant degradation of the pollutants is observed this study demonstrates the potential of mspd tio2 for efficient and cost effective treatment of industrial wastewater containing complex sulfur containing organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image

an option industrial effluents frequently contain dissolved solids organic inorganic compounds toxic metals etc phenols 1 pesticides 2 dioxins 3 herbicides 4 pharmaceuticals 5 and textile dyes 6 have been considered industrial effluents which are particularly challenging to degrade using eco friendly routes 7 also industrial effluent degradation is usually much more complex when compared to the degradation of model pollutants dyes like methylene blue 8 9 methylene orange 10 rhodamine b 11 etc photocatalytic degradation using tio2 has emerged as a promising alternative as it can effectively degrade a wide range of pollutants into harmless products under uv irradiation 6 ilmenite is a mineral resource for tio2 production and is very abundant the sulfate and chloride processes are used to leach the ilmenite mineral ore 12 the chloride process creates titanium tetrachloride ticl4 by using chlorine gas cl2 and coke c at elevated temperatures a secondary oxidation process removes the chlorine gas and creates titanium dioxide tio2 13 in the sulfate process sulfuric acid h2so4 leaches titanium from ilmenite ore fetio3 the resulting reaction produces titanyl sulfate tioso4 and then goes for the secondary hydrolysis stage to break the titanyl sulfate into hydrated tio2 and h2so4 14 the sulfate process has advantages over the chloride process as it is simple technology has low and cheap grade ores used for production and can produce anatase phase tio2 recently a modified sulfate process has been used to produce ultra pure tio2 from ilmenite ore the advantages of the modified sulfate process over the sulfate process are scalability reduction of heat energy and low cost patent application no 3704 mum 2011 the modified sulfate process for tio2 synthesis has been reported to produce highly crystalline and pure nanoparticles thus these nanoparticles have the prospect of being good photocatalysts 12 therefore this method has attracted considerable attention for industrial wastewater treatment applications tio2 is one of the widely used photocatalysts which can degrade a wide range of organic compounds using solar light and moisture available in the environment that is organic compounds are converted to co2 and h2o in the presence of sunlight and moisture 6 tio2 is widely studied for photocatalysis because of its low cost nontoxic nature significant availability and chemical and physical stability 15 the reason for the efficacy of tio2 is that it has a high electron hole pair generation rate and low recombination rate 16 17 industrial effluent degradation is complicated compared to commercially available pollutants as it contains many dissolved solids organic and inorganic compounds salts toxic metals etc industrial effluent or any dye degradation depends mainly on dye concentration 18 ph 18 19 catalyst concentration 20 and light exposure time 21 however analytic grade tio2 presents a scalability challenge from the standpoint of industrial effluents this problem can be bypassed if mspd tio2 can be duly valorized and used for industrial wastewater treatment advanced oxidation process aop is a widely studied method for wastewater treatment and pollutant degradation there have been recent developments in the use of aops for instance landge et al 2021 have developed a rapid and efficient method for preparing a supported binary metal oxide s scheme bi2o3 zno catalyst for use in photocatalytic aops for wastewater treatment applications 22 cako et al 2020 have investigated the use of hydrodynamic cavitation hc as an aop for the degradation of brilliant cresyl blue bcb dye 97 degradation in just 30 min in wastewater 23 aop using tio2 is an effective method for the removal of a wide range of pollutants such as dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals 24 25 the use of tio2 photocatalysis as an aop for industrial wastewater treatment shows substantial promise in addressing the challenge of wastewater pollution 26 27 however the technology is still in the developmental stage and further research is needed to optimize and scale the process and make it more cost effective and energy efficient in this study the mspd tio2 is valorized by studying its photocatalytic properties and performance its performance is benchmarked with respect to commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 this study also involved in photocatalytic degradation of multi organo sulfur industrial effluents ao7 and sulfur black by mspd tio2 this wastewater treatment is studied with varying dye ph values 2 5 to 10 and catalyst concentration 50 to 100 g l at 10 g l dye concentration furthermore the reaction pathways for both sulfur black and acid orange 7 have been proposed with kinetics at different ph values 2 materials in this study high purity tio2 is utilized as the material for the degradation of textile industrial effluent modified sulfate process derived high purity tio2 mspd tio2 extracted from the ilmenite ore is obtained from india rare earth limited irel the textile industrial effluent is also obtained from irel and has a black color 3 ml of the industrial effluent solution is taken for degradation studies every 30 min the ph of the industrial wastewater is adjusted between 2 5 and 10 using hcl thermofisher 1 m and naoh thermofisher flakes deionized water is used to dilute the

tio2 nanopowders it is observed that both mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have the same peak positions the anatase tetragonal corner sharing octahedra phase is evident with the peak at 2Î¸ 25 28 which corresponds to the 101 plane 28 on the other hand the rutile tetragonal edge sharing octahedra phase has a peak at 27 43 which corresponds to the 110 respectively the 2Î¸ at peaks 28 35 37 78 54 98 and 65 confirm the firm diffraction peaks of the anatase phase whereas peaks at 32 3 47 5 48 1 and 53 95 can be attributed to rutile phase 28 the debye scherrer equation is used to calculate the crystalline size of both nanopowders it is estimated that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have 22 2 and 34 2 nm crystalline sizes respectively the crystalline size shows a strong influence on the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity by providing more activation sites 29 therefore there is a chance for mspd tio2 with its smaller crystallite size to have more activation sites thus leading to better photocatalytic activity the phase fractions are analyzed using rietveld s analysis it is observed that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 have anatase rutile in phase fractions 95 5 and 88 12 respectively it is clear that degussa p 25 tio2 has a lower anatase percentage compared to the mspd tio2 this is interesting given that the anatase phase is considered better for photocatalytic performance when compared to rutile due to its higher surface area and higher electron mobility 30 31 therefore it is expected that mspd tio2 would exhibit better photocatalytic activity than degussa p 25 tio2 4 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem a catalyst s particle size 32 33 and surface morphology 34 can affect its photocatalytic activity hence the particle size distribution and surface morphology of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 are studied using zeiss sem the particle size distribution of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 is found to be 30 3 and 25 2 nm respectively furthermore all of the particles are found to be spherical fig 2 if the particle sizes are less their surface area would be high thereby increasing the reaction rate 35 even though the bulk material bandgap is lower compared to nanomaterial the photocatalytic activity is very high for nanomaterials due to their significant activation sites 36 eds showed that ti and o atomic percentages as 63 3 and 36 2 for mspd tio2 and 70 3 and 30 3 for degussa p 25 tio2 respectively mentioned in supplementary data fig 1 sem analysis shows that the particles in both the mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 samples fig 2 are agglomerated and in the nano regime larger surface area to volume ratio this indicates the potential for high surface activity and photocatalytic performance 32 4 1 3 bet surface area analysis bet surface area of the catalyst is another crucial factor that controls the photocatalytic efficiency by increasing the number of active sites in the material 32 33 the photocatalytic reaction rate would be high if the catalyst has a high surface area in bet surface area pre heating of the mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 powders are done at 200 c to avoid moisture in the powder the measured surface area of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 are 98 19 and 98 23 m2 g respectively here both tio2 bet surface areas are essentially the same and expected that provide the same activation sites for photocatalytic reactions 4 1 4 bandgap studies bandgap influences photocatalytic activity s performance of the catalyst as the material s bandgap decreases it will generate more electron and hole pairs as the energy required to create excitons electron hole pair would be less 37 bandgaps of mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 tio2 samples are studied using diffusive reflectance spectroscopy kubelka munk function calculations are used to find bandgaps from the reflectance data 38 it is observed that mspd tio2 and degussa p 25 have band gaps of 3 2 ev and 3 4 ev respectively fig 3 the band positions of the catalyst decide the photocatalytic performance it may be noted that some semiconductors like si 1 1 ev cuo 1 5 ev etc have lower bandgaps but do not show good photocatalytic performance due to limited oxidation potential 39 so the bandgap position of the catalyst would need to satisfy both oxidation and reduction potentials furthermore the material would have to be stable in an aqueous medium under light irradiation the physico chemical properties of mspd tio2 are compared with commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 and shown in table 1 4 1 5 degussa p 25 vs mspd tio2 the photocatalytic performance of mspd tio2 is observed by comparing degussa p 25 tio2 the studies are observed with 20 g l of degussa p 25 and mspd tio2 with methylene blue solution 10 mg l fig 4 shows that mspd tio2 delivers 100 degradation in 2 h in contrast degussa p 25 offers only 91 degradation here it is seen that mspd tio2 has better photocatalytic activity due to its desirable properties particle shape spherical size 30 5 nm surface area 98 19 m2 g bandgap 3 2 ev phase anatase rutile 95 5 table 1 because mspd tio2 s properties are desirable it is expected to generate more ho2 oh o2 radicals this also implies that the recombination rate is low in mspd tio2 when compared to degussa p 25 tio2 the generated radicals react with methylene blue and form byproducts h2o and co2 as mentioned earlier in the characterization mspd tio2 has better properties and photocatalytic degradation than degussa p 25 tio2 4 2 industrial effluent characterization and degradation 4 2 1 ph measurements the ph of the industrial effluent solution is also a crucial factor that affects degradation 40 41 the effluent s ph modifies the electrical double layer of the solid electrolyte interface this is because ph does change the adsorption desorption process by modifying the catalyst surface and electro hole pair photogeneration 42 in any photocatalytic dye degradation the degradation is done by photogenerated ho2 or oh or o2 radicals if the ph of the solution is low it encourages the oxidation reaction the degradation seen thus in acidic ph primarily involves ho2 oh 32 on the other hand if the ph is high i e alkaline the degradation rate is controlled by the reduction reaction of o2 radicals 43 under such conditions the sulfide ions present in the industrial effluent undergo oxidation at a strongly alkaline ph 44 the industrial effluent has a ph value of 7 5 for reference solution 10 mg l 0 5abs and 11 for as received industrial effluent at 25 c the dyes in the industrial effluent sample have been confirmed to be anionic this implies that degradation efficiency can be improved by using acidic ph 32 4 2 2 uv vis nir spectroscopy the industrial effluent is characterized using uv vis nir spectroscopy in absorbance mode this mode allows us to determine the characteristic bands 45 the characteristic bands are observed at 583 and 483 nm these bands are attributed to the presence of sulfur black 46 and acid orange 47 respectively fig 5 the bands at 305 395 and 483 nm are sub bands and derivatives of sulfur black and acid orange the chemical structure of sulfur black c18h8n4o5s2 and acid orange c16h11n2nao4s are shown in fig 6 there is no sign of bands in the range of 750 3200 nm only background uv vis nir spectra are collected in absorbance mode for the industrial effluent before and after degradation it is observed that before degradation multi organo sulfur industrial effluent is black in color and the absorbance corresponds to 0 5abs it is challenging for light to reach inside the industrial effluent solution as it is black in color hence the photocatalytic degradation reactions of the industrial effluent are mostly on the surface of the solution the absorbance obtained through uv vis nir spectroscopy is directly proportional to the concentration of dyes here we notice that after degradation the absorbance is 0 1abs it is clear that the concentration of the effluents decreases with exposure time in the presence of a catalyst the generated ho2 oh o2 radicals from oxidation and reduction reactions convert the organo sulfur industrial effluent into h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 the transparent industrial effluent is monitored with 80 3 and 72 3 sulfur black and acid orange degradation after 120 min of photocatalytic degradation fig 9 4 2 3 without catalyst loading the study aimed to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of industrial effluent specifically for the removal of sulfur black and ao7 the experiments are conducted using a 10 g l industrial effluent concentration and a 2 hour exposure time with varying ph levels of the effluent the ph is adjusted using hcl and naoh and no catalyst mspd tio2 is used in the preliminary studies to evaluate the sole effect of ph the results show that for the sulfur black removal the degradation efficiency is 8 0 5 2 0 5 0 and 0 for ph solutions of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 respectively at the beginning of the experiment 0 min for ao7 the removal efficiency is 3 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 0 for ph solutions of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 respectively fig 7 table 2 this study demonstrated that the industrial effluent s ph significantly impacts the degradation of sulfur black and ao7 and the removal efficiency decreased as the ph increased the results suggest that optimizing the ph level of the effluent could improve the efficiency of the degradation process hence the removal of this organo sulfur industrial effluent is negligible without a catalyst loading with respect to the exposure time if the industrial effluent solution s ph value is low the h ions from hcl used to maintain ph adsorb the anionic industrial effluent the adsorption is through van der waals attraction and allows it to degrade anionic ions present in the solution by neutralization 32 the acidic solutions 2 5 and 5 ph containing h cations without catalyst and generated by hcl showed 8 0 5 and 3 0 5 degradation for sulfur black and acid orange respectively but if the ph value of the solution is 7 5 there is 0 degradation in sulfur black and acid orange it is due to the absence of h and oh ions in the case of ph 10 the oh ions from naoh used to maintain ph repel the anionic industrial effluent this van der waals repulsion does not allow for degradation 43 48 4 2 4 catalyst loading 4 2 4 1 natural sunlight vs simulated sunlight industrial effluent degradation studies are carried out in natural and simulated sunlight the tests are carried out with 50 g l of mspd tio2 catalyst and 10 g l organo sulfur industrial effluent loading molar ratio oxidant to pollutant is mentioned in supplementary data the duration of these photocatalytic experiments is 2 h the organo sulfur industrial effluent solution showed 40 3 and 14 2 degradation in natural sunlight for sulfur black and acid orange respectively but in stimulated sunlight it showed 28 2 and 7 2 for sulfur black and acid orange respectively fig 8 the mspd tio2 degraded methylene blue completely in just 2 h however in the case of industrial effluent it shows just 28 2 degradation in simulated sunlight over 2 h this indicates that industrial effluent degradation is more complicated when compared to commercially available pollutants like methylene blue rhodamine b etc ph variation the degradation of industrial effluent is studied with mspd tio2 loading by varying ph the reference industrial effluent solution 10 g l ph value is 7 5 there is no significant degradation with respect to time in the absence of the catalyst fig 7 the photocatalytic degradation of the ph 7 5 solution is then studied by varying the catalyst loading table 3 results show that as the mspd tio2 loading increases from 0 to 100 g l the degradation efficiency increase for both sulfur black and ao7 with degradation percentages ranging from 0 to 40 3 and 0 to 14 2 respectively it is observed here that with increasing tio2 loading the degradation efficiency increased this is not surprising since an increase in tio2 loading would cause more concentration of oxidative species in the photocatalytic bath 49 the proposed reaction pathways for both sulfur black and ao7 occurring during the photocatalytic degradation process are presented in fig 13 the effect of ph on the degradation of industrial effluent is studied in the absence and presence of an mspd tio2 catalyst in the absence of tio2 no degradation is observed however studies are carried out with 50 g l mspd tio2 catalyst loading with ph variation the degradation efficiencies of sulfur black and ao7 decreased as the ph of the solution increased from 2 5 to 10 the highest degradation efficiency of sulfur black and ao7 is observed at ph 2 5 with values of 65 3 and 60 3 respectively table 4 it is clear that as the ph value decreases the degradation efficiency increases fig 7 table 4 and shifts the potential of the catalytic reaction the observed ph dependence can be attributed to changes in the surface charge of the tio2 catalyst which shifts the potential of the catalytic reaction as the ph decreases the surface charge of the catalyst becomes more positive enhancing the adsorption of the pollutants and the subsequent degradation conversely at higher ph values the surface charge becomes more negative reducing the adsorption and degradation efficiency these findings suggest that ph optimization is an important parameter for the efficient degradation of industrial effluents using tio2 catalysts the ph of the solution affects the adsorption desorption process it modifies the electrical double layer of the solid electrolyte interface 50 in acidic conditions 2 5 and 5 ph tio2 has a positive surface charge and acts as a strong lewis acid this supports the adsorption of industrial effluent ph 11 negative surface on the tio2 surface and leads to better degradation but in the case of basic ph conditions the tio2 has a negative surface charge and acts as a lewis base this leads to coulomb repulsion between industrial effluent and tio2 surface this in turn results in a decrease in degradation 51 the results of the study suggest that as the ph of the industrial effluent becomes more acidic the degradation efficiency of the tio2 catalyst increases reaching a maximum value of 65 3 these findings provide valuable insights into the role of ph in modulating the efficiency of industrial effluent degradation using tio2 catalysts fig 7 shows that ph 2 5 and ph 5 solutions show much better results than ph 7 and 10 solutions it is due to better adsorption between tio2 cation and industrial effluents to further investigate this phenomenon the degradation studies are carried out by varying the catalyst mspd tio2 concentration at these ph 2 5 and 5 values table 5 fig 9 the ph 5 yielded 77 3 and 71 3 degradation of sulfur black and ao7 for loading 100 g l mspd tio2 in the case of 150 g l mspd tio2 loading it is 80 3 and 72 3 degradation for sulfur black and ao7 the degradation efficiency is very high in the ph 5 industrial effluent as the solution is neutralized the outcomes of the studies are tabulated in table 5 it is observed that the ph 5 solution offered the best degradation with 100 and 150 g l mspd tio2 and saturated at 150 mg these findings suggest that optimizing the catalyst loading and ph value can significantly enhance the degradation efficiency of industrial effluents which can be useful for the development of efficient wastewater treatment systems in the case of ph 2 5 it is 57 3 and 66 3 degradation for sulfur black and 49 3 and 58 3 degradation for ao7 it is observed that first 30 min the ph 2 5 solution efficiency is very high compared to ph 5 it is due to more h ions available in ph 2 5 however with increasing time the adsorption activity decreased by the coagulation of the catalyst it leads to lower the degradation kinetics 52 the results in fig 9 show that at ph 5 industrial effluent degradation is most effective compared to ph 2 5 at both 100 and 150 g l of mspd tio2 the industrial effluent is black in color with a high concentration of sulfur and carbon the effluent solution became semi transparent after 1 h of degradation and fully transparent after 2 h of irradiation fig 9 this color in organo sulfur industrial effluent changes concerning degradation time it clears that the sulfur and organic compounds are degraded successfully the turbidity values for the 25 50 100 and 150 g l loadings are 0 5 ntu 1 27 ntu 1 97 ntu 3 05 ntu and 4 ntu high levels of turbidity can reduce the efficiency of photocatalysis by decreasing the penetration of light into the fluid when light is scattered by the suspended particles in the fluid less light reaches the catalyst reducing its activation and the rate of the photocatalytic reaction in this study the turbidity is optimized through 150 g l loading for optimizing the photocatalysis reaction rate touati et al 2019 conducted an investigation on the degradation of sulfur black effluent using ce tio2 under uv light illumination at a ph of 9 5 which resulted in a 92 degradation rate after 24 h 46 similarly huang et al 2017 studied the degradation of acid orange 7 effluent using cobalt impregnated activated carbon in peroxymonosulfate under uv light illumination at a ph of 8 which resulted in an 85 degradation rate after 60 min 53 however this current study aims to investigate the combined degradation of both sulfur black and acid orange 7 in industrial wastewater the study uses concentration of 150 g l tio2 at a ph of 5 resulting in an 80 3 degradation rate for sulfur black and a 72 3 degradation rate for acid orange 7 within 2 h the degradation rate constant is found to be k 0 0125 0 002 min 1 these findings suggest the potential of tio2 for the efficient degradation of multiple organic pollutants in industrial wastewater under appropriate ph and concentration conditions 4 2 5 total suspended solids tss the total suspended solids of the industrial effluent are calculated by taking 25 g l of industrial effluent solution into the alumina crucibles the solution is evaporated in a hot air oven at 100 c for 24 h 54 the total suspended solids of industrial effluent are observed to be 6 g l and 0 24 g l before and after the degradation respectively it is clear that the industrial effluent tss concentration is high before degradation as it contains suspended solids dissolved solids and organo sulfur compounds after degradation the tss value decreased by the formation of h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 the recommended tss value for any drinking water is 0 038 g l 55 but the industrial effluents solutions tss value is 0 24 g l and not suitable for drinking 4 2 6 total dissolved solids tds tds of the industrial effluent is calculated with varying ph before degradation the tds is observed as 235 4 776 6 854 4 and 900 5 ppm for 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 ph solutions table 6 it is clear that with an increase in the ph of the industrial effluent the tds levels increased at lower ph the conductivity of the solution rises by h ions and leads to an increase in tds value this is consistent with other reports that show higher ph in industrial effluents are concomitant with higher tds 1 the tds of industrial effluent after degradation is calculated for every 30 min interval the tds values are observed as 776 6 223 4 140 3 120 4 and 70 4 ppm for 0 30 60 90 and 120 min time intervals 150 g l mspd tio2 at 5 ph table 7 as the exposure time increases the value of dissolved solids in the industrial effluent is decreased this is expected to be due formation of intermediate products h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 from generated ho2 oh o2 radicals the formation of intermediated products increases with increasing exposure time so with increasing exposure time the value of the dissolved solid decreases 4 2 7 icp oes analysis icp oes carried out elemental analysis studies of industrial effluent to check the percentage of geological rare earth and mining elements the inorganic ions na al ca etc present in the industrial effluent affect photocatalytic degradation these ions decrease photocatalytic activity by neutralizing themselves it leads to a decrease in organic compound degradation in the industrial effluent it is observed that ag as ba al be cd co cr cu mn ni pb se and th are not detected the detected elements ti co zn and fe are 0 01 0 01 0 18 and 0 02 ppm respectively the icp oes analysis is carried out for industrial effluent after degradation to check quantity reduction in the elements after degradation only the tl 0 01 ppm co 0 01 ppm zn 0 07 ppm and fe 0 01 ppm are observed in the industrial effluent it is identified that only zn and fe reduced from 0 18 and 0 02 ppm to 0 07 and 0 01 ppm respectively after degradation the icp oes analysis confirms that as expected there is no discernible change in inorganic ions concentration after degradation see table 8 4 2 8 carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulfur chns analysis the industrial effluent chns content is analyzed before and after degradation before degradation c h n and s in the industrial effluent are observed as c 4 0 1 h 70 25 0 1 n 10 0 1 s 11 37 0 15 respectively uv vis nir spectroscopy tds and tss data show qualitative information and the chns analyzer gives quantitative and qualitative information this study clearly shows that industrial effluent contains organic compounds and sulfur components after degradation c h n and s in the industrial effluent are observed to be c 1 37 0 1 h 15 37 n 3 5 0 1 s 1 12 0 2 respectively the c h n and s percentages decreased after degradation it happened using oxidation and reduction reactions generated ho2 oh o2 radicals these radicals convert industrial effluent into h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 this study shows that the industrial effluent successfully degraded the organic compounds and sulfur components 4 2 9 ft ir analysis ft ir spectroscopy is carried out for both as received and degraded industrial effluents fig 10 a shows peaks at 3250 3350 cm 1 ch oh 2050 2120 cm 1 cc c c o n c s 1630 cm 1 c c 1400 cm 1 sulfate 1100 cm 1 c c c bending and 600 cm 1 ch deformation for industrial effluent this result confirms that the industrial effluent has many organic compounds and sulfates ao7 and sulfur black fig 10 b shows that after mspd tio2 based photocatalytic treatment at 5 ph the ft ir showed no sign of peaks at 1400 cm 1 for sulfate and 1100 cm 1 c c c bending hence it is confirmed that the mspd tio2 degraded all sulfates and organic materials present in the industrial effluent solution 4 2 10 cod analysis the fig 11 shows that the initial concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in the industrial effluent is high 7680 mg l high levels of cod can be indicative of the presence of hazardous or toxic compounds in the wastewater which can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health if not effectively treated however the results show that after degradation with 150 mg of mspd tio2 at a ph of 5 the cod concentration is significantly reduced to 320 mg l this reduction suggests that the use of mspd tio2 is a promising method for treating industrial wastewater containing high levels of organic pollutants fig 11 xiao et al 2023 have shown that the biotoxicity of photocatalytic products decreases with time as the degradation process progresses 56 this is due to the fact that as the pollutant molecules are broken down the reactive oxygen species ros generated during the photocatalytic process also react with the intermediate products leading to further degradation and reduction of toxicity furthermore the degradation of the pollutants also leads to the formation of smaller and less complex molecules which are generally less toxic than their parent compounds hence it is known that the overall toxicity of the treated water decreases with aop making it less harmful to the environment and living organisms the organo sulfur industrial effluent is hence photo catalytically degraded quite completely using mspd tio2 and is analyzed before and after degradation fig 8 the results obtained from the tds tss chns ft ir icp oes and uv vis nir spectroscopy analyses are found to be complementary together these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the degradation of the pollutants in the industrial effluent sample the analyses revealed 80 3 reduction in sulfur black and a 72 3 reduction in ao7 indicating effective degradation of these compounds 4 3 mechanism and kinetics of industrial effluent degradation epr spectroscopy can assist in revealing the reaction mechanisms of tio2 photocatalysis it does so by identifying the types and locations of paramagnetic centers their interactions with each other and with other species and their changes under different conditions 57 when light falls on the catalyst the electron gets excited from the valance band to the conduction band this creates electron hole pairs eq 3 electrons in the conduction band undergo reduction reactions eqs 4 5 and holes in the valence band experience an oxidation reaction eqs 6 7 this generates ho2 oh o2 radicals 58 the generated radicals react with organo sulfur industrial effluent and form byproducts like h2o co2 so3 2 and nh4 fig 12 3 tio 2 hÏ tio 2 e cb h vb 4 o 2 e cb o 2 5 o 2 h oh ho

thiochromene as the reaction time is enhanced this chromophoric system intermediates again undergo oxidation and is finally reduced to co2 h2o so3 2 and nh4 fig 13 b 46 4 3 3 kinetics the kinetics of industrial effluent degradation studies are examined by plot ln c c0 vs time fig 14 where c is the final concentration and c0 is the initial concentration the kinetics associated with various catalyst loadings are tabulated with respect to ph value table 9 it is observed that it followed pseudo first order it is also observed that the reaction rate increases with increasing catalyst concentration which is true regardless of the ph the degradation studies with ph variation show that industrial effluent degradation is good for ph 2 5 and 5 hence the kinetics are studied for ph 2 5 and 5 the ph 2 5 solution shows 0 0037 0 0046 and 0 0060 min 1 rate constants for 50 100 and 150 g l of catalyst mspd tio2 loading also the ph 5 solution has rate constants of 0 0119 0 0124 and 0 0125 min 1 for 50 100 and 150 g l of catalyst table 9 the ph 2 5 solution with catalyst loading has a lower rate constant than the ph 5 industrial effluent solution this is due to the coagulation of the catalyst at lower ph it is clear that the rate constant kinetics is high for the ph 5 solution and increases with catalyst concentration 4 4 recoverability and reusability this study aimed to evaluate the photochemical stability of mspd tio2 at ph 5 during photocatalysis by assessing its performance over five cycles of use the photocatalytic degradation rate of the catalyst after each cycle is measured to determine any changes in its effectiveness the results showed that the industrial effluent degradation rate decreased from 80 in the first cycle to 72 in the fifth cycle for sulfur black and from 72 to 66 for ao7 this decline of 8 can be attributed to the mass loss of the photocatalyst during the recovery and drying process which amounted to 16 67 150 to 125 mg fig 15 and table 10 however the study also found that 100 mg mspd tio2 showed 77 and 71 in sulfur black and ao7 respectively which demonstrated greater degradation percentages compared to the 125 mg reused catalyst this indicates that the reused catalyst had less photocatalytic activity likely due to loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss the study highlights the importance of evaluating the stability and reusability of photocatalysts in industrial applications the results suggest that the loss of activation sites and particle aggregation due to mass loss can significantly affect the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst the xrd pattern of the mspd tio2 catalyst shown in fig 16 is analyzed to assess any structural changes after the degradation of industrial effluent the absence of any additional peak in the xrd pattern suggests that there is no change in the crystal structure of the catalyst additionally the crystalline size 22 2 nm and phase fractions anatase rutile 95 5 of the mspd tio2 catalyst before and after degradation are found to be similar indicating that the catalyst s structural and compositional stability is unaffected by the industrial effluent fig 16 furthermore the absence of any changes in the ft ir spectrum of the mspd tio2 catalyst before and after the degradation of the industrial effluent indicates that the effluent adsorption on the catalyst s surface is minimal or absent fig 16 these findings suggest that the mspd tio2 catalyst is highly stable and it does not undergo photo dissolution or photo corrosion even after prolonged exposure to industrial effluent these results can be attributed to the unique morphology and composition of the mspd tio2 catalyst which provides excellent stability and durability under harsh environmental conditions when tio2 is used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of industrial effluent it undergoes several transformations before being finally removed from the system these transformations depend on the type and concentration of the effluent the photocatalytic conditions e g uv light intensity tio2 particle size and dosage and the environmental conditions e g ph temperature and presence of other chemicals the fate of tio2 in the environment after the photocatalytic degradation of industrial effluent depends on its physical and chemical properties 59 in general tio2 particles can be removed from the system by settling filtration or centrifugation however some tio2 particles may remain suspended in the treated effluent and they may be discharged into the environment aops have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of wastewater and the removal of contaminants however it is crucial to acknowledge the potential hazards related to these processes 60 nitration nitrogen fixation and the formation of n derivatives are all potential risks that must be carefully monitored and managed during aops to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the process 61 5 conclusions the study found that mspd tio2 is more effective than commercially available degussa p 25 tio2 in treating industrial effluents the mspd tio2 degraded methylene blue completely in just 2 h while it showed only 28 2 degradation in simulated sunlight over 2 h in the case of industrial effluent the industrial wastewater containing sulfur black and acid orange 7 is degraded by 80 3 and 72 3 respectively with 150 g l mspd tio2 at a ph of 5 k 0 0125 0 0702 min 1 results from tds 70 4 ppm tss 0 24 g l chns ft ir absence of sulfate and c c c bonds icp oes and uv vis nir spectroscopy analyses are found to be mutually consistent and complementary providing a comprehensive understanding of the degradation process of organo sulfur industrial effluent this study also investigated the photochemical stability of mspd tio2 by assessing its performance over five cycles of use xrd and ft ir analyses confirmed that the catalyst did not undergo any structural or phase changes during the cycles however the reusability test revealed that the activity of the mspd tio2 decreased due to the loss of activation sites particle aggregation and mass loss moreover the study evaluated the effectiveness of mspd tio2 for treating industrial effluent containing high levels of organic pollutants the cod test showed that the effluent had a cod value of 7680 mg l before degradation and 320 mg l after degradation indicating the efficiency of mspd tio2 for treating industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants this work shows the potential of mspd tio2 for simultaneously addressing scale cost and efficiency related concerns in industrial photocatalysis the reported analytical grade can be a prospective replacement for commercial degussa p25 tio2 used for photocatalytic applications however future work using mspd tio2 films is needed to investigate their effectiveness in degrading biotoxicity of the organo sulfur compounds present in the industrial effluent and the environmental fate of catalyst credit authorship contribution statement harish kuruva conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

12467,adsorption of heavy metals by various sorbents has been widely studied by many scientists due to the processes of industrialization as well as the great concentration of these toxic and dangerous pollutants in the environment the elimination of which is significant important the ion exchangers lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 purolite a830 and lewatit af5 were used as adsorbents to remove heavy metal ions m ii such as zinc zn ii nickel ni ii and copper cu ii especially cu ii in the presence of anionic surfactants to examine the adsorption efficiency in such systems the main objective of this paper were the kinetic equilibrium thermodynamic and column studies in the hcl m ii anionic surfactant as such as sds sodium dodecyl sulfate abs dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid or absna50 sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate systems the largest adsorption capacities were obtained in the hcl m ii as systems for lewatit monoplus tp220 cu ii 9 9 10 mg g zn ii 8 5 8 9 mg g and ni ii 7 3 9 2 mg g compared to the other ion exchangers therefore after the first selection lewatit monoplus tp220 and the systems containing cu ii were further examined the isotherms models were applied in the experimental data analysis and show that the langmuir determination coefficient r 2 0 993 and temkin r 2 0 948 0 965 isotherm models exhibit the best fitting the results of the temperature dependent adsorption of cu ii in the presence of sds on lewatit monoplus tp220 suggested that the adsorption was spontaneous thermodynamically favourable and exothermic in nature the enthalpy h 7 19 kj mol cmc and 7 03 kj mol cmc the largest working ion exchange capacities of the anion exchange resin were obtained for the abs surfactant c w 30 g l cmc and 12 g l cmc as follows from the current investigations lewatit monoplus tp220 has a great potential for the removal of cu ii in the presence of abs and sds for comparison cu ii ions removal by the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process was also presented and exhibits 54 73 88 cu ii removal efficiency in the presence of sds and abs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metals copper sorption anionic surfactant kinetics column studies equilibrium studies thermodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays with the industrial development and the need to satisfy customer needs the industry is racing to create a wide range of different products and consumer goods in turn this generates wastewater of varying compositions therefore it is important to find appropriate methods for treating them taking into account also the effects of associated substances such as surfactants present in sewages 1 their numerous applications fig 1 indicate that their presence should not be underestimated when developing wastewater treatment methods among the surfactants anionic surfactants are the most commonly used according to the surfactants market report 2 they accounted for 40 of the market share among all surfactant groups fig 2 their use is mainly supported by their low production cost and very good emulsifying and solubilising properties for this reason this group of surfactants is also expected to be found in the largest quantity in wastewater this is an argument in favour of carrying out wastewater treatment studies using this group of surfactants the other quite significant problem as regards to the presence of various substances in sewage are metal ions it is well known that the presence of heavy metals in the ecosystem poses a major threat to human health and life as well as to the environment 3 4 with the industrial development the concentration of metals in waste water increases among others they are used in the production of pesticides paper petrochemicals and batteries as well as electroplating mining tanning and textile industry despite ever increasing techniques to minimize waste in production processes there are still no zero waste techniques that allow safe discharge of post process waters for the removal of metals and surfactants from wastewater there are a number of separation methods already developed adsorption membrane chemical electric biological of photocatalytic based separation methods are proposed for heavy metals removal 3 5 8 whereas for surfactants membrane techniques adsorption chemical and biological ones 9 13 in contrast there are only a few literature reports on the separation of these compounds concerning the coexistence in one solution this type of effluents is expected in the environment the analysis of the literature has identified several authors dealing with the coexistence of metals and surfactants in the systems simultaneously with the analysis of separation techniques the latest developments in this area are summarized in table 1 it should be highlighted that in the adsorption studies of the surfactants heavy metals systems the presence of surfactants can affect significantly both the surface properties of the adsorbents and the adsorption efficiency of heavy metals 14 additionally the effects of surfactants and heavy metals on plants and ecosystems are very poorly studied 15 hence such research is extremely important from both cognitive and application points of view therefore the aim of this study was to examine the effect of anionic surfactants on adsorption of heavy metal ions from the aqueous solutions there were taken into account the main aspects i kinetic ii equilibrium iii thermodynamic and iv column studies moreover the cu ii adsorption efficiency on lewatit monoplus tp220 was also compared with that of cu ii removal by the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process 2 experimental 2 1 reagents the ion exchanger and chemicals used in the present

critical micellar concentration cmc for the systems containing sds abs or absna50 surfactants in water or 0 1 6 0 mol l hcl without or in the presence of m ii were obtained using the du noÃ¼y ring

surfactant sds abs or absna50 were prepared and used in the adsorption studies on lewatit monoplus tp220 to analyze the effect of as on the removal efficiency of heavy metal ions the concentrations of as in the systems under discussion were below cmc and above cmc the critical micellar concentration and were following for sds 24 mg l cmc and 11 300 mg l cmc for abs 4 5 mg l cmc and 2067 mg l cmc and for absna50 18 mg l cmc and 2550 mg l cmc 2 2 kinetic equilibrium thermodynamic and column studies the kinetic equilibrium and thermodynamic studies of m ii in the presence of as on lewatit

calculated standard deviation did not exceed 1 5 in all cases the desorption studies of cu ii from lewatit monoplus tp220 was presented in our previous paper 45 and in section 3 4 the concentration of

at the liquid air interface without and with heavy metal ions was previously studied and described for abs absna50 in 37 38 and for sds in 39 the surface tension measurements in triplicate ring method led to the determination of adsorption isotherms and cmc values as well as the calculation of szyszkowski parameters 37 39 for better understanding the heavy metal ions adsorption in the system containing the anionic surfactants the concentrations of sds abs absna50 after the adsorption on lewatit af5 lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 and purolite a830 were also analyzed using the previously obtained adsorption isotherm plots the relationships between the surface tension Î³ eq mn m and the decimal logarithm of as concentration mol l as it was found the concentration of the anionic surfactants decreases after the adsorption but it decreases depending on the hydrochloric acid concentration from 0 1 mol l to 6 mol l or and heavy metal zn ii co ii cu ii ni ii ions as well as the sorbent types presence the percentage removal of as from the systems without 0 1 6 mol l hcl as and with 0 1 6 mol l hcl m ii as heavy metal ions is presented in table 2 as it was found for lewatit monoplus sr7 the concentration of absna50 reduction in the solutions containing heavy metals after the adsorption was the highest for the system with absna50 cmc r 100 while for absna50 cmc the concentration reduction was slightly lower and being to 95 99 for purolite a830 and lewatit af5 the trend was opposite the smaller r was obtained for the systems with absna50 cmc than for absna50 cmc the changes in the as concentration after the sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 show very high as concentration reduction for the absna50 systems containing both cmc and cmc in the systems with absna50 cmc the r values are in a narrow range which means that in this case the hydrochloric acid did not influence significantly the as concentration reduction after the sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 and purolite a830 whereas in the systems with absna50 cmc the effect of hcl is greater especially after the sorption on purolite a830 and lewatit af5 taking into account the structure of as absna50 abs sds and its concentrations cmc cmc the as concentration reduction in the solutions after the sorption from the systems hcl m ii as on lewatit monoplus tp220 was similar for all examined as for the system cmc or slightly and significantly smaller for abs and sds cmc when the concentration of as is below cmc the structure of surfactants did not affect the adsorption significantly but when their concentration is higher above cmc a different structure of as influences the adsorption extensively 3 2 effect of anionic surfactants on adsorption efficiency of heavy metals kinetic studies the study of the effect of phase contact time on the removal of heavy metal ions in the presence of the anionic surfactants was carried out at the 100 mg l concentrations with the constant parameters v as 180 rpm a 8 t 295 k and the phase contact time t 1 min 24 h for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg ni ii as sds abs absna50 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg zn ii as sds abs absna50 and 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii as sds abs absna50 as concentration cmc and cmc the results of ni ii zn ii and cu ii on lewatit monoplus tp220 without the surfactant were described in our previous paper 42 whereas the cu ii adsorption in the presence of absna50 in 37 the selectivity series of lewatit monoplus tp220 for the heavy metals system without surfactant was in the following order cu ii 9 98 mg g zn ii 9 09 mg g co ii 6 90 mg g ni ii 6 24 mg g 42 and the great adsorption ability of this ion exchanger with the bis picolylamine functional groups compared to the others was previously proved 42 44 the results of heavy metals adsorption in the presence of the anionic surfactants sds abs absna50 on lewatit monoplus tp220 are presented in fig 4 whereas the results from the 0 1 mol l hcl m ii absna50 on lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 and purolite a830 are shown in table 3 for comparison the screening test of four sorbents for heavy metal ions removal table 3 shows that comparing the adsorption capacities obtained for the systems containing the absna50 surfactant lewatit monoplus tp220 exhibit the best adsorption ability toward the heavy metals the selectivity series for the 0 1 mol l hcl m ii absna50 systems were following lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 purolite a830 cmc and cmc zn ii ni ii cu ii and for lewatit monoplus tp220 cmc and cmc cu ii zn ii ni ii lewatit monoplus tp220 shows great adsorption ability toward all heavy metals under discussion but the highest for cu ii therefore this ion exchanger was selected for our future studies moreover the addition of anionic surfactant to the systems changed slightly the adsorption efficiency small reduction is observed or the efficiency remain at the same level or in rare cases increased slightly compared to the systems without the surfactant taking into account the effect of the presence of the anionic surfactants sds abs or absna50 on heavy metal ions removal efficiency it was found that copper adsorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 did not depend on the presence of the anionic surfactant the adsorption capacities were 10 mg g for the systems without as and 10 mg l for the system with as c 0 100 mg l for the systems containing ni ii and zn ii with as the adsorption efficiency on lewatit monoplus tp220 depends on the presence of the surfactant as well as on its concentration when the as concentration is above cmc a reduction of ni ii and zn ii adsorption efficiency is observed whereas for the as concentration below cmc a slight reduction for zn ii and a slight increase for ni ii of adsorption capacities are noted the increasing phase contact time contributed to an increase in heavy metal ions adsorption efficiency which means that the amount of adsorbed heavy metals ions q t values increased with time fig 4 additionally the presence of sds abs absna50 enhanced the zn ii removal uptake in the first 30 min of the process whereas after the longer phase contact time its uptake is smaller compared to the systems without as the enhanced removal of ni ii was observed in the system containing sds and abs at 60 1440 min of phases contact time for the surfactants concentration cmc in the case of cu ii during the first 30 min for the systems with abs and absna 50 cmc the cu ii uptake is also larger the greatest reduction in the amount of cu ii adsorbed on lewatit monoplus tp220 was observed for the systems with sds and abs cmc for the first minutes of phase contact time and the trend is retained for the time from 0 to 240 min the differences in the efficiency of heavy metal ions removal as a function of time in presented systems are readily apparent in fig 4 while the exact explanation of these differences is quite complicated due to the complexity of the examined systems and many factors that could be significant the experimental adsorption data were modelled using the pseudo first order kinetic equation pfo the pseudo second order equation pso and the intraparticle diffusion ipd kinetic models described in table s1 the calculations were made for both the linear and non linear models however due to a worse fit in the case of the non linear model only the kinetic parameters for the linear model are presented in the supplementary materials the calculated kinetic parameters for the cu ii system with absna 50 were presented previously in 36 whereas the others for the cu ii systems with abs sds and ni ii zn ii systems with abs absna 50 sds are presented in tables s2 s3 and s4 in this paper moreover the plots obtained during modelling of adsorption experimental cu ii ni ii and zn ii data from the systems containing abs sds and absna50 using the kinetic pfo pso and ipd models are presented in figs s2 s5 whereas the fitting plots in fig s6 the determination coefficients r 2 of the pfo and pso models were in the range of 0 522 0 93 and 1 000 for cu ii 0 898 0 999 and 0 994 0 998 for ni ii as well as 0 462 0 976 and 1 000 for zn ii respectively moreover the calculated values of q e cal from the pfo equations are not in line with the experimental ones q e exp whereas the great agreement between the experimental and calculated adsorption capacities was noted for the pso model it can be concluded that the pso models l can be applied for description of the kinetic adsorption data of the cu ii ni ii and zn ii on lewatit monoplus tp220 it was observed that for the intraparticle diffusion the high r 2 values were obtained in most cases from the second part of the multilinear plot qt vs t 0 5 indicating that the intraparticle diffusion could be a rate limiting step the r 2 values were in the range 0 836 0 935 0 823 0 998 0 665 0 963 for cu ii ni ii and zn ii sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 respectively the calculated capacities were usually higher than the experimental ones whereas the intraparticle diffusion rate constants range from 0 1 to 0 37 mg g min0 5 3 3 equilibrium studies the adsorption isotherms describe the interactions of adsorbates with adsorbents and their knowledge is important in the application of these adsorbents for the practical design and operation of adsorption systems therefore the correlation of the equilibrium data by the theoretical or empirical equations is essential considering practical applications of the adsorbent lewatit monoplus tp220 for the removal of heavy metals in the systems with the anionic surfactant it is significant to determine the impact of the initial metal ion concentration on the degree of toxic substances removal the aqueous solutions containing from 50 to 8000 mg l of cu ii were used maintaining the constant adsorbent dose 0 5 g phase contact time 24 h and temperature 295 k to define the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium concentration correlations the experimental data were obtained and the plots of q e versus c e are presented in fig 5 for lewatit monoplus tp220 while the solid phase after the cu ii adsorption is presented in fig 1s then these data were fitted to the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin raduschkevich isotherm models the linear and non linear forms of the applied isotherm models are depicted in table s1 and the equilibrium parameters calculated based on the above mentioned isotherms are collected in table 4 the comparison of the correlation coefficients r 2 values which allows one to predict the best isotherm model fitting indicated that the langmuir isotherm model described the sorption of cu ii better on lewatit monoplus tp220 in the presence of the anionic surfactants process compared to the other isotherm models these values for the considered isotherms could be presented in the following order linear regression l langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich freundlich moreover the langmuir isotherm model r 2 0 993 shows the best fit between the adsorption capacities obtained experimentally and calculated according to the langmuir assumption it could be assumed that the copper in the presence of as sorption occurred mainly by the single molecular adsorption 46 moreover high values of the correlation coefficients r 2 in the range 0 948 0 965 were also obtained in the case of the temkin isotherm however there was no a good fit between the experimental adsorption capacities and the theoretical ones the temkin model supposed that the electrostatic interactions participate in the sorption process 47 the freundlich isotherm describes reversible adsorption and is not restricted to the formation of the monolayer non ideal adsorption on the heterogeneous surfaces attributed to various adsorbent adsorbate interactions and the presence of different functional groups on the surface as can be seen in fig 5 fitting plots and examination of the data l shows that the freundlich isotherm provides a worse description of the data over the studied concentration range compared to the other isotherms and the determination coefficient is lower being in the range of 0 729 0 781 the 1 n parameter being 0 242 0 264 indicated the favourable adsorption 1 n 0 5 the adsorbate is easily adsorbed 1 n 2 the adsorbate is hardly adsorbed 47 the dubinin radushkevich d r model based on the activation energy value could provide the additional information about the adsorption mechanism on the heterogeneous surface when the activation energy value e is in the range of 1 8 kj mol the adsorption process is physical however when e is 8 16 kj mol the adsorption process occurs through the ion exchange or chemisorption which could proceed for e ranging from 16 to 40 kj mol 48 in our case the calculated determination coefficients were not very high 0 739 0 965 and the adsorption capacity values q e exp mg g and q m mg g differ from each other based on the non linear regression applied for the calculation of the equilibrium adsorption parameters the solver add in with the microsoft excel 2013 spreadsheet and the error analysis the marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd the determination coefficient r 2 and the adjusted r squared r adj 2 parameters table 4 indicate that the langmuir and temkin isotherms give the best description of cu ii adsorption in the presence of as moreover the mpsd values are usually higher for the systems containing the anionic surfactant of the concentration cmc the determination coefficients decrease in the series sds temkin langmuir freundlich d r abs langmuir temkin freundlich d r sds temkin langmuir d r freundlich abs langmuir temkin d r freundlich indicating that the mechanism of adsorption and the presence of the specific adsorbate adsorbent interactions depend on the chemical composition of the surfactant and its concentration a better description of cu ii adsorption in the presence of sds by the temkin model suggests that in the mechanism of adsorption the electrostatic interactions play here a more significant role due to the fact that the adsorption capacities were higher for the systems containing cu ii and sds e g 172 12 mg g sds and 142 56 mg g abs in this case the effect of temperature was additionally considered fig 6 presents the adsorption isotherms of cu ii from the systems with sds as the relationship between the amount of cu ii adsorbed per unit of mass of lewatit monoplus tp220 q e mg g and the equilibrium concentration in the solutions c e mg l at different temperatures the adsorption capacities increased with the concentration and reached the plateau phase contact time t 24 h all isotherm parameters calculated using the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin raduskievich models at different temperatures for the description of cu ii adsorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 from 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg l cu ii sds solutions are collected in table 4 ambient temperature and table 5 313 and 333 k comparing the r 2 values l 0 990 1 00 and r 2 0 917 0 970 indicates that the langmuir and temkin isotherms fit the experimental data of cu ii adsorption the best onto lewatit monoplus tp220 in the presence of sds compared to the dubinin raduskievich r 2 0 793 0 924 and freundlich r 2 0 763 0 813 ones such a tendency is similar for all the temperatures examined furthermore the adsorption capacities were observed to decrease with the increasing temperature e g for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg l cu ii sds cmc the capacities were 172 12 mg g 295 k 153 70 mg g 313 k and 132 mg g 333 k the comparison of the adsorption capacities of the lewatit monoplus tp220 ion exchanger with the other adsorbents included in table 6 and in the review paper 49 51 used for the cu ii removal in the presence or without surfactants allows to conclude that it can be considered as an adsorptive material on an industrial scale in the wastewater treatment plant containing cu ii 3 4 thermodynamic studies the effect of temperature on the adsorption equilibrium was investigated in the temperature range of 295 333 k the thermodynamic parameters such as the gibbs free energy of adsorption g the entropy s and the enthalpy h change were evaluated to understand the spontaneity and the enthalpy change of the adsorption the temperature dependent thermodynamic parameters provide important information about the adsorption process the value of gibbs free energy g indicates whether the adsorption is spontaneous or not the spontaneous adsorption process is found when the value of gibbs free energy g is negative the value of the enthalpy change h gives information on whether the adsorption is exothermic or endothermic if the value of h is negative the adsorption process is exothermic but when the value of h is positive the adsorption process is endothermic in nature the value of the entropy change s is related to the degree of freedom of the adsorbed species 60 thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the cu ii adsorption isotherms from the solutions containing the sds surfactant onto the lewatit monoplus tp220 resin at three different temperatures using eqs 4 6 and are presented in table 7 the values of the entropy s and enthalpy h change were obtained from the ln k versus 1 t plots that show the linear relationships high values of the determination coefficients r 2 close to 1 the negative values of the gibbs free energy g indicate that the cu ii sorption in the presence of sds was feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous moreover it was found that the g values decrease slightly with the increasing temperature implying that the degree of reaction spontaneity increases with the increasing temperature 61 62 the values of g are more negative for the systems with cu ii and sds above cmc suggesting that the adsorption process for this system is more spontaneous as mentioned in 62 when the g value is up to 3 82 kcal mol 20 kj mol the electrostatic interactions between the adsorption sites and the metal ion could play a significant role in adsorption physical adsorption and the surface complexation reaction could be the major mechanism responsible for the cu ii adsorption process while the g value is more negative than 7 62 kcal mol 40 kj mol the mechanism involves charge sharing or transfer from the adsorbent surface to the metal ion to form a coordinate bond the ion exchange mechanism proceeds when the binding energy is in the range 1 91 3 82 kcal mol 62 the values of g obtained in this paper range from 7 8 to 8 3 kj mol indicating that the electrostatic interactions play a more significant role here the negative values of the enthalpy change h 7 19 kj mol k the system with cu ii and sds cmc and h 7 03 kj mol k the system with cu ii and sds cmc indicate the exothermic nature of the sorption the negative values of the entropy were obtained in the adsorption systems under discussion but for the system with sds cmc s are more negative than for the system with sds cmc this indicates that in the system with sds cmc the disorder decreased as was mentioned in 63 concerning the cu ii removal by iron oxide modified sepiolite g negative degree of spontaneity increases with the increasing temperature h positive s positive to the transition metal ions could enter the smaller adsorbent cavities they must give up their hydration water before the results in the positive values of s m ii ions are less hydrated in the adsorbent layers than in the aqueous solution the more positive values of s indicate the increased randomness at the solid solution interface due to the liberation of water molecules from the hydrated metal ions during the adsorption processes however the adsorption capacity for cu ii in the sds presence onto lewatit monoplus tp220 increased with the decreasing temperature table 8 shows the comparison of the thermodynamic parameters for the cu ii adsorption onto various adsorbents as can be found similar to our studies the values of the gibbs free energy in most cases are negative which indicates the spontaneous nature of the process and more negative values with an increase of temperature show that an increase in temperature favours the sorption process as follows from the examples the values of h and s could be both positive positive and negative or both negative depending on the systems and applied adsorbents 3 5 desorption efficiency the regeneration possibility of lewatit monoplus tp220 resin after the cu ii sorption was presented in our earlier paper 45 in which a three cycle of sorption desorption was shown the desorption studies using various types of eluents hno3 hcl h2so4 naoh nh4oh at the concentrations equal to 1 and 2 mol l proved that cu ii ions can be desorbed with different efficiencies the use of mineral acids does not provide satisfactory results 0 34 10 46 d1 and the effecitivness of desorption increases with the increasing acid concentration the most appropriate eluting agent for copper ii desorption was 2 mol l nh4oh resulting in 76 41 of cu ii desorption in the first cycle 69 5 in the second one and 45 9 in the third one despite not quantitative cu ii desorption lewatit monoplus tp220 could be reused and the adsorption capacities obtained in the 3rd cycle are still comparable with the adsorption capacity in cycle 1 moreover the great lewatit monoplus tp220 ability toward cu ii from the real solutions such as sulfate chloride leaching liquors obtained after the treatment of stainless steel scraps without the anionic surfactant r 98 27 and in the presence of abs na50 r 98 13 was proved previously 39 and in this paper fig s7 fig s7 shows that the cu ii removal efficiency was also great in the presence of abs r 98 1 and sds surfactants r 98 5 for lewatit monoplus tp220 and it was much higher compared to the other resins r 15 22 after the cu ii sorption from the sewage c0cu ii 21 25 mg l the desorption studies were also carried out using the 2 mol l nh4oh and hcl solutions the 2 mol l hcl eluting solution gave even lower desorption efficiency not only for the lewatit monoplus tp220 ion exchanger but also for all tested sorbents which is consistent with the results obtained from the model solutions the regeneration efficiency of cu ii from lewatit monoplus tp220 using 2 mol l nh4oh after the adsorption from the real solution was equal to 70 53 and 54 61 for the sorption without and with as respectively the desorption from the other sorbents with the same eluting agents was low r 6 4 22 04 3 6 column studies the main problem that occurs in industrial applications is the small volume of treated wastewater and the insufficient concentration of pollutants in the treated effluent that means above the permissible limits for its discharge 49 therefore the adsorption process in the continuous mode is used to ensure very low outlet concentrations of pollutants such a system could be applied repeatedly and the adsorbent regenerated many conditions such as the nature of the used adsorbate and adsorbent adsorbate concentration ph bed height and flow rate could affect the efficiency of wastewater treatment dynamic studies were carried out for the 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii as sds abs systems using a glass column of Ã¸ 10 mm 10 ml of swollen ion exchange resin 100 mg cu ii l and the flow rate 0 4 ml min first the breakthrough curves were obtained and plotted as the variation of the copper concentration in the aqueous solution ratio of c c 0 as a function of effluent volume fig 7 the breakthrough curves are of typical shape as in most cases of sorption by the column method operation and follow the s shaped profile 67 when cu ii ions begin to appear in the solution collected from the column the breakthrough point of the curve occurred for the systems under discussion the breakthrough points were determined at c c 0 equal 0 05 the eluate volumes to the breakthrough point u w ml were 3000 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 2250 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds and 1200 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 1700 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds based on these effluent volumes and taking into account the order of occurrence of each curve in fig 7b in the direction of the increasing eluate volumes it was found that for the systems with the anionic surfactant of the concentration below cmc these values are usually much higher than for the systems with the concentration of anionic surfactant above cmc when the concentration of the anionic surfactant is above cmc a faster saturated or exhausted column was also observed the total volumes to the exhaustion point at c c 0 equal to 0 95 u ep ml were 4540 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 3800 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds and 2190 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 3800 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds the complete column saturation is reached when the effluent concentration equals the influent concentration and no further adsorption occurs for c c 0 equal 1 according to eqs 7 11 the column parameters such as the weight d w ml g bed d b distribution coefficients as well as the working ion exchange capacity c w g ml the capacity at the exhaustion point cep g l the capacity from the breakthrough point to the exhaustion point c wep g l were calculated and are presented in fig 7c and table 9 as it was found with the increasing anionic surfactant concentration capacity decreases and the highest values were obtained in the system containing abs of the concentration below cmc c w 22 5 g l the time required for the exchange zone formation t z min and the time required for the exchange zone to become established t e min 14 t z u ep u w q 15 t e u ep q is longer for the solutions with the lower surfactant concentration table 9 3 7 cu ii removal by muef as mentioned in table 1 metal ions can be removed from the aqueous solutions in the presence of surfactants using the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration technique therefore for comparative purposes studies have been carried out in this regard polymeric membranes are usually used in the filtration process due to their relatively low cost and the possibility of obtaining high flux values 19 68 69 however in the systems considered in this study the use of this type of membrane is not advisable in the strongly acidic environment polymeric membranes are usually highly sensitive to the changes in ph over a wide range 70 71 therefore the decision was made to use less commonly used ceramic membranes only a few such examples were found in the literature for cd ii with the anionic surfactant sds and the nonionic surfactant rofam 10 72 cu ii with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylobenzene sulfonate 36 cu ii cr vi and ni ii with cationic surfactant cetylpyridinium chloride using the hybrid polymer ceramic composite membrane 70 the research indicated that the ceramic membranes can be used in the systems discussed in this paper neither high acid concentrations nor high surfactant concentrations much higher than cmc caused permanent blockage of the membrane tests have shown see fig 8a that membrane cleaning is sufficient to achieve similar permeate flux values in the subsequent process cycles for both the membranes and the surfactants according to the experience during the filtration of the surfactant containing solution the filtration capacity drops sharply by approximately 85 compared to that of the water filtration this is mainly due to the concentration polarisation and the adsorption of the surfactant on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores fouling as a result of these phenomena a reduction in the rate of the ultrafiltration process and a change in the separation properties of the membranes tested were observed after a 3 h membrane cleaning the obtained permeate flux is close to the initial flux decrease of approximately 7 5 which indicates that the filtration of the surfactant solutions did not block the pores and the surface of the membrane permanently and that the additional surfactant layer on the membrane was removed after the micellar solutions filtration a similar reduction in the fluxes was observed during the removal of copper ions in the acid system examples for 0 1 mol l hcl are presented in fig 8b the permeate flux depends on the membrane in meuf with a larger cut off membrane a higher permeate flux is obtained but with time the reduction of about 10 and 20 is observed for the membranes with cut off of 5 and 15 kda respectively this phenomenon is observed for all the surfactants the degree of metal ion retention as well as the permeate flux depends on the type of membrane and surfactant as well as the hydrochloric acid concentration the results of cu ii ion removal are shown in fig 9 regardless of the surfactant retention is higher when a membrane with a lower cut off is used fig 9a on the other hand it should be noted that filtration with this membrane has a lower efficiency in terms of the permeate flow fig 9b therefore it is important to consider both issues before making a final membrane choice for the specific process in the case of hydrochloric acid filtration the type of surfactant cannot be ignored as can be seen in fig 9b in the meuf process with abs the retention apart from the highest acid concentration is similar while with sds a significantly lower retention is observed as the acid concentration increases this is most likely due to the different chemical structures of the two surfactants being compared in the case of high concentrations of hydrochloric acid the influence of h ions present in the system cannot be neglected it must be assumed that in such a system hydrogen ions interact with the negatively charged head of the sds micelles and a reaction takes place which leads to the replacement of sodium ions by hydrogen ions and consequently to the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfuric acid moreover this can result in h ions successfully competing with copper ions in the system so that these ions do not adsorb to the micelle surface and as unbound pass through the membrane in the case of abs already acidic in nature no reaction is expected therefore no significant differences are observed in the retention rates 4 conclusions the effect of anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate on cu ii ni ii zn ii ions removal efficiency on the ion exchangers lewatit monoplus sr7

l hcl m ii as heavy metals was determined and the kinetic equilibrium thermodynamic and column studies were presented the results lead to the following conclusions a the concentration of surfactants in the solution decreases significantly after the adsorption and this efficiency yield depends on the hcl concentration 0 1 6 mol l the presence of heavy metal ions as well as on the type of sorbent

12467,adsorption of heavy metals by various sorbents has been widely studied by many scientists due to the processes of industrialization as well as the great concentration of these toxic and dangerous pollutants in the environment the elimination of which is significant important the ion exchangers lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 purolite a830 and lewatit af5 were used as adsorbents to remove heavy metal ions m ii such as zinc zn ii nickel ni ii and copper cu ii especially cu ii in the presence of anionic surfactants to examine the adsorption efficiency in such systems the main objective of this paper were the kinetic equilibrium thermodynamic and column studies in the hcl m ii anionic surfactant as such as sds sodium dodecyl sulfate abs dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid or absna50 sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate systems the largest adsorption capacities were obtained in the hcl m ii as systems for lewatit monoplus tp220 cu ii 9 9 10 mg g zn ii 8 5 8 9 mg g and ni ii 7 3 9 2 mg g compared to the other ion exchangers therefore after the first selection lewatit monoplus tp220 and the systems containing cu ii were further examined the isotherms models were applied in the experimental data analysis and show that the langmuir determination coefficient r 2 0 993 and temkin r 2 0 948 0 965 isotherm models exhibit the best fitting the results of the temperature dependent adsorption of cu ii in the presence of sds on lewatit monoplus tp220 suggested that the adsorption was spontaneous thermodynamically favourable and exothermic in nature the enthalpy h 7 19 kj mol cmc and 7 03 kj mol cmc the largest working ion exchange capacities of the anion exchange resin were obtained for the abs surfactant c w 30 g l cmc and 12 g l cmc as follows from the current investigations lewatit monoplus tp220 has a great potential for the removal of cu ii in the presence of abs and sds for comparison cu ii ions removal by the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process was also presented and exhibits 54 73 88 cu ii removal efficiency in the presence of sds and abs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metals copper sorption anionic surfactant kinetics column studies equilibrium studies thermodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays with the industrial development and the need to satisfy customer needs the industry is racing to create a wide range of different products and consumer goods in turn this generates wastewater of varying compositions therefore it is important to find appropriate methods for treating them taking into account also the effects of associated substances such as surfactants present in sewages 1 their numerous applications fig 1 indicate that their presence should not be underestimated when developing wastewater treatment methods among the surfactants anionic surfactants are the most commonly used according to the surfactants market report 2 they accounted for 40 of the market share among all surfactant groups fig 2 their use is mainly supported by their low production cost and very good emulsifying and solubilising properties for this reason this group of surfactants is also expected to be found in the largest quantity in wastewater this is an argument in favour of carrying out wastewater treatment studies using this group of surfactants the other quite significant problem as regards to the presence of various substances in sewage are metal ions it is well known that the presence of heavy metals in the ecosystem poses a major threat to human health and life as well as to the environment 3 4 with the industrial development the concentration of metals in waste water increases among others they are used in the production of pesticides paper petrochemicals and batteries as well as electroplating mining tanning and textile industry despite ever increasing techniques to minimize waste in production processes there are still no zero waste techniques that allow safe discharge of post process waters for the removal of metals and surfactants from wastewater there are a number of separation methods already developed adsorption membrane chemical electric biological of photocatalytic based separation methods are proposed for heavy metals removal 3 5 8 whereas for surfactants membrane techniques adsorption chemical and biological ones 9 13 in contrast there are only a few literature reports on the separation of these compounds concerning the coexistence in one solution this type of effluents is expected in the environment the analysis of the literature has identified several authors dealing with the coexistence of metals and surfactants in the systems simultaneously with the analysis of separation techniques the latest developments in this area are summarized in table 1 it should be highlighted that in the adsorption studies of the surfactants heavy metals systems the presence of surfactants can affect significantly both the surface properties of the adsorbents and the adsorption efficiency of heavy metals 14 additionally the effects of surfactants and heavy metals on plants and ecosystems are very poorly studied 15 hence such research is extremely important from both cognitive and application points of view therefore the aim of this study was to examine the effect of anionic surfactants on adsorption of heavy metal ions from the aqueous solutions there were taken into account the main aspects i kinetic ii equilibrium iii thermodynamic and iv column studies moreover the cu ii adsorption efficiency on lewatit monoplus tp220 was also compared with that of cu ii removal by the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process 2 experimental 2 1 reagents the ion exchanger and chemicals used in the present

ultrafiltration process the laboratory scale cross flow ultrafiltration system from the tami industries france with two ceramic membranes effective area 0 006358 m2 cut off 5 and 15 kda was used the

concentration of metal ions in the permeate and feed solution respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of anionic surfactants the behaviour of anionic surfactants such as sds abs absna50 at the liquid air interface without and with heavy metal ions was previously studied and described for abs absna50 in 37 38 and for sds in 39 the surface tension measurements in triplicate ring method led to the determination of adsorption isotherms and cmc values as well as the calculation of szyszkowski parameters 37 39 for better understanding the heavy metal ions adsorption in the system containing the anionic surfactants the concentrations of sds abs absna50 after the adsorption on lewatit af5 lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 and purolite a830 were also analyzed using the previously obtained adsorption isotherm plots the relationships between the surface tension Î³ eq mn m and the decimal logarithm of as concentration mol l as it was found the concentration of the anionic surfactants decreases after the adsorption but it decreases depending on the hydrochloric acid concentration from 0 1 mol l to 6 mol l or and heavy metal zn ii co ii cu ii ni ii ions as well as the sorbent types presence the percentage removal of as from the systems without 0 1 6 mol l hcl as and with 0 1 6 mol l hcl m ii as heavy metal ions is presented in table 2 as it was found for lewatit monoplus sr7 the concentration of absna50 reduction in the solutions containing heavy metals after the adsorption was the highest for the system with absna50 cmc r 100 while for absna50 cmc the concentration reduction was slightly lower and being to 95 99 for purolite a830 and lewatit af5 the trend was opposite the smaller r was obtained for the systems with absna50 cmc than for absna50 cmc the changes in the as concentration after the sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 show very high as concentration reduction for the absna50 systems containing both cmc and cmc in the systems with absna50 cmc the r values are in a narrow range which means that in this case the hydrochloric acid did not influence significantly the as concentration reduction after the sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 and purolite a830 whereas in the systems with absna50 cmc the effect of hcl is greater especially after the sorption on purolite a830 and lewatit af5 taking into account the structure of as absna50 abs sds and its concentrations cmc cmc the as concentration reduction in the solutions after the sorption from the systems hcl m ii as on lewatit monoplus tp220 was similar for all examined as for the system cmc or slightly and significantly smaller for abs and sds cmc when the concentration of as is below cmc the structure of surfactants did not affect the adsorption significantly but when their concentration is higher above cmc a different structure of as influences the adsorption extensively 3 2 effect of anionic surfactants on adsorption efficiency of heavy metals kinetic studies the study of the effect of phase contact time on the removal of heavy metal ions in the presence of the anionic surfactants was carried out at the 100 mg l concentrations with the constant parameters v as 180 rpm a 8 t 295 k and the phase contact time t 1 min 24 h for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg ni ii as sds abs absna50 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg zn ii as sds abs absna50 and 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii as sds abs absna50 as concentration cmc and cmc the results of ni ii zn ii and cu ii on lewatit monoplus tp220 without the surfactant were described in our previous paper 42 whereas the cu ii adsorption in the presence of absna50 in 37 the selectivity series of lewatit monoplus tp220 for the heavy metals system without surfactant was in the following order cu ii 9 98 mg g zn ii 9 09 mg g co ii 6 90 mg g ni ii 6 24 mg g 42 and the great adsorption ability of this ion exchanger with the bis picolylamine functional groups compared to the others was previously proved 42 44 the results of heavy metals adsorption in the presence of the anionic surfactants sds abs absna50 on lewatit monoplus tp220 are presented in fig 4 whereas the results from the 0 1 mol l hcl m ii absna50 on lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 and purolite a830 are shown in table 3 for comparison the screening test of four sorbents for heavy metal ions removal table 3 shows that comparing the adsorption capacities obtained for the systems containing the absna50 surfactant lewatit monoplus tp220 exhibit the best adsorption ability toward the heavy metals the selectivity series for the 0 1 mol l hcl m ii absna50 systems were following lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit af5 purolite a830 cmc and cmc zn ii ni ii cu ii and for lewatit monoplus tp220 cmc and cmc cu ii zn ii ni ii lewatit monoplus tp220 shows great adsorption ability toward all heavy metals under discussion but the highest for cu ii therefore this ion exchanger was selected for our future studies moreover the addition of anionic surfactant to the systems changed slightly the adsorption efficiency small reduction is observed or the efficiency remain at the same level or in rare cases increased slightly compared to the systems without the surfactant taking into account the effect of the presence of the anionic surfactants sds abs or absna50 on heavy metal ions removal efficiency it was found that copper adsorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 did not depend on the presence of the anionic surfactant the adsorption capacities were 10 mg g for the systems without as and 10 mg l for the system with as c 0 100 mg l for the systems containing ni ii and zn ii with as the adsorption efficiency on lewatit monoplus tp220 depends on the presence of the surfactant as well as on its concentration when the as concentration is above cmc a reduction of ni ii and zn ii adsorption efficiency is observed whereas for the as concentration below cmc a slight reduction for zn ii and a slight increase for ni ii of adsorption capacities are noted the increasing phase contact time contributed to an increase in heavy metal ions adsorption efficiency which means that the amount of adsorbed heavy metals ions q t values increased with time fig 4 additionally the presence of sds abs absna50 enhanced the zn ii removal uptake in the first 30 min of the process whereas after the longer phase contact time its uptake is smaller compared to the systems without as the enhanced removal of ni ii was observed in the system containing sds and abs at 60 1440 min of phases contact time for the surfactants concentration cmc in the case of cu ii during the first 30 min for the systems with abs and absna 50 cmc the cu ii uptake is also larger the greatest reduction in the amount of cu ii adsorbed on lewatit monoplus tp220 was observed for the systems with sds and abs cmc for the first minutes of phase contact time and the trend is retained for the time from 0 to 240 min the differences in the efficiency of heavy metal ions removal as a function of time in presented systems are readily apparent in fig 4 while the exact explanation of these differences is quite complicated due to the complexity of the examined systems and many factors that could be significant the experimental adsorption data were modelled using the pseudo first order kinetic equation pfo the pseudo second order equation pso and the intraparticle diffusion ipd kinetic models described in table s1 the calculations were made for both the linear and non linear models however due to a worse fit in the case of the non linear model only the kinetic parameters for the linear model are presented in the supplementary materials the calculated kinetic parameters for the cu ii system with absna 50 were presented previously in 36 whereas the others for the cu ii systems with abs sds and ni ii zn ii systems with abs absna 50 sds are presented in tables s2 s3 and s4 in this paper moreover the plots obtained during modelling of adsorption experimental cu ii ni ii and zn ii data from the systems containing abs sds and absna50 using the kinetic pfo pso and ipd models are presented in figs s2 s5 whereas the fitting plots in fig s6 the determination coefficients r 2 of the pfo and pso models were in the range of 0 522 0 93 and 1 000 for cu ii 0 898 0 999 and 0 994 0 998 for ni ii as well as 0 462 0 976 and 1 000 for zn ii respectively moreover the calculated values of q e cal from the pfo equations are not in line with the experimental ones q e exp whereas the great agreement between the experimental and calculated adsorption capacities was noted for the pso model it can be concluded that the pso models l can be applied for description of the kinetic adsorption data of the cu ii ni ii and zn ii on lewatit monoplus tp220 it was observed that for the intraparticle diffusion the high r 2 values were obtained in most cases from the second part of the multilinear plot qt vs t 0 5 indicating that the intraparticle diffusion could be a rate limiting step the r 2 values were in the range 0 836 0 935 0 823 0 998 0 665 0 963 for cu ii ni ii and zn ii sorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 respectively the calculated capacities were usually higher than the experimental ones whereas the intraparticle diffusion rate constants range from 0 1 to 0 37 mg g min0 5 3 3 equilibrium studies the adsorption isotherms describe the interactions of adsorbates with adsorbents and their knowledge is important in the application of these adsorbents for the practical design and operation of adsorption systems therefore the correlation of the equilibrium data by the theoretical or empirical equations is essential considering practical applications of the adsorbent lewatit monoplus tp220 for the removal of heavy metals in the systems with the anionic surfactant it is significant to determine the impact of the initial metal ion concentration on the degree of toxic substances removal the aqueous solutions containing from 50 to 8000 mg l of cu ii were used maintaining the constant adsorbent dose 0 5 g phase contact time 24 h and temperature 295 k to define the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium concentration correlations the experimental data were obtained and the plots of q e versus c e are presented in fig 5 for lewatit monoplus tp220 while the solid phase after the cu ii adsorption is presented in fig 1s then these data were fitted to the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin raduschkevich isotherm models the linear and non linear forms of the applied isotherm models are depicted in table s1 and the equilibrium parameters calculated based on the above mentioned isotherms are collected in table 4 the comparison of the correlation coefficients r 2 values which allows one to predict the best isotherm model fitting indicated that the langmuir isotherm model described the sorption of cu ii better on lewatit monoplus tp220 in the presence of the anionic surfactants process compared to the other isotherm models these values for the considered isotherms could be presented in the following order linear regression l langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich freundlich moreover the langmuir isotherm model r 2 0 993 shows the best fit between the adsorption capacities obtained experimentally and calculated according to the langmuir assumption it could be assumed that the copper in the presence of as sorption occurred mainly by the single molecular adsorption 46 moreover high values of the correlation coefficients r 2 in the range 0 948 0 965 were also obtained in the case of the temkin isotherm however there was no a good fit between the experimental adsorption capacities and the theoretical ones the temkin model supposed that the electrostatic interactions participate in the sorption process 47 the freundlich isotherm describes reversible adsorption and is not restricted to the formation of the monolayer non ideal adsorption on the heterogeneous surfaces attributed to various adsorbent adsorbate interactions and the presence of different functional groups on the surface as can be seen in fig 5 fitting plots and examination of the data l shows that the freundlich isotherm provides a worse description of the data over the studied concentration range compared to the other isotherms and the determination coefficient is lower being in the range of 0 729 0 781 the 1 n parameter being 0 242 0 264 indicated the favourable adsorption 1 n 0 5 the adsorbate is easily adsorbed 1 n 2 the adsorbate is hardly adsorbed 47 the dubinin radushkevich d r model based on the activation energy value could provide the additional information about the adsorption mechanism on the heterogeneous surface when the activation energy value e is in the range of 1 8 kj mol the adsorption process is physical however when e is 8 16 kj mol the adsorption process occurs through the ion exchange or chemisorption which could proceed for e ranging from 16 to 40 kj mol 48 in our case the calculated determination coefficients were not very high 0 739 0 965 and the adsorption capacity values q e exp mg g and q m mg g differ from each other based on the non linear regression applied for the calculation of the equilibrium adsorption parameters the solver add in with the microsoft excel 2013 spreadsheet and the error analysis the marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd the determination coefficient r 2 and the adjusted r squared r adj 2 parameters table 4 indicate that the langmuir and temkin isotherms give the best description of cu ii adsorption in the presence of as moreover the mpsd values are usually higher for the systems containing the anionic surfactant of the concentration cmc the determination coefficients decrease in the series sds temkin langmuir freundlich d r abs langmuir temkin freundlich d r sds temkin langmuir d r freundlich abs langmuir temkin d r freundlich indicating that the mechanism of adsorption and the presence of the specific adsorbate adsorbent interactions depend on the chemical composition of the surfactant and its concentration a better description of cu ii adsorption in the presence of sds by the temkin model suggests that in the mechanism of adsorption the electrostatic interactions play here a more significant role due to the fact that the adsorption capacities were higher for the systems containing cu ii and sds e g 172 12 mg g sds and 142 56 mg g abs in this case the effect of temperature was additionally considered fig 6 presents the adsorption isotherms of cu ii from the systems with sds as the relationship between the amount of cu ii adsorbed per unit of mass of lewatit monoplus tp220 q e mg g and the equilibrium concentration in the solutions c e mg l at different temperatures the adsorption capacities increased with the concentration and reached the plateau phase contact time t 24 h all isotherm parameters calculated using the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin raduskievich models at different temperatures for the description of cu ii adsorption on lewatit monoplus tp220 from 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg l cu ii sds solutions are collected in table 4 ambient temperature and table 5 313 and 333 k comparing the r 2 values l 0 990 1 00 and r 2 0 917 0 970 indicates that the langmuir and temkin isotherms fit the experimental data of cu ii adsorption the best onto lewatit monoplus tp220 in the presence of sds compared to the dubinin raduskievich r 2 0 793 0 924 and freundlich r 2 0 763 0 813 ones such a tendency is similar for all the temperatures examined furthermore the adsorption capacities were observed to decrease with the increasing temperature e g for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg l cu ii sds cmc the capacities were 172 12 mg g 295 k 153 70 mg g 313 k and 132 mg g 333 k the comparison of the adsorption capacities of the lewatit monoplus tp220 ion exchanger with the other adsorbents included in table 6 and in the review paper 49 51 used for the cu ii removal in the presence or without surfactants allows to conclude that it can be considered as an adsorptive material on an industrial scale in the wastewater treatment plant containing cu ii 3 4 thermodynamic studies the effect of temperature on the adsorption equilibrium was investigated in the temperature range of 295 333 k the thermodynamic parameters such as the gibbs free energy of adsorption g the entropy s and the enthalpy h change were evaluated to understand the spontaneity and the enthalpy change of the adsorption the temperature dependent thermodynamic parameters provide important information about the adsorption process the value of gibbs free energy g indicates whether the adsorption is spontaneous or not the spontaneous adsorption process is found when the value of gibbs free energy g is negative the value of the enthalpy change h gives information on whether the adsorption is exothermic or endothermic if the value of h is negative the adsorption process is exothermic but when the value of h is positive the adsorption process is endothermic in nature the value of the entropy change s is related to the degree of freedom of the adsorbed species 60 thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the cu ii adsorption isotherms from the solutions containing the sds surfactant onto the lewatit monoplus tp220 resin at three different temperatures using eqs 4 6 and are presented in table 7 the values of the entropy s and enthalpy h change were obtained from the ln k versus 1 t plots that show the linear relationships high values of the determination coefficients r 2 close to 1 the negative values of the gibbs free energy g indicate that the cu ii sorption in the presence of sds was feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous moreover it was found that the g values decrease slightly with the increasing temperature implying that the degree of reaction spontaneity increases with the increasing temperature 61 62 the values of g are more negative for the systems with cu ii and sds above cmc suggesting that the adsorption process for this system is more spontaneous as mentioned in 62 when the g value is up to 3 82 kcal mol 20 kj mol the electrostatic interactions between the adsorption sites and the metal ion could play a significant role in adsorption physical adsorption and the surface complexation reaction could be the major mechanism responsible for the cu ii adsorption process while the g value is more negative than 7 62 kcal mol 40 kj mol the mechanism involves charge sharing or transfer from the adsorbent surface to the metal ion to form a coordinate bond the ion exchange mechanism proceeds when the binding energy is in the range 1 91 3 82 kcal mol 62 the values of g obtained in this paper range from 7 8 to 8 3 kj mol indicating that the electrostatic interactions play a more significant role here the negative values of the enthalpy change h 7 19 kj mol k the system with cu ii and sds cmc and h 7 03 kj mol k the system with cu ii and sds cmc indicate the exothermic nature of the sorption the negative values of the entropy were obtained in the adsorption systems under discussion but for the system with sds cmc s are more negative than for the system with sds cmc this indicates that in the system with sds cmc the disorder decreased as was mentioned in 63 concerning the cu ii removal by iron oxide modified sepiolite g negative degree of spontaneity increases with the increasing temperature h positive s positive to the transition metal ions could enter the smaller adsorbent cavities they must give up their hydration water before the results in the positive values of s m ii ions are less hydrated in the adsorbent layers than in the aqueous solution the more positive values of s indicate the increased randomness at the solid solution interface due to the liberation of water molecules from the hydrated metal ions during the adsorption processes however the adsorption capacity for cu ii in the sds presence onto lewatit monoplus tp220 increased with the decreasing temperature table 8 shows the comparison of the thermodynamic parameters for the cu ii adsorption onto various adsorbents as can be found similar to our studies the values of the gibbs free energy in most cases are negative which indicates the spontaneous nature of the process and more negative values with an increase of temperature show that an increase in temperature favours the sorption process as follows from the examples the values of h and s could be both positive positive and negative or both negative depending on the systems and applied adsorbents 3 5 desorption efficiency the regeneration possibility of lewatit monoplus tp220 resin after the cu ii sorption was presented in our earlier paper 45 in which a three cycle of sorption desorption was shown the desorption studies using various types of eluents hno3 hcl h2so4 naoh nh4oh at the concentrations equal to 1 and 2 mol l proved that cu ii ions can be desorbed with different efficiencies the use of mineral acids does not provide satisfactory results 0 34 10 46 d1 and the effecitivness of desorption increases with the increasing acid concentration the most appropriate eluting agent for copper ii desorption was 2 mol l nh4oh resulting in 76 41 of cu ii desorption in the first cycle 69 5 in the second one and 45 9 in the third one despite not quantitative cu ii desorption lewatit monoplus tp220 could be reused and the adsorption capacities obtained in the 3rd cycle are still comparable with the adsorption capacity in cycle 1 moreover the great lewatit monoplus tp220 ability toward cu ii from the real solutions such as sulfate chloride leaching liquors obtained after the treatment of stainless steel scraps without the anionic surfactant r 98 27 and in the presence of abs na50 r 98 13 was proved previously 39 and in this paper fig s7 fig s7 shows that the cu ii removal efficiency was also great in the presence of abs r 98 1 and sds surfactants r 98 5 for lewatit monoplus tp220 and it was much higher compared to the other resins r 15 22 after the cu ii sorption from the sewage c0cu ii 21 25 mg l the desorption studies were also carried out using the 2 mol l nh4oh and hcl solutions the 2 mol l hcl eluting solution gave even lower desorption efficiency not only for the lewatit monoplus tp220 ion exchanger but also for all tested sorbents which is consistent with the results obtained from the model solutions the regeneration efficiency of cu ii from lewatit monoplus tp220 using 2 mol l nh4oh after the adsorption from the real solution was equal to 70 53 and 54 61 for the sorption without and with as respectively the desorption from the other sorbents with the same eluting agents was low r 6 4 22 04 3 6 column studies the main problem that occurs in industrial applications is the small volume of treated wastewater and the insufficient concentration of pollutants in the treated effluent that means above the permissible limits for its discharge 49 therefore the adsorption process in the continuous mode is used to ensure very low outlet concentrations of pollutants such a system could be applied repeatedly and the adsorbent regenerated many conditions such as the nature of the used adsorbate and adsorbent adsorbate concentration ph bed height and flow rate could affect the efficiency of wastewater treatment dynamic studies were carried out for the 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii as sds abs systems using a glass column of Ã¸ 10 mm 10 ml of swollen ion exchange resin 100 mg cu ii l and the flow rate 0 4 ml min first the breakthrough curves were obtained and plotted as the variation of the copper concentration in the aqueous solution ratio of c c 0 as a function of effluent volume fig 7 the breakthrough curves are of typical shape as in most cases of sorption by the column method operation and follow the s shaped profile 67 when cu ii ions begin to appear in the solution collected from the column the breakthrough point of the curve occurred for the systems under discussion the breakthrough points were determined at c c 0 equal 0 05 the eluate volumes to the breakthrough point u w ml were 3000 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 2250 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds and 1200 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 1700 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds based on these effluent volumes and taking into account the order of occurrence of each curve in fig 7b in the direction of the increasing eluate volumes it was found that for the systems with the anionic surfactant of the concentration below cmc these values are usually much higher than for the systems with the concentration of anionic surfactant above cmc when the concentration of the anionic surfactant is above cmc a faster saturated or exhausted column was also observed the total volumes to the exhaustion point at c c 0 equal to 0 95 u ep ml were 4540 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 3800 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds and 2190 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii abs 3800 ml for 0 1 mol l hcl 100 mg cu ii sds the complete column saturation is reached when the effluent concentration equals the influent concentration and no further adsorption occurs for c c 0 equal 1 according to eqs 7 11 the column parameters such as the weight d w ml g bed d b distribution coefficients as well as the working ion exchange capacity c w g ml the capacity at the exhaustion point cep g l the capacity from the breakthrough point to the exhaustion point c wep g l were calculated and are presented in fig 7c and table 9 as it was found with the increasing anionic surfactant concentration capacity decreases and the highest values were obtained in the system containing abs of the concentration below cmc c w 22 5 g l the time required for the exchange zone formation t z min and the time required for the exchange zone to become established t e min 14 t z u ep u w q 15 t e u ep q is longer for the solutions with the lower surfactant concentration table 9 3 7 cu ii removal by muef as mentioned in table 1 metal ions can be removed from the aqueous solutions in the presence of surfactants using the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration technique therefore for comparative purposes studies have been carried out in this regard polymeric membranes are usually used in the filtration process due to their relatively low cost and the possibility of obtaining high flux values 19 68 69 however in the systems considered in this study the use of this type of membrane is not advisable in the strongly acidic environment polymeric membranes are usually highly sensitive to the changes in ph over a wide range 70 71 therefore the decision was made to use less commonly used ceramic membranes only a few such examples were found in the literature for cd ii with the anionic surfactant sds and the nonionic surfactant rofam 10 72 cu ii with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylobenzene sulfonate 36 cu ii cr vi and ni ii with cationic surfactant cetylpyridinium chloride using the hybrid polymer ceramic composite membrane 70 the research indicated that the ceramic membranes can be used in the systems discussed in this paper neither high acid concentrations nor high surfactant concentrations much higher than cmc caused permanent blockage of the membrane tests have shown see fig 8a that membrane cleaning is sufficient to achieve similar permeate flux values in the subsequent process cycles for both the membranes and the surfactants according to the experience during the filtration of the surfactant containing solution the filtration capacity drops sharply by approximately 85 compared to that of the water filtration this is mainly due to the concentration polarisation and the adsorption of the surfactant on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores fouling as a result of these phenomena a reduction in the rate of the ultrafiltration process and a change in the separation properties of the membranes tested were observed after a 3 h membrane cleaning the obtained permeate flux is close to the initial flux decrease of approximately 7 5 which indicates that the filtration of the surfactant solutions did not block the pores and the surface of the membrane permanently and that the additional surfactant layer on the membrane was removed after the micellar solutions filtration a similar reduction in the fluxes was observed during the removal of copper ions in the acid system examples for 0 1 mol l hcl are presented in fig 8b the permeate flux depends on the membrane in meuf with a larger cut off membrane a higher permeate flux is obtained but with time the reduction of about 10 and 20 is observed for the membranes with cut off of 5 and 15 kda respectively this phenomenon is observed for all the surfactants the degree of metal ion retention as well as the permeate flux depends on the type of membrane and surfactant as well as the hydrochloric acid concentration the results of cu ii ion removal are shown in fig 9 regardless of the surfactant retention is higher when a membrane with a lower cut off is used fig 9a on the other hand it should be noted that filtration with this membrane has a lower efficiency in terms of the permeate flow fig 9b therefore it is important to consider both issues before making a final membrane choice for the specific process in the case of hydrochloric acid filtration the type of surfactant cannot be ignored as can be seen in fig 9b in the meuf process with abs the retention apart from the highest acid concentration is similar while with sds a significantly lower retention is observed as the acid concentration increases this is most likely due to the different chemical structures of the two surfactants being compared in the case of high concentrations of hydrochloric acid the influence of h ions present in the system cannot be neglected it must be assumed that in such a system hydrogen ions interact with the negatively charged head of the sds micelles and a reaction takes place which leads to the replacement of sodium ions by hydrogen ions and consequently to the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfuric acid moreover this can result in h ions successfully competing with copper ions in the system so that these ions do not adsorb to the micelle surface and as unbound pass through the membrane in the case of abs already acidic in nature no reaction is expected therefore no significant differences are observed in the retention rates 4 conclusions the effect of anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate on cu ii ni ii zn ii ions removal efficiency on the ion exchangers lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 purolite a830 and lewatit af5 was investigated using the static and column methods the adsorption of surfactants from the solutions without 0 1 6 mol l hcl as and with 0 1 6 mol l hcl m ii as heavy metals was determined and the kinetic equilibrium thermodynamic and column studies were presented the results lead to the following conclusions a the concentration of surfactants in the solution decreases significantly after the adsorption and this efficiency yield depends on the hcl concentration 0 1 6 mol l the presence of heavy metal ions as well as on the type of sorbent the highest reduction in the as concentration was observed in the case of lewatit monoplus sr7 and lewatit monoplus tp220 ion exchangers for absna50 57 100 and abs 29 100 b among ion exchangers lewatit monoplus sr7 lewatit monoplus tp220 purolite a830 and lewatit af5 the highest adsorption ability toward heavy metals especially for cu ii in the presence of as is shown by lewatit monoplustp220 therefore it was selected for further studies the adsorption capacities were in the range 9 9 10 mg g for lewatit monoplus tp220 in the presence of abs absna 50 sds surfactants and were much higher than for the others e g in the presence of absna50 10 mg g for lewatit monoplus tp220 0 4 7 1 mg g for purolite a830 0 6 7 2 mg g for lewatit af5 and 0 6 4 mg g for lewatit monoplus sr7 c the adsorption of cu ii in the presence of abs and sds was well described by the temkin r 2 0 948 0 965 and langmuir r 2 0 993 isotherm models the maximum adsorption capacities decrease with the

12468,the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in aquatic environments extremely concerns to human health and the ecosystem thus their removal is essential this work produced carbon fiber aerogels from egg box waste using a chemical free fabrication process the pyrolyzed egg box aerogel peba exhibited three dimensional interconnected carbon nanofibers with high surface area and pore volume the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of four ppcps namely diclofenac dic caffeine cf tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip from water were high and comparable to other carbon based adsorbents and the adsorption time was much faster within 20 min the redlich peterson and the pseudo second order models were the best fitted isotherm and kinetic models respectively which imply multilayer adsorption at high concentrations and the chemisorption process furthermore mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of all ppcps were elucidated peba was applied in the fixed bed column experiment to mimic the continuous adsorption process in addition peba was recyclable after low temperature heat treatment the adsorption capacity 8 1 mg g and removal efficiency 94 03 for tc was still high after three cycles metabolomics analysis revealed that no secondary pollution is released into water after thermal treatment therefore peba has the potential as an efficient adsorbent for removing ppcps from water keywords carbon fiber green fabrication pharmaceuticals adsorption fixed bed column data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps to improve daily life has resulted in releasing these compounds into the environment 1 2 ppcps and their metabolites in water bodies have become a major concern for the environment and human health 2 3 several methods have been utilized for the removal of ppcps from wastewater before their release to the environment such as chemical oxidation 4 coagulation 5 membrane separation 6 photocatalyst 7 bioreactor 8 ion exchange 9 catalytic membrane reactor 10 12 and adsorption 13 15 in particular adsorption is an attractive and exciting technique due to its effectiveness to remove a wide range of contaminants in water 16 17 in general adsorption efficiency depends on the characteristics of adsorbents e g surface area surface functional groups porosity surface charge and on the operating conditions such as ph temperature a ratio of adsorbent adsorbate and contact time 18 19 carbon based materials including carbon nanotube 20 graphene 21 activated carbon 15 carbon aerogel 13 biochar 22 and carbon nanofiber 23 satisfy the above criteria thus they are frequently used to remove ppcps in water due to their large surface area and the plurality of functional groups with a strong affinity for organic compounds 14 24 synthesis of carbons with three dimensional 3d structure including carbon fiber aerogel 13 25 carbon nanotube sponges 26 graphene aerogel 27 carbon fiber graphene aerogel 28 and graphene carbon nanotube aerogel 29 have been extensively investigated because of their outstanding physical properties which include low apparent density high porosity large specific surface area high electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity 30 however the preparation processes could be expensive complicated toxic and thus impractical for large scale production 30 alternatively carbonous material prepared from biomasses such as biochar is a good choice as an adsorbent for pollutant removal from water these can be prepared from biomaterials and non mineral materials such as rice straw 31 coconut shells 32 olive stones 33 potato peels 34 and spent tea leaves 35 via pyrolysis although the as prepared adsorbent shows low adsorption efficiency due to its lower surface area the surface area can be improved via physical or chemical activation typically the physical activation is done by using co2 and water steam as activating agents while the chemical activation requires chemical reagents such as koh h3po4 naoh and zncl2 however utilizing large amounts of chemicals increases production costs and chemical pollution thus restricting their industrial applications it may also have a negative impact on the environment although there is currently an innovative method called oxygen plasma a clean technology that increases the surface area of carbon materials without chemicals or solvents 36 37 it has a limitation on the investment cost and complex operation of equipment this work prepared a chemical free adsorbent carbon fiber aerogel from empty egg boxes the fabrication process did not involve the use of any chemicals after physical reduction freeze drying and pyrolysis the pyrolyzed egg box aerogels peba exhibited a favorably porous structure large specific surface area and particularly low density the peba was studied for the removal of four ppcps viz diclofenac dic caffeine cf tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip from water the interactive effect of contact time initial adsorbate concentration pyrolysis temperature and holding times were investicated furthermore isotherm modeling and kinetic studies were carried out to comprehend the adsorption mechanism and the adsorption rate the fixed bed column adsorption demonstrations were preformed to study the effect of flow rate initial adsorbate concentration and amount of the adsorbent moreover the reusability of saturated adsorbent was also tested by applying a thermal method for the re pyrolysis of peba at a low temperature all experiments have shown that peba can be a good candidate as an efficient adsorbent for tested ppcps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ppcps four ppcps namely caffeine cas no 58 08 2 diclofenac sodium salt cas no 15307 79 6 tetracycline hydrochloride cas no 64 75 5 and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cas no 8393 32 0 were used in this work all ppcps were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation of carbon fiber aerogel the egg box was torn and cut into small pieces then 30 g of egg box scraps was poured into 2000 ml deionized di water and thoroughly mixed using a mechanical blender until the mixture became homogenous the blended egg box solution was cast in a petri dish 90 mm in diameter and 15 mm in height subsequently it was freeze dried alpha 2 4 ld plus christ at a 35 c in a vacuum of 0 12 mbar for 48 h to form egg box aerogels eba afterwards eba was converted to carbon fiber aerogels via pyrolysis in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere the pyrolysis conditions were varied using three pyrolysis temperatures 500 700 and 900 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and three holding times 30 60 and 120 mins finally peba aerogels were crushed and turned into powders

emission scanning electron microscope jsm 7900f schottky fe sem the pore size and the surface area were studied through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using the micromeritics tristar ii plus the specific surface area was investigated with brunauer emmett teller bet theory while the porosity was calculated via the barett joyner halenda bjh equation the surface functional groups of the peba were determined via fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer frontier system raman spectra were recorded on a dxr3xi raman imaging microscope the value of the ph of zero charge phpzc was calculated using the ph drift method 13 for this purpose the nacl solution 0 05 m with different ph from 2 to 11 was prepared after that the nacl solution with a volume of 10 ml was added into a 12 ml glass tube containing 10 mg of peba powder and the mixture was stirred for 24 h after that the final ph was read and the phpzc was examined with plotting the final ph phf minus the initial ph phi against phi 2 4 batch adsorption experiments before the experiments peba powder was washed with di water at 150 rpm for 60 min using a roller shaker the process was repeated five times to remove dust and mineral ash that occurred during the pyrolysis process after that peba powder was separated from water by suction filtration and oven dried at 50 c overnight before using in all adsorption experiments 2 4 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption demonstrations were conducted to determine the best performing peba at different pyrolysis temperatures and holding times the experiments were carried out in glass tubes 12 ml and kept in the incubator shaker ks 4000 i control ika for 240 min at 22 c with the natural ph of the ppcps for adsorption experiments 5 mg of peba was added to 5 ml of various ppcps with the initial concentration of 10 mg l each experiment was repeated three times and the average results were reported after reaching the equilibrium the solution was collected using a 0 45 Î¼m regenerated cellulose syringe filter minisart rc25 syringe filter 17 765 sartorius the solution concentration was analyzed by the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 5000 uv vis nir at the wavelength of 276 nm 13 38 273 nm 39 40 357 nm 41 42 and 278 nm 43 45 for dic cf tc and cip respectively the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity qe mg g of peba were

pyrolyzed at different temperatures 100 300 and 500 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and a holding time of 30 and 60 min after re pyrolysis peba was washed with di water three times then samples were filtered and supernatants were collected for further analysis peba was dried in an oven at 50 c overnight the regenerated sample was weighted for tc adsorption using the same conditions as in the batch experiments the residual concentration of tc was determined as described in section 2 4 1 2 7 metabolomics analysis the collected supernatant after washing peba was analyzed via an agilent

hierarchical clustering heatmaps of normalized metabolites log transformed and pareto scaled were made by metaboanalyst version 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the morphology of eba and peba pyrolyzed at 900 c for 30 min was examined by sem as presented in fig 1 a and b both samples showed a porous structure consisting of a three dimensional interconnected network of fibers but the fiber sizes differed the size of the eba s fibers was in the range of 80 220 nm while the fiber of peba was 50 nm moreover the surface area of the aerogel increased from 6 21 m2 g before pyrolysis eba to 409 57 m2 g after pyrolysis peba the pore volume increased from 0 008 cm3 g eba to 0 241 cm3 g peba moreover pore size increased from 5 24 nm eba to 7 51 nm peba these results indicate a significant impact of pyrolysis which decreased the nanofibers dimension and enhanced the aerogel s surface area and porosity furthermore it transformed the cellulose based fibers into carbon based fibers as evidenced by the ftir spectra in fig 1 c the ftir spectra of eba aerogel showed various absorption bands which are the characteristic bands of cellulose namely the hydroxyl oh group at 3335 cm 1 the ch stretching at 2903 cm 1 the cc stretching at 1593 cm 1 the ch bending at 1425 cm 1 the co stretching at 1738 and 1161 cm 1 and the c o c pyranose at 1031 cm 1 these bands disappeared after pyrolysis due to the decarboxylation of c o c bonds and the decomposition of hydroxyl groups indicating that the eba has transformed into carbon nanofiber 54 58 for the peba the additional ftir bands were observed at approximately 2353 2122 and 2107 cm 1 which are assigned to cc stretching cc stretching and the allene chain c c c stretching respectively 13 these observations were confirmed by the raman spectra of eba and peba aerogels as shown in fig 1 d the eba exhibited the cellulose peaks at the raman shift of 1381 1124 1097 900 and 382 cm 1 whereas the peaks at 1456 and 1274 cm 1 belong to lignin the peaks at 1604 and 1656 cm 1 are from hemicellulose 59 61 these raman peaks disappeared after pyrolysis instead two strong peaks at 1342 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 were observed which corresponded to the d band and g band representing the disorder in carbon nanofiber and the in plane vibrational stretching mode of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms respectively 62 64 the ftir and raman spectra showed the change in the chemical composition from cellulose fibers eba to carbon fibers peba after passing through the pyrolysis process which is in agreement with previous studies 13 25 3 2 batch adsorption experiments first screening tests were conducted to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperatures and pyrolysis holding times through peba fabrication on dic cf tc and cip removal efficiency from water fig 2 a shows the removal efficiency of peba aerogels pyrolyzed at 500 c 700 c and 900 c with a fixed holding time of 60 min it is clearly seen that the removal efficiency increased with the pyrolysis temperature peba pyrolyzed at 900 c showed the highest removal efficiency 95 for cf tc and cip and 75 for dic compared to the removal efficiency of 10 for dic and cf when peba was pyrolyzed at 500 c the reason for the higher removal efficiency with increasing pyrolysis temperature is understandable it is well known for pyrolyzed carbon materials that as the pyrolysis temperature increases organic molecules in the biomass become more volatile and decomposed voids are created in the matrix leading to an increase in micropores in the carbonaceous materials 65 67 hence increasing pyrolysis temperature caused a complete transformation from cellulose fibers to carbon fibers it also enhanced the surface area and pore volume of peba 68 69 fig 2 b shows the effect of pyrolysis holding time on the removal efficiency the aerogels were pyrolyzed at 900 c but the holding times were varied as 30 60 and 120 min as with increasing pyrolysis temperatures the longer pyrolysis holding time causes the volatilization and loss of organic compounds leading to higher micropores pore volume and surface area of the carbon materials 67 69 all ppcp molecules experience this effect however it is particularly noticeable in the case of dic the removal efficiency of dic increases from 69 at 30 min holding time to around 85 at 120 min holding time in contrast increasing the holding time does not prominently affect the removal efficiency of cf tc and cip because the removal efficiencies of other ppcp molecules were already very high 90 even for the holding time of 30 min thus the pyrolysis temperature and the holding time were selected as 900 c and 30 min to produce the peba aerogel this fabrication condition was used for the adsorption experiment in the rest of the studies this condition may not be the best regarding the highest adsorption efficiency for all ppcps but it is sufficient to remove ppcps at low concentrations in wastewater it is also more economical for peba aerogel production fig 3 presents the effect of ppcps concentration and contact time on the adsorbate removal efficiency and the peba adsorption capacity the ppcps concentrations were varied from 1 to 100 mg l and the removal efficiency is shown in fig 3 a the removal efficiency dropped when the ppcps concentrations increased by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbates the ratio of active sites on the adsorbent surface to the total ppcps molecules decreases this effect in turn decreases the removal efficiency due to excessive ppcps molecules in the solution on the other hand the adsorption capacity increased with increasing ppcps concentrations fig 3 b it could be attributed to the provision of a prominent driving force by higher ppcps concentrations to overcome the adsorbate transfer resistance at the solid liquid interface 70 the influence of the contact time on the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity is presented in fig 3 c and d the contact time was varied from 1 to 240 min while the concentration was kept constant at 10 mg l it is clearly seen from the graphs that the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity increased by increasing contact times the longer contact times allow the ppcps molecules to interact with the active site of the peba adsorbent surface it should be noted that the peba can adsorb all ppcps very quickly reaching the equilibrium within 20 min with the removal efficiency approaching 100 for cf tc and cip 3 3 adsorption isotherms the isotherm experiments were carried out to evaluate the possible adsorption mechanism and to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity of peba the adsorption isotherms of dic cf tc and cip by peba are shown in fig 4 a comparison of ppcps adsorption with previously studied adsorbents is presented in table 1 as compared to another adsorbent in table 1 peba s ppcps adsorption capacity was within range however it took peba less time to reach the adsorption equilibrium the time to reach equilibrium was only 20 min making peba a suitable adsorbent for quick adsorption applications it should be noted that some of the adsorbents listed in table 1 exhibited very high adsorption capacity particularly the porous carbon derived from co2 ref 41 however the process to fabricate this adsorbent is complicated involving galvano electrolysis to reduce co2 in ternary carbonate melt electrolyte consisting of li2co3 na2co3 and k2co3 with ni sheet and pt ti plate as cathode and anode thus compared to others materials peba is much easier to synthesize though it showed lower adsorption capacity of selected ppcps it was also produced from waste and the process did not involve the use of any harmful chemicals to further understand the mechanism two parameter langmuir freundlich and three parameter sips redlich peterson isotherm models were used to fit the data the langmuir isotherm is applied for monolayer adsorption onto the homogeneous surface of an adsorbent in contrast the freundlich isotherm is based on multilayer adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent the sips model is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich models for predicting the heterogeneous adsorption system and overcoming the limitation of high adsorbate concentrations associated with the freundlich model this model responds to a monolayer adsorption capacity characteristic of the langmuir isotherm at high adsorbate concentrations finally the redlich peterson model incorporates the langmuir and freundlich combination like the sips model but it responds to the ideal langmuir model at low concentration and responds to the freundlich model at high concentration 71 73 the fitting parameters using these models are aggregated in table 2 of all models the redlich peterson model was found to show the best fit with the experimental results with the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 947 0 989 0 975 and 0 981 for dic cf tc and cip respectively and the lowest root mean square error rmse when compared with other models it referred to the adsorption of all ppcps on the peba surface is monolayer adsorption at low concentrations and multilayer adsorption at high concentrations according to the redlich peterson model 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is the study to explain the adsorption mechanism of the adsorbate onto the surface of the adsorbent by varying the contact time 74 the adsorption of dic cf tc and cip versus the contact time at constant ppcps concentration and adsorbent dosage was plotted as shown in fig 5 the adsorption of all ppcps rapidly increased with time up to around 20 min after that the adsorption reached equilibrium and the adsorption capacities of peba at equilibrium for dic cf tc and cip were approximately 8 3 9 8 8 4 and 10 5 mg g respectively the experimental data were fitted by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models as shown in fig 5 a b c and d for dic cf tc and cip adsorption respectively the pseudo first order model explains the physical adsorption process that proceeds with diffusion through a boundary while the pseudo second order model represents the chemical adsorption with a strong linkages between adsorbate and adsorbent 75 the kinetic parameters from the fittings of model are indicated in table 3 the best fit of all experiments defined from the highest r2 and the lowest rmse belongs to the pseudo second order model additionally the calculated adsorption capacity qm from the pseudo second order model coincided with the experimental value qexp it indicates that all four ppcps in this work adsorbed on the peba surface favor the chemisorption process furthermore adsorption kinetic data were fitted with the resistance to intraparticle diffusion equation ride eq 9 the so called weber morris model this model investigates the mass transfer resistance at the boundary layer that can explain the diffusion mechanism of adsorption the results from fittings are presented in fig 5 e f g and h for dic cf tc and cip adsorption respectively and the fitting parameters are summarized in table 3 the c value determines the thickness of the boundary layer when c is equal to zero the linear line passes through the origin denoting no boundary layer between the adsorbate and adsorbent and interparticle diffusion is considered the only rate controlling step however the r 2 value of the model is low and the regression line did not pass through the origin this indicates a more pronounced boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion is not the only mechanism controlling adsorption instead the adsorption process involved three linear regions including rapid surface loading at the beginning 1st linear section then gradual pore diffusion during 5 20 min 2nd linear section and finally horizontal equilibrium after 20 min 3rd linear section 74 76 3 5 adsorption mechanism understanding the fundamental of adsorption is necessary since it can estimate the adsorbent s commercial application in this work the adsorption of four ppcps onto peba adsorbent showed different removal efficiency and adsorption capacity depending on the physicochemical properties of adsorbates dic cf tc and cip and the surface properties of peba in addition other environmental conditions such as solution ph and temperature are also crucial for the adsorption process here the ph of ppcps solutions was not controlled during the experiment so it was not fixed but was in the range of 5 6 the proposed mechanisms for dic cf tc and cip adsorption onto the peba are presented in fig 6 the possible adsorption mechanisms in this work are the pore filling effect Ï Ï interaction electrostatic interaction cation Ï interaction and hydrophobic interaction the sem images and bet analysis mentioned in section 3 1 showed that the peba aerogel exhibited an excellent porous structure from the three dimensional interconnected carbon fibers thus the pore filling effect is a probable physical adsorption mechanism that occurred for all ppcps adsorption this mechanism can explain the rapid and high adsorption capacity of ppcps molecules corresponding to the first stage of adsorption based on the intraparticle diffusion model the second mechanism is the Ï Ï interaction which is the interaction between aromatic compounds and carbon based materials according to the ftir and raman results from section 3 1 peba exhibited a number of cc and cc functional groups in the structure and presented the raman g band graphite band meanwhile all of the ppcps used in this study have aromatic rings in the structure the chemical structures are shown in fig 6 so there are undoubtedly Ï Ï interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbates which is another possible mechanism in the adsorption process the third mechanism is the electrostatic interaction to understand this mechanism the surface charge of the adsorbent and the ionic forms of the ppcps were taken into consideration these variables are related to their ph including the phpzc of peba pka of each ppcps molecule and ph of the solution the phpzc of peba was found to be 8 56 as shown in fig 7 it means that the surface charge of peba was positive when the ph of the solution was below 8 56 the ph of dic cf tc and cip solutions used in all experiments were 5 77 5 72 4 83 and 6 20 respectively which were lower than 8 56 it indicates that the surface charge of peba adsorbent was positive in all experiments another important factor is the pka of the ppcps molecules the pka of dic is 4 15 which divides it into two major forms the neutral form dic0 at ph 4 15 and the anionic form dic at ph 4 15 77 since the ph of dic solution was 5 77 the dic molecules were in the anionic form secondly the pka of cf is 0 7 and 14 in the aquatic environment cf can be a cation cf at ph 0 7 neutral cf0 at 0 7 ph 14 and anion at ph 14 78 thus the cf molecules have no charge in the adsorption experiment solution ph of 5 72 furthermore the pka of tc is 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 in the adsorption experiments where the solution ph was 4 83 tc was in a neutral form tch 2 0 79 it should be noted that even though the total charge of tch 2 0 was zero the tc molecule had a polar structure with an equal amount of positive and negative charges finally the pka of cip is 5 90 and 8 89 leading to the neutral form cip0 in the adsorption experiment ph 6 20 80 similar to tch 2 0 cip0 is a polar molecule with equal positive and negative charges in the structure following the argument above the electrostatic interaction mechanism can occur in the adsorption of dic tc and cip due to the attraction between the positive charge of the adsorbent surface and the negative charge of the adsorbate molecules moreover the cation Ï bond is a relatively strong interaction that can occur between an electron rich Ï system e g aromatic donors and an adjacent cation here the Ï electron of the peba structure can form the cation Ï bond with the protonated amino group in the structure of tc and cip molecules 81 the last possible mechanism in the adsorption process is the hydrophobic interaction the hydrophobic interaction is the bonding between the hydrophobic site of adsorbent and adsorbate the strength of this interaction depends on the hydrophobic site of each adsorbate in this experiment the hydrophobic interaction was more effective on the dic and cip adsorption than cf and tc adsorption this is due to higher octanol water partition coefficient log kow of dic 3 91 13 and cip 0 4 82 than the cf 0 07 83 and tc 1 30 84 3 6 fixed bed column experiments although batch adsorption studies can be used for screening the adsorbents and understanding the adsorption mechanism it is not practical to use in large scale wastewater treatment due to their limited small volume and difficult operation in solid liquid separation instead the fixed bed column studies can mimic the continuous process on the industrial plant scale for this purpose the peba efficiency in the column was measured tc was selected as the ppcps compound in these experiments the effect of initial concentration flow rate and adsorbent mass on the adsorption capacities was investigated and the calculated column parameters are summarized in table 4 the effect of initial tc concentration ci was studied and the resulting breakthrough curves are shown in fig 8 a increasing ci reduced the breakthrough time tb defined as the time when cf ci 0 05 for example tb decreased from 50 min to 13 min and the total operation time ttotal decreased from 347 min and 98 min when ci was raised from 5 mg l to 20 mg l increasing ci also had a negative effect on the adsorption capacities qbed and qtotal which decreased from 29 mg g to 23 mg g and from 1 47 mg to 1 17 mg respectively when ci increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l these results showed that the column operation of peba adsorbent was more efficient at lower tc concentrations similar findings were reported in other studies 85 the effect of flow rate is presented in fig 8 b it can be observed that when the flow rate was increased from 1 to 3 ml min tb and ttotal decreased from 71 to 17 min and from 272 to 116 min respectively furthermore increasing the flow rate reduced the removal efficiency y from 48 07 to 32 83 qtotal from 1 39 mg to 1 19 mg and qbed from 28 mg g to 24 mg g these observations suggest that the contact time between tc molecules and available binding sites of the adsorbent surface is insufficient at higher flow rates leading to inferior column performance of tc adsorption finally the effect of the adsorbent mass was investigated as shown in fig 8 c it showed that the column performance was improved when the adsorbent mass was increased when the adsorbent mass was increased from 25 mg to 100 mg both tb and ttotal also increased from 32 min to 77 min and from 140 min to 302 min respectively the higher adsorbent mass provided more available adsorption sites and sufficient residence time within the column from the column experiments it can be concluded that peba is more efficient in column adsorption for a low tc concentration with a low flow rate and using a large peba mass 3 7 reusability study regeneration techniques such as thermal desorption microwave irradiation supercritical fluid regeneration solvent regeneration advanced oxidation process and microbial assisted adsorbent regeneration have been applied to regenerate saturated adsorbents among them bio regeneration is slow and some chemical constituents of adsorbent and adsorbate can be harmful to microorganisms 86 chemical regeneration using organic and inorganic solvents or through oxidation is limited due to the toxicity of potential by products and the generation of secondary pollutants 87 in contrast thermal regeneration is a chemical free approach which has been used successfully to regenerate carbonous adsorbents such as activated carbon and biochar 88 accordingly in this study thermal regeneration was conducted by re pyrolysis of saturated peba to avoid chemicals used fig 9 a shows the removal efficiency of the regenerated adsorbent after re pyrolysis at 100 500 c for 30 60 min the best removal efficiency of tc was observed in the regenerated peba adsorbent at 500 c for 30 or 60 min the removal efficiency reached approximately 98 which was very close to the removal efficiency of the fresh peba the red dashed line in fig 9 a however regeneration at the lower temperature 300 c and short holding time 30 min could still provide relatively high removal efficiency 96 similar to the peba regenerated at 500 c thus the regeneration temperature of 300 c could be a better option considering the energy consumption and cost savings this condition was used to regenerate the peba in the cyclic adsorption experiments as shown in fig 9 b in the first three cycles both tc removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of regenerated peba were not significantly changed the adsorption capacity dropped slightly from 8 4 mg g in the 1st cycle to 8 1 mg g in the 3rd cycle while the removal efficiency changed from 96 5 to 94 0 these results demonstrated the reusability of peba adsorbent however the adsorption performance decreased more prominently after the 3rd cycle the removal efficiency was around 70 in the 6th cycle the sem images of the samples after the 1st and 6th cycles are also presented in fig 9 b the morphology of the peba after the 6th cycle shows the non uniform distribution of pores and the increase in pore size which indicates the beginning of the collapsed porous structure resulting in a drop in removal efficiency on the other hand ftir spectra not shown were relatively unchanged after several adsorption regeneration cycles implying no changes in chemical bonds although thermal regeneration is considered a fast and highly efficient method it is criticized for high energy consumption and the destruction of adsorbents at high temperatures 22 the findings of this study showed that thermal regeneration could be efficient at low temperatures e g 300 c and short holding times e g 30 min therefore decreasing the reaction temperature and holding time can reduce energy consumption and enhance the overall applicability of thermal regeneration another concern related to thermal treatment is the generation of unknown compounds the heat might decompose adsorbate or break the bonds between adsorbent and adsorbate 86 89 for instance xiao et al 2020 reported the decomposition and mineralization of organic pollutants perfluorooctanoic acid on spent granular activated carbon after thermal treatment at 200 c and 700 c or higher respectively 90 it should be noted that after thermal regeneration decomposed compounds can be released into the water during the subsequent adsorption cycles and cause secondary water pollution despite its importance the release of by product compounds to water through thermal regeneration processes is rarely studied in this study peba was washed three times with distilled water after each cycle of adsorption thermal regeneration the filtrates were collected for the analysis of detectable compounds in supernatants for this purpose firstly the pure tc before and after heating at 300 c was analyzed using lc qtof ms to ensure that the tc and its degraded products are detectable using the established method when the output confirmed that tc and its transformed compounds are detectable with lc qtof ms the filtrates of washed peba were analyzed with the same method lc qtof ms analysis screened 448 features in both positive and negative ionization modes among these 37 metabolites were annotated using ms and msms data 73 were annotated by ms data and the rest remained unknown fig 9 c shows the clustering heatmap of top 35 significantly altered metabolites with the exact m z between different washing steps this figure indicates that the concentration of detected compounds after the first wash was higher than in the second and third washing steps tc and its degradation products were not found among the screened compounds this finding shows that tc and its related compounds were not released into water after thermal regeneration or their concentrations were lower than the detection limit of the established method considering the high accuracy and sensitivity of lc qtof ms analysis tc is most likely turned to gaseous products or fixed on the peba adsorbent through thermal regeneration therefore the detected compounds in washed samples should have originated from peba due to heating fig 9 d represents the principal component analysis plot of detected compounds based on different regeneration cycles as shown in this figure the released chemicals into water after the first and fifth cycles are more separated than in other cycles thus fresh and overused peba adsorbent can release different compounds through the thermal regeneration process fig 9 e depicts the principal component analysis plot of screened compounds based on different washing steps between regeneration cycles this figure shows that different compounds are released after each washing step different chemical profiles from the first wash could be related to more available compounds on the surface of peba after re pyrolysis 4 conclusions this study proposed the green fabrication of carbon nanofiber aerogel from egg boxes without any use of harmful chemicals in all processes the pyrolysis temperatures and holding times were varied to find the optimum condition for fabricating the peba the adsorption experiments were carried out with four ppcps compounds i e dic cf tc and cip the best performance was obtained when peba was pyrolyzed at 900 c for 30 min furthermore the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of all ppcps depended on their initial concentration and contact times several models were fitted to the adsorption isotherms it was found that the redlich peterson model was the best fit which implies that monolayer adsorption occurs at lower concentrations and multilayer adsorption takes place at higher concentrations the pseudo second order model was found to be the best fitted model in kinetic studies indicating that the ppcps adsorbed on peba surface favor the chemisorption process in addition the adsorption mechanism of all ppcps on peba was proposed which involved the pore filling effect Ï Ï interaction electrostatic interaction cation Ï interaction and hydrophobic interaction the peba was also tested for continuous adsorption in the fixed bed column studies the results showed that peba is more efficient at low tc concentrations with a low flow rate and a large adsorbent mass moreover peba can be recycled and reused through simple heat treatment it is also verified that this regeneration process did not cause secondary pollution by releasing by products into water in summary the combination of low cost environment friendly fabrication process high efficiency and fast adsorption make the peba a fascinating adsorbent material for ppcps removal from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12468,the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in aquatic environments extremely concerns to human health and the ecosystem thus their removal is essential this work produced carbon fiber aerogels from egg box waste using a chemical free fabrication process the pyrolyzed egg box aerogel peba exhibited three dimensional interconnected carbon nanofibers with high surface area and pore volume the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of four ppcps namely diclofenac dic caffeine cf tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip from water were high and comparable to other carbon based adsorbents and the adsorption time was much faster within 20 min the redlich peterson and the pseudo second order models were the best fitted isotherm and kinetic models respectively which imply multilayer adsorption at high concentrations and the chemisorption process furthermore mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of all ppcps were elucidated peba was applied in the fixed bed column experiment to mimic the continuous adsorption process in addition peba was recyclable after low temperature heat treatment the adsorption capacity 8 1 mg g and removal efficiency 94 03 for tc was still high after three cycles metabolomics analysis revealed that no secondary pollution is released into water after thermal treatment therefore peba has the potential as an efficient adsorbent for removing ppcps from water keywords carbon fiber green fabrication pharmaceuticals adsorption fixed bed column data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps to improve daily life has resulted in releasing these compounds into the environment 1 2 ppcps and their metabolites in water bodies have become a major concern for the environment and human health 2 3 several methods have been utilized for the removal of ppcps from wastewater before their release to the environment such as chemical oxidation 4 coagulation 5 membrane separation 6 photocatalyst 7 bioreactor 8 ion exchange 9 catalytic membrane reactor 10 12 and adsorption 13 15 in particular adsorption is an attractive and exciting technique due to its effectiveness to remove a wide range of contaminants in water 16 17 in general adsorption efficiency depends on the characteristics of adsorbents e g surface area surface functional groups porosity surface charge and on the operating conditions such as ph temperature a ratio of adsorbent adsorbate and contact time 18 19 carbon based materials including carbon nanotube 20 graphene 21 activated carbon 15 carbon aerogel 13 biochar 22 and carbon nanofiber 23 satisfy the above criteria thus they are frequently used to remove ppcps in water due to their large surface area and the plurality of functional groups with a strong affinity for organic compounds 14 24 synthesis of carbons with three dimensional 3d structure including carbon fiber aerogel 13 25 carbon nanotube sponges 26 graphene aerogel 27 carbon fiber graphene aerogel 28 and graphene carbon nanotube aerogel 29 have been extensively investigated because of their outstanding physical properties which include low apparent density high porosity large specific surface area high electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity 30 however the preparation processes could be expensive complicated toxic and thus impractical for large scale production 30 alternatively carbonous material prepared from biomasses such as biochar is a good choice as an adsorbent for pollutant removal from water these can be prepared from biomaterials and non mineral materials such as rice straw 31 coconut shells 32 olive stones 33 potato peels 34 and spent tea leaves 35 via pyrolysis although the as prepared adsorbent shows low adsorption efficiency due to its lower surface area the surface area can be improved via physical or chemical activation typically the physical activation is done by using co2 and water steam as activating agents while the chemical activation requires chemical reagents such as koh h3po4 naoh and zncl2 however utilizing large amounts of chemicals increases production costs and chemical pollution thus restricting their industrial applications it may also have a negative impact on the environment although there is currently an innovative method called oxygen plasma a clean technology that increases the surface area of carbon materials without chemicals or solvents 36 37 it has a limitation on the investment cost and complex operation of equipment this work prepared a chemical free adsorbent carbon fiber aerogel from empty egg boxes the fabrication process did not involve the use of any chemicals after physical reduction freeze drying and pyrolysis the pyrolyzed egg box aerogels peba exhibited a favorably porous structure large specific surface area and particularly low density the peba was studied for the removal of four ppcps viz diclofenac dic caffeine cf tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip from water the interactive effect of contact time initial adsorbate concentration pyrolysis temperature and holding times were investicated furthermore isotherm modeling and kinetic studies were carried out to comprehend the adsorption mechanism and the adsorption rate the fixed bed column adsorption demonstrations were preformed to study the effect of flow rate initial adsorbate concentration and amount of the adsorbent moreover the reusability of saturated adsorbent was also tested by applying a thermal method for the re pyrolysis of peba at a low temperature all experiments have shown that peba can be a good candidate as an efficient adsorbent for tested ppcps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ppcps four ppcps namely caffeine cas no 58 08 2 diclofenac sodium salt cas no 15307 79 6 tetracycline hydrochloride cas no 64 75 5 and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cas no 8393 32 0 were used in this work all ppcps were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation of carbon fiber aerogel the egg box was torn and cut into small pieces then 30 g of egg box scraps was poured into 2000 ml deionized di water and thoroughly mixed using a mechanical blender until the mixture became homogenous the blended egg box solution was cast in a petri dish 90 mm in diameter and 15 mm in height subsequently it was freeze dried alpha 2 4 ld plus christ at a 35 c in a vacuum of 0 12 mbar for 48 h to form egg box aerogels eba afterwards eba was converted to carbon fiber aerogels via pyrolysis in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere the pyrolysis conditions were varied using three pyrolysis temperatures 500 700 and 900 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and three holding times 30 60 and 120 mins finally peba aerogels were crushed and turned into powders using a mechanical blender scheme 1 summarizes the green fabrication process of peba and its utilization for ppcps adsorption 2 3 characterization the morphology of the peba was analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope jsm 7900f schottky fe sem the pore size and the surface area were studied through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using the micromeritics tristar ii plus the specific surface area was investigated with brunauer emmett teller bet theory while the porosity was calculated via the barett joyner halenda bjh equation the surface functional groups of the peba were determined via fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer frontier system raman spectra were recorded on a dxr3xi raman imaging microscope the value of the ph of zero charge phpzc was calculated using the ph drift method 13 for this purpose the nacl solution 0 05 m with different ph from 2 to 11 was prepared after that the nacl solution with a volume of 10 ml was added into a 12 ml glass tube containing 10 mg of peba powder and the mixture was stirred for 24 h after that the final ph was read and the phpzc was examined with plotting the final ph phf minus the initial ph phi against phi 2 4 batch adsorption experiments before the experiments peba powder was washed with di water at 150 rpm for 60 min using a roller shaker the process was repeated five times to remove dust and mineral ash that occurred during the pyrolysis process after that peba powder was separated from water by suction filtration and oven dried at 50 c overnight before using in all adsorption experiments 2 4 1 adsorption experiments the adsorption demonstrations were conducted to determine the best performing peba at different pyrolysis temperatures and holding times the experiments were carried out in glass tubes 12 ml and kept in the incubator shaker ks 4000 i control ika for 240 min at 22 c with the natural ph of the ppcps for adsorption experiments 5 mg of peba was added to 5 ml of various ppcps with the initial concentration of 10 mg l each experiment was repeated three times and the average results were reported after reaching the equilibrium the solution was collected using a 0 45 Î¼m regenerated cellulose syringe filter minisart rc25 syringe filter 17 765 sartorius the solution concentration was analyzed by the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 5000 uv vis nir at the wavelength of 276 nm 13 38 273 nm 39 40 357 nm 41 42 and 278 nm 43 45 for dic cf tc and cip respectively the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity qe mg g of peba were

pyrolyzed at different temperatures 100 300 and 500 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and a holding time of 30 and 60 min after re pyrolysis peba was washed with di water three times then samples were filtered and supernatants were collected for further analysis peba was dried in an oven at 50 c overnight the regenerated sample was weighted for tc adsorption using the same conditions as in the batch experiments the residual concentration of tc was determined as described in section 2 4 1 2 7 metabolomics analysis the collected supernatant after washing peba was analyzed via an agilent

hierarchical clustering heatmaps of normalized metabolites log transformed and pareto scaled were made by metaboanalyst version 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the morphology of eba and peba pyrolyzed at 900 c for 30 min was examined by sem as presented in fig 1 a and b both samples showed a porous structure consisting of a three dimensional interconnected network of fibers but the fiber sizes differed the size of the eba s fibers was in the range of 80 220 nm while the fiber of peba was 50 nm moreover the surface area of the aerogel increased from 6 21 m2 g before pyrolysis eba to 409 57 m2 g after pyrolysis peba the pore volume increased from 0 008 cm3 g eba to 0 241 cm3 g peba moreover pore size increased from 5 24 nm eba to 7 51 nm peba these results indicate a significant impact of pyrolysis which decreased the nanofibers dimension and enhanced the aerogel s surface area and porosity furthermore it transformed the cellulose based fibers into carbon based fibers as evidenced by the ftir spectra in fig 1 c the ftir spectra of eba aerogel showed various absorption bands which are the characteristic bands of cellulose namely the hydroxyl oh group at 3335 cm 1 the ch stretching at 2903 cm 1 the cc stretching at 1593 cm 1 the ch bending at 1425 cm 1 the co stretching at 1738 and 1161 cm 1 and the c o c pyranose at 1031 cm 1 these bands disappeared after pyrolysis due to the decarboxylation of c o c bonds and the decomposition of hydroxyl groups indicating that the eba has transformed into carbon nanofiber 54 58 for the peba the additional ftir bands were observed at approximately 2353 2122 and 2107 cm 1 which are assigned to cc stretching cc stretching and the allene chain c c c stretching respectively 13 these observations were confirmed by the raman spectra of eba and peba aerogels as shown in fig 1 d the eba exhibited the cellulose peaks at the raman shift of 1381 1124 1097 900 and 382 cm 1 whereas the peaks at 1456 and 1274 cm 1 belong to lignin the peaks at 1604 and 1656 cm 1 are from hemicellulose 59 61 these raman peaks disappeared after pyrolysis instead two strong peaks at 1342 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 were observed which corresponded to the d band and g band representing the disorder in carbon nanofiber and the in plane vibrational stretching mode of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms respectively 62 64 the ftir and raman spectra showed the change in the chemical composition from cellulose fibers eba to carbon fibers peba after passing through the pyrolysis process which is in agreement with previous studies 13 25 3 2 batch adsorption experiments first screening tests were conducted to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperatures and pyrolysis holding times through peba fabrication on dic cf tc and cip removal efficiency from water fig 2 a shows the removal efficiency of peba aerogels pyrolyzed at 500 c 700 c and 900 c with a fixed holding time of 60 min it is clearly seen that the removal efficiency increased with the pyrolysis temperature peba pyrolyzed at 900 c showed the highest removal efficiency 95 for cf tc and cip and 75 for dic compared to the removal efficiency of 10 for dic and cf when peba was pyrolyzed at 500 c the reason for the higher removal efficiency with increasing pyrolysis temperature is understandable it is well known for pyrolyzed carbon materials that as the pyrolysis temperature increases organic molecules in the biomass become more volatile and decomposed voids are created in the matrix leading to an increase in micropores in the carbonaceous materials 65 67 hence increasing pyrolysis temperature caused a complete transformation from cellulose fibers to carbon fibers it also enhanced the surface area and pore volume of peba 68 69 fig 2 b shows the effect of pyrolysis holding time on the removal efficiency the aerogels were pyrolyzed at 900 c but the holding times were varied as 30 60 and 120 min as with increasing pyrolysis temperatures the longer pyrolysis holding time causes the volatilization and loss of organic compounds leading to higher micropores pore volume and surface area of the carbon materials 67 69 all ppcp molecules experience this effect however it is particularly noticeable in the case of dic the removal efficiency of dic increases from 69 at 30 min holding time to around 85 at 120 min holding time in contrast increasing the holding time does not prominently affect the removal efficiency of cf tc and cip because the removal efficiencies of other ppcp molecules were already very high 90 even for the holding time of 30 min thus the pyrolysis temperature and the holding time were selected as 900 c and 30 min to produce the peba aerogel this fabrication condition was used for the adsorption experiment in the rest of the studies this condition may not be the best regarding the highest adsorption efficiency for all ppcps but it is sufficient to remove ppcps at low concentrations in wastewater it is also more economical for peba aerogel production fig 3 presents the effect of ppcps concentration and contact time on the adsorbate removal efficiency and the peba adsorption capacity the ppcps concentrations were varied from 1 to 100 mg l and the removal efficiency is shown in fig 3 a the removal efficiency dropped when the ppcps concentrations increased by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbates the ratio of active sites on the adsorbent surface to the total ppcps molecules decreases this effect in turn decreases the removal efficiency due to excessive ppcps molecules in the solution on the other hand the adsorption capacity increased with increasing ppcps concentrations fig 3 b it could be attributed to the provision of a prominent driving force by higher ppcps concentrations to overcome the adsorbate transfer resistance at the solid liquid interface 70 the influence of the contact time on the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity is presented in fig 3 c and d the contact time was varied from 1 to 240 min while the concentration was kept constant at 10 mg l it is clearly seen from the graphs that the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity increased by increasing contact times the longer contact times allow the ppcps molecules to interact with the active site of the peba adsorbent surface it should be noted that the peba can adsorb all ppcps very quickly reaching the equilibrium within 20 min with the removal efficiency approaching 100 for cf tc and cip 3 3 adsorption isotherms the isotherm experiments were carried out to evaluate the possible adsorption mechanism and to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity of peba the adsorption isotherms of dic cf tc and cip by peba are shown in fig 4 a comparison of ppcps adsorption with previously studied adsorbents is presented in table 1 as compared to another adsorbent in table 1 peba s ppcps adsorption capacity was within range however it took peba less time to reach the adsorption equilibrium the time to reach equilibrium was only 20 min making peba a suitable adsorbent for quick adsorption applications it should be noted that some of the adsorbents listed in table 1 exhibited very high adsorption capacity particularly the porous carbon derived from co2 ref 41 however the process to fabricate this adsorbent is complicated involving galvano electrolysis to reduce co2 in ternary carbonate melt electrolyte consisting of li2co3 na2co3 and k2co3 with ni sheet and pt ti plate as cathode and anode thus compared to others materials peba is much easier to synthesize though it showed lower adsorption capacity of selected ppcps it was also produced from waste and the process did not involve the use of any harmful chemicals to further understand the mechanism two parameter langmuir freundlich and three parameter sips redlich peterson isotherm models were used to fit the data the langmuir isotherm is applied for monolayer adsorption onto the homogeneous surface of an adsorbent in contrast the freundlich isotherm is based on multilayer adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent the sips model is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich models for predicting the heterogeneous adsorption system and overcoming the limitation of high adsorbate concentrations associated with the freundlich model this model responds to a monolayer adsorption capacity characteristic of the langmuir isotherm at high adsorbate concentrations finally the redlich peterson model incorporates the langmuir and freundlich combination like the sips model but it responds to the ideal langmuir model at low concentration and responds to the freundlich model at high concentration 71 73 the fitting parameters using these models are aggregated in table 2 of all models the redlich peterson model was found to show the best fit with the experimental results with the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 947 0 989 0 975 and 0 981 for dic cf tc and cip respectively and the lowest root mean square error rmse when compared with other models it referred to the adsorption of all ppcps on the peba surface is monolayer adsorption at low concentrations and multilayer adsorption at high concentrations according to the redlich peterson model 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is the study to explain the adsorption mechanism of the adsorbate onto the surface of the adsorbent by varying the contact time 74 the adsorption of dic cf tc and cip versus the contact time at constant ppcps concentration and adsorbent dosage was plotted as shown in fig 5 the adsorption of all ppcps rapidly increased with time up to around 20 min after that the adsorption reached equilibrium and the adsorption capacities of peba at equilibrium for dic cf tc and cip were approximately 8 3 9 8 8 4 and 10 5 mg g respectively the experimental data were fitted by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models as shown in fig 5 a b c and d for dic cf tc and cip adsorption respectively the pseudo first order model explains the physical adsorption process that proceeds with diffusion through a boundary while the pseudo second order model represents the chemical adsorption with a strong linkages between adsorbate and adsorbent 75 the kinetic parameters from the fittings of model are indicated in table 3 the best fit of all experiments defined from the highest r2 and the lowest rmse belongs to the pseudo second order model additionally the calculated adsorption capacity qm from the pseudo second order model coincided with the experimental value qexp it indicates that all four ppcps in this work adsorbed on the peba surface favor the chemisorption process furthermore adsorption kinetic data were fitted with the resistance to intraparticle diffusion equation ride eq 9 the so called weber morris model this model investigates the mass transfer resistance at the boundary layer that can explain the diffusion mechanism of adsorption the results from fittings are presented in fig 5 e f g and h for dic cf tc and cip adsorption respectively and the fitting parameters are summarized in table 3 the c value determines the thickness of the boundary layer when c is equal to zero the linear line passes through the origin denoting no boundary layer between the adsorbate and adsorbent and interparticle diffusion is considered the only rate controlling step however the r 2 value of the model is low and the regression line did not pass through the origin this indicates a more pronounced boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion is not the only mechanism controlling adsorption instead the adsorption process involved three linear regions including rapid surface loading at the beginning 1st linear section then gradual pore diffusion during 5 20 min 2nd linear section and finally horizontal equilibrium after 20 min 3rd linear section 74 76 3 5 adsorption mechanism understanding the fundamental of adsorption is necessary since it can estimate the adsorbent s commercial application in this work the adsorption of four ppcps onto peba adsorbent showed different removal efficiency and adsorption capacity depending on the physicochemical properties of adsorbates dic cf tc and cip and the surface properties of peba in addition other environmental conditions such as solution ph and temperature are also crucial for the adsorption process here the ph of ppcps solutions was not controlled during the experiment so it was not fixed but was in the range of 5 6 the proposed mechanisms for dic cf tc and cip adsorption onto the peba are presented in fig 6 the possible adsorption mechanisms in this work are the pore filling effect Ï Ï interaction electrostatic interaction cation Ï interaction and hydrophobic interaction the sem images and bet analysis mentioned in section 3 1 showed that the peba aerogel exhibited an excellent porous structure from the three dimensional interconnected carbon fibers thus the pore filling effect is a probable physical adsorption mechanism that occurred for all ppcps adsorption this mechanism can explain the rapid and high adsorption capacity of ppcps molecules corresponding to the first stage of adsorption based on the intraparticle diffusion model the second mechanism is the Ï Ï interaction which is the interaction between aromatic compounds and carbon based materials according to the ftir and raman results from section 3 1 peba exhibited a number of cc and cc functional groups in the structure and presented the raman g band graphite band meanwhile all of the ppcps used in this study have aromatic rings in the structure the chemical structures are shown in fig 6 so there are undoubtedly Ï Ï interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbates which is another possible mechanism in the adsorption process the third mechanism is the electrostatic interaction to understand this mechanism the surface charge of the adsorbent and the ionic forms of the ppcps were taken into consideration these variables are related to their ph including the phpzc of peba pka of each ppcps molecule and ph of the solution the phpzc of peba was found to be 8 56 as shown in fig 7 it means that the surface charge of peba was positive when the ph of the solution was below 8 56 the ph of dic cf tc and cip solutions used in all experiments were 5 77 5 72 4 83 and 6 20 respectively which were lower than 8 56 it indicates that the surface charge of peba adsorbent was positive in all experiments another important factor is the pka of the ppcps molecules the pka of dic is 4 15 which divides it into two major forms the neutral form dic0 at ph 4 15 and the anionic form dic at ph 4 15 77 since the ph of dic solution was 5 77 the dic molecules were in the anionic form secondly the pka of cf is 0 7 and 14 in the aquatic environment cf can be a cation cf at ph 0 7 neutral cf0 at 0 7 ph 14 and anion at ph 14 78 thus the cf molecules have no charge in the adsorption experiment solution ph of 5 72 furthermore the pka of tc is 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 in the adsorption experiments where the solution ph was 4 83 tc was in a neutral form tch 2 0 79 it should be noted that even though the total charge of tch 2 0 was zero the tc molecule had a polar structure with an equal amount of positive and negative charges finally the pka of cip is 5 90 and 8 89 leading to the neutral form cip0 in the adsorption experiment ph 6 20 80 similar to tch 2 0 cip0 is a polar molecule with equal positive and negative charges in the structure following the argument above the electrostatic interaction mechanism can occur in the adsorption of dic tc and cip due to the attraction between the positive charge of the adsorbent surface and the negative charge of the adsorbate molecules moreover the cation Ï bond is a relatively strong interaction that can occur between an electron rich Ï system e g aromatic donors and an adjacent cation here the Ï electron of the peba structure can form the cation Ï bond with the protonated amino group in the structure of tc and cip molecules 81 the last possible mechanism in the adsorption process is the hydrophobic interaction the hydrophobic interaction is the bonding between the hydrophobic site of adsorbent and adsorbate the strength of this interaction depends on the hydrophobic site of each adsorbate in this experiment the hydrophobic interaction was more effective on the dic and cip adsorption than cf and tc adsorption this is due to higher octanol water partition coefficient log kow of dic 3 91 13 and cip 0 4 82 than the cf 0 07 83 and tc 1 30 84 3 6 fixed bed column experiments although batch adsorption studies can be used for screening the adsorbents and understanding the adsorption mechanism it is not practical to use in large scale wastewater treatment due to their limited small volume and difficult operation in solid liquid separation instead the fixed bed column studies can mimic the continuous process on the industrial plant scale for this purpose the peba efficiency in the column was measured tc was selected as the ppcps compound in these experiments the effect of initial concentration flow rate and adsorbent mass on the adsorption capacities was investigated and the calculated column parameters are summarized in table 4 the effect of initial tc concentration ci was studied and the resulting breakthrough curves are shown in fig 8 a increasing ci reduced the breakthrough time tb defined as the time when cf ci 0 05 for example tb decreased from 50 min to 13 min and the total operation time ttotal decreased from 347 min and 98 min when ci was raised from 5 mg l to 20 mg l increasing ci also had a negative effect on the adsorption capacities qbed and qtotal which decreased from 29 mg g to 23 mg g and from 1 47 mg to 1 17 mg respectively when ci increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l these results showed that the column operation of peba adsorbent was more efficient at lower tc concentrations similar findings were reported in other studies 85 the effect of flow rate is presented in fig 8 b it can be observed that when the flow rate was increased from 1 to 3 ml min tb and ttotal decreased from 71 to 17 min and from 272 to 116 min respectively furthermore increasing the flow rate reduced the removal efficiency y from 48 07 to 32 83 qtotal from 1 39 mg to 1 19 mg and qbed from 28 mg g to 24 mg g these observations suggest that the contact time between tc molecules and available binding sites of the adsorbent surface is insufficient at higher flow rates leading to inferior column performance of tc adsorption finally the effect of the adsorbent mass was investigated as shown in fig 8 c it showed that the column performance was improved when the adsorbent mass was increased when the adsorbent mass was increased from 25 mg to 100 mg both tb and ttotal also increased from 32 min to 77 min and from 140 min to 302 min respectively the higher adsorbent mass provided more available adsorption sites and sufficient residence time within the column from the column experiments it can be concluded that peba is more efficient in column adsorption for a low tc concentration with a low flow rate and using a large peba mass 3 7 reusability study regeneration techniques such as thermal desorption microwave irradiation supercritical fluid regeneration solvent regeneration advanced oxidation process and microbial assisted adsorbent regeneration have been applied to regenerate saturated adsorbents among them bio regeneration is slow and some chemical constituents of adsorbent and adsorbate can be harmful to microorganisms 86 chemical regeneration using organic and inorganic solvents or through oxidation is limited due to the toxicity of potential by products and the generation of secondary pollutants 87 in contrast thermal regeneration is a chemical free approach which has been used successfully to regenerate carbonous adsorbents such as activated carbon and biochar 88 accordingly in this study thermal regeneration was conducted by re pyrolysis of saturated peba to avoid chemicals used fig 9 a shows the removal efficiency of the regenerated adsorbent after re pyrolysis at 100 500 c for 30 60 min the best removal efficiency of tc was observed in the regenerated peba adsorbent at 500 c for 30 or 60 min the removal efficiency reached approximately 98 which was very close to the removal efficiency of the fresh peba the red dashed line in fig 9 a however regeneration at the lower temperature 300 c and short holding time 30 min could still provide relatively high removal efficiency 96 similar to the peba regenerated at 500 c thus the regeneration temperature of 300 c could be a better option considering the energy consumption and cost savings this condition was used to regenerate the peba in the cyclic adsorption experiments as shown in fig 9 b in the first three cycles both tc removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of regenerated peba were not significantly changed the adsorption capacity dropped slightly from 8 4 mg g in the 1st cycle to 8 1 mg g in the 3rd cycle while the removal efficiency changed from 96 5 to 94 0 these results demonstrated the reusability of peba adsorbent however the adsorption performance decreased more prominently after the 3rd cycle the removal efficiency was around 70 in the 6th cycle the sem images of the samples after the 1st and 6th cycles are also presented in fig 9 b the morphology of the peba after the 6th cycle shows the non uniform distribution of pores and the increase in pore size which indicates the beginning of the collapsed porous structure resulting in a drop in removal efficiency on the other hand ftir spectra not shown were relatively unchanged after several adsorption regeneration cycles implying no changes in chemical bonds although thermal regeneration is considered a fast and highly efficient method it is criticized for high energy consumption and the destruction of adsorbents at high temperatures 22 the findings of this study showed that thermal regeneration could be efficient at low temperatures e g 300 c and short holding times e g 30 min therefore decreasing the reaction temperature and holding time can reduce energy consumption and enhance the overall applicability of thermal regeneration another concern related to thermal treatment is the generation of unknown compounds the heat might decompose adsorbate or break the bonds between adsorbent and adsorbate 86 89 for instance xiao et al 2020 reported the decomposition and mineralization of organic pollutants perfluorooctanoic acid on spent granular activated carbon after thermal treatment at 200 c and 700 c or higher respectively 90 it should be noted that after thermal regeneration decomposed compounds can be released into the water during the subsequent adsorption cycles and cause secondary water pollution despite its importance the release of by product compounds to water through thermal regeneration processes is rarely studied in this study peba was washed three times with distilled water after each cycle of adsorption thermal regeneration the filtrates were collected for the analysis of detectable compounds in supernatants for this purpose firstly the pure tc before and after heating at 300 c was analyzed using lc qtof ms to ensure that the tc and its degraded products are detectable using the established method when the output confirmed that tc and its transformed compounds are detectable with lc qtof ms the filtrates of washed peba were analyzed with the same method lc qtof ms analysis screened 448 features in both positive and negative ionization modes among these 37 metabolites were annotated using ms and msms data 73 were annotated by ms data and the rest remained unknown fig 9 c shows the clustering heatmap of top 35 significantly altered metabolites with the exact m z between different washing steps this figure indicates that the concentration of detected compounds after the first wash was higher than in the second and third washing steps tc and its degradation products were not found among the screened compounds this finding shows that tc and its related compounds were not released into water after thermal regeneration or their concentrations were lower than the detection limit of the established method considering the high accuracy and sensitivity of lc qtof ms analysis tc is most likely turned to gaseous products or fixed on the peba adsorbent through thermal regeneration therefore the detected compounds in washed samples should have originated from peba due to heating fig 9 d represents the principal component analysis plot of detected compounds based on different regeneration cycles as shown in this figure the released chemicals into water after the first and fifth cycles are more separated than in other cycles thus fresh and overused peba adsorbent can release different compounds through the thermal regeneration process fig 9 e depicts the principal component analysis plot of screened compounds based on different washing steps between regeneration cycles this figure shows that different compounds are released after each washing step different chemical profiles from the first wash could be related to more available compounds on the surface of peba after re pyrolysis 4 conclusions this study proposed the green fabrication of carbon nanofiber aerogel from egg boxes without any use of harmful chemicals in all processes the pyrolysis temperatures and holding times were varied to find the optimum condition for fabricating the peba the adsorption experiments were carried out with four ppcps compounds i e dic cf tc and cip the best performance was obtained when peba was pyrolyzed at 900 c for 30 min furthermore the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of all ppcps depended on their initial concentration and contact times several models were fitted to the adsorption isotherms it was found that the redlich peterson model was the best fit which implies that monolayer adsorption occurs at lower concentrations and multilayer adsorption takes place at higher concentrations the pseudo second order model was found to be the best fitted model in kinetic studies indicating that the ppcps adsorbed on peba surface favor the chemisorption process in addition the adsorption mechanism of all ppcps on peba was proposed which involved the pore filling effect Ï Ï interaction electrostatic interaction cation Ï interaction and hydrophobic interaction the peba was also tested for continuous adsorption in the fixed bed column studies the results showed that peba is more efficient at low tc concentrations with a low flow rate and a large adsorbent mass moreover peba can be recycled and reused through simple heat treatment it is also verified that this regeneration process did not cause secondary pollution by releasing by products into water in summary the combination of low cost environment friendly fabrication process high efficiency and fast adsorption make the peba a fascinating adsorbent material for ppcps removal from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12469,phytoremediation success depends on the selection of suitable plant species to this end the multiple attribute decision making process madm is a useful tool for selecting plants to remediate wastewater here macrophytes were used to treat synthetic swine wastewater ssw and the best plant alternative for phytoremediation of ssw was chosen based on the hybrid entropy fuzzy ahp topsis madm method the attributes used to feed the madm method were treatment performance physiological endpoint changes and biomass by products macrophyte treated wastewater achieved higher pollutants removal

azolla proved to be the best option for phytoremediation of swine wastewater since it had the highest rank as determined by the proposed method acute toxic units of the treated effluent 0 38 and phyto

will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past few decades animal production has been transformed from subsistence farming to an intensive model where costs have decreased but environmental impact has increased pig production is characterized by high loads of solid liquid and gaseous wastes making it one of the agricultural activities with the greatest environmental impact 1 the composition of swine wastewater can vary according to age number nutritional needs feed composition housing methods e g bedding material and production phase mating gestating farrowing nursery and growing finishing of the animals 2 these wastewaters are composed of faeces and urine mixed with wash water containing pathogenic microorganisms unmetabolized antibiotics nutrients and organic matter 3 thus the use of an efficient method of treating swine wastewater is essential conventional treatment methods whether physical chemical or biological can have limited capacity to remove pollutants and or have high implementation and or operational costs 4 commonly used in the treatment of piggery wastewater anaerobic digestion reduces health risks and produces biogas and biofertilizer however digestion does not reduce the pollution load sufficiently to discharge this wastewater into waterbodies requiring post treatment typically by waste stabilization pond systems 3 even this combined treatment may not eliminate n p and organic matter which still needs to be properly treated and recycled given this context bio based remediation using plants known as phytoremediation technology is an attractive sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative with low operation and maintenance costs 5 aquatic plants namely macrophytes are capable to removing metals nutrients and xenobiotic compounds from industrial municipal and agricultural wastewaters 6 7 however different plants perform differently in improving wastewater quality 8 and although plants can be tolerant to toxic compounds the success of using macrophytes lies in the choice of a suitable plant species the appropriate selection of the phytoremediator species is considered the most important factor for biomass growth and nutrient removal efficiency 9 for instance kadir et al 10 evaluated the capacity of the duck weeds lemna minor and azolla pinnata for phytoremediation of four dilutions 2 5 5 10 and 15 of palm oil manufacturing effluent pome over ten days the authors reported that the 2 5 pome dilution resulted in the highest growth of l minor and a pinnata 8 7 g e 9 8 g wet weight increases respectively and all the plants survived until the end of the 10 day exposure period with a pinnata presenting greater reductions in the parameters analyzed the highest ammonia reductions were found in the 5 pome dilution 98 with a pinnata and 95 5 with l minor while the highest phosphate removals were found in the 10 pome dilution 93 3 with a pinnata and 87 7 with l minor and the highest cod removals were found in the 15 pome dilution 78 with l minor and 66 with a pinnata the authors highlighted the importance of the plants in improving treated effluent quality while at the same time serving as a potential source of animal feed for swine wastewater xu and shen 11 highlight that the wastewater offers a readily and cost effective growth medium for macrophytes due to the high concentration of nutrients but selecting the best plant from a collection of local strains is a prerequisite for establishing an effective cultivation system nevertheless what if the selection of these plants involved the direct participation of stakeholders in the plant selection process if plant performance varies by wastewater type and plant strain species what parameters should be taken into account to evaluate which plant is best for a given wastewater or treatment condition for this purpose the multiple attribute decision making process madm is a useful tool for selecting the most suitable plant to remediate contaminated areas 12 13 madm methodologies are based on various approaches and representations of the logic of the human decision making process 14 and have been employed in choosing wastewater treatment alternatives 15 wang et al 13 used ahp topsis and triangular fuzzy numbers to choose the most suitable plants for phytoremediation of two petroleum contaminated soil sites in china the changing shale gas field and liaohe oil field the criteria used in the study included physiological characteristics natural environmental conditions and polluted soil properties the highest weight of the evaluation system for the changning shale gas field was assigned to moisture content followed by light intensity for the liaohe oil field temperature had the greatest weight followed by moisture content the results showed that in the changning shale gas field festuca arundinacea was the most suitable plant according to the ahp topsis fuzzy calculations for the liaohe oil field festuca elata keng ex e alexeev had the highest score using the fuzzy ahp topsis method cao et al 12 evaluated fifteen clones of salix spp to phytoremediate soils contaminated by heavy metals cd zn and pb under flooded and non flooded control conditions the best clones for phytoremediation were selected based on the ahp entropy model fed with the attributes criteria growth performance photosynthetic parameters accumulation and mobility of toxic metals flooding affected growth and behavior of photosynthetic parameters in different ways with different clones showing an increase or decrease in height stem diameter and leaf area as well as photosynthetic rate transpiration rate or stomatal conductance in relation to the control condition the flooded condition reduced cd contents 11 7 90 1 in all organs but increased zn and pb contents in the roots compared to the non flooded condition in general the ahp entropy model indicated three clones with the greatest potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated by metals under the conditions studied thus the use of the madm methodology for selecting plants for phytoremediation of contaminated areas has proven to be a valuable approach however to date there have been no reports on phytoremediation of swine wastewater in view of the aforementioned the present study compared the performances of four macrophyte species lemna minuta landoltia punctata salvinia minima and azolla microphylla in treatment of synthetic swine wastewater biomass by products production and physiological plant trait endpoints we used multicriteria decision making based on entropy fuzzy ahp for weighting followed by topsis to rank alternatives to select the most suitable macrophyte phytoremediator of swine wastewater our results provide a comprehensive dataset on the potentials of the four macrophytes for the phytoremediation of swine wastewater as well as by product production here we propose the use of the madm methodology as a way to identify the most satisfactory macrophyte alternative the one that guarantees not only wastewater reclamation but also that provides biomass in quality and quantity for further upcycling 2 material and methods 2 1 plant stock cultivation the plants used in this experiment were the full fledged floating aquatics plants azolla microphylla kaulf water fern salvinia

floating plants and control units contained only sww without plants each treatment consisted of 3 replicates for a total of 15 experimental units fig a 1 supplementary material to reduce the bias of

stress index psi was calculated using the biomarkers chl a chl b total chl car and antho contents following the methods proposed by beliaeff and burgeot 31 guerlet et al 32 and devin et al 33 briefly the mean value x for each macrophyte biomarker was standardized using the mean value m and standard deviation sd for all macrophyte biomarkers to produce the y value as follows eq 8 8 y x m sd the z value was then defined as z y or z y corresponding to activation or inhibition of a biomarker respectively the score value s for each biomarker content was obtained according to eq 9 9 s z min where min is the minimal z value for all treatment groups for each biomarker the changes in biomarker content bmki at the beginning day 0 and end day 10 of the experiment bmki bmk10 bmk0 were measured to further estimate score values the plant with the greatest reductions inhibition bmki 0 in chlorophyll a b and total chlorophyll 34 and greatest increases induction bmki 0 in carotenoids and anthocyanin 35 36 contents in its tissues was considered to have the highest stress index level in this method a higher ibr value meant a greater response more stress expressed by the exposed organisms moreover a radar diagram plotted according to the score s value indicated the strength of biomarkers in response to pollutants the highest score corresponded to the greatest biological effects thus to calculate the scores of the pigments chl a chl b and total chl transformed bmki values were used as follows bmkt 1 bmki for carotenoids and anthocyanin contents the score s values were

depended on the arrangement of biomarkers the median of all possible n 1 psi matrices were used as the final psi index value 33 2 6 4 biomass total lipids crude protein and total volatile solids contents total lipid content in macrophyte biomass was estimated by bligh and dyer s method 37 and was expressed as of dw g of lipids per 100 g of dry plant weight the crude protein content in macrophyte tissue was estimated by n 6 25 38 whereas nitrogen n was measured by the kjeldahl nitrogen method and expressed as of dw g of proteins per 100 g of dry plant weight volatile solids were determined by ignition of residue in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 30 min 39 the results were expressed as mg of volatile solids per g of dry plant biomass mg g 1dw 2 7 multi criteria decision making methods the approach to choosing the best plant for the phytoremediation of swine wastewater among the four alternative macrophytes a microphylla l punctata l minuta and s minima was based on the quality of the treated wastewater criteria i and the physiological characteristics of the plants and their biomass by products criteria ii fig a 2 supplementary material each of these criteria is composed of indicators and their respective attributes the supposition was that the most suitable plant was ideally the one that presented the maximum removal of wastewater physicochemical quality attributes physicochemical quality indicators minimized acute and chronic wastewater ecotoxicity expressed as toxicity units toxicity indicators presented the highest production of lipids proteins and volatile solids content resource recovery indicators and finally presented the greatest growth and lowest phyto stress index phytotoxicity indicators a total of thirteen attributes were considered in the evaluation process fig a 2 supplementary material the attributes used in decision making were chosen through a literature survey of common pollutants studied in the phytoremediation process as well as biomass by products and their phytotoxicity endpoints rgr and psi the wastewater physicochemical quality indicators and resource recovery indicators were classified as benefit attributes while toxicity indicators and phytotoxicity indicators were classified as costs in the topsis model see text a 1 supplementary material the multicriteria decision making methods for the comparison of the four floating macrophytes were performed using combined entropy and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process e fahp methods for weighting criteria and topsis for ranking of the alternatives the purpose of the use of e fahp in this study was to combine the advantages of subjective fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and objective entropy evaluation methods to produce weights and reduce limitations of each

growth endpoint changes we used a statistical generalized linear model glm with a gamma log normal or normal continuous distributions in r software the significant distribution that best fit the data was chosen based on the lowest value of the akaike information criterion aic among the three indicated distributions table a 9 supplementary material we also performed a tukey post hoc test to assess pairwise differences between treatments a significance level of 5 was set for all statistical analyses a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of topsis ranking preference of the four macrophytes alternatives a detailed description can be found in the supplementary material text a 2 fig a 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 treated synthetic swine wastewater quality 3 1 1 wastewater physicochemical quality indicators all macrophyte treatments significaantly reduced n nh4 and n no3 concentrations compared to the control p 0 05 fig 1 removals of n nh4 were 7 control 26 3 s minima 36 4 l minuta 36 4 l punctata and 42 4 a microphylla for nitrate nitrogen removals were 13 6 control 50 9 l minuta 63 2 l punctata 40 1 s minima and 65 7 a microphylla were observed nitrogen removal in macrophyte treatment units can occur by plant uptake nitrification denitrification sedimentation of particulate nitrogen and volatilization of ammonia 41 indeed at the end of the treatments a bottom sludge was formed including in the control treatment fig a 3 supplementary material but no decaying plant biomass was observed wastewater ph increased from 6 5 raw wastewater to ph 7 5 control ph 7 6 l minuta ph 7 6 l punctata ph 7 2 s minima and ph 7 8 a microphylla although at ph 7 the nh3 nh4 equilibrium shifts towards formation of ammonia which volatilizes 42 the close to neutral ph values do not suggest major ammonia volatilization occurred thus sedimentation and volatilization seemingly represented small fractions of nitrogen removal as corroborated by the low removals of n nh4 7 and n no3 13 in the control treatments other routes direct plant uptake and nitrification denitrification likely explain the removal of n nh4 and n no3 denitrifying bacteria develop in anaerobic anoxic environments although the aerenchyma of aquatic plants release oxygen to the rhizosphere through photosynthesis 43 overpopulation shades the units and decreases the oxygen content in the rhizosphere zone 44 favoring denitrifying conditions in this study it was not possible to measure the dissolved oxygen or oxidation reduction potential in the treated wastewater direct plant uptake contributed to the removal of nitrogen plants preferentially uptake nh4 over no3 since the energy required to assimilate nh4 is lower than for no3 45 nevertheless in all treatments the nitrate nitrogen removal was greater than ammonium nitrogen removal however it has already been observed that the increase in nitrate ammonium ratio in growth medium led to a decrease in uptake of both n forms by roots and an increase the uptake of no3 by fronds 46 thus we believe that the greater nitrate removals was mainly due to denitrification and direct plant uptake in contrast ammonia removal may have been mainly due to direct plant uptake toyama et al 47 cultivated four duckweed species spirodela polyrhiza lemna minor lemna gibba and landoltia punctata over 4 days of exposition and evaluated their potentials to remove nitrogen from municipal swine and anaerobic digestion wastewaters unlike our results they found an increase in n no3 for all plants in treated swine wastewater they argued that microbial nitrification prevailed over denitrification due to the inhibition caused by the aerobic conditions formed in the rhizosphere by duckweed photosynthesis in our case this did not appear to have occurred from an initial concentration of 97 3 mg l 1 p po4 3 the treatments removed 7 9 control 66 3 l minuta 71 5 l punctata 64 7 s minima and 68 3 a microphylla wetlands may provide a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to remove phosphorus from wastewater these may include precipitation of metal phosphates adsorption onto clay or substrate particles biological reduction or plant uptake 48 nevertheless the main route of phosphorus removal in floating macrophyte tanks is direct uptake by the plant and plant mediated microbial processes 49 hence the low phosphate removal in the control unit 7 9 corroborates that the phosphate removal pathway required the presence of macrophytes copper and zinc are essential pig dietary supplements and unabsorbed cu2 and zn2 can enter swine wastewater via faeces and urine 50 for cu all plant mediated treatments showed significantly lower concentrations p 0 05 than the control unit fig 2a on the other hand no significant differences in zn concentrations were observed in the wastewaters treated by the four plants and the control glm p 0 05 fig 2b macrophytes are recognized for their effectiveness in taking up heavy metals from wastewater 51 both metals are essential elements for these plants with zn serving as a co factor for several enzyme systems and in protein synthesis 52 while cu plays a role in the synthesis of photosynthetic electron transporters 53 among the physicochemical parameters the lowest final concentrations were observed for organic matter tcod fig 2c with removals of 25 control 68 s minima 79 3 l punctata 80 7 a microphylla and 80 6 l minuta all macrophyte treatments produced final tcods significantly lower p 0 05 than the control treatment fig 2c although a synthetic wastewater was used treatment did not take place under sterile conditions and was therefore subject to the development of microorganisms which may have colonized plant roots and metabolized organic matter the synthetic wastewater presented a bod5 20 cod ratio of 0 57 table 1 and was characterized as readily biodegradable 42 thus it is likely that the microorganisms present in the wastewaters contributed to the high tcod removals 3 1 2 ecotoxicological wastewater evaluation the macrophyte treated and control units significantly reduced acute and chronic toxicities to c dubia from an initial value of 116 6 the acute toxic units tua ranged from zero no toxicity in the l minuta and a microphylla treated wastewaters to 2 16 units in the control table 2 the chronic toxic units ranged from 1 41 in lemna treated wastewater to 2 77 units in the control table 2 far below the initial value of 121 4 c dubia is extremely sensitive to metals and other compounds present in swine wastewater toxicity of some of these pollutants reported in the literature include lc50 2d 1 15 mg l 1 for n nh4 54 to d magna and 18 Î¼g l 1 cu or 173 5 Î¼g l 1 zn to c dubia 55 furthermore in a multi element medium synergistic interactions occur and other compounds potentiate toxicity of the wastewater 55 56 thus it was expected that the high concentrations of the pollutants in the synthetic swine wastewater table 1 table a 1 would cause high acute and chronic toxicities to c dubia only one study was found in the literature that evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of swine wastewater using c dubia as a model organism 57 in which acute toxicity lc50 2d of swine wastewater after secondary treatment was found in the range of 27 9 31 5 tua 3 5 3 2 that wastewater with lower acute toxicities had metals and nutrient concentrations about 10 to 100 fold lower than the wastewater used in our study a recent study showed that despite being different species c dubia and d magna have similar sensitivities in acute and chronic toxicity tests and therefore toxicity results of both may be comparable 58 villamar et al 56 characterized toxicity in primary swine wastewater and estimated an lc50 2d 3 5 tua 28 5 to d magna those authors observed that the toxicity of the wastewater to the test organism was related to the presence of n nh4 wastewater treated with a microphylla and l minuta presented significantly lower acute and chronic toxicities than the control and l punctata and s minima treated wastewaters table 2 after three days neither l minuta nor a microphylla wastewater presented acute toxicity to c dubia furthermore only the wastewater treated by these two plants presented significantly lower chronic toxicity than the control unit table 2 3 2 biomass by products and physiological plant characteristics 3 2 1 resource recovery indicators protein lipids and total volatile solids contents were quantified in the l punctata l minuta s minima and a microphylla harvested at the end of the experiment final protein contents ranged from 22 8 dw to 33 7 dw lipids from 1 1 dw to 14 1 dw and volatile solids from 660 1 mg g 1 to 687 8 mg g 1 dw there was no significant difference between treatments for volatile solids glm p 0 05 fig 3a biomass productivity is an important parameter for assessing plant growth and its by product potential yield 59 all four macrophytes grew vigorously in the synthetic swine wastewater over the 10 day experiment l minuta 15 94 g m 2 d 1 and a microphylla 15 44 g m 2 d 1 presented the highest biomass productivity p 0 05 whereas s minima 12 65 g m 2 d 1 had the lowest productivity fig 3b l punctata 33 0 9 dw and l minuta 22 7 0 9 dw contained the highest and lowest p 0 05 protein contents respectively while s minima 28 5 6 2 dw and a microphylla 28 4 1 0 dw had similar intermediate protein contents fig 3c the great potential of protein production by l punctata treating swine farming wastewater has already been reported in the literature for instance bergmann et al 21 compared 41 duckweed species in swine wastewater treatment and l punctata was the species with the highest protein production mohedano et al 49 evaluated the efficiency of l punctata ponds in the removal of nutrients from piggery wastewater as well as biomass productivity and protein content the ponds produced 68 ton ha 1 y 1 of dw and 35 dw of protein revealing the great potential of l punctata to polish swine wastewater and simultaneously produce added value l minuta had the highest p 0 05 lipids content 14 1 2 1 dw while s minima was the macrophyte with the lowest final lipids content 1 1 0 2 dw and a microphylla 7 8 2 4 dw and l punctata 9 8 0 2 dw had statistically similar lipids contents p 0 05 fig 3d to the best of our knowledge no studies that evaluated lipid content in macrophyte biomass that treated swine farming wastewater have been reported in the literature however for other types of wastewater lipid concentrations vary between 4 and 14 dw 60 61 the protein and lipids contents together with high biomass production make the postharvest macrophyte biomasses candidates for potentially value added by products such as biofuels and animal feeds 62 which may support circular economy efforts 3 2 2 phytotoxicity indicators overall there was a decrease in chlorophylls a b and total and an increase in carotenoids and anthocyanin in the fronds of the macrophytes at the end of the experiment table 3 the largest reductions in chl a occurred in l minuta 45 3 followed by l punctata 26 6 a microphylla 12 9 and s minima 9 8 the behavior was slightly different for chl b and total chl for chl b s minima 44 9 had the largest reductions followed by l minuta 28 2 a microphylla 26 5 and l punctata 14 5 the decreasing order of tchl reductions was l minuta 40 9 s minima 27 9 l punctata 23 6 and a microphylla 15 9 l punctata had the highest contents p 0 05 of these pigments before and after treatment whereas s minima and a microphylla had the lowest p 0 05 table 3 photosynthetic pigment changes can indicate the potential productivity in plants and their reduction can be used as a test for wastewater borne toxicity although it does not indicate a specific substance that causes this toxicity 34 although essential for plant metabolism high concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus inhibit the growth of aquatic plants 63 64 moreover metals are readily absorbed by aquatic plants and are more likely to be harmful when internalized 34 for instance henke et al 65 observed aberrations in the chloroplasts of l punctata exposed to metals on the other hand carotenoids and anthocyanin increased during all treatments with the maximum change occurring in a microphylla and s minima followed by l punctata and l minuta table 3 living organisms have a redox system that aims to balance the production increase of reactive oxygen species ros and prevent damage under environmentally stressful conditions the toxic effects of ros in plants are counteracted by enzymatic and non enzymatic mechanisms 66 representing the second line of defense against ros the non enzymatic antioxidant system includes carotenoids and phenolic compounds i e anthocyanin that act as scavengers for these species that impair plant growth and development 35 36 l minuta 0 3163 0 006 presented the highest relative growth rate and s minima 0 2309 0 004 the lowest l punctata 0 2857 0 012 and a microphylla 0 2665 0 006 presented statistically similar rates rgr is a useful indicator of plant growth under environmental stress and disturbance regimes the higher the plant rgr during treatment the better adapted the plant was to the wastewater 67 to sum up the photosynthetic pigments chl a b and total decreased and carotenoids and anthocyanin increased in the four plants after phytoremediation of ssw this indicates that the treatment conditions increased phytotoxicity in all macrophytes however it was not possible to pinpoint which plant was most or least tolerant to the wastewater since different responses were found in different plants to uncover the oreder of tolerance we used the phyto stress index which can be defined as any external factor that negatively affects plant growth reproductive capacity and survival 35 the toxicity biomarkers related to photosynthesis including chl a chl b total chl car and antho were integrated and quantified in phyto stress index psi values psi values were obtained from the median of all n 1 ai matrices eqs 10 and 11 see methods section 2 6 3 expressed in table 3 overall a microphylla presented the lowest stress index 0 09 during treatment of synthetic swine wastewater table 3 while the highest psi was found for l minuta 3 52 the expressive psi for l minuta was attributed to the high reductions in chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll during wastewater treatment with this plant which presented the highest scores for these two biomarkers among all biomarkers of all plants table a 5 supplementary material only azolla showed no visible signs of necrotic or chlorosis spots in their fronds fig a 3 supplementary materials to the best of our knowledge no studies have used the ibr value from photosynthetic pigments for aquatic plants and our study contains the first account of this useful tool for measuring the phyto stress of macrophytes using photosynthetic pigments 3 3 multi criteria analysis the weighting criteria were obtained from subjective fahp and objective entropy methods for subjective weighting of the fifteen experts evaluations only ten were considered for the calculation of the weights since they obtained cr 0 1 table a 2 supplementary material for the fahp method ws rgr tua tuc and rnh4 n were the four most important attributes while rcod was the least important table 4 the weights were also determined by the entropy method wo in which the variation of attribute responses between alternatives was considered and the greatest weight was attributed to the greatest variation in this method the attributes of greatest importance highest weight were tuc psi and lipids and those of least importance were volatile solids and rp po43 rgr had the highest weight in the fahp method and one of the lowest in the entropy method this difference shows the importance of combining the methods to produce compromise weights wc eq 12 since using only one would lead to different ranking of the alternatives cost attributes were the most important criteria in compromise weights in descending order tuc psi and lipids were the attributes with the highest weights while rcod rp po43 and volatile solids were the least important table 4 the attribute response matrix table a 6 supplementary material was normalized the normalized decision matrix was multiplied by the compromise weights in the weighted normalized decision matrix vij table a 7 supplementary material among the alternatives the largest response differences were found for tua lipids and psi which caused the entropy value of these attributes to increase and therefore their weights for instance the higher psi value obtained by l minuta increased the entropy value of psi and affected its combined weight a combination of high weight and high psi cost type value caused lemna s score to decrease for tuc lipids and psi there was an increase in entropy weights compared to fahp weights table 4 since the final weight wc was calculated as a weighted average eq 12 it is possible that the entropy method could have more importance than the fahp on the final choice of plant however a comparison of topsis rankings by the two methods showed greater similarity between the ranking of the combined weights wc and the subjective weights fahp obtained from the experts evaluation than between wc and entropy weights table 5 the large differences in tuc lipids and psi among the alternatives did not lead to advantages of the entropy method over the fuzzy ahp weighting method in any case in both rankings a microphylla was the highest ranked macrophyte the wc scores were considered as the final topsis rankings and the best alternative found was a microphylla followed by l minuta l punctata and s minima table 5 in the sensitivity analysis the weights of the attributes were changed and ranking results were assessed the sensitivity analysis also proved the preference of azolla regardless of the weights assigned fig a 4 supplementary material hence wc and topsis were proven reliable for choosing a suitable macrophyte for phytoremediation of swine wastewater 3 4 advantages and recommendations of the present research approach the hybrid entropy fuzzy ahp weighting topsis ranking method was considered to select the best floating macrophyte for the phytoremediation of ssw to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to simultaneously assess treated wastewater quality biomasses by products and phytotoxicity endpoints as attributes in a multicriteria decision making process by integrating the entropy fahp and topsis methods it was possible to find a plant that not only met the expectations of the decision maker but also the intrinsic values obtained by its performance during wastewater treatment from the attributes quality criteria of the treated wastewater were considered with regard to plant characteristics during phytotoxicity and after biomass by products wastewater treatment this approach allowed us to evaluate not only if phytoremediation improves the quality of the ssw wastewater but also which plants were less affected by the wastewater as measured by the psi moreover thinking about a circular economy the proposal innovates by incorporating the potential of value added products from plants prioritizing the choice of a plant with higher production of lipids and proteins while also evaluating the volatile solids content of the biomass as a prospect for potential production of bioenergy some studies used the integration of multicriteria decision making methods in the choice of plants for phytoremediation including consideration of aspects of physical chemical quality of the remediated medium and plant physiology 12 13 but not for wastewater with consideration of quality attributes of the treated wastewater physiological plant characteristics and biomass by products furthermore this is the first time a microphylla is reported for treating swine wastewater our study showed the as yet unexplored potential of this species in treating swine wastewater the selection of wastewater treatment technologies using decision making processes depends heavily on factors such as capital operating and maintenance costs 15 since this was a laboratory experiment social and environmental aspects were not considered we chose to work under conditions with no external variations including using real wastewater that could vary from one collection to another the objective was that the only variable was the different plants used it is recommended however that this methodology also be applied at a pilot scale under external variations and that capital capex and operation opex costs still little explored and discussed in constructed wetlands treatment systems are implemented in multicriteria decision making models even so the present work provided good results and met the objective which was to choose the plant best suited for the treatment of swine wastewater based on the quality of the treated wastewater the health of the plants and the value added by products the plant biomass could provide after wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the macrophytes l minuta l punctata a microphylla and s minima were used for the treatment of synthetic swine wastewater during 10 days of exposure at the end of the experiment the quality of the treated wastewater biomass resources and growth parameters were assessed overall there were significant differences in the removal of the pollutants among the plants and almost always with the control a microphylla stood out as the plant with the lowest psi caused by ssw in turn l minuta presented treatment with the highest rgr and lipid production both plants performed very well in removing acute and chronic toxicity of the treated wastewater to c dubia however l minuta was strongly affected by wastewater as indicated by its highest psi value these better performances of a microphylla and l minuta were shown in the ranking obtained by the hybrid madm method proposed here in this method a microphylla was chosen as the most suitable macrophyte for swine wastewater treatment ranking considering only the individual weight methods fahp and entropy and sensitivity analysis also indicated the best performance of this species our study provides a reliable approach for decision makers to choose a suitable macrophyte with dual advantages optimal wastewater treatment performance and

12469,phytoremediation success depends on the selection of suitable plant species to this end the multiple attribute decision making process madm is a useful tool for selecting plants to remediate wastewater here macrophytes were used to treat synthetic swine wastewater ssw and the best plant alternative for phytoremediation of ssw was chosen based on the hybrid entropy fuzzy ahp topsis madm method the attributes used to feed the madm method were treatment performance physiological endpoint changes and biomass by products macrophyte treated wastewater achieved higher pollutants removal

and 25 18 26 42 14 for zn respectively furthermore azolla and lemna removed more ssw toxicity and presented the lowest phyto stress index 0 09 and highest lipids production 14 dw during treatment azolla proved to be the best option for phytoremediation of swine wastewater since it had the highest rank as determined by the proposed method acute toxic units of the treated effluent 0 38 and phyto stress index 0 49 had the greatest weight in choosing the best plant while the production of biomass volatile solids and removals of p po4 3 and tcod were the least influential this study provided a reliable approach to select the best plant from available macrophytes capable of improving physicochemical and ecotoxicological quality of wastewater and offer value added plant biomass products

will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past few decades animal production has been transformed from subsistence farming to an intensive model where costs have decreased but environmental impact has increased pig production is characterized by high loads of solid liquid and gaseous wastes making it one of the agricultural activities with the greatest environmental impact 1 the composition of swine wastewater can vary according to age number nutritional needs feed composition housing methods e g bedding material and production phase mating gestating farrowing nursery and growing finishing of the animals 2 these wastewaters are composed of faeces and urine mixed with wash water containing pathogenic microorganisms unmetabolized antibiotics nutrients and organic matter 3 thus the use of an efficient method of treating swine wastewater is essential conventional treatment methods whether physical chemical or biological can have limited capacity to remove pollutants and or have high implementation and or operational costs 4 commonly used in the treatment of piggery wastewater anaerobic digestion reduces health risks and produces biogas and biofertilizer however digestion does not reduce the pollution load sufficiently to discharge this wastewater into waterbodies requiring post treatment typically by waste stabilization pond systems 3 even this combined treatment may not eliminate n p and organic matter which still needs to be properly treated and recycled given this context bio based remediation using plants known as phytoremediation technology is an attractive sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative with low operation and maintenance costs 5 aquatic plants namely macrophytes are capable to removing metals nutrients and xenobiotic compounds from industrial municipal and agricultural wastewaters 6 7 however different plants perform differently in improving wastewater quality 8 and although plants can be tolerant to toxic compounds the success of using macrophytes lies in the choice of a suitable plant species the appropriate selection of the phytoremediator species is considered the most important factor for biomass growth and nutrient removal efficiency 9 for instance kadir et al 10 evaluated the capacity of the duck weeds lemna minor and azolla pinnata for phytoremediation of four dilutions 2 5 5 10 and 15 of palm oil manufacturing effluent pome over ten days the authors reported that the 2 5 pome dilution resulted in the highest growth of l minor and a pinnata 8 7 g e 9 8 g wet weight increases respectively and all the plants survived until the end of the 10 day exposure period with a pinnata presenting greater reductions in the parameters analyzed the highest ammonia reductions were found in the 5 pome dilution 98 with a pinnata and 95 5 with l minor while the highest phosphate removals were found in the 10 pome dilution 93 3 with a pinnata and 87 7 with l minor and the highest cod removals were found in the 15 pome dilution 78 with l minor and 66 with a pinnata the authors highlighted the importance of the plants in improving treated effluent quality while at the same time serving as a potential source of animal feed for swine wastewater xu and shen 11 highlight that the wastewater offers a readily and cost effective growth medium for macrophytes due to the high concentration of nutrients but selecting the best plant from a collection of local strains is a prerequisite for establishing an effective cultivation system nevertheless what if the selection of these plants involved the direct participation of stakeholders in the plant selection process if plant performance varies by wastewater type and plant strain species what parameters should be taken into account to evaluate which plant is best for a given wastewater or treatment condition for this purpose the multiple attribute decision making process madm is a useful tool for selecting the most suitable plant to remediate contaminated areas 12 13 madm methodologies are based on various approaches and representations of the logic of the human decision making process 14 and have been employed in choosing wastewater treatment alternatives 15 wang et al 13 used ahp topsis and triangular fuzzy numbers to choose the most suitable plants for phytoremediation of two petroleum contaminated soil sites in china the changing shale gas field and liaohe oil field the criteria used in the study included physiological characteristics natural environmental conditions and polluted soil properties the highest weight of the evaluation system for the changning shale gas field was assigned to moisture content followed by light intensity for the liaohe oil field temperature had the greatest weight followed by moisture content the results showed that in the changning shale gas field festuca arundinacea was the most suitable plant according to the ahp topsis fuzzy calculations for the liaohe oil field festuca elata keng ex e alexeev had the highest score using the fuzzy ahp topsis method cao et al 12 evaluated fifteen clones of salix spp to phytoremediate soils contaminated by heavy metals cd zn and pb under flooded and non flooded control conditions the best clones for phytoremediation were selected based on the ahp entropy model fed with the attributes criteria growth performance photosynthetic parameters accumulation and mobility of toxic metals flooding affected growth and behavior of photosynthetic parameters in different ways with different clones showing an increase or decrease in height stem diameter and leaf area as well as photosynthetic rate transpiration rate or stomatal conductance in relation to the control condition the flooded condition reduced cd contents 11 7 90 1 in all organs but increased zn and pb contents in the roots compared to the non flooded condition in general the ahp entropy model indicated three clones with the greatest potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated by metals under the conditions studied thus the use of the madm methodology for selecting plants for phytoremediation of contaminated areas has proven to be a valuable approach however to date there have been no reports on phytoremediation of swine wastewater in view of the aforementioned the present study compared the performances of four macrophyte species lemna minuta landoltia punctata salvinia minima and azolla microphylla in treatment of synthetic swine wastewater biomass by products production and physiological plant trait endpoints we used multicriteria decision making based on entropy fuzzy ahp for weighting followed by topsis to rank alternatives to select the most suitable macrophyte phytoremediator of swine wastewater our results provide a comprehensive dataset on the potentials of the four macrophytes for the phytoremediation of swine wastewater as well as by product production here we propose the use of the madm methodology as a way to identify the most satisfactory macrophyte alternative the one that guarantees not only wastewater reclamation but also that provides biomass in quality and quantity for further upcycling 2 material and methods 2 1 plant stock cultivation the plants used in this experiment were the full fledged floating aquatics plants azolla microphylla kaulf water fern salvinia

by evaluating their sensibility to sodium chloride nacl as reference material 2 6 plant biomasses analyses 2 6 1 relative growth rate and biomass productivity at the beginning and end of the experiment plant biomass fresh weight fw g was determined by blotting the plant on paper towel to remove excess water followed by weighing on an analytical balance for plant dry weight dw g a known fw mass of sample was placed in an airflow oven at 65 c for 72 h until a constant weight was obtained the relative growth rate rgr d 1 of the plants was calculated based on dry biomass using eq 1 1 rgr ln dw e dw b t where rgr is the average relative growth rate d 1 dwb g and dwe g represent the dry biomass at the beginning and end of the experiment respectively and t represents the duration of the

carotenoids and anthocyanin contents chlorophyll a chl a b chl b total total chl and carotenoids car extractions were performed according to su et al 26 absorbance readings at 470 649 and 664 nm were used to calculate amounts of chl a chl b total chl and car 27 eqs 3 6 the results were expressed in mg pigment per g fresh weight of plant biomass mg g 1 fw 3 chlorophyll a mg g 1 13 36 a 664 5 19 a

absorbance readings at 529 and 650 nm were made to correct chlorophyll absorbance overlaps 29 eq 7 total anthocyanin content was calculated using the corrected absorbance ac and molar absorbance

changes during synthetic swine wastewater treatment the contents of chl a chl b total chl car and antho were recorded before the start plants harvested from hoagland solution day 0 and at the end plants harvested from synthetic swine wastewater day 10 of the experiment 2 6 3 phyto stress index psi a general stress index integrated biomarker responses ibr from here on referred to as the phyto stress index psi was calculated using the biomarkers chl a chl b total chl car and antho contents following the methods proposed by beliaeff and burgeot 31 guerlet et al 32 and devin et al 33 briefly the mean value x for each macrophyte biomarker was standardized using the mean value m and standard deviation sd for all macrophyte biomarkers to produce the y value as follows eq 8 8 y x m sd the z value was then defined as z y or z y corresponding to activation or inhibition of a biomarker respectively the score value s for each biomarker content was obtained according to eq 9 9 s z min where min is the minimal z value for all treatment groups for each biomarker the changes in biomarker content bmki at the beginning day 0 and end day 10 of the experiment bmki bmk10 bmk0 were measured to further estimate score values the plant with the greatest reductions inhibition bmki 0 in chlorophyll a b and total chlorophyll 34 and greatest increases induction bmki 0 in carotenoids and anthocyanin 35 36 contents in its tissues was considered to have the highest stress index level in this method a higher ibr value meant a greater response more stress expressed by the exposed organisms moreover a radar diagram plotted according to the score s value indicated the strength of biomarkers in response to pollutants the highest score corresponded to the greatest biological effects thus to calculate the scores of the pigments chl a chl b and total chl transformed bmki values were used as follows bmkt 1 bmki for carotenoids and anthocyanin contents the score s values were calculated using the direct bmki values the psi index was calculated according to eqs 10 11 31 33 10 a i 1 2 sin 2 Ï n s i s i 1 in which individual areas ai connect the ith and the i 1 th radius coordinates of the star plot si and si 1 represent consecutive clockwise individual biomarker scores and their successive star plot radius coordinates n represents the number of radii corresponding to the biomarkers used in the study and the term 2Ï n is calculated in radians the psi corresponded to the total area displayed by the radar diagram eq 11 31 11 psi a i however since the psi value depended on the arrangement of biomarkers the median of all possible n 1 psi matrices were used as the final psi index value 33 2 6 4 biomass total lipids crude protein and total volatile solids contents total lipid content in macrophyte biomass was estimated by bligh and dyer s method 37 and was expressed as of dw g of lipids per 100 g of dry plant weight the crude protein content in macrophyte tissue was estimated by n 6 25 38 whereas nitrogen n was measured by the kjeldahl nitrogen method and expressed as of dw g of proteins per 100 g of dry plant weight volatile solids were determined by ignition of residue in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 30 min 39 the results were expressed as mg of volatile solids per g of dry plant biomass mg g 1dw 2 7 multi criteria decision making methods the approach to choosing the best plant for the phytoremediation of swine wastewater among the four alternative macrophytes a microphylla l punctata l minuta and s minima was based on the quality of the treated wastewater criteria i and the physiological characteristics of the plants and their biomass by products criteria ii fig a 2 supplementary material each of these criteria is composed of indicators and their respective attributes the supposition was that the most suitable plant was ideally the one that presented the maximum removal of wastewater physicochemical quality attributes physicochemical quality indicators minimized acute and chronic wastewater ecotoxicity expressed as toxicity units toxicity indicators presented the highest production of lipids proteins and volatile solids content resource recovery indicators and finally presented the greatest growth and lowest phyto stress index phytotoxicity indicators a total of thirteen attributes were considered in the evaluation process fig a 2 supplementary material the attributes used in decision making were chosen through a literature survey of common pollutants studied in the phytoremediation process as well as biomass by products and their phytotoxicity endpoints rgr and psi the wastewater physicochemical quality indicators and resource recovery indicators were classified as benefit attributes while toxicity indicators and phytotoxicity indicators were classified as costs in the topsis model see text a 1 supplementary material the multicriteria decision making methods for the comparison of the four floating macrophytes were performed using combined entropy and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process e fahp methods for weighting criteria and topsis for ranking of the alternatives the purpose of the use of e fahp in this study was to combine the advantages of subjective fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and objective entropy evaluation methods to produce weights and reduce limitations of each

previously 40 eq 12 12 w c w j s w j o j 1 n w j s w j o the calculation of weights by the two methods e fahp and use of topsis for ranking alternatives is described in supplementary materials text a 1 2 8 data analysis the experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design to determine the effect of treatments to improve swine wastewater quality biomass by products production and plant growth endpoint changes we used a statistical generalized linear model glm with a gamma log normal or normal continuous distributions in r software the significant distribution that best fit the data was chosen based on the lowest value of the akaike information criterion aic among the three indicated distributions table a 9 supplementary material we also performed a tukey post hoc test to assess pairwise differences between treatments a significance level of 5 was set for all statistical analyses a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of topsis ranking preference of the four macrophytes alternatives a detailed description can be found in the supplementary material text a 2 fig a 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 treated synthetic swine wastewater quality 3 1 1 wastewater physicochemical quality indicators all macrophyte treatments significaantly reduced n nh4 and n no3 concentrations compared to the control p 0 05 fig 1 removals of n nh4 were 7 control 26 3 s minima 36 4 l minuta 36 4 l punctata and 42 4 a microphylla for nitrate nitrogen removals were 13 6 control 50 9 l minuta 63 2 l punctata 40 1 s minima and 65 7 a microphylla were observed nitrogen removal in macrophyte treatment units can occur by plant uptake nitrification denitrification sedimentation of particulate nitrogen and volatilization of ammonia 41 indeed at the end of the treatments a bottom sludge was formed including in the control treatment fig a 3 supplementary material but no decaying plant biomass was observed wastewater ph increased from 6 5 raw wastewater to ph 7 5 control ph 7 6 l minuta ph 7 6 l punctata ph 7 2 s minima and ph 7 8 a microphylla although at ph 7 the nh3 nh4 equilibrium shifts towards formation of ammonia which volatilizes 42 the close to neutral ph values do not suggest major ammonia volatilization occurred thus sedimentation and volatilization seemingly represented small fractions of nitrogen removal as corroborated by the low removals of n nh4 7 and n no3 13 in the control treatments other routes direct plant uptake and nitrification denitrification likely explain the removal of n nh4 and n no3 denitrifying bacteria develop in anaerobic anoxic environments although the aerenchyma of aquatic plants release oxygen to the rhizosphere through photosynthesis 43 overpopulation shades the units and decreases the oxygen content in the rhizosphere zone 44 favoring denitrifying conditions in this study it was not possible to measure the dissolved oxygen or oxidation reduction potential in the treated wastewater direct plant uptake contributed to the removal of nitrogen plants preferentially uptake nh4 over no3 since the energy required to assimilate nh4 is lower than for no3 45 nevertheless in all treatments the nitrate nitrogen removal was greater than ammonium nitrogen removal however it has already been observed that the increase in nitrate ammonium ratio in growth medium led to a decrease in uptake of both n forms by roots and an increase the uptake of no3 by fronds 46 thus we believe that the greater nitrate removals was mainly due to denitrification and direct plant uptake in contrast ammonia removal may have been mainly due to direct plant uptake toyama et al 47 cultivated four duckweed species spirodela polyrhiza lemna minor lemna gibba and landoltia punctata over 4 days of exposition and evaluated their potentials to remove nitrogen from municipal swine and anaerobic digestion wastewaters unlike our results they found an increase in n no3 for all plants in treated swine wastewater they argued that microbial nitrification prevailed over denitrification due to the inhibition caused by the aerobic conditions formed in the rhizosphere by duckweed photosynthesis in our case this did not appear to have occurred from an initial concentration of 97 3 mg l 1 p po4 3 the treatments removed 7 9 control 66 3 l minuta 71 5 l punctata 64 7 s minima and 68 3 a microphylla wetlands may provide a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to remove phosphorus from wastewater these may include precipitation of metal phosphates adsorption onto clay or substrate particles biological reduction or plant uptake 48 nevertheless the main route of phosphorus removal in floating macrophyte tanks is direct uptake by the plant and plant mediated microbial processes 49 hence the low phosphate removal in the control unit 7 9 corroborates that the phosphate removal pathway required the presence of macrophytes copper and zinc are essential pig dietary supplements and unabsorbed cu2 and zn2 can enter swine wastewater via faeces and urine 50 for cu all plant mediated treatments showed significantly lower concentrations p 0 05 than the control unit fig 2a on the other hand no significant differences in zn concentrations were observed in the wastewaters treated by the four plants and the control glm p 0 05 fig 2b macrophytes are recognized for their effectiveness in taking up heavy metals from wastewater 51 both metals are essential elements for these plants with zn serving as a co factor for several enzyme systems and in protein synthesis 52 while cu plays a role in the synthesis of photosynthetic electron transporters 53 among the physicochemical parameters the lowest final concentrations were observed for organic matter tcod fig 2c with removals of 25 control 68 s minima 79 3 l punctata 80 7 a microphylla and 80 6 l minuta all macrophyte treatments produced final tcods significantly lower p 0 05 than the control treatment fig 2c although a synthetic wastewater was used treatment did not take place under sterile conditions and was therefore subject to the development of microorganisms which may have colonized plant roots and metabolized organic matter the synthetic wastewater presented a bod5 20 cod ratio of 0 57 table 1 and was characterized as readily biodegradable 42 thus it is likely that the microorganisms present in the wastewaters contributed to the high tcod removals 3 1 2 ecotoxicological wastewater evaluation the macrophyte treated and control units significantly reduced acute and chronic toxicities to c dubia from an initial value of 116 6 the acute toxic units tua ranged from zero no toxicity in the l minuta and a microphylla treated wastewaters to 2 16 units in the control table 2 the chronic toxic units ranged from 1 41 in lemna treated wastewater to 2 77 units in the control table 2 far below the initial value of 121 4 c dubia is extremely sensitive to metals and other compounds present in swine wastewater toxicity of some of these pollutants reported in the literature include lc50 2d 1 15 mg l 1 for n nh4 54 to d magna and 18 Î¼g l 1 cu or 173 5 Î¼g l 1 zn to c dubia 55 furthermore in a multi element medium synergistic interactions occur and other compounds potentiate toxicity of the wastewater 55 56 thus it was expected that the high concentrations of the pollutants in the synthetic swine wastewater table 1 table a 1 would cause high acute and chronic toxicities to c dubia only one study was found in the literature that evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of swine wastewater using c dubia as a model organism 57 in which acute toxicity lc50 2d of swine wastewater after secondary treatment was found in the range of 27 9 31 5 tua 3 5 3 2 that wastewater with lower acute toxicities had metals and nutrient concentrations about 10 to 100 fold lower than the wastewater used in our study a recent study showed that despite being different species c dubia and d magna have similar sensitivities in acute and chronic toxicity tests and therefore toxicity results of both may be comparable 58 villamar et al 56 characterized toxicity in primary swine wastewater and estimated an lc50 2d 3 5 tua 28 5 to d magna those authors observed that the toxicity of the wastewater to the test organism was related to the presence of n nh4 wastewater treated with a microphylla and l minuta presented significantly lower acute and chronic toxicities than the control and l punctata and s minima treated wastewaters table 2 after three days neither l minuta nor a microphylla wastewater presented acute toxicity to c dubia furthermore only the wastewater treated by these two plants presented significantly lower chronic toxicity than the control unit table 2 3 2 biomass by products and physiological plant characteristics 3 2 1 resource recovery indicators protein lipids and total volatile solids contents were quantified in the l punctata l minuta s minima and a microphylla harvested at the end of the experiment final protein contents ranged from 22 8 dw to 33 7 dw lipids from 1 1 dw to 14 1 dw and volatile solids from 660 1 mg g 1 to 687 8 mg g 1 dw there was no significant difference between treatments for volatile solids glm p 0 05 fig 3a biomass productivity is an important parameter for assessing plant growth and its by product potential yield 59 all four macrophytes grew vigorously in the synthetic swine wastewater over the 10 day experiment l minuta 15 94 g m 2 d 1 and a microphylla 15 44 g m 2 d 1 presented the highest biomass productivity p 0 05 whereas s minima 12 65 g m 2 d 1 had the lowest productivity fig 3b l punctata 33 0 9 dw and l minuta 22 7 0 9 dw contained the highest and lowest p 0 05 protein contents respectively while s minima 28 5 6 2 dw and a microphylla 28 4 1 0 dw had similar intermediate protein contents fig 3c the great potential of protein production by l punctata treating swine farming wastewater has already been reported in the literature for instance bergmann et al 21 compared 41 duckweed species in swine wastewater treatment and l punctata was the species with the highest protein production mohedano et al 49 evaluated the efficiency of l punctata ponds in the removal of nutrients from piggery wastewater as well as biomass productivity and protein content the ponds produced 68 ton ha 1 y 1 of dw and 35 dw of protein revealing the great potential of l punctata to polish swine wastewater and simultaneously produce added value l minuta had the highest p 0 05 lipids content 14 1 2 1 dw while s minima was the macrophyte with the lowest final lipids content 1 1 0 2 dw and a microphylla 7 8 2 4 dw and l punctata 9 8 0 2 dw had statistically similar lipids contents p 0 05 fig 3d to the best of our knowledge no studies that evaluated lipid content in macrophyte biomass that treated swine farming wastewater have been reported in the literature however for other types of wastewater lipid concentrations vary between 4 and 14 dw 60 61 the protein and lipids contents together with high biomass production make the postharvest macrophyte biomasses candidates for potentially value added by products such as biofuels and animal feeds 62 which may support circular economy efforts 3 2 2 phytotoxicity indicators overall there was a decrease in chlorophylls a b and total and an increase in carotenoids and anthocyanin in the fronds of the macrophytes at the end of the experiment table 3 the largest reductions in chl a occurred in l minuta 45 3 followed by l punctata 26 6 a microphylla 12 9 and s minima 9 8 the behavior was slightly different for chl b and total chl for chl b s minima 44 9 had the largest reductions followed by l minuta 28 2 a microphylla 26 5 and l punctata 14 5 the decreasing order of tchl reductions was l minuta 40 9 s minima 27 9 l punctata 23 6 and a microphylla 15 9 l punctata had the highest contents p 0 05 of these pigments before and after treatment whereas s minima and a microphylla had the lowest p 0 05 table 3 photosynthetic pigment changes can indicate the potential productivity in plants and their reduction can be used as a test for wastewater borne toxicity although it does not indicate a specific substance that causes this toxicity 34 although essential for plant metabolism high concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus inhibit the growth of aquatic plants 63 64 moreover metals are readily absorbed by aquatic plants and are more likely to be harmful when internalized 34 for instance henke et al 65 observed aberrations in the chloroplasts of l punctata exposed to metals on the other hand carotenoids and anthocyanin increased during all treatments with the maximum change occurring in a microphylla and s minima followed by l punctata and l minuta table 3 living organisms have a redox system that aims to balance the production increase of reactive oxygen species ros and prevent damage under environmentally stressful conditions the toxic effects of ros in plants are counteracted by enzymatic and non enzymatic mechanisms 66 representing the second line of defense against ros the non enzymatic antioxidant system includes carotenoids and phenolic compounds i e anthocyanin that act as scavengers for these species that impair plant growth and development 35 36 l minuta 0 3163 0 006 presented the highest relative growth rate and s minima 0 2309 0 004 the lowest l punctata 0 2857 0 012 and a microphylla 0 2665 0 006 presented statistically similar rates rgr is a useful indicator of plant growth under environmental stress and disturbance regimes the higher the plant rgr during treatment the better adapted the plant was to the wastewater 67 to sum up the photosynthetic pigments chl a b and total decreased and carotenoids and anthocyanin increased in the four plants after phytoremediation of ssw this indicates that the treatment conditions increased phytotoxicity in all macrophytes however it was not possible to pinpoint which plant was most or least tolerant to the wastewater since different responses were found in different plants to uncover the oreder of tolerance we used the phyto stress index which can be defined as any external factor that negatively affects plant growth reproductive capacity and survival 35 the toxicity biomarkers related to photosynthesis including chl a chl b total chl car and antho were integrated and quantified in phyto stress index psi values psi values were obtained from the median of all n 1 ai matrices eqs 10 and 11 see methods section 2 6 3 expressed in table 3 overall a microphylla presented the lowest stress index 0 09 during treatment of synthetic swine wastewater table 3 while the highest psi was found for l minuta 3 52 the expressive psi for l minuta was attributed to the high reductions in chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll during wastewater treatment with this plant which presented the highest scores for these two biomarkers among all biomarkers of all plants table a 5 supplementary material only azolla showed no visible signs of necrotic or chlorosis spots in their fronds fig a 3 supplementary materials to the best of our knowledge no studies have used the ibr value from photosynthetic pigments for aquatic plants and our study contains the first account of this useful tool for measuring the phyto stress of macrophytes using photosynthetic pigments 3 3 multi criteria analysis the weighting criteria were obtained from subjective fahp and objective entropy methods for subjective weighting of the fifteen experts evaluations only ten were considered for the calculation of the weights since they obtained cr 0 1 table a 2 supplementary material for the fahp method ws rgr tua tuc and rnh4 n were the four most important attributes while rcod was the least important table 4 the weights were also determined by the entropy method wo in which the variation of attribute responses between alternatives was considered and the greatest weight was attributed to the greatest variation in this method the attributes of greatest importance highest weight were tuc psi and lipids and those of least importance were volatile solids and rp po43 rgr had the highest weight in the fahp method and one of the lowest in the entropy method this difference shows the importance of combining the methods to produce compromise weights wc eq 12 since using only one would lead to different ranking of the alternatives cost attributes were the most important criteria in compromise weights in descending order tuc psi and lipids were the attributes with the highest weights while rcod rp po43 and volatile solids were the least important table 4 the attribute response matrix table a 6 supplementary material was normalized the normalized decision matrix was multiplied by the compromise weights in the weighted normalized decision matrix vij table a 7 supplementary material among the alternatives the largest response differences were found for tua lipids and psi which caused the entropy value of these attributes to increase and therefore their weights for instance the higher psi value obtained by l minuta increased the entropy value of psi and affected its combined weight a combination of high weight and high psi cost type value caused lemna s score to decrease for tuc lipids and psi there was an increase in entropy weights compared to fahp weights table 4 since the final weight wc was calculated as a weighted average eq 12 it is possible that the entropy method could have more importance than the fahp on the final choice of plant however a comparison of topsis rankings by the two methods showed greater similarity between the ranking of the combined weights wc and the subjective weights fahp obtained from the experts evaluation than between wc and entropy weights table 5 the large differences in tuc lipids and psi among the alternatives did not lead to advantages of the entropy method over the fuzzy ahp weighting method in any case in both rankings a microphylla was the highest ranked macrophyte the wc scores were considered as the final topsis rankings and the best alternative found was a microphylla followed by l minuta l punctata and s minima table 5 in the sensitivity analysis the weights of the attributes were changed and ranking results were assessed the sensitivity analysis also proved the preference of azolla regardless of the weights assigned fig a 4 supplementary material hence wc and topsis were proven reliable for choosing a suitable macrophyte for phytoremediation of swine wastewater 3 4 advantages and recommendations of the present research approach the hybrid entropy fuzzy ahp weighting topsis ranking method was considered to select the best floating macrophyte for the phytoremediation of ssw to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to simultaneously assess treated wastewater quality biomasses by products and phytotoxicity endpoints as attributes in a multicriteria decision making process by integrating the entropy fahp and topsis methods it was possible to find a plant that not only met the expectations of the decision maker but also the intrinsic values obtained by its performance during wastewater treatment from the attributes quality criteria of the treated wastewater were considered with regard to plant characteristics during phytotoxicity and after biomass by products wastewater treatment this approach allowed us to evaluate not only if phytoremediation improves the quality of the ssw wastewater but also which plants were less affected by the wastewater as measured by the psi moreover thinking about a circular economy the proposal innovates by incorporating the potential of value added products from plants prioritizing the choice of a plant with higher production of lipids and proteins while also evaluating the volatile solids content of the biomass as a prospect for potential production of bioenergy some studies used the integration of multicriteria decision making methods in the choice of plants for phytoremediation including consideration of aspects of physical chemical quality of the remediated medium and plant physiology 12 13 but not for wastewater with consideration of quality attributes of the treated wastewater physiological plant characteristics and biomass by products furthermore this is the first time a microphylla is reported for treating swine wastewater our study showed the as yet unexplored potential of this species in treating swine wastewater the selection of wastewater treatment technologies using decision making processes depends heavily on factors such as capital operating and maintenance costs 15 since this was a laboratory experiment social and environmental aspects were not considered we chose to work under conditions with no external variations including using real wastewater that could vary from one collection to another the objective was that the only variable was the different plants used it is recommended however that this methodology also be applied at a pilot scale under external variations and that capital capex and operation opex costs still little explored and discussed in constructed wetlands treatment systems are implemented in multicriteria decision making models even so the present work provided good results and met the objective which was to choose the plant best suited for the treatment of swine wastewater based on the quality of the treated wastewater the health of the plants and the value added by products the plant biomass could provide after wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the macrophytes l minuta l punctata a microphylla and s minima were used for the treatment of synthetic swine wastewater during 10 days of exposure at the end of the experiment the quality of the treated wastewater biomass resources and growth parameters were assessed overall there were significant differences in the removal of the pollutants among the plants and almost always with the control a microphylla stood out as the plant with the lowest psi caused by ssw in turn l minuta presented treatment with the highest rgr and lipid production both plants performed very well in removing acute and chronic toxicity of the treated wastewater to c dubia however l minuta was strongly affected by wastewater as indicated by its highest psi value these better performances of a microphylla and l minuta were shown in the ranking obtained by the hybrid madm method proposed here in this method a microphylla was chosen as the most suitable macrophyte for swine wastewater treatment ranking considering only the individual weight methods fahp and entropy and sensitivity analysis also indicated the best performance of this species our study provides a reliable approach for decision makers to choose a suitable macrophyte with dual advantages optimal wastewater treatment performance and biomass with the greatest potential for recycling in a circular economy context credit authorship contribution statement eder carlos lopes coimbra conceptualization methodology investigation formal
