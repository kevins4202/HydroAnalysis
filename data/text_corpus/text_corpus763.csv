3815,dolomitization as one of the most important diagenetic processes in carbonate reservoirs is essential for reservoir porosity development and evolution however the geochemical mechanism of dolomitization is unclear in this study theoretical analysis laboratory physical experiments thermodynamic calculation and computer numerical simulation were combined to explore the coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization a series of water rock reaction experiments at various temperature were firstly carried out x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscope sem icp mass and other analytical methods were used to monitor ion concentration relative content and surface morphology of all minerals secondly molecular dynamics md simulation and thermo hydro chemical thc coupling simulation were employed to analyze various processes of dissolution precipitation and transformation of carbonate rock finally combining thermodynamic calculation coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were determined and the optimum formation conditions of dolomite were confirmed dolomitization experienced a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite at 60 80 and 95 the equilibrium constants of dolomitization are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 respectively dolomite is formed when mg ca ratio equals 5 3 at 95 and the scope activity of mg2 is 32 91 54 52 it would need a much higher activated mg2 or it may be impossible to form dolomite if the mg ca ratio is less than 3 this study has revealed coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on metasomatism dolomitization which could provide a basis for evaluating and predicting high quality carbonate reservoirs keywords carbonate reservoir dolomitization coupled effects temperature solution compositions controlling factors 1 introduction carbonate rocks especially dolomite reservoirs contain significant volumes of the hydrocarbon resources globally hahn et al 2018 rötting et al 2015 whitaker and xiao 2010 xia et al 2019 with the continuous discovery of oil and gas reservoirs in deeply buried dolomite the development mechanism of dolomite reservoirs becomes topical abarca et al 2019 fenter et al 2007 hardie 1987 koeshidayatullah et al 2020 whitaker and xiao 2010 however the origin of sedimentary dolomite a subject of long standing enigma has never been stopped being discussed dolomite camg co3 2 is a simple but important mineral component of sedimentary rocks baker and kastner 1981 jonas et al 2017 jones and xiao 2005 land 1998 pina et al 2020 zhang et al 2010 it is simple because its chemical formula is accessible and the elements contained are only ca mg c and o most dolomites are considered metasomatic formed by replacement of original limestone that is dolomitization whose stoichiometric equation is 2caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 biehl et al 2016 liu et al 2019 whitaker and xiao 2010 dolomitization as one of the most important diageneses in carbonate reservoirs is essential for reservoir porosity evolution alqattan and budd 2017 conliffe et al 2012 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 koeshidayatullah et al 2020 mechanism of dolomitization and its effect on the reservoir porosity is thus of fundamental importance in reservoir development and distribution under various geological conditions dolomitization has different formation models such as seepage reflux evaporation hydrothermal metasomatism microbial genesis etc biehl et al 2016 dravis and wanless 2018 jones and xiao 2005 mei 2012 during the whole diagenesis of carbonate reservoirs whereby formation water is present in the reservoir pores and the resultant fluid rock reactions played a major role in dolomitization hahn et al 2018 liu et al 2020 numerous publications address that temperature kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 solution property biehl et al 2016 kell duivestein et al 2019 whitaker and xiao 2010 and other geological factors bénézeth et al 2018 bialik et al 2018 biehl et al 2016 kell duivestein et al 2019 are partial key controls for dolomitization however minerals dissolution precipitation along with dolomitization is controlled by combined controlling factors rather than single one the essence of dolomitization is minerals transformation therefore the process is controlled by mineral kinetic parameters bénézeth et al 2018 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 zhang et al 2009 as the kinetic rate constant and the mineral saturation state are both temperature dependent dolomitization rate is also strongly influenced by temperature horita 2014 shou et al 2016 whitaker and xiao 2010 in the early stage numerous scholars devote themselves to the synthesis experiment of dolomite under low temperature and pressure land 1998 with the continuous discovery of deep buried dolomite reservoirs more and more scholars have studied the dolomitization of carbonate rocks under relatively high temperature and pressure berninger et al 2017 came et al 2017 chen et al 2019 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 li et al 2015 a series of experiments have been carried out to determine the formation temperature of dolomite land 1998 so far no real stoichiometric dolomite has been synthesized without the involvement of microorganisms at room temperature and pressure in the laboratory a series of subsequent studies show that the formation of dolomite is closely related to the solution compositions bialik et al 2018 chen and tao 2004 etschmann et al 2014 frank and fielding 2003 kaczmarek and sibley 2011 montes hernandez et al 2016 as dolomitization proceeds the process becomes predominantly solution controlled along with ionic supersaturation with calcite dissolution the concentration of ca2 increases which would inhibit the dolomitization the increase of mg2 concentration could reduce the thermodynamic stability of calcite which improves the calcite dissolution and also reduces the effective supersaturation of calcite davis et al 2000 gabellone and whitaker 2016 magnesium is also the material basis of dolomitization as the formation of dolomite needs to consume a huge amount of mg2 de nooijer et al 2017 yang et al 2012 in the early diagenetic stage the most likely source of mg2 supply is seawater however in the late diagenetic stage deep dolomite reservoirs have not all experienced seawater intrusion so where does such a continuous flow and large of mg2 come from previous studies show that mg ca ratio is also one of the decisive factors of dolomitization over a certain range the higher the mg ca ratio in the solution the shorter the induction period and the more likely dolomitization occurs bialik et al 2018 de nooijer et al 2017 frank and fielding 2003 gabellone and whitaker 2016 yang et al 2012 so what kind of ion is really the key factor for the dolomitization coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were investigated in this study laboratory lab water rock reaction experiments at various temperature 60 95 with various types of solution were conducted ions concentrations mineral contents and morphology were monitored in real time to analyze the dolomitization process under varying conditions molecular dynamics simulation md was employed to calculated different interaction force between h2o and mg2 or ca2 a serious of thermodynamic formulae were solved to determine the geochemistry mechanism of dolomitization five thermo hydro chemical thc coupling multi component and multi phase reactive transport simulation models corresponding to the lab experiments were established to verify the experimental data and determine the minerals rate constant the effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were collectively determined which would provide a theoretical basis for the study of the development mechanism of carbonate reservoir 2 experimental methods 2 1 rock samples preparation natural calcite is used in this study fig 1 a xrd results of the starting rocks are shown in fig 1b and the purity is 100 the experimental samples include two size specifications one is block samples with a size of 10 mm 10 mm 5 mm fig 1c and another one is subspherical particles with a diameter of 2 mm formed by crushing the whole calcite fig 1d 2 2 solution medium three types 1 2 and 3 of solution with different mg ca ratio were used in this experiment solutions were prepared by distilled water and chemicals such as cacl2 2h2o mgcl2 6h2o nacl and kcl studies show that the existence of sulfates has an important effect on dolomitization baker and kastner 1981 land 1985 morrow and ricketts 1988 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2012a to exclude the possibility of microbial dolomitization no sulfate was added in this experiment all solutions were saturated with co2 at the corresponding temperature and pressure in each sub experiment mg ca ratios and typical ions concentrations are summarized in table 1 before being saturated with co2 ph values of all solutions are about 7 0 2 3 scheme setting there are 5 sets of experiments in total each of which needs 4 reaction vessels corresponding to 4 sampling time nodes as temperature and solution compositions are crucial factors to be investigated in this study three indicators were set for each factor table 2 the burial depth of dolomite reservoir during the middle deep burial stage is about 600 4600 m and the corresponding temperature ranges from 40 to 120 berninger et al 2017 shou et al 2016 previous study show that dolomite can be generated above 60 fan et al 2012 usdowski 1989 therefore 60 80 and 95 were selected in this experiment mg ca ratios were set with reference to seawater concentrations the pressures were set to constant of 19 mpa 2 4 facility the experiments were conducted using a high temperature and pressure reactor system developed independently by china university of petroleum beijing as shown in fig 2 the reactor is made of a kind of corrosion resistant alloy material containing a 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe plastic liner which could withstand the acid and alkali erosion all reactors are equipped with temperature and pressure control devices the maximum operating temperature and pressure are 100 and 25 mpa respectively 2 5 operation procedure rock samples were washed by ultrasonic vibration in deionized water and dried for 48 h in an electric blast drying oven a total of 10 g of rock samples about two blocks and several particles were weighed and placed in each reactor solution of approximately 9 times of the rock sample mass were added to the reactor the reaction temperature was set through the temperature control systems and the reactor was pressurized to 19 mpa with co2 gas the react was allowed to occur under a sealed environment throughout the experiment the reactor was cooled and opened after the designated experiment time hydro chemical analyses and ph measurement were conducted after solid liquid separation the rock samples were weighted analyzed by xrd and sem after drying 3 experimental results 3 1 dolomitization at different temperature rock weight accumulation and concentrations changes of ca2 and mg2 during exp a c are presented in fig 3 once the reaction starts calcite dissolves in the acid solution releasing a large amount of ca2 at 72 h ca2 concentration increases to 1 1 0 9 and 0 8 mmol l 1 in exp a b and c respectively during this process rock weight in all experiments continue to decrease both ca2 concentration and weight change show that the dissolution degree ranges from strong to weak is exp a b and c ca2 concentrations decrease after 72 h in all experiments because that the released ca2 accumulated in the solution to a certain extent and then precipitated in the second half of the experiment mg2 concentration decreases markedly in exp c with an experimental temperature of 95 but shows little change in the other two experiments in the later stage the rock weight is added by calcite precipitation and other newly formed carbonate minerals from the sem photomicrographs of typical rock samples fig 4 it can be seen clearly that the intensity of dissolution weakens as the temperature increases in the earlier stage fig 4a 4c as fig 4d 4f shown redeposited calcite can be observed in all experiments mostly in exp a at 216 h dolomite is observed by both sem morphology and electron backscatter diffraction ebsd in exp c fig 4g 4i which is consistent with the change in ions concentrations the chemical formula of the newly generated dolomite is ca1 14mg0 86 co3 2 and xrd results also prove the dolomite with a relative content of 1 1 3 2 dolomitization in various solutions rock weight accumulation and concentrations changes of ca2 mg2 during exp c d and e are presented in fig 5 once reaction starts calcite dissolves in the acid solution releasing a large quantity of ca2 ca2 concentration increases from about 10 mmol l 1 to 45 mmol l 1 in all experiments however the change ranges of ca2 concentration are quite similar among the experiments the variation trend of weight is basically consistent with that of ca2 in the later stage weight changes markedly in exp c with the formation of dolomite while change little in other two experiments from the sem photomicrographs of typical rock samples fig 6 it can be seen that the intensity of dissolution is basically no difference during exp c e in the early stage fig 6a 6c redeposited calcite with different shapes can be observed in exp c e fig 4d 4f at 216 h several kinds of dolomites with varying mg ca proportions appeared in exp c fig 6g 6i indicative of metasomatism 4 numerical simulation 4 1 md simulation methods gromacs software package was employed to model the interactions between h2o and ca2 or mg2 in the aqueous phase hess et al 2008 van der spoel et al 2005 spce for water and opls aa for sodium chloride and magnesium chloride potentials were adopted in the molecular dynamics md simulations the system included 5000 water molecules 80 chloride cl ions the total amount of ca2 and mg2 ions were 40 in order to investigate the effect of mg ca ratio two cases were studied one had 20 ca2 and 20 mg2 ions mg ca ratio 1 the other one comprised 6 ca2 and 32 mg2 ions mg ca ratio 5 3 for the temperature effect the mg ca ratio was kept constant as 5 3 6 ca2 and 32 mg2 ions and the pressure was fixed at 19 mpa the temperature was set to 60 80 and 95 c respectively the simulated pressure and temperature conditions were consistent with our lab experiments initially the steepest descent algorithm was used for energy minimization of the simulated systems with a tolerance of 800 kj mol 1 nm 1 isothermal isobaric ensemble npt was adopted for all the simulations the leapfrog integration algorithm was applied with a time step of 1 fs for the lennard jones potential short range nonbonded interactions with a cutoff radius of 1 1 nm were employed the lincs algorithms was used for constraining chemical bond lengths the long range electrostatic interactions were computed by using the particle mesh ewald method with a cutoff radius of 1 1 nm and a grid spacing of 0 12 nm periodic boundary condition was applied to all directions in order to equilibrate the system the pressure and temperature were controlled by berendsen coupling for 2 ns then nosé hoover thermostat was adopted for temperature control and parrinello rahman coupling was used for pressure control on the equilibrium state for 2 ns the data produced from the last 2 ns was analyzed and discussed 4 2 md simulation results fig 7 shows a snapshot of the equilibrated aqueous solution system in which all cations ions are uniformly dispersed in the water molecules in order to distinguish the difference between mg2 and ca2 the radial distribution function rdf values of mg2 ca2 ions with respect to h2o are calculated with temperature and ratio variations fig 8 both of mg2 and ca2 appear to have double hydration layers in all models compared to ca2 mg2 have apparently stronger interaction with the surrounding h2o as the peaks of mg2 approximately 7 appear higher than those of ca2 approximately 4 from fig 8a 8c rdf values of mg2 are 7 326 7 273 and 7 098 while the corresponding rdf values of ca2 are 4 734 4 672 and 4 617 respectively this indicates that the interactions between cations and h2o are weakened with increasing temperature because the kinetic energy of the system increased the motions of the cations are more vigorous and they can diffuse more freely in the solution from fig 8d 8f it can be concluded that the increase of the mg ca ratio also leads to a decrease of rdf values this may be due to the competition between different mg2 that impair the pair interaction between mg2 and h2o however the rdf curves of ca2 are almost invariable with ratio variation 4 3 thc simulation methods a simulation program for multiphase reactive transport toughreact was employed to reproduce the mineral transformation and porosity evolution during dolomitization xu et al 2011 toughreact is a thermo hydro chemical thc coupling program suitable for pertinent study on non isothermal multiphase fluid flow solute transport and reactive geochemistry governing equations involved are tabulated in table 3 the program succeeds from tough2 with a fully coupled computation of fluid and heat flow table 3 pruess et al 1999 the geochemical field is partially coupled with the thermal and hydraulic fields in each time step after the fluid and heat flow part get converged solute transport and geochemical reaction start to run with the known temperature and velocity field and the change of porosity and permeability will affect fluid and heat flow as a feedback xiao and jones 2018 for the calculation of solute transport and geochemical reaction i e the reactive transport part the consumption and production of component in geochemical reaction serve as a kind of source sink item in the solute transport computation abarca et al 2019 pruess et al 1999 xu et al 2011 compared with the conventional convection diffusion equation an addition item is added in table 3 the solute transport part is solved on a component by component basis all gridblocks assemble a large jacobian matrix no iteration is needed to solve it with regard to the geochemical reaction part the system of mixed equilibrium kinetic chemical reaction equations is solved on a gridblock by gridblock basis by using the newton raphson iteration it can deal with the reaction under both equilibrium and kinetic control most reactions are considered in toughreact such as mineral dissolution precipitation gas dissolution exsolution cation exchange surface complexation and adsorption xu et al 2011 xu et al 2012 therefore it can be adequately applied in modelling dolomitization and other reservoir diagenetic reactions 4 4 thc modelling corresponding to lab experiments five reactive numerical models were established corresponding to five sets of experiments a cylinder shaped gridblock with 100 cm3 fig 9 a the same as the reactors in lab experiments fig 9b was established fig 9 temperature pressure starting minerals and solution compositions were exactly the same as the corresponding lab experiments the initial porosity was 0 9 calculated by the amount of rock vs solution as the reactive time of lab experiments was much shorter than the actual geological scale all minerals included in the thc models were kinetics controlled all rate parameters are tabulated in table 4 as the most important and typical ions the ca2 and mg2 concentrations during lab experiments and thc models are analyzed comparatively fig 10 in fig 10 vertical errors refer to experimental instrument and measurement errors while lateral errors refer to sample timing errors consistent with the experimental results calcite is dissolved as the reaction progresses leading to an increase in ca2 concentration in the later stage the mg2 concentration decreases as a result of dolomite precipitation especially in exp c the thc model generally mimics the lab simulation results with a range of numerical errors deemed to be reasonable the errors are mainly due to several factors such as the size of rock particles sample heterogeneities and neglected adsorption firstly the rock particles used in the lab experiment are not uniform in size and shape which may lead to the dissolution dominant sites and gradually cause heterogeneity within the system whereas in the numerical modeling the mineral was assumed to be completely homogeneous and the whole simulation process was assumed to be uniform secondly the rock particles rested completely at the bottom in the experimental autoclave and there was a difference in ionic concentration between the top and the bottom of the autoclave as minerals were dissolved however it was assumed that rocks and aqueous solutions were uniformly distributed in the numerical models finally some physical and microcosmic effects in the experiment were not included in the numerical models such as the adsorption of mg2 on calcite surfaces which may result in higher values than the lab experimental results 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of metasomatism dolomitization dolomitization refers to the process that mg2 in the solution enters the calcite crystal under a specified condition and converts it into dolomite crystal in exp c there are sufficient mg2 promoting dolomite precipitation firstly ca2 ions concentrations in the solution are unsaturated resulting in calcite dissolution caco3 h ca2 hco3 then ca2 becomes saturated in the solution resulting in calcite precipitation and the reaction system enters a dynamic equilibrium at the same time mg2 in the solution begins to be adsorbed on the calcite mineral next the adsorbed mg2 on the calcite gradually replaced ca2 in the calcite to form dolomite or mg rich calcite carbonate minerals with varying mg ca proportions are detected in the experimental products as shown in fig 11 this suggests that dolomitization experiences a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite requires a quite long time to become stable and convert into an ideal dolomite with mg ca proportion close to 1 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 pimentel and pina 2014 pina et al 2020 5 2 controlling factors of metasomatism dolomitization the metasomatic dolomitization process can be expressed as caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 from the perspective of thermodynamics dolomitization is an endothermic reaction thus increasing temperature is beneficial to the forward reaction berninger et al 2017 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 however from a kinetic point of view the dolomitization process is influenced not only by temperature but also by the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the solution kell duivestein et al 2019 montes hernandez et al 2016 both mg2 and ca2 in solution can hydrate with water due to the smaller radius the electrostatic attraction between mg2 and h2o is approximately 20 higher than that between ca2 and h2o consequently it is more likely for mg2 to combine with h2o in the solution to form complexes esteban and taberner 2003 the formation of dolomite requires relatively high reaction activation energy to break the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and for calcite dissolution there are mainly two approaches to overcome the activation energy 1 increase the system temperature to improve the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and caco3 2 increase the concentration of reactants to improve the number of effective collision time between activated mg2 and calcite alqattan and budd 2017 gabellone and whitaker 2016 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 usdowski has experimentally demonstrated that dolomite can be generated as long as the temperature is above 60 usdowski 1989 however in this study no dolomite formation was observed between 60 and 80 this may be attributed to the fact that the c ca2 c mg2 in this study 0 057 mol l 1 is much lower than that in the usdowski s experiment approximately 7 to 9 mol l 1 in addition the reaction time also varies greatly this demonstrates that instead of a single factor dolomitization is controlled by multiple factors such as temperature and solution compositions 5 2 1 temperature the results of molecular dynamics simulation show that the interactions between cations and water weaken with increasing temperature this can be interpreted as the kinetic energy of the system increases as temperature increases which will lead to the more vigorous motions and more free diffusion of the cations in the solution at low temperature mg2 tends to form hydration bond with water and be solvated therefore activated mg2 would be too little to effectively collide with calcite under low temperature conditions thus not conducive to dolomitization by combining the van t hoff equation eq 1 kilgoff equation eq 2 and the relationship between heat capacity c p m θ and temperature eq 3 the relationship between enthalpy change and temperature eq 4 and the relationship between equilibrium constant and temperature eq 5 can be derived bénézeth et al 2018 1 d ln k θ dt δ r h m θ r t 2 2 d δ r h m θ dt δ r c p m θ 3 δ r c p m θ δ a 1 δ a 2 t δ a 3 t 2 δ a 4 t 3 δ a 5 t 2 4 δ r h m θ δ a 1 t δ a 2 t 2 2 δ a 3 t 3 3 δ a 4 t 4 4 δ a 5 t δ h 0 5 ln k θ t δ h 0 rt δ a 1 l n t r δ a 2 t 2 r δ a 3 t 2 6 r δ a 4 t 3 12 r δ a 5 2 r t 2 i where δ r h m θ is the standard molar enthalpy for metasomatic dolomitization δ f g m θ is the standard molar free energy of formation δ f h m θ is the standard enthalpy of formation c p m θ is the specific heat at constant pressure a 1 a 5 are the coefficients that determine c p m θ r is the gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and k θ t is the chemical equilibrium constant at temperature t k θ 298 15 k 1 49 the change in enthalpy with a reaction schedule of 1 mol in the standard state δ r h m θ 298 15 k and the heat capacity coefficient of the reaction δ a 1 can be calculated by eq 7 6 δ r h m θ 298 15 k b ν b δ f h m θ b 298 15 k pr b ν b δ f h m θ b 298 15 k r e 7 δ a 1 b ν b a 1 b pr b ν b a 1 b re where the subscript b represents different substances in the reaction ν b represents the stoichiometric number of substance b and the subscripts pr and re represent the products and reactants respectively by substituting the standard enthalpy of formation δ f h m θ 298 15 k of each substance listed in table 5 into eq 6 it can be calculated that δ r h m θ 298 15 k is equal to 2 87 kj mol 1 in addition by substituting the heat capacity coefficient of each substance listed in table 5 into eq 7 the δ a 1 can be calculated as 1082 13 j mol 1 k 2 and by the same logic we get δ a 2 6 7564 j mol 1 k 2 δ a 3 0 0159 j mol 1 k 3 δ a 4 1 36 10 5 j mol 1 k 4 δ a 5 9 146 106 j mol 1 k respectively substitute the above results into eq 4 and get δ h 0 169 49 kj mol 1 then the corresponding results are substituted into eq 5 and k θ 333 15 k 1 67 k θ 353 15 k 1 75 k θ 368 15 k 1 80 are obtained successively in other words the equilibrium constants are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 at 60 80 and 95 respectively in exp c the temperature was set to 95 high temperature provides energy to break the hydration bond between mg2 and h2o and promoted the solvation of mg2 this leads to an increase in the concentration of activated mg2 involved in the reaction thus improving effective collision times between activated mg2 and caco3 in addition the high temperature accelerates the rate of molecular motion which would increase the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and calcite chen et al 2009 from these two aspects the high temperature is conducive to the formation of dolomite within a certain temperature range in addition temperature also has a significant influence on the degree of the order of dolomite the higher the temperature is the better the degree of the order of dolomite is generated kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 pina et al 2020 5 2 2 solution compositions the equilibrium constant and concentration entropy of dolomitization could be calculated by eqs 8 and 9 respectively when q k the equilibrium moves in reverse reaction direction when q k the system is in an equilibrium state and when q k the equilibrium moves in forward reaction direction which would lead to dolomitization zhang et al 2009 8 k ca 2 m g 2 where k is the equilibrium constant of reaction ca 2 and m g 2 represent the calcium and magnesium ion concentrations at equilibrium respectively 9 q a c a 2 a m g 2 c c a 2 δ c a 2 c m g 2 δ m g 2 c c a 2 c m g 2 δ m g 2 where a is the concentration of activated ions in the solution c is the total concentration of ions in the solution including activated ions and those that hydrate with water and δ represents the proportion of activated ions in the solution to the total ion concentration specifically at 95 the hydration bond between ca2 and h2o is broken and ca2 in solution is considered to be fully involved in the reaction i e a ca 2 c ca 2 δ ca2 100 dolomite formation is observed when the mg ca ratio is 5 3 indicating that q is less than k θ 368 15 k with a value of 1 80 in this case the range of δ mg2 obtained from eq 9 is approximately 32 91 to 54 52 when mg ca ratio is 3 to break the kinetic barrier for dolomitization to generate dolomite i e q 1 80 δ mg2 must be greater than 54 52 if this condition is not satisfied in this experiment there would be no dolomite formation similarly when the mg ca ratio is equal to 1 it can be calculated that δ mg2 must be greater than 171 98 in order to generate dolomite obviously this is impractical that is to say dolomite cannot be formed when the mg ca ratio 1 therefore the lower the mg ca ratio is the greater the activity of mg2 is required to break the kinetic barrier of dolomitization and generate dolomite 5 3 related calcite dissolution and cementation dolomitization does not occur independently and is often accompanied by dissolution and cementation of calcite from fig 11 it can be observed that dolomite tends to form along the dissolution zone of calcite the dissolution of calcite improves the porosity and permeability of the rock thus increasing the contact area between mg2 and calcite and promoting the formation of dolomite by discussing the influence of different factors on the dissolution and cementation of calcite the mechanism of dolomitization can be better understood previous studies indicated that the maximum corrosion of co2 solution on rocks occurs at a temperature between 60 and 90 grgic 2011 meng et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 in this study it is shown that in the temperature range of 60 95 the dissolution of calcite is negatively correlated with temperature as the temperature increases the equilibrium constant for h reaction decreases resulting in the decrease of h concentration in the solution co2 h2o h hco3 as h decreases in the solution the reaction moves into the direction that is not conducive to the dissolution of calcite caco3 h ca2 hco3 which leads to a decrease of the dissolution of calcite as the temperature increases mineral crystals grow outward from the crystal nucleus and the crystallization rate of calcite is relevant to the concentration of ca2 in the solution exp a has the fastest crystallization rate and large size of calcite the dissolution rate of calcite is large and the concentration of ca2 in the solution will be high at low temperature therefore low temperature is conducive to the formation of new calcite crystals in addition the reaction temperature also affects the shape of calcite crystals the higher the reaction temperature is the higher the energy of the newly formed calcite crystal is which would be in an unstable state consequently calcite crystals formed at high temperatures are irregular in shapes berninger et al 2017 fan et al 2007 huang et al 1995 kell duivestein et al 2019 the structure of dolomite crystal is similar to that of calcite and the dolomite crystal generated under high temperature may be unstable the most favorable conditions for dolomite formation are likely to be warming followed by cooling fan et al 2012 the high temperature is conducive to dolomite formation while the low temperature can stabilize the dolomite crystal during exp c d and e the increase of the mg ca ratio has little effect on calcite dissolution in the solution mg2 is adsorbed on the surface of calcite and gradually enters into the calcite crystal eventually leading to a decrease of calcite order degree in the disordered crystal the distribution of particles is mixed and uneven which means it is in an unstable state and prone to destruction davis et al 2000 de nooijer et al 2017 jonas et al 2017 on the other hand the increase of mg ca ratio will inhibit calcite cementation the surface of calcite crystal is prone to adsorb mg2 and ca2 and the system energy of calcite combined with mg2 is lower than that of calcite combined with ca2 meaning that the former is more stable and easier to form the higher mg2 concentration in the solution the more mg2 adsorbed on the calcite crystal surface which would hinder the combination of calcite and ca2 thus inhibiting the growth of calcite crystal 6 conclusions at 60 80 and 95 the equilibrium constants of dolomitization are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 respectively higher temperature provides more energy to break the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and promotes more activated mg2 thus improving the number of effective collision time with caco3 in addition high temperature accelerates the rate of molecular motion improving the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and calcite which would promote dolomitization in lower mg ca ratio condition a higher activity of mg2 is required to break the kinetic barrier of dolomitization dolomite is formed when mg ca ratio equals 5 3 at 95 and the scope activity of mg2 is 32 91 54 52 it would need a much higher activated mg2 or it may be impossible to form dolomite if the mg ca ratio is less than 3 dolomitization experienced a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite dolomitization is controlled by the coupling of temperature and solution compositions it needs quite high reaction activation energy to fracture the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and to dissolve calcite during dolomitization increasing temperatures and the reactant concentrations could overcome the reaction activation energy credit authorship contribution statement leilei yang conceptualization data curation funding acquisition resources writing review editing

dolomitization is unclear in this study theoretical analysis laboratory physical experiments thermodynamic calculation and computer numerical simulation were combined to explore the coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization a series of water rock reaction experiments at various temperature were firstly carried out x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscope sem icp mass and other analytical methods were used to monitor ion concentration relative content and surface morphology of all minerals secondly molecular dynamics md simulation and thermo hydro chemical thc coupling simulation were employed to analyze various processes of dissolution precipitation and transformation of carbonate rock finally combining thermodynamic calculation coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were determined and the optimum formation conditions of dolomite were confirmed dolomitization experienced a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite at 60 80 and 95 the equilibrium constants of dolomitization are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 respectively dolomite is formed when mg ca ratio equals 5 3 at 95 and the scope activity of mg2 is 32 91 54 52 it would need a much higher activated mg2 or it may be impossible to form dolomite if the mg ca ratio is less than 3 this study has revealed coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on metasomatism dolomitization which could provide a basis for evaluating and predicting high quality carbonate reservoirs keywords carbonate reservoir dolomitization coupled effects temperature solution compositions controlling factors 1 introduction carbonate rocks especially dolomite reservoirs contain significant volumes of the hydrocarbon resources globally hahn et al 2018 rötting et al 2015 whitaker and xiao 2010 xia et al 2019 with the continuous discovery of oil and gas reservoirs in deeply buried dolomite the development mechanism of dolomite reservoirs becomes topical abarca et al 2019 fenter et al 2007 hardie 1987 koeshidayatullah et al 2020 whitaker and xiao 2010 however the origin of sedimentary dolomite a subject of long standing enigma has never been stopped being discussed dolomite camg co3 2 is a simple but important mineral component of sedimentary rocks baker and kastner 1981 jonas et

considered metasomatic formed by replacement of original limestone that is dolomitization whose stoichiometric equation is 2caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 biehl et al 2016 liu et al 2019 whitaker and xiao 2010 dolomitization as one of the most important diageneses in carbonate reservoirs is essential for reservoir porosity evolution alqattan and budd 2017 conliffe et al 2012 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 koeshidayatullah et al 2020 mechanism of dolomitization and its effect on the reservoir porosity is thus of fundamental importance in reservoir development and distribution under various geological conditions dolomitization has different formation models such as seepage reflux evaporation hydrothermal metasomatism microbial genesis etc biehl et al 2016 dravis and wanless 2018 jones and xiao 2005 mei 2012 during the whole diagenesis of carbonate reservoirs whereby formation water is present in the reservoir pores and the resultant fluid rock reactions played a major role in dolomitization hahn et al 2018 liu et al 2020 numerous publications address that temperature kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 solution property biehl et al 2016 kell duivestein et al 2019 whitaker and xiao 2010 and other geological factors bénézeth et al 2018 bialik et al 2018 biehl et al 2016 kell duivestein et al 2019 are partial key controls for dolomitization however minerals dissolution precipitation along with dolomitization is controlled by combined controlling factors rather than single one the essence of dolomitization is minerals transformation therefore the process is controlled by mineral kinetic parameters bénézeth et al 2018 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 zhang et al 2009 as the kinetic rate constant and the mineral saturation state are both temperature dependent dolomitization rate is also strongly influenced by temperature horita 2014 shou et al 2016 whitaker and xiao 2010 in the early stage numerous scholars devote themselves to the synthesis experiment of dolomite under low temperature and pressure land 1998 with the continuous discovery of deep buried dolomite reservoirs more and more scholars have studied the dolomitization of carbonate rocks under relatively high temperature and pressure berninger et al 2017 came et al 2017 chen et al 2019 enayati bidgoli and navidtalab 2020 li et al 2015 a series of experiments have been carried out to determine the formation temperature of dolomite land 1998 so far no real stoichiometric dolomite has been synthesized without the involvement of microorganisms at room temperature and pressure in the laboratory a series of subsequent studies show that the formation of dolomite is closely related to the solution compositions bialik et al 2018 chen and tao 2004 etschmann et al 2014 frank and fielding 2003 kaczmarek and sibley 2011 montes hernandez et al 2016 as dolomitization proceeds the process becomes predominantly solution controlled along with ionic supersaturation with calcite dissolution the concentration of ca2 increases which would inhibit the dolomitization the increase of mg2 concentration could reduce the thermodynamic stability of calcite which improves the calcite dissolution and also reduces the effective supersaturation of calcite davis et al 2000 gabellone and whitaker 2016 magnesium is also the material basis of dolomitization as the formation of dolomite needs to consume a huge amount of mg2 de nooijer et al 2017 yang et al 2012 in the early diagenetic stage the most likely source of mg2 supply is seawater however in the late diagenetic stage deep dolomite reservoirs have not all experienced seawater intrusion so where does such a continuous flow and large of mg2 come from previous studies show that mg ca ratio is also one of the decisive factors of dolomitization over a certain range the higher the mg ca ratio in the solution the shorter the induction period and the more likely dolomitization occurs bialik et al 2018 de nooijer et al 2017 frank and fielding 2003 gabellone and whitaker 2016 yang et al 2012 so what kind of ion is really the key factor for the dolomitization coupled effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were investigated in this study laboratory lab water rock reaction experiments at various temperature 60 95 with various types of solution were conducted ions concentrations mineral contents and morphology were monitored in real time to analyze the dolomitization process under varying conditions molecular dynamics simulation md was employed to calculated different interaction force between h2o and mg2 or ca2 a serious of thermodynamic formulae were solved to determine the geochemistry mechanism of dolomitization five thermo hydro chemical thc coupling multi component and multi phase reactive transport simulation models corresponding to the lab experiments were established to verify the experimental data and determine the minerals rate constant the effects of temperature and solution compositions on dolomitization were collectively determined which would provide a theoretical basis for the study of the development mechanism of carbonate reservoir 2 experimental methods 2 1 rock samples preparation natural calcite is used in this study fig 1 a xrd results of the starting rocks are shown in fig 1b and the purity is 100 the experimental samples include two size specifications one is block samples with a size of 10 mm 10 mm 5 mm fig 1c and another one is subspherical particles with a diameter of 2 mm formed by crushing the whole calcite fig 1d 2 2 solution medium three types 1 2 and 3 of solution with different mg ca ratio were used in this experiment solutions were prepared by distilled water and chemicals such as cacl2 2h2o mgcl2 6h2o nacl and kcl studies show that the existence of sulfates has an important effect on dolomitization baker and kastner 1981 land 1985 morrow and ricketts 1988 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2012a to exclude the possibility of microbial dolomitization no sulfate was added in this experiment all solutions were saturated with co2 at the corresponding temperature and pressure in each sub experiment mg ca ratios and typical ions concentrations are summarized in table 1 before being saturated with co2 ph values of all solutions are about 7 0 2 3 scheme setting there are 5 sets of experiments in total each of which needs 4 reaction vessels corresponding to 4 sampling time nodes as temperature and solution compositions are crucial factors to be investigated in this study three indicators were set for each factor table 2 the burial depth of dolomite reservoir during the middle deep burial stage is about 600 4600 m and the corresponding temperature ranges from 40 to 120 berninger et al 2017 shou et al 2016 previous study show that dolomite can be generated above 60 fan et al 2012 usdowski 1989 therefore 60 80 and 95 were selected in this experiment mg ca ratios were set with reference to seawater concentrations the pressures were set to constant of 19 mpa 2 4 facility the experiments were conducted using a high temperature and pressure reactor system developed independently by china university of petroleum beijing as shown in fig 2 the reactor is made of a kind of corrosion resistant alloy material containing a 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe plastic liner which could withstand the acid and alkali erosion all reactors are equipped with temperature and pressure control devices the maximum operating temperature and pressure are 100 and 25 mpa respectively 2 5 operation procedure rock samples were washed by ultrasonic vibration in deionized water and dried for 48 h in an electric blast drying oven a total of 10 g of rock samples about two blocks and several particles were weighed and placed in each reactor solution of approximately 9 times of the rock sample mass were added to the reactor the reaction temperature was set through the temperature control systems and the reactor was pressurized to 19 mpa with co2 gas the react was allowed to occur under a sealed environment throughout the experiment the reactor was cooled and opened after the designated experiment time hydro chemical analyses and ph measurement were conducted after solid liquid separation the rock samples were weighted analyzed by xrd and sem after drying 3 experimental results 3 1 dolomitization at different temperature rock weight accumulation and concentrations changes of ca2 and mg2 during exp a c are presented in fig 3 once the reaction starts calcite dissolves in the acid solution releasing a large amount of ca2 at 72 h ca2 concentration increases to 1 1 0 9 and 0 8 mmol l 1 in exp a b and c respectively during this process rock weight in all experiments continue to decrease both ca2 concentration and weight change show that the dissolution degree ranges from strong to weak is exp a b and c ca2 concentrations decrease after 72 h in all experiments because that the released ca2 accumulated in the solution to a certain extent and then precipitated in the second half of the experiment mg2 concentration decreases markedly in exp c with an experimental temperature of 95 but shows little change in the other two experiments in the later stage the rock weight is added by calcite precipitation and other newly formed carbonate minerals from the sem photomicrographs of typical rock samples fig 4 it can be seen clearly that the intensity of dissolution weakens as the temperature increases in the earlier stage fig 4a 4c as fig 4d 4f shown redeposited calcite can be observed in all experiments mostly in exp a at 216 h dolomite is observed by both sem morphology and electron backscatter diffraction ebsd in exp c fig 4g 4i which is consistent with the change in ions concentrations the chemical formula of the newly generated dolomite is ca1 14mg0 86 co3 2 and xrd results also prove the dolomite with a relative content of 1 1 3 2 dolomitization in various solutions rock weight accumulation and concentrations changes of ca2 mg2 during exp c d and e are presented in fig 5 once reaction starts calcite dissolves in the acid solution releasing a large quantity of ca2 ca2 concentration increases from about 10 mmol l 1 to 45 mmol l 1 in all experiments however the change ranges of ca2 concentration are quite similar among the experiments the variation trend of weight is basically consistent with that of ca2 in the later stage weight changes markedly in exp c with the formation of dolomite while change little in other two experiments from the sem photomicrographs of typical rock samples fig 6 it can be seen that the intensity of dissolution is basically no difference during exp c e in the early stage fig 6a 6c redeposited calcite with different shapes can be observed in exp c e fig 4d 4f at 216 h several kinds of dolomites with varying mg ca proportions appeared in exp c fig 6g 6i indicative of metasomatism 4 numerical simulation 4 1 md simulation methods gromacs software package was employed to model the interactions between h2o and ca2 or mg2 in the aqueous phase hess et al 2008 van der spoel et al 2005 spce for water and opls aa for sodium chloride and magnesium chloride potentials were adopted in the molecular dynamics md simulations the system included 5000 water molecules 80 chloride cl ions the total amount of ca2 and mg2 ions were 40 in order to investigate the effect of mg ca ratio two cases were studied one had 20 ca2 and 20 mg2 ions mg ca ratio 1 the other one comprised 6 ca2 and 32 mg2 ions mg ca ratio 5 3 for the temperature effect the mg ca ratio was kept constant as 5 3 6 ca2 and 32 mg2 ions and the pressure was fixed at 19 mpa the temperature was set to 60 80 and 95 c respectively the simulated pressure and temperature conditions were consistent with our lab experiments initially the steepest descent algorithm was used for energy minimization of the simulated systems with a tolerance of 800 kj mol 1 nm 1 isothermal isobaric ensemble npt was adopted for all the simulations the leapfrog integration algorithm was applied with a time step of 1 fs for the lennard jones potential short range nonbonded interactions with a cutoff radius of 1 1 nm were employed the lincs algorithms was used for constraining chemical bond lengths the long range electrostatic interactions were computed by using the particle mesh ewald method with a cutoff radius of 1 1 nm and a grid spacing of 0 12 nm periodic boundary condition was applied to all directions in order to equilibrate the system the pressure and temperature were controlled by berendsen coupling for 2 ns then nosé hoover thermostat was adopted for temperature control and parrinello rahman coupling was used for pressure control on the equilibrium state for 2 ns the data produced from the last 2 ns was analyzed and discussed 4 2 md simulation results fig 7 shows a snapshot of the equilibrated aqueous solution system in which all cations ions are uniformly dispersed in the water molecules in order to distinguish the difference between mg2 and ca2 the radial distribution function rdf values of mg2 ca2 ions with respect to h2o are calculated with temperature and ratio variations fig 8 both of mg2 and ca2 appear to have double hydration layers in all models compared to ca2 mg2 have apparently stronger interaction with the surrounding h2o as the peaks of mg2 approximately 7 appear higher than those of ca2 approximately 4 from fig 8a 8c rdf values of mg2 are 7 326 7 273 and 7 098 while the corresponding rdf values of ca2 are 4 734 4 672 and 4 617 respectively this indicates that the interactions between cations and h2o are weakened with increasing temperature because the kinetic energy of the system increased the motions of the cations are more vigorous and they can diffuse more freely in the solution from fig 8d 8f it can be concluded that the increase of the mg ca ratio also leads to a decrease of rdf values this may be due to the competition between different mg2 that impair the pair interaction between mg2 and h2o however the rdf curves of ca2 are almost invariable with ratio variation 4 3 thc simulation methods a simulation program for multiphase reactive transport toughreact was employed to reproduce the mineral transformation and porosity evolution during dolomitization xu et al 2011 toughreact is a thermo hydro chemical thc coupling program suitable for pertinent study on non isothermal multiphase fluid flow solute transport and reactive geochemistry governing equations involved are tabulated in table 3 the program succeeds from tough2 with a fully coupled computation of fluid and heat flow table 3 pruess et al 1999 the geochemical field is partially coupled with the thermal and hydraulic fields in each time step after the fluid and heat flow part get converged solute transport and geochemical reaction start to run with the known temperature and velocity field and the change of porosity and permeability will affect fluid and heat flow as a feedback xiao and jones 2018 for the calculation of solute transport and geochemical reaction i e the reactive transport part the consumption and production of component in geochemical reaction serve as a kind of source sink item in the solute transport computation abarca et al 2019 pruess et al 1999 xu et al 2011 compared with the conventional convection diffusion equation an addition item is added in table 3 the solute transport part is solved on a component by component basis all gridblocks assemble a large jacobian matrix no iteration is needed to solve it with regard to the geochemical reaction part the system of mixed equilibrium kinetic chemical reaction equations is solved on a gridblock by gridblock basis by using the newton raphson iteration it can deal with the reaction under both equilibrium and kinetic control most reactions are considered in toughreact such as mineral dissolution precipitation gas dissolution exsolution cation exchange surface complexation and adsorption xu et al 2011 xu et al 2012 therefore it can be adequately applied in modelling dolomitization and other reservoir diagenetic reactions 4 4 thc modelling corresponding to lab experiments five reactive numerical models were established corresponding to five sets of experiments a cylinder shaped gridblock with 100 cm3 fig 9 a the same as the reactors in lab experiments fig 9b was established fig 9 temperature pressure starting minerals and solution compositions were exactly the same as the corresponding lab experiments the initial porosity was 0 9 calculated by the amount of rock vs solution as the reactive time of lab experiments was much shorter than the actual geological scale all minerals included in the thc models were kinetics controlled all rate parameters are tabulated in table 4 as the most important and typical ions the ca2 and mg2 concentrations during lab experiments and thc models are analyzed comparatively fig 10 in fig 10 vertical errors refer to experimental instrument and measurement errors while lateral errors refer to sample timing errors consistent with the experimental results calcite is dissolved as the reaction progresses leading to an increase in ca2 concentration in the later stage the mg2 concentration decreases as a result of dolomite precipitation especially in exp c the thc model generally mimics the lab simulation results with a range of numerical errors deemed to be reasonable the errors are mainly due to several factors such as the size of rock particles sample heterogeneities and neglected adsorption firstly the rock particles used in the lab experiment are not uniform in size and shape which may lead to the dissolution dominant sites and gradually cause heterogeneity within the system whereas in the numerical modeling the mineral was assumed to be completely homogeneous and the whole simulation process was assumed to be uniform secondly the rock particles rested completely at the bottom in the experimental autoclave and there was a difference in ionic concentration between the top and the bottom of the autoclave as minerals were dissolved however it was assumed that rocks and aqueous solutions were uniformly distributed in the numerical models finally some physical and microcosmic effects in the experiment were not included in the numerical models such as the adsorption of mg2 on calcite surfaces which may result in higher values than the lab experimental results 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of metasomatism dolomitization dolomitization refers to the process that mg2 in the solution enters the calcite crystal under a specified condition and converts it into dolomite crystal in exp c there are sufficient mg2 promoting dolomite precipitation firstly ca2 ions concentrations in the solution are unsaturated resulting in calcite dissolution caco3 h ca2 hco3 then ca2 becomes saturated in the solution resulting in calcite precipitation and the reaction system enters a dynamic equilibrium at the same time mg2 in the solution begins to be adsorbed on the calcite mineral next the adsorbed mg2 on the calcite gradually replaced ca2 in the calcite to form dolomite or mg rich calcite carbonate minerals with varying mg ca proportions are detected in the experimental products as shown in fig 11 this suggests that dolomitization experiences a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite requires a quite long time to become stable and convert into an ideal dolomite with mg ca proportion close to 1 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 pimentel and pina 2014 pina et al 2020 5 2 controlling factors of metasomatism dolomitization the metasomatic dolomitization process can be expressed as caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 from the perspective of thermodynamics dolomitization is an endothermic reaction thus increasing temperature is beneficial to the forward reaction berninger et al 2017 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 however from a kinetic point of view the dolomitization process is influenced not only by temperature but also by the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the solution kell duivestein et al 2019 montes hernandez et al 2016 both mg2 and ca2 in solution can hydrate with water due to the smaller radius the electrostatic attraction between mg2 and h2o is approximately 20 higher than that between ca2 and h2o consequently it is more likely for mg2 to combine with h2o in the solution to form complexes esteban and taberner 2003 the formation of dolomite requires relatively high reaction activation energy to break the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and for calcite dissolution there are mainly two approaches to overcome the activation energy 1 increase the system temperature to improve the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and caco3 2 increase the concentration of reactants to improve the number of effective collision time between activated mg2 and calcite alqattan and budd 2017 gabellone and whitaker 2016 kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 usdowski has experimentally demonstrated that dolomite can be generated as long as the temperature is above 60 usdowski 1989 however in this study no dolomite formation was observed between 60 and 80 this may be attributed to the fact that the c ca2 c mg2 in this study 0 057 mol l 1 is much lower than that in the usdowski s experiment approximately 7 to 9 mol l 1 in addition the reaction time also varies greatly this demonstrates that instead of a single factor dolomitization is controlled by multiple factors such as temperature and solution compositions 5 2 1 temperature the results of molecular dynamics simulation show that the interactions between cations and water weaken with increasing temperature this can be interpreted as the kinetic energy of the system increases as temperature increases which will lead to the more vigorous motions and more free diffusion of the cations in the solution at low temperature mg2 tends to form hydration bond with water and be solvated therefore activated mg2 would be too little to effectively collide with calcite under low temperature conditions thus not conducive to dolomitization by combining the van t hoff equation eq 1 kilgoff equation eq 2 and the relationship between heat capacity c p m θ and temperature eq 3 the relationship between enthalpy change and temperature eq 4 and the relationship between equilibrium constant and temperature eq 5 can be derived bénézeth et al 2018 1 d ln k θ

formation δ f h m θ is the standard enthalpy of formation c p m θ is the specific heat at constant pressure a 1 a 5 are the coefficients that determine c p m θ r is the gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k

capacity coefficient of the reaction δ a 1 can be calculated by eq 7 6 δ r h m θ 298 15 k b ν b δ f h m θ b 298 15 k pr b ν b δ f h m θ b 298 15 k r e 7 δ a 1 b ν b a 1 b pr b ν b a 1 b re where the subscript b represents different substances in the reaction ν b represents the stoichiometric number of substance b and the subscripts pr and re represent the products and reactants respectively by substituting the standard enthalpy of formation δ f h m θ 298 15 k of each substance listed in table 5 into eq 6 it can be calculated that δ r h m θ 298 15 k is equal to 2 87 kj mol 1 in addition by substituting the heat capacity coefficient of each substance listed in table 5 into eq 7 the δ a 1 can be calculated as 1082 13 j mol 1 k 2 and by the same logic we get δ a 2 6 7564 j mol 1 k 2 δ a 3 0 0159 j mol 1 k 3 δ a 4 1 36 10 5 j mol 1 k 4 δ a 5 9 146 106 j mol 1 k respectively substitute the above results into eq 4 and get δ h 0 169 49 kj mol 1 then the corresponding results are substituted into eq 5 and k θ 333 15 k 1 67 k θ 353 15 k 1 75 k θ 368 15 k 1 80 are obtained successively in other words the equilibrium constants are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 at 60 80 and 95 respectively in exp c the temperature was set to 95 high temperature provides energy to break the hydration bond between mg2 and h2o and promoted the solvation of mg2 this leads to an increase in the concentration of activated mg2 involved in the reaction thus improving effective collision times between activated mg2 and caco3 in addition the high temperature accelerates the rate of molecular motion which would increase the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and calcite chen et al 2009 from these two aspects the high temperature is conducive to the formation of dolomite within a certain temperature range in addition temperature also has a significant influence on the degree of the order of dolomite the higher the temperature is the better the degree of the order of dolomite is generated kaczmarek and thornton 2017 kell duivestein et al 2019 pina et al 2020 5 2 2 solution compositions the equilibrium constant and concentration entropy of dolomitization could be calculated by eqs 8 and 9 respectively when q k the equilibrium moves in reverse reaction direction when q k the system is in an equilibrium state and when q k the equilibrium moves in forward reaction direction which would lead to dolomitization zhang et al 2009 8 k ca 2 m g 2 where k is the equilibrium constant of reaction ca 2 and m g 2 represent the calcium and magnesium ion concentrations at equilibrium respectively 9 q a c a 2 a m g 2 c c a 2 δ c a 2 c m g 2 δ m g 2 c c a 2 c m g 2 δ m g 2 where a is the concentration of activated ions in the solution c is the total concentration of ions in the solution including activated ions and those that hydrate with water and δ represents the proportion of activated ions in the solution to the total ion concentration specifically at 95 the hydration bond between ca2 and h2o is broken and ca2 in solution is considered to be fully involved in the reaction i e a ca 2 c ca 2 δ ca2 100 dolomite formation is observed when the mg ca ratio is 5 3 indicating that q is less than k θ 368 15 k with a value of 1 80 in this case the range of δ mg2 obtained from eq 9 is approximately 32 91 to 54 52 when mg ca ratio is 3 to break the kinetic barrier for dolomitization to generate dolomite i e q 1 80 δ mg2 must be greater than 54 52 if this condition is not satisfied in this experiment there would be no dolomite formation similarly when the mg ca ratio is equal to 1 it can be calculated that δ mg2 must be greater than 171 98 in order to generate dolomite obviously this is impractical that is to say dolomite cannot be formed when the mg ca ratio 1 therefore the lower the mg ca ratio is the greater the activity of mg2 is required to break the kinetic barrier of dolomitization and generate dolomite 5 3 related calcite dissolution and cementation dolomitization does not occur independently and is often accompanied by dissolution and cementation of calcite from fig 11 it can be observed that dolomite tends to form along the dissolution zone of calcite the dissolution of calcite improves the porosity and permeability of the rock thus increasing the contact area between mg2 and calcite and promoting the formation of dolomite by discussing the influence of different factors on the dissolution and cementation of calcite the mechanism of dolomitization can be better understood previous studies indicated that the maximum corrosion of co2 solution on rocks occurs at a temperature between 60 and 90 grgic 2011 meng et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 in this study it is shown that in the temperature range of 60 95 the dissolution of calcite is negatively correlated with temperature as the temperature increases the equilibrium constant for h reaction decreases resulting in the decrease of h concentration in the solution co2 h2o h hco3 as h decreases in the solution the reaction moves into the direction that is not conducive to the dissolution of calcite caco3 h ca2 hco3 which leads to a decrease of the dissolution of calcite as the temperature increases mineral crystals grow outward from the crystal nucleus and the crystallization rate of calcite is relevant to the concentration of ca2 in the solution exp a has the fastest crystallization rate and large size of calcite the dissolution rate of calcite is large and the concentration of ca2 in the solution will be high at low temperature therefore low temperature is conducive to the formation of new calcite crystals in addition the reaction temperature also affects the shape of calcite crystals the higher the reaction temperature is the higher the energy of the newly formed calcite crystal is which would be in an unstable state consequently calcite crystals formed at high temperatures are irregular in shapes berninger et al 2017 fan et al 2007 huang et al 1995 kell duivestein et al 2019 the structure of dolomite crystal is similar to that of calcite and the dolomite crystal generated under high temperature may be unstable the most favorable conditions for dolomite formation are likely to be warming followed by cooling fan et al 2012 the high temperature is conducive to dolomite formation while the low temperature can stabilize the dolomite crystal during exp c d and e the increase of the mg ca ratio has little effect on calcite dissolution in the solution mg2 is adsorbed on the surface of calcite and gradually enters into the calcite crystal eventually leading to a decrease of calcite order degree in the disordered crystal the distribution of particles is mixed and uneven which means it is in an unstable state and prone to destruction davis et al 2000 de nooijer et al 2017 jonas et al 2017 on the other hand the increase of mg ca ratio will inhibit calcite cementation the surface of calcite crystal is prone to adsorb mg2 and ca2 and the system energy of calcite combined with mg2 is lower than that of calcite combined with ca2 meaning that the former is more stable and easier to form the higher mg2 concentration in the solution the more mg2 adsorbed on the calcite crystal surface which would hinder the combination of calcite and ca2 thus inhibiting the growth of calcite crystal 6 conclusions at 60 80 and 95 the equilibrium constants of dolomitization are 1 67 1 75 and 1 80 respectively higher temperature provides more energy to break the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and promotes more activated mg2 thus improving the number of effective collision time with caco3 in addition high temperature accelerates the rate of molecular motion improving the effective collision probability between activated mg2 and calcite which would promote dolomitization in lower mg ca ratio condition a higher activity of mg2 is required to break the kinetic barrier of dolomitization dolomite is formed when mg ca ratio equals 5 3 at 95 and the scope activity of mg2 is 32 91 54 52 it would need a much higher activated mg2 or it may be impossible to form dolomite if the mg ca ratio is less than 3 dolomitization experienced a series of transitional processes from calcite mg bearing calcite high calcium dolomite low calcium dolomite dolomitization is controlled by the coupling of temperature and solution compositions it needs quite high reaction activation energy to fracture the hydration bond of mg2 h2o and to dissolve calcite during dolomitization increasing temperatures and the reactant concentrations could overcome the reaction activation energy credit authorship contribution statement leilei yang conceptualization data curation funding acquisition resources writing review editing

methane coexist in an adsorption cell water vapor is produced via evaporation of liquid water and the processes of liquid water evaporation and water vapor and methane adsorption onto shale occur simultaneously the rate of liquid water conversion into vapor and the free water vapor content in the gas mixture depend on relative humidity rh changes in rh are monitored with a humidity sensor in sawm the amount of water vapor adsorbed greatly exceeds that of methane the adsorption of water vapor took longer to reach equilibrium than that of methane the amount of water vapor adsorbed at equilibrium decreased with total pressure while the opposite situation occurred with methane adsorption compared to pure methane adsorption onto dry shale pmds the amount of methane adsorbed was lower by 10 59 in sawm the equilibrium time for methane adsorption was higher and t50 and t80 t50 and t80 represented the times required for adsorption of 50 and 80 of the equilibrium adsorption amount respectively increased 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times respectively in the two experiments the declines in the level of methane adsorption were equal when a critical threshold equilibration degree ed was reached before reaching ed the rate of methane adsorption in sawm was higher than that in pmds after reaching ed the phenomenon was reversed keywords water vapor methane simultaneous adsorption adsorption amount adsorption rate decay 1 introduction the migration and adsorption behavior of gas in rock matrices is of great importance to many engineering resource and environmental issues such as the accumulation and reserves of shale gas gas leakage during exploitation and natural release of greenhouse gases from geological formations to resolve the problem of energy shortages many countries have shifted their attention to shale gas research and exploration kerr 2010 bustin et al 2012 chapiro and bruining 2015 pranesh 2018 however this has also caused damage to the environment while mitigating the energy crisis weber and clavin 2012 for example shale gas leakage caused by exploitation may induce groundwater surface water soil and atmospheric pollution most of this damage is caused by a lack of clarity regarding the features of methane migration and adsorption allen et al 2015 ferrar et al 2013 montgomery et al 2005 schmidt 2011 the pore structure functional group density kerogen type clay mineral content water saturation and level formation temperature of shale greatly affect the diffusion and adsorption of methane jin and firoozabadi 2014 chalmers and bustin 2007 xiong et al 2018 in particular there are two types of water in shale formations namely natural water and artificially injected water and they exhibit multiple forms in reservoirs i e structural water adsorbed water and condensed water vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 natural water refers to groundwater in the process of diagenetic evolution and it is formed by a mixture of sedimentary water diagenetic water and hypogenic water and through a series of complex physical chemical reactions primary water is ubiquitous within shale reservoirs researchers have found that water saturation levels due to natural water in typical gas production shales in north america range from 15 to 35 artificially injected water refers to the unrecoverable water remaining in the matrix in the process of hydraulic fracturing the imbibition effect in rock formations is induced by water injection resulting in desorption of some methane molecules after that some of the water is extracted as a liquid while the rest exists in the shale matrix in the adsorbed state and cannot be recovered approximately 50 95 of the injected water is confined in the pore network of the shale matrix due to capillary forces which leads to low water recovery in the hydraulic fracturing process the influence of water on the migration and adsorption of methane has always been a focus of research water vapor is a component of shale gas and is generally accompanied by methane in shale formations wang et al 2009 vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 research has demonstrated that water imposes adverse effects on the adsorption permeability and diffusivity of methane chalmers and bustin 2008 howarth et al 2011 li et al 2016 zhang and yu 2016 in shale gas exploitation injected water destroys the reservoir structure and blocks gas transportation paths moreover water vapor which is produced via liquid water evaporation is adsorbed onto pore surfaces to displace methane vidic et al 2013 kuchler 2017 in this context studies of the migration and adsorption of water vapor and methane are particularly important for safe and highly efficient resource exploitation studies have revealed that both water vapor and methane are preferentially adsorbed onto micropore surfaces with high potential energy hatch et al 2012 liu et al 2016 li et al 2016 the main competition for ch4 h2o adsorption occurs in pores of approximately 2 7 nm wang and yu 2016 and the adsorbed water transforms to condensation with increasing water film thickness li et al 2017 tokunaga et al 2017 wang et al 2018 conducted experiments on methane adsorption onto shales partially saturated with water they found that the adsorption capacity of wet shale was reduced and that increasing moisture content clearly impeded methane adsorption ross and bustin 2009 and gasparik et al 2014 reported that clay content is positively correlated with the content of adsorbed water and the amount of methane adsorption onto clay rich shale decreased by approximately 40 90 under water bearing conditions the above studies indicated that water inhibits methane adsorption onto shale but most of them focus on the amount adsorbed at equilibrium research on the interactions between water and methane in the adsorption process is still limited richard 1951 established a unipore diffusion model to study the dynamics of natural gas adsorption onto zeolites subsequently scholars investigated the adsorption process of methane from two perspectives in one case it was observed that the diffusion coefficient remained constant and in the other case the diffusion coefficient changed over time smith and williams 1984 mianowski and marecka 2009 akkutlu and faithi 2012 zhao et al 2014 yue et al 2016 by comparison it was found that the latter description of the gas adsorption process was more accurate recent research indicated that the diffusion coefficient decreases over time which may be related to reduced pore pressure during the occurring diffusion process liu et al 2018 rani et al 2018 moreover scholars have determined that the rates for diffusion and adsorption of methane onto wet shale are lower than those seen with dry shale which indicates that adsorbed water may negatively affect methane adsorption yuan et al 2014 zolfaghari et al 2017 although current studies have investigated the processes for adsorption of methane and water their experimental samples included shale containing preabsorbed i e pre equilibrated water under natural conditions water and methane usually coexist and may adsorb simultaneously onto shale formations but this phenomenon has rarely been considered in this work the simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane sawm onto shale was studied the sawm process was examined at total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa with three samples collected from the qaidam basin because the amount of water vapor adsorbed is difficult to determine due to the cooccurrence of evaporation and adsorption a reference evaporation experiment with liquid water relw was designed to establish a functional relationship between relative humidity rh and evaporation rate for calculating the rate for production of water vapor using this relationship and experimental data the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed were calculated based on the experimental results the effect of water vapor on methane adsorption was investigated by comparing the processes of the pure methane adsorption onto dry shale pmds and sawm the interactions between water vapor and methane were researched by analyzing their adsorption rates adsorption amounts and competitive adsorption strengths 2 adsorption experiments the main component of shale gas is methane and it is accompanied by ethane propane carbon dioxide and water vapor the forms in which water occurs are diverse water can exist in three forms in shale rock formations vapor liquid and quasi solid e g strongly bound water yang and yu 2020 and the three forms interconvert with variations in temperature pressure and other environmental conditions studies have shown that both liquid and strongly bound water exert negative effects on methane adsorption li et al 2015 wang and yu 2016 while the effect of water vapor on methane adsorption is still not clear therefore simultaneous adsorption experiments with water vapor and methane under different pressures must be conducted to simulate the adsorption process for water vapor and methane under the formation conditions 2 1 experimental samples three shale samples were obtained from the chaiye 2 core drilling well in the qaidam basin china the depths of the samples were 983 9 m denoted c1 1021 3 m denoted c2 and 1026 3 m denoted c3 table 1 the samples were crushed 200 mesh for sawm analysis the mineral composition and clay content were analyzed by a siemens xrd 6100 analyzer based on the sy t 5163 2010 standard the kerogen types were analyzed by a biological microscope axioskop 2 plus based on the sy t 5125 1996 standard the maturity characterized by vitrinite reflectance was determined by a microphotometer hitachi f7000 mpv sp equipped with an oil immersion objective lens according to the sy t 5124 1995 standard the toc content was determined by a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer according to the gb t 19145 2003 standard the specific surface area was determined by a quadrasorb si specific surface area analyzer according to the gb t19587 2004 standard as stated in the classification criteria of the international union of pure and applied chemistry nanopores are divided into three grades micropores diameter 2 nm mesopores 2 nm diameter less than 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 low pressure carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorption lpa and high pressure mercury intrusion micp tests were performed to calculate pore size distributions although micp can be used to measure pores with diameters ranging from 3 to 200 μm it is not useful for characterizing ultra fine pores due to structural deformations induced at high pressures co2 and n2 molecules can access micropores and mesopores in low pressure adsorption processes therefore co2 adsorption low pressure n2 adsorption and micp were applied to determine micropores mesopores and macropores respectively in this study the lpa method was conducted by following the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards and the analyzer is the same as specific surface area test the curve was analyzed using dubinin astakhov theory micp tests were run with a mercury injection meter auto pore iv 9520 and the experimental procedure followed the gb t 21650 1 2008 standard to determine macropore volumes fig 1 shows the pore size distributions pore volumes and pore surface areas of the micro meso and macropores 2 2 experimental apparatus an isothermal adsorption test apparatus was adopted to conduct sawm analyses fig 2 shows that the apparatus includes four parts a gas injection system adsorption system constant temperature system and data acquisition system compared to that of previous studies wang et al 2018 ma and yu 2020 the apparatus was improved by replacing the water bath with an incubator to improve the sealing capability and heat uniformity of the constant temperature system the adsorption system was composed of a receiver cell adsorption cell and high precision pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 001 mpa a hc2a ic102 humidity temperature sensor supplied by rotronic switzerland was added to the adsorption cell to measure humidity and temperature with accuracies of 0 01 and 0 01 k for measurements of relative humidity and temperature respectively the hc2a ic102 humidity temperature sensor allowed measurements over a relative humidity range from of 0 100 and a temperature range from 273 to 393 k variation in pressure were monitored through the pressure sensor during the experiment and the limit of the pressure sensor was 10 mpa the experiments were conducted under constant temperature which was controlled by the constant temperature system and temperature fluctuation was controlled to within 0 2 k the inner volumes of the cells were determined with the helium substitution method li et al 2015 the inner volume of the receiver cell was 66 042 cm3 and that of the adsorption cell was 62 352 cm3 as shown in fig 2 the adsorption cell contained the shale sample and ch4 h2o mixture the ch4 h2o mixture established a two phase system in the cell the upper part was a ch4 h2o gas mixture and the lower part contained liquid water during adsorption experiments the shale sample adsorbed water vapor from the gas mixture and the water vapor within was produced by evaporation of liquid water 2 3 experimental procedures this study consisted of two experiments the sawm experiment and the relw the sawm experiment was designed to observe the simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane for the sawm experiment a corresponding relw was performed to determine the rate at which liquid water was converted into water vapor fig 3 a and b shows schematics for the internal structures of the adsorption cells used for the relw and sawm experiments respectively and the mass preservation of water vapor the experimental environments temperature pressure and liquid water volume for the sawm and the relw studies were strictly identical to determine the amount of water vapor adsorbed the relationship between the evaporation rate and relative humidity was first determined through the relw and then this relationship was applied to study the sawm calculations of the abovementioned variables will be explained in detail in section 3 1 the procedure used for sawm was as follows a the temperature of the incubator was set to 313 15 k and the adsorption apparatus remained stable under vacuum after the system temperature was reached b the communication valve between the receiver and the adsorption cell was closed and high purity 99 999 methane was injected into the receiver cell under a given pressure through the regulating valve the pressures injected into the receiver cell were 1 6 4 8 and 8 0 mpa corresponding to equilibrium adsorption total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa in the adsorption cell respectively the stabilization time was 4 h c the sample was dried for 12 h at 378 15 k and the dried shale was cooled in a constant temperature and humidity chamber with a temperature of 313 15 k and relative humidity of 0 dried shale 10 g was placed in a stainless steel slot d the stainless steel slot and 10 cm3 of water preheated for 12 h at 313 15 k were placed into the adsorption cell simultaneously e the communication valve between the receiver and adsorption cells was opened and the temperature pressure and humidity were recorded f the experiment was stopped when the pressure and humidity stabilized i e adsorption equilibrium was attained the shale was removed for weighing g all of the above experimental steps were repeated and adsorption experiments were performed on each sample with equilibrium adsorption total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa the relw was conducted by replacing the shale sample with a stainless steel block of an equal volume and the procedure was the same as that of the sawm the procedure for the pmds study was the same as that of the sawm study except that only the shale samples were placed in the adsorption cell in step d of the sawm 3 methodology 3 1 calculation method for water vapor adsorption fig 4 shows that liquid water started to convert to water vapor and the relative humidity in the adsorption cell began increasing when the experiment began the rh value in the sawm was lower than that in a relw at the corresponding time t in the sawm part of the water vapor was converted into absorbed water and the other part existed in the free state in regard to the sawm and relw the following is obtained 1a w a w e w f 1b w er w fr where wa is the amount of water vapor adsorbed in the sawm mol we is the amount of liquid water evaporated in the sawm mol wf is the amount of free water vapor in the sawm mol wer is the amount of liquid water evaporated in the relw mol and wfr is the amount of free water vapor in the relw mol there are two methods for calculating the amount of methane adsorbed the volumetric and gravimetric methods sudibandriyo et al 2003 chareonsuppanimit et al 2012 the former was applied in this study by substituting the recorded pressure rh and temperature data into the gas state equation the amounts of free methane in the mixture before and after adsorption were calculated and the difference between these amounts was the amount adsorbed in the sawm the recorded pressure was the total pressure of water vapor and methane wang et al 2013 demonstrated that the partial pressure of a single gas in a ch4 h2o mixture may be calculated with dalton s partial pressure law they assumed that each gas was evenly distributed throughout the container this approach assumed that each gas generated the same pressure as it would have when occupying the entire container alone the state equations for the gases in the mixture are

relative humidity in the samw dimensionless psw is the saturated vapor pressure mpa va is the bulk gas volume of the adsorption cell in the samw cm3 and ta is the temperature of the adsorption cell in the sawm k the amount of liquid water evaporated was calculated by integrating the evaporation rate over time 5 w e 0 t v d t v t i δ t i where v is the evaporation rate of liquid water in the sawm mol s and t is the experimental time s the evaporation rate of liquid water was related to factors such as temperature and relative humidity wang et al 2015 in the sawm and the relw the evaporation conditions were identical except for the relative humidity they yielded the same evaporation rates if their rh values in the adsorption cell were the same namely 6 v r h v r r h where v rh is the evaporation rate of liquid water in the sawm mol s and vr rh is the evaporation rate of liquid water in the relw mol s for the relw the amount of free water vapor in the adsorption cell was equal to the amount evaporated namely 7a w er 0 t v r d t v r t i δ t i 7b w er w fr 8a w fr p wr v ar z wr r t ar 8b p wr r hr p sw where vr is the rate increment of water vapor in the relw mol s pwr is the

model for calculating the mole fraction of h2o ch4 in gas mixtures they considered the interactions between molecules of the different gas components in the mixture but ignored the effects of gas dissolution and gas water hydration according to the principle of gas liquid equilibrium the equation governing the equilibrium between the two water phases in the ch4 h2o mixture system is ji and yan 2003 9 w y w p mix f w x w γ w where w is the fugacity coefficient of water vapor dimensionless yw is the mole fraction of water vapor in the vapor phase dimensionless fw is the liquid phase reference fugacity of water mpa xw is the mole fraction of water in the liquid phase dimensionless and γw is the activity coefficient of water dimensionless the temperature and pressure were relatively low in this study therefore the liquid water was regarded as incompressible herein the activity coefficient of water remains approximately constant when ignoring dissolution and hydration the saturated vapor pressure was reported by daubert and danner 1985 and mccain 1990 as follows 10 p sw 10 6 e x p 73 649 7258 2 t 7 3037 l n t 4 1653 10 6 t 2 based on the above assumptions mohammadi and richon 2008

the corresponding yw values were obtained by y w p w z mix p mix z w fig 5 reveals that the measured values were consistent with the calculated values in the relw the amount of liquid water evaporated which was equal to the amount of free water vapor in the adsorption cell was determined with eqs 7a and 8a on this basis the evaporation rate was calculated and the relationship between evaporation rate and rh was acquired as shown in fig 6 the relationship based on measured humidity data was fitted with an exponential equation as expressed in eq 12 fig 6 indicates that the rate for evaporation of liquid water decreases with increasing total pressure 12 v r a e b r h in the sawm the evaporation rate was calculated by substituting the measured rh data into eqs 12 and 6 the amount of free water vapor was calculated with eqs 10 and 4 after calculating the amounts of evaporation and free water vapor the adsorption amount was calculated by considering mass conservation the adsorption per unit sample mass at time t is w w a q where q is the sample mass g we adopted symbols to indicate the amount of water vapor adsorbed at equilibrium 3 2 calculation method for methane adsorption the amount of methane adsorbed was calculated by the volumetric method using partial pressure data for methane in the ch4 h2o mixture eqs 2a and 2b indicate that the total pressure consisted of the partial pressures of water vapor and methane the partial pressure of water vapor was calculated by the method discussed in section 3 1 hence with the use of the partial pressure of water vapor and the total pressure the partial pressure of methane was determined with eq 3 based on the above the amount of methane adsorbed was calculated from the law of mass conservation and eq 2b the amount of methane adsorbed was the difference between the amount of methane injected into the adsorption cell and the amount of free methane 13 m a m t m f 14 m t p rm v r z rm r t r 15 m f p rm v r z rm r t ar

adsorbed was calculated by substituting eqs 14 and 15 into eq 13 the amount adsorbed per unit sample mass at time t was m m a q and the equilibrium adsorption amount was expressed as me 4 results and discussion 4 1 amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed the relative humidity was monitored by a humidity temperature sensor in the relw and sawm and data were obtained at equilibrium total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa we and wf were calculated according to the method described in section 3 1 and fig 7 shows the calculated results for the sawm after adsorption equilibrium was reached the shale sample was removed from the adsorption cell the sample was weighed and the equilibrium amount of water vapor adsorbed was verified according to the mass change in the sample after the adsorption experiment fig 8 shows a comparison of the equilibrium adsorption amounts determined via calculation and sample weighing the comparisons indicated that the discrepancies were within 5 the sawm experiments were conducted at the three equilibrium total pressures 1 3 and 5 mpa the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed by the three samples are shown in fig 9 the results revealed that the increments in the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed changed from large to small during the adsorption process in particular the rates for adsorption of water vapor and methane changed from rapid to slow over time the behavior was more obvious within the first 24 h after 24 h the methane increment was very small but the water vapor increment was relatively large a longer time was required for water vapor to reach adsorption equilibrium than for methane with increasing adsorption amounts water vapor and methane transitioned from single layer adsorption to multilayer adsorption li et al 2017 compared with the methane adsorption process the adsorption of water vapor has not stopped after multilayer adsorption as the adsorption process continued the condensation of water vapor occurred which causes the adsorption process of water vapor to last longer than that of methane 4 2 preferential adsorption of water vapor in the sawm the equilibrium adsorption amount is an indicator reflecting the adsorption capacity of shale using the experimental data pertaining to the sawm equilibrium amounts of water vapor w e and methane m e adsorbed were obtained and are listed in table 2 at adsorption equilibrium the amount of water vapor adsorbed was much larger than that of methane the equilibrium amounts of water vapor adsorbed by the three shales ranged from 0 931 to 1 761 mmol g and the equilibrium amounts of methane adsorbed ranged from 0 028 to 0 280 mmol g the ratios of the equilibrium amount of water vapor and methane adsorbed re we me ranged from 6 5 to 62 9 3 3 32 1 and 7 2 35 8 for the three samples zhang and lu 2019 used a theoretical advancement of an augmented brunauer emmett teller adsorption equation for clay soils to quantify external and internal specific surface areas their results indicated that polar materials such as water were adsorbed on both internal and external solid surfaces while nonpolar materials such as methane and nitrogen only accessed external solid surfaces lu and zhang 2020 this could explain why the amount of water vapor adsorbed was much higher than that of methane the value of me increased and the value of we decreased with increasing total pressure in the adsorption cell there were two reasons for this one is that the high total pressure led to a low saturation pressure of water vapor in the mixture in particular the partial pressure of water vapor was reduced which reduced the number of water molecules available for adsorption and the amount of water vapor adsorbed decreased at the same time the increase in methane adsorption led to a decrease in water vapor intensity during competitive adsorption which led to a decrease in amount of water vapor adsorbed the other reason was that the methane partial pressure increment was much more significant than that of the water vapor partial pressure with increasing total pressure methane molecules preferentially migrated to the adsorption sites to effect adsorption so adsorption sites that would otherwise be available to water vapor were occupied by methane when the equilibrium total pressure rose from 1 to 5 mpa we declined by 0 176 0 615 mmol g for the three samples and me increased by 0 098 0 242 mmol g the magnitude of variations in the amount of water vapor adsorbed were larger than those of methane this indicates that total pressure imposed a significant effect on we 4 3 comparison of adsorption progress for water vapor and methane in the sawm the ratio of the adsorption amount to the equilibrium adsorption amount is referred to as the equilibration degree ed of the adsorption process the symbol ted was adopted to denote the time when ed of the equilibrium adsorption amount was achieved for example t10 t50 and t80 represent the times when 10 50 and 80 respectively of the equilibrium adsorption amount were attained the process of methane adsorption onto shale may be divided into three stages namely the initial transition and later stages ma and yu 2020 and t50 and t80 are the time limits distinguishing these three stages the t10 t50 and t80 values for water vapor and methane are shown in fig 10 in the sawm t50 ranged from 0 05 to 21 5 h for water vapor and from 0 12 to 0 55 h for methane while t80 ranged from 0 8 to 63 h for water vapor and from 0 3 to 1 5 h for methane this indicates that methane entered the transition and later stages earlier than water vapor the initial stage and transition stage are mainly controlled by bulk diffusion ma and yu 2020 in the sawm the partial pressure of methane was higher than that of water vapor this means that the bulk diffusivity of methane was higher the migration rate of methane in shale pore space was faster and the frequency and probability of methane colliding with the pore wall were higher resulting in a shorter time for methane to complete the initial stage and transition stage than water vapor the times for entry of water vapor into the initial and transition stages were generally longer than those for methane except for the initial stage at 1 mpa for c3 the times required to reach the transition stage for water vapor were 0 35 11 45 h c1 1 75 21 00 h c2 and 1 85 6 40 h c3 longer than those for methane in regard to the later stage the times were 6 10 38 55 h c1 13 70 53 00 h c2 and 0 25 35 60 h c3 longer further analysis revealed that the time extension was positively correlated with total pressure fig 10 also indicated that the time span between t80 and t50 was much longer than that between t50 and t10 in the sawm and this phenomenon was clearer for water vapor than for methane this indicates that the time required for adsorption of a unit amount increased as the adsorption process progressed the time to complete an ed unit for methane ranged from 0 002 to 0 011 h and it ranged from 0 004 to 0 019 h for water vapor in the initial stage the above time for methane ranged from 0 001 to 0 430 h and it ranged from 0 010 to 0 938 h for water vapor in the transition stage water vapor and methane enter pores in the gaseous state and they occur in the pores in the free and adsorbed states the migration of free and adsorbed gas are referred to as bulk and interface diffusion respectively bulk diffusion is the result of pressure and rate differences rate difference of molecular migration between free and adsorbed gas states occurring in matrix pores these differences stem from the driving force and resistance respectively the interface diffusion process involves movements of adsorbed molecules to high potential sites under the influence of potential energy differences as shown in fig 11 in the initial stage 11a monolayer adsorption of water vapor and methane occurred the migration of methane occurred due to bulk and interface diffusion the migration of water vapor was largely due to bulk diffusion the adsorption of water vapor onto shale was driven by hydrogen bonds formed between the water molecules and pore surface e g the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in kaolinite polar oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl on organic matter surfaces and so on and hydrogen bonds are 5 10 times stronger than van der waals forces hendricks and jefferson 1938 wang et al 2006 lu and khorshidi 2015 kadkhodaie and rezaee 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 zhang and lu 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore adsorbed water molecules were difficult to desorb i e the migration of water vapor did not occur via interface diffusion in the transition stage 11b multilayer monolayer interlayer adsorption of water vapor and methane was observed methane migration included bulk and interface diffusion compared to the initial stage the proportion of bulk diffusion was smaller and that of interface diffusion was larger in the transition stage for water vapor hydrogen bonds were formed between adsorbed water molecules thus making desorption difficult migration involved bulk diffusion and the proportion of bulk diffusion in the transition stage was smaller than that in the initial stage in the later stage 11c multilayer monolayer interlayer adsorption and condensation of water vapor occurred bulk diffusion of water vapor and methane disappeared methane migration occurred through interface diffusion and water vapor migration involved condensation the bulk diffusion rate for methane was higher than the interface diffusion rate and the amount of adsorption caused by bulk diffusion was larger the driving force for bulk diffusion was stronger than that for interface diffusion as the adsorption process developed the proportion of bulk diffusion decreased and that of interface diffusion increased however monolayer interlayer and multilayer adsorption was gradually observed this suggests that the driving force for methane migration deteriorated and that the number of effective adsorption sites for methane was reduced moreover inhibition of methane adsorption by water vapor became more prevalent resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate of methane condensation of water vapor occurred through hydrogen bonding with increasing amounts of water vapor adsorption in the water vapor adsorption process the proportion of bulk diffusion decreased and that of condensation increased monolayer interlayer and multilayer adsorption and condensation processes gradually occurred the driving force for bulk diffusion of water vapor weakened compared to that for methane adsorption as a result the migration velocity of the water molecules in pores was low and the times required for these water molecules to reach adsorption sites on the shale surface were long because of the strong hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules the water vapor adsorption layer was thick which increased the amount of water vapor adsorbed the adsorption process can be analyzed over time by establishing a quantitative relationship between ed and ted this provides a basis for determining the progress of adsorption in the experiment which is important for evaluating the amount of shale gas remaining in a reservoir during production ma and yu 2020 studied the dynamic behavior of methane adsorption onto partially saturated shales and proposed a dynamic adsorption model dam to describe the complete adsorption process based on the dam the relationship between ed and time is 16 t ed 0 01 e d k a 0 01 e d where k is the dynamic adsorption coefficient s 1 and a is a proportionality coefficient dimensionless experimental data for water vapor and methane from the sawm were fitted by eq 16 the above equation reasonably described the relationship between ted and ed the parameters of k and a are listed in table 3 in regard to water vapor the k parameter decreased with increasing total pressure however this did not occur during the methane adsorption process the results demonstrated that the time required to reach the same ed value for adsorption of both water vapor and methane at 5 mpa was longer than that required at 1 mpa in terms of methane me increased and the molecular migration time in the pores decreased with increasing total pressure ed was negatively correlated with me and me was positively correlated with total pressure this suggests that ed was negatively correlated with total pressure however total pressure provided the driving force for molecular migration and the driving force was thus positively correlated with ed the difference in behaviors with total pressures of 1 and 5 mpa indicated that the increase in me caused by total pressure exerted a pronounced effect on the methane adsorption progress for water vapor we decreased with total pressure the content of water vapor in the mixture decreased with total pressure which resulted in weakening of the driving force for adsorption the slower process for adsorption for water vapor at 5 mpa was caused by the two factors discussed above 4 4 distinction between ch4 adsorption processes for the h2o ch4 mixture and pure ch4 to understand the effect of water vapor on the adsorption of methane in the sawm pmds tests were performed on the three samples a comparison of the methane adsorption processes for pure ch4 and the ch4 h2o mixture is shown in fig 12 the equilibrium amount of methane adsorbed increased with total pressure in both sawm and pmds from 1 to 5 mpa the increments in the adsorption amounts ranged from 0 09 to 0 24 mmol g for the three samples in the sawm and they ranged from 0 11 to 0 26 mmol g in pmds the increment caused by the total pressure increase was small in the sawm in pmds t50 ranged from 0 002 to 0 014 h t80 ranged from 0 006 to 0 070 h and the adsorption of methane occurred more slowly than that of pure methane onto dry shale the t50 and t80 values in the sawm were 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times longer respectively than those in pmds as shown in fig 12 in all time ranges the amounts adsorbed in pmds were larger than those in sawm the reason for the adsorption delay in the sawm was that the adsorbed water molecules reduced the adsorption potential of the shale surface the time required for methane molecules to reach optimal adsorption sites was increased the decrease in the amount of methane adsorbed in the sawm is attributed to occupation of some of the surface adsorption sites by water vapor e g the oxygen containing functional groups pang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 moreover water vapor condensed at the pore throats which prevented methane molecules from entering the pores the reductions in methane adsorption in the sawm over those in pmds are provided in table 4 the adsorption reductions ranged from 0 014 to 0 066 mmol g and the reduction percentage ranged from 10 to 59 the adsorption reduction was smallest for c3 this occurred because c3 had the lowest clay content among the three samples the inner pore surfaces provided effective adsorption sites for both methane and water vapor because of the different adsorption capacities for methane and water vapor at the same sites their corresponding adsorption behavior involved competition for these surface sites adsorption of methane and water vapor onto shale is a physical process jiang et al 2007 liang et al 2016 in this process the adsorbate exhibiting the stronger interaction with the adsorbent replaces the weaker adsorbate effective adsorption sites for both water vapor and methane occur in clay but clay is hydrophilic billemont et al 2013 gensterblum et al 2014 the adsorption potential of water molecules is much higher than that of methane molecules with clay resulting in preferential adsorption of water vapor therefore the proportion of clay adsorption sites occupied by water vapor is large the ratios of the methane adsorption rates in pmds to those in the sawm vmp vm are shown in fig 13 the ratios reflected the differences in adsorption rates between the two experiments when the ratio was greater than 1 water vapor produced an inhibitory effect on methane adsorption conversely it yielded an enhancing effect when the ratio was less than 1 as indicated in table 5 the ratios ranged from 0 3 to 585 2 c1 0 8 335 6 c2 and 2 3 1035 5 c3 the maximum ratio for c3 was obviously higher than those for c1 and c2 which reveals that water vapor imposed the strongest inhibitory effect on methane adsorption for c3 the minimum ratios for c1 and c2 were less than 1 fig 13 indicates that ratios lower than 1 only occurred in the late stages of adsorption processes at 3 mpa c1 and 5 mpa c2 and this phenomenon was observed for a relatively short time the rate of methane adsorption decreased as adsorption proceeded and the initial rate was the highest the initial ratio was adopted as a basic value with which to measure the rate decay for methane in the two experiments table 5 indicates that the basic values ranged from 30 5 to 110 4 c1 69 1 204 9 c2 and 14 8 74 4 c3 the rate decay in the sawm was higher than that in pmds when the ratio was higher than the basic value conversely rate decay occurred faster in pmds when the ratio was lower than the basic value as shown in fig 13 the ratio was first higher and then lower than the basic value during the adsorption process at 1 mpa the critical point occurred after t90 at 5 mpa it occurred before t30 this indicates that the rate decay of methane was the same when a critical ed value was reached in the two experiments before the critical ed value was reached the rate decay in the sawm occurred more rapidly while after the critical ed value it occurred more rapidly in pmds with increasing total pressure ed occurred earlier in the adsorption process in the sawm adsorbed water impeded methane adsorption which increased the time required for methane to reach adsorption equilibrium the adsorbed water also affected the reduction in the methane adsorption rate the above experimental results suggest the following relationship between the adsorption rate and amount of water vapor adsorbed 17 v m c e d w where vm is the methane adsorption rate in the sawm mmol g s and c and d are positive parameters parameter c approximates the adsorption rate of methane at initiation and d is a coefficient reflecting the degree of adsorption rate change with changes in the amount of water vapor adsorbed the result for fitting of the function is provided in table 6 r2 was larger than 0 73 and d was positive parameter d was positively correlated with total pressure which indicates that the impact of the amount of water vapor adsorbed on the methane adsorption rate decreased with increasing total pressure in the sawm the amount of water vapor adsorbed was negatively correlated with the total pressure the bulk and interface diffusion processes of methane were affected by the amount of water vapor adsorbed and their diffusion intensities were positively correlated with the methane adsorption rate with regard to bulk diffusion the thickness of the adsorbed water layer decreased with decreasing amounts of water vapor adsorbed furthermore the pore diameters of effective gas migration channels widened and the probability of channel blocking decreased this indicates that the resistance to bulk diffusion was reduced in terms of interface diffusion the number of adsorption sites occupied by water molecules decreased and the adsorption potential energy increased with decreasing water vapor adsorption hence the range of methane interface diffusion expanded and the driving force for the interface diffusion process of methane also increased 5 conclusions an experimental method was proposed in this paper to explain the simultaneous adsorption of water and methane onto shales several conclusions were drawn based on the experimental results under the condition of simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane the adsorption of water vapor onto shale clearly occurred preferentially and the equilibrium amount of water vapor adsorbed we was much larger than that of methane me the we values for the three shale samples ranged from 0 931 to 1 761 mmol g and me ranged from 0 028 to 0 280 mmol g when the equilibrium total pressure was increased from 1 to 5 mpa we was 6 5 62 9 times c1 3 3 32 1 times c2 and 7 2 35 8 times c3 as high as me with equilibrium total pressure changed we decreased with increasing total pressure while me increased with increasing total pressure in the sawm the water vapor and methane adsorption rates decreased over time the adsorption equilibration time for water vapor was much longer than that of methane when the equilibrium total pressure was increased from 1 to 5 mpa the t50 value of water vapor ranged from 0 05 to 21 5 h and the t50 value of methane ranged from 0 12 to 0 55 h the t80 value of water vapor ranged from 0 8 to 63 h and the t80 value of methane ranged from 0 3 to 1 5 h with pmds me was lower than mpe and the time required to reach adsorption equilibrium was longer the me value decreased by 10 59 and t50 and t80 increased by 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times respectively in the two experiments the rates of methane adsorption decay were the same when the threshold ed was reached before reaching this threshold ed the decay in the sawm rate occurred more rapidly and after threshold ed the decay in the pmds rate occurred more rapidly credit

3816,methane is the main component of natural gas and a greenhouse gas it usually coexists with water in geological formations methane adsorption onto shale has been studied extensively but there is no report on the simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane sawm this paper reports a new experimental method for studying sawm onto shale during the experiment liquid water water vapor and methane coexist in an adsorption cell water vapor is produced via evaporation of liquid water and the processes of liquid water evaporation and water vapor and methane adsorption onto shale occur simultaneously the rate of liquid water conversion into vapor and the free water vapor content in the gas mixture depend on relative humidity rh changes in rh are monitored with a humidity sensor in sawm the amount of water vapor adsorbed greatly exceeds that of methane the adsorption of water vapor took longer to reach equilibrium than that of methane the amount of water vapor adsorbed at equilibrium decreased with total pressure while the opposite situation occurred with methane adsorption compared to pure methane adsorption onto dry shale pmds the amount of methane adsorbed was lower by 10 59 in sawm the equilibrium time for methane adsorption was higher and t50 and t80 t50 and t80 represented the times required for adsorption of 50 and 80 of the equilibrium adsorption amount respectively increased 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times respectively in the two experiments the declines in the level of methane adsorption were equal when a critical threshold equilibration degree ed was reached before reaching ed the rate of methane adsorption in sawm was higher than that in pmds after reaching ed the phenomenon was reversed keywords water vapor methane simultaneous adsorption adsorption amount adsorption rate decay 1 introduction the migration and adsorption behavior of gas in rock matrices is of great importance to many engineering resource and environmental issues such as the accumulation and reserves of shale gas gas leakage during exploitation and natural release of greenhouse gases from geological formations to resolve the problem of energy shortages many countries have shifted their attention to shale gas research and exploration kerr 2010 bustin et al 2012 chapiro and bruining 2015 pranesh 2018 however this has also caused damage to the environment while mitigating the energy crisis weber and clavin 2012 for example shale gas leakage caused by exploitation may induce groundwater surface water soil and atmospheric pollution most of this damage is caused by a lack of clarity regarding the features of methane migration and adsorption allen et al 2015 ferrar et al 2013 montgomery et al 2005 schmidt 2011 the pore structure functional group density kerogen type clay mineral content water saturation and level formation temperature of shale greatly affect the diffusion and adsorption of methane jin and firoozabadi 2014 chalmers and bustin 2007 xiong et al 2018 in particular there are two types of water in shale formations namely natural water and artificially injected water and they exhibit multiple forms in reservoirs i e structural water adsorbed water and condensed water vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 natural water refers to groundwater in the process of diagenetic evolution and it is formed by a mixture of sedimentary water diagenetic water and hypogenic water and through a series of complex physical chemical reactions primary water is ubiquitous within shale reservoirs researchers have found that water saturation levels due to natural water in typical gas production shales in north america range from 15 to 35 artificially injected water refers to the unrecoverable water remaining in the matrix in the process of hydraulic fracturing the imbibition effect in rock formations is induced by water injection resulting in desorption of some methane molecules after that some of the water is extracted as a liquid while the rest exists in the shale matrix in the adsorbed state and cannot be recovered approximately 50 95 of the injected water is confined in the pore network of the shale matrix due to capillary forces which leads to low water recovery in the hydraulic fracturing process the influence of water on the migration and adsorption of methane has always been a focus of research water vapor is a component of shale gas and is generally accompanied by methane in shale formations wang et al 2009 vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 research has demonstrated that water imposes adverse effects on the adsorption permeability and diffusivity of methane chalmers and bustin 2008 howarth et al 2011 li et al 2016 zhang and yu 2016 in shale gas exploitation injected water destroys the reservoir structure and blocks gas transportation paths moreover water vapor which is produced via liquid water evaporation is adsorbed onto pore surfaces to displace methane vidic et al 2013 kuchler 2017 in this context studies of the migration and adsorption of water vapor and methane are particularly important for safe and highly efficient resource exploitation studies have revealed that both water vapor and methane are preferentially adsorbed onto micropore surfaces with high potential energy hatch et al 2012 liu et al 2016 li et al 2016 the main competition for ch4 h2o adsorption occurs in pores of approximately 2 7 nm wang and yu 2016 and the adsorbed water transforms to condensation with increasing water film thickness li et al 2017 tokunaga et al 2017 wang et al 2018 conducted experiments on methane adsorption onto shales partially saturated with water they found that the adsorption capacity of wet shale was reduced and that increasing moisture content clearly impeded methane adsorption ross and bustin 2009 and gasparik et al 2014 reported that clay content is positively correlated with the content of adsorbed water and the amount of methane adsorption onto clay rich shale decreased by approximately 40 90 under water bearing conditions the above studies indicated that water inhibits methane adsorption onto shale but most of them focus on the amount adsorbed at equilibrium research on the interactions between water and methane in the adsorption process is still limited richard 1951 established a unipore diffusion model to study the dynamics of natural gas adsorption onto zeolites subsequently scholars investigated the adsorption process of methane from two perspectives in one case it was observed that the diffusion coefficient remained constant and in the other case the diffusion coefficient changed over time smith and williams 1984 mianowski and marecka 2009 akkutlu and faithi 2012 zhao et al 2014 yue et al 2016 by comparison it was found that the latter description of the gas adsorption process was more accurate recent research indicated that the diffusion coefficient decreases over time which may be related to reduced pore pressure during the occurring diffusion process liu et al 2018 rani et al 2018 moreover scholars have determined that the rates for diffusion and adsorption of methane onto wet shale are lower than those seen with dry shale which indicates that adsorbed water may negatively affect methane adsorption yuan et al 2014 zolfaghari et al 2017 although current studies have investigated the processes for adsorption of methane and water their experimental samples included shale containing preabsorbed i e pre equilibrated water under natural conditions water and methane usually coexist and may adsorb simultaneously onto shale formations but this phenomenon has rarely been considered in this work the simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane sawm onto shale was studied the sawm process was examined at total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa with three samples collected from the qaidam basin because the amount of water vapor adsorbed is difficult to determine due to the cooccurrence of evaporation and adsorption a reference evaporation experiment with liquid water relw was designed to establish a functional relationship between relative humidity rh and evaporation rate for calculating the rate for production of water vapor using this relationship and experimental data the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed were calculated based on the experimental results the effect of water vapor on methane adsorption was investigated by comparing the processes of the pure methane adsorption onto dry shale pmds and sawm the interactions between water vapor and methane were researched by analyzing their adsorption rates adsorption amounts and competitive adsorption strengths 2 adsorption experiments the main component of shale gas is methane and it is accompanied by ethane propane carbon dioxide and water vapor the forms in which water occurs are diverse water can exist in three forms in shale rock formations vapor liquid and quasi solid e g strongly bound water yang and yu 2020 and the three forms interconvert with variations in temperature pressure and other environmental conditions studies have shown that both liquid and strongly bound water exert negative effects on methane adsorption li et al 2015 wang and yu 2016 while the effect of water vapor on methane adsorption is still not clear therefore simultaneous adsorption experiments with water vapor and methane under different pressures must be conducted to simulate the adsorption process for water vapor and methane under the formation conditions 2 1 experimental samples three shale samples were obtained from the chaiye 2 core drilling well in the qaidam basin china the depths of the samples were 983 9 m denoted c1 1021 3 m denoted c2 and 1026 3 m denoted c3 table 1 the samples were crushed 200 mesh for sawm analysis the mineral composition and clay content were analyzed by a siemens xrd 6100 analyzer based on the sy t 5163 2010 standard the kerogen types were analyzed by a biological microscope axioskop 2 plus based on the sy t 5125 1996 standard the maturity characterized by vitrinite reflectance was determined by a microphotometer hitachi f7000 mpv sp equipped with an oil immersion objective lens according to the sy t 5124 1995 standard the toc content was determined by a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer according to the gb t 19145 2003 standard the specific surface area was determined by a quadrasorb si specific surface area analyzer according to the gb t19587 2004 standard as stated in the classification criteria of the international union of pure and applied chemistry nanopores are divided into three grades micropores diameter 2 nm mesopores 2 nm diameter less than 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 low pressure carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorption lpa and high pressure mercury intrusion micp tests were performed to calculate pore size distributions although micp can be used to measure pores with diameters ranging from 3 to 200 μm it is not useful for characterizing ultra fine pores due to structural deformations induced at high pressures co2 and n2 molecules can access micropores and mesopores in low pressure adsorption processes therefore co2 adsorption low pressure n2 adsorption and micp were applied to determine micropores mesopores and macropores respectively in this study the lpa method was conducted by following the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards and the analyzer is the same as specific surface area test the curve was analyzed using dubinin astakhov theory micp tests were run with a mercury injection meter auto pore iv 9520 and the experimental procedure followed the gb t 21650 1 2008 standard to determine macropore volumes fig 1 shows the pore size distributions pore volumes and pore surface areas of the micro meso and macropores 2 2 experimental apparatus an isothermal adsorption test apparatus was adopted to conduct sawm analyses fig 2 shows that the apparatus includes four parts a gas injection system adsorption system constant temperature system and data acquisition system compared to that of previous studies wang et al 2018 ma and yu 2020 the apparatus was improved by replacing the water bath with an incubator to improve the sealing capability and heat uniformity of the constant temperature system the adsorption system was composed of a receiver cell adsorption cell and high precision pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 001 mpa a hc2a ic102 humidity temperature sensor supplied by rotronic switzerland was added to the adsorption cell to measure humidity and temperature with accuracies of 0 01 and 0 01 k for measurements of relative humidity and temperature respectively the hc2a ic102 humidity temperature sensor allowed measurements over a relative humidity range from of 0 100 and a temperature range from 273 to 393 k variation in pressure were monitored through the pressure sensor during the experiment and the limit of the pressure sensor was 10 mpa the experiments were conducted under constant temperature which was controlled by the constant temperature system and temperature fluctuation was controlled to within 0 2 k the inner volumes of the cells were determined with the helium substitution method li et al 2015 the inner volume of the receiver cell was 66 042 cm3 and that of the adsorption cell was 62 352 cm3 as shown in fig 2 the adsorption cell contained the shale sample and ch4 h2o mixture the ch4 h2o mixture established a two phase system in the cell the upper part was a ch4 h2o gas mixture and the lower part contained liquid water during adsorption experiments the shale sample adsorbed water vapor from the gas mixture and the water vapor within was produced by evaporation of liquid water 2 3 experimental procedures this study consisted of two experiments the sawm experiment and the relw the sawm experiment was designed to observe the simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane for the sawm experiment a corresponding relw was performed to determine the rate at which liquid water was converted into water vapor fig 3 a and b shows schematics for the internal structures of the adsorption cells used for the relw and sawm experiments respectively and the mass preservation of water vapor the experimental environments temperature pressure and liquid water volume for the sawm and the relw studies were strictly identical to determine the amount of water vapor adsorbed the relationship between the evaporation rate and relative humidity was first determined through the relw and then this relationship was applied to study the sawm calculations of the abovementioned variables will be explained in detail in section 3 1 the procedure used for sawm was as follows a the temperature of the incubator was set to 313 15 k and the adsorption apparatus remained stable under vacuum after the system temperature was reached b the communication valve between the receiver and the adsorption cell was closed and high purity 99 999 methane was injected into the receiver cell under a given pressure through the regulating valve the pressures injected into the receiver cell were 1 6 4 8 and 8 0 mpa corresponding to equilibrium adsorption total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa in the adsorption cell respectively the stabilization time was 4 h c the sample was dried for 12 h at 378 15 k and the dried shale was cooled in a constant temperature and humidity chamber with a temperature of 313 15 k and relative humidity of 0 dried shale 10 g was placed in a stainless steel slot d the stainless steel slot and 10 cm3 of water preheated for 12 h at 313 15 k were placed into the adsorption cell simultaneously e the communication valve between the receiver and adsorption cells was opened and the temperature pressure and humidity were recorded f the experiment was stopped when the pressure and humidity stabilized i e adsorption equilibrium was attained the shale was removed for weighing g all of the above experimental steps were repeated and adsorption experiments were performed on each sample with equilibrium adsorption total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa the relw was conducted by replacing the shale sample with a stainless steel block of an equal volume and the procedure was the same as that of the sawm the procedure for the pmds study was the same as that of the sawm study except that only the shale samples were placed in the adsorption cell in step d of the sawm 3 methodology 3 1 calculation method for water vapor adsorption fig 4 shows that liquid water started to convert to water vapor and the relative humidity in the adsorption cell began increasing when the experiment began the rh value in the sawm was lower than that in a relw at the corresponding time t in the sawm part of the water vapor was converted into absorbed water and the other part existed in the free state in regard to the sawm and relw the following is obtained 1a w a w e w f 1b w er w fr where wa is the amount of water vapor adsorbed in the sawm mol we is the amount of liquid water evaporated in the sawm mol wf is the amount of free water vapor in the sawm mol wer is the amount of liquid water evaporated in the relw mol and wfr is the amount of free water vapor in the relw mol there are two methods for calculating the amount of methane adsorbed the volumetric and gravimetric methods sudibandriyo et al 2003 chareonsuppanimit et al 2012 the former was applied in this study by substituting the recorded pressure rh and temperature data into the gas state equation the amounts of free methane in the mixture before and after adsorption were calculated and the difference between these amounts was the amount adsorbed in the sawm the recorded pressure was the total pressure of water vapor and methane wang et al 2013 demonstrated that the partial pressure of a single gas in a ch4 h2o mixture may be calculated with dalton s partial pressure law they assumed that each gas was evenly distributed throughout the container this approach assumed that each gas generated the same pressure as it would have when occupying the entire container alone the state equations for the gases in the mixture are

conditions were identical except for the relative humidity they yielded the same evaporation rates if their rh values in the adsorption cell were the same namely 6 v r h v r r h where v rh is the evaporation rate of liquid water in the sawm mol s and vr rh is the evaporation rate of liquid water in the relw mol s for the relw the amount of free water vapor in the adsorption cell was equal to the amount evaporated namely 7a w er 0 t v r d t v r t i δ t i 7b w er w fr 8a w fr p wr v ar z wr r t ar 8b p wr r hr p sw where vr is the rate increment of water vapor in the relw mol s pwr is the

model for calculating the mole fraction of h2o ch4 in gas mixtures they considered the interactions between molecules of the different gas components in the mixture but ignored the effects of gas dissolution and gas water hydration according to the principle of gas liquid equilibrium the equation governing the equilibrium between the two water phases in the ch4 h2o mixture system is ji and yan

fugacity of water mpa xw is the mole fraction of water in the liquid phase dimensionless and γw is the activity coefficient of water dimensionless the temperature and pressure were relatively low in this study therefore the liquid water was regarded as incompressible herein the activity coefficient of water remains approximately constant when ignoring dissolution and hydration the saturated vapor

the corresponding yw values were obtained by y w p w z mix p mix z w fig 5 reveals that the measured values were consistent with the calculated values in the relw the amount of liquid water evaporated which was equal to the amount of free water vapor in the adsorption cell was determined with eqs 7a and 8a on this basis the evaporation rate was calculated and the relationship between evaporation rate and rh was acquired as shown in fig 6 the relationship based on measured humidity data was fitted with an exponential equation as expressed in eq 12 fig 6 indicates that the rate for evaporation of liquid water decreases with increasing total pressure 12 v r a e b r h in the sawm the evaporation rate was calculated by substituting the measured rh data into eqs 12 and 6 the amount of free water vapor was calculated with eqs 10 and 4 after calculating the amounts of evaporation and free water vapor the adsorption amount was calculated by considering mass conservation the adsorption per unit sample mass at time t is w w a q where q is the sample mass g we adopted symbols to indicate the amount of water vapor adsorbed at equilibrium 3 2 calculation method for methane adsorption the amount of methane adsorbed was calculated by the volumetric method using partial pressure data for methane in the ch4 h2o mixture eqs 2a and 2b indicate that the total pressure consisted of the partial pressures of water vapor and methane the partial pressure of water vapor was calculated by the method discussed in section 3 1 hence with the use of the partial pressure of water vapor and the total pressure the partial pressure of methane was determined with eq 3 based on the above the amount of methane adsorbed was calculated from the law of mass conservation and eq 2b the amount of methane adsorbed was the difference between the amount of methane injected into the adsorption cell and the amount of free methane 13 m a m t m f 14 m t p rm v r z rm r t r 15 m f p rm v r z rm r t ar

discussion 4 1 amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed the relative humidity was monitored by a humidity temperature sensor in the relw and sawm and data were obtained at equilibrium total pressures of 1 3 and 5 mpa we and wf were calculated according to the method described in section 3 1 and fig 7 shows the calculated results for the sawm after adsorption equilibrium was reached the shale sample was removed from the adsorption cell the sample was weighed and the equilibrium amount of water vapor adsorbed was verified according to the mass change in the sample after the adsorption experiment fig 8 shows a comparison of the equilibrium adsorption amounts determined via calculation and sample weighing the comparisons indicated that the discrepancies were within 5 the sawm experiments were conducted at the three equilibrium total pressures 1 3 and 5 mpa the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed by the three samples are shown in fig 9 the results revealed that the increments in the amounts of water vapor and methane adsorbed changed from large to small during the adsorption process in particular the rates for adsorption of water vapor and methane changed from rapid to slow over time the behavior was more obvious within the first 24 h after 24 h the methane increment was very small but the water vapor increment was relatively large a longer time was required for water vapor to reach adsorption equilibrium than for methane with increasing adsorption amounts water vapor and methane transitioned from single layer adsorption to multilayer adsorption li et al 2017 compared with the methane adsorption process the adsorption of water vapor has not stopped after multilayer adsorption as the adsorption process continued the condensation of water vapor occurred which causes the adsorption process of water vapor to last longer than that of methane 4 2 preferential adsorption of water vapor in the sawm the equilibrium adsorption amount is an indicator reflecting the adsorption capacity of shale using the experimental data pertaining to the sawm equilibrium amounts of water vapor w e and methane m e adsorbed were obtained and are listed in table 2 at adsorption equilibrium the amount of water vapor adsorbed was much larger than that of methane the equilibrium amounts of water vapor adsorbed by the three shales ranged from 0 931 to 1 761 mmol g and the equilibrium amounts of methane adsorbed ranged from 0 028 to 0 280 mmol g the ratios of the equilibrium amount of water vapor and methane adsorbed re we me ranged from 6 5 to 62 9 3 3 32 1 and 7 2 35 8 for the three samples zhang and lu 2019 used a theoretical advancement of an augmented brunauer emmett teller adsorption equation for clay soils to quantify external and internal specific surface areas their results indicated that polar materials such as water were adsorbed on both internal and external solid surfaces while nonpolar materials such as methane and nitrogen only accessed external solid surfaces lu and zhang 2020 this could explain why the amount of water vapor adsorbed was much higher than that of methane the value of me increased and the value of we decreased with increasing total pressure in the adsorption cell there were two reasons for this one is that the high total pressure led to a low saturation pressure of water vapor in the mixture in particular the partial pressure of water vapor was reduced which reduced the number of water molecules available for adsorption and the amount of water vapor adsorbed decreased at the same time the increase in methane adsorption led to a decrease in water vapor intensity during competitive adsorption which led to a decrease in amount of water vapor adsorbed the other reason was that the methane partial pressure increment was much more significant than that of the water vapor partial pressure with increasing total pressure methane molecules preferentially migrated to the adsorption sites to effect adsorption so adsorption sites that would otherwise be available to water vapor were occupied by methane when the equilibrium total pressure rose from 1 to 5 mpa we declined by 0 176 0 615 mmol g for the three samples and me increased by 0 098 0 242 mmol g the magnitude of variations in the amount of water vapor adsorbed were larger than those of methane this indicates that total pressure imposed a significant effect on we 4 3 comparison of adsorption progress for water vapor and methane in the sawm the ratio of the adsorption amount to the equilibrium adsorption amount is referred to as the equilibration degree ed of the adsorption process the symbol ted was adopted to denote the time when ed of the equilibrium adsorption amount was achieved for example t10 t50 and t80 represent the times when 10 50 and 80 respectively of the equilibrium adsorption amount were attained the process of methane adsorption onto shale may be divided into three stages namely the initial transition and later stages ma and yu 2020 and t50 and t80 are the time limits distinguishing these three stages the t10 t50 and t80 values for water vapor and methane are shown in fig 10 in the sawm t50 ranged from 0 05 to 21 5 h for water vapor and from 0 12 to 0 55 h for methane while t80 ranged from 0 8 to 63 h for water vapor and from 0 3 to 1 5 h for methane this indicates that methane entered the transition and later stages earlier than water vapor the initial stage and transition stage are mainly controlled by bulk diffusion ma and yu 2020 in the sawm the partial pressure of methane was higher than that of water vapor this means that the bulk diffusivity of methane was higher the migration rate of methane in shale pore space was faster and the frequency and probability of methane colliding with the pore wall were higher resulting in a shorter time for methane to complete the initial stage and transition stage than water vapor the times for entry of water vapor into the initial and transition stages were generally longer than those for methane except for the initial stage at 1 mpa for c3 the times required to reach the transition stage for water vapor were 0 35 11 45 h c1 1 75 21 00 h c2 and 1 85 6 40 h c3 longer than those for methane in regard to the later stage the times were 6 10 38 55 h c1 13 70 53 00 h c2 and 0 25 35 60 h c3 longer further analysis revealed that the time extension was positively correlated with total pressure fig 10 also indicated that the time span between t80 and t50 was much longer than that between t50 and t10 in the sawm and this phenomenon was clearer for water vapor than for methane this indicates that the time required for adsorption of a unit amount increased as the adsorption process progressed the time to complete an ed unit for methane ranged from 0 002 to 0 011 h and it ranged from 0 004 to 0 019 h for water vapor in the initial stage the above time for methane ranged from 0 001 to 0 430 h and it ranged from 0 010 to 0 938 h for water vapor in the transition stage water vapor and methane enter pores in the gaseous state and they occur in the pores in the free and adsorbed states the migration of free and adsorbed gas are referred to as bulk and interface diffusion respectively bulk diffusion is the result of pressure and rate differences rate difference of molecular migration between free and adsorbed gas states occurring in matrix pores these differences stem from the driving force and resistance respectively the interface diffusion process involves movements of adsorbed molecules to high potential sites under the influence of potential energy differences as shown in fig 11 in the initial stage 11a monolayer adsorption of water vapor and methane occurred the migration of methane occurred due to bulk and interface diffusion the migration of water vapor was largely due to bulk diffusion the adsorption of water vapor onto shale was driven by hydrogen bonds formed between the water molecules and pore surface e g the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in kaolinite polar oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl on organic matter surfaces and so on and hydrogen bonds are 5 10 times stronger than van der waals forces hendricks and jefferson 1938 wang et al 2006 lu and khorshidi 2015 kadkhodaie and rezaee 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 zhang and lu 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore adsorbed water molecules were difficult to desorb i e the migration of water vapor did not occur via interface diffusion in the transition stage 11b multilayer monolayer interlayer adsorption of water vapor and methane was observed methane migration included bulk and interface diffusion compared to the initial stage the proportion of bulk diffusion was smaller and that of interface diffusion was larger in the transition stage for water vapor hydrogen bonds were formed between adsorbed water molecules thus making desorption difficult migration involved bulk diffusion and the proportion of bulk diffusion in the transition stage was smaller than that in the initial stage in the later stage 11c multilayer monolayer interlayer adsorption and condensation of water vapor occurred bulk diffusion of water vapor and methane disappeared methane migration occurred through interface diffusion and water vapor migration involved condensation the bulk diffusion rate for methane was higher than the interface diffusion rate and the amount of adsorption caused by bulk diffusion was larger the driving force for bulk diffusion was stronger than that for interface diffusion as the adsorption process developed the proportion of bulk diffusion decreased and that of interface diffusion increased however monolayer interlayer and multilayer adsorption was gradually observed this suggests that the driving force for methane migration deteriorated and that the number of effective adsorption sites for methane was reduced moreover inhibition of methane adsorption by water vapor became more prevalent resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate of methane condensation of water vapor occurred through hydrogen bonding with increasing amounts of water vapor adsorption in the water vapor adsorption process the proportion of bulk diffusion decreased and that of condensation increased monolayer interlayer and multilayer adsorption and condensation processes gradually occurred the driving force for bulk diffusion of water vapor weakened compared to that for methane adsorption as a result the migration velocity of the water molecules in pores was low and the times required for these water molecules to reach adsorption sites on the shale surface were long because of the strong hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules the water vapor adsorption layer was thick which increased the amount of water vapor adsorbed the adsorption process can be analyzed over time by establishing a quantitative relationship between ed and ted this provides a basis for determining the progress of adsorption in the experiment which is important for evaluating the amount of shale gas remaining in a reservoir during production ma and yu 2020 studied the dynamic behavior of methane adsorption onto partially saturated shales and proposed a dynamic adsorption model dam to describe the complete adsorption process based on the dam the relationship between ed and time is 16 t ed 0 01 e d k a 0 01 e d where k is the dynamic adsorption coefficient s 1 and a is a proportionality coefficient dimensionless experimental data for water vapor and methane from the sawm were fitted by eq 16 the above equation reasonably described the relationship between ted and ed the parameters of k and a are listed in table 3 in regard to water vapor the k parameter decreased with increasing total pressure however this did not occur during the methane adsorption process the results demonstrated that the time required to reach the same ed value for adsorption of both water vapor and methane at 5 mpa was longer than that required at 1 mpa in terms of methane me increased and the molecular migration time in the pores decreased with increasing total pressure ed was negatively correlated with me and me was positively correlated with total pressure this suggests that ed was negatively correlated with total pressure however total pressure provided the driving force for molecular migration and the driving force was thus positively correlated with ed the difference in behaviors with total pressures of 1 and 5 mpa indicated that the increase in me caused by total pressure exerted a pronounced effect on the methane adsorption progress for water vapor we decreased with total pressure the content of water vapor in the mixture decreased with total pressure which resulted in weakening of the driving force for adsorption the slower process for adsorption for water vapor at 5 mpa was caused by the two factors discussed above 4 4 distinction between ch4 adsorption processes for the h2o ch4 mixture and pure ch4 to understand the effect of water vapor on the adsorption of methane in the sawm pmds tests were performed on the three samples a comparison of the methane adsorption processes for pure ch4 and the ch4 h2o mixture is shown in fig 12 the equilibrium amount of methane adsorbed increased with total pressure in both sawm and pmds from 1 to 5 mpa the increments in the adsorption amounts ranged from 0 09 to 0 24 mmol g for the three samples in the sawm and they ranged from 0 11 to 0 26 mmol g in pmds the increment caused by the total pressure increase was small in the sawm in pmds t50 ranged from 0 002 to 0 014 h t80 ranged from 0 006 to 0 070 h and the adsorption of methane occurred more slowly than that of pure methane onto dry shale the t50 and t80 values in the sawm were 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times longer respectively than those in pmds as shown in fig 12 in all time ranges the amounts adsorbed in pmds were larger than those in sawm the reason for the adsorption delay in the sawm was that the adsorbed water molecules reduced the adsorption potential of the shale surface the time required for methane molecules to reach optimal adsorption sites was increased the decrease in the amount of methane adsorbed in the sawm is attributed to occupation of some of the surface adsorption sites by water vapor e g the oxygen containing functional groups pang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 moreover water vapor condensed at the pore throats which prevented methane molecules from entering the pores the reductions in methane adsorption in the sawm over those in pmds are provided in table 4 the adsorption reductions ranged from 0 014 to 0 066 mmol g and the reduction percentage ranged from 10 to 59 the adsorption reduction was smallest for c3 this occurred because c3 had the lowest clay content among the three samples the inner pore surfaces provided effective adsorption sites for both methane and water vapor because of the different adsorption capacities for methane and water vapor at the same sites their corresponding adsorption behavior involved competition for these surface sites adsorption of methane and water vapor onto shale is a physical process jiang et al 2007 liang et al 2016 in this process the adsorbate exhibiting the stronger interaction with the adsorbent replaces the weaker adsorbate effective adsorption sites for both water vapor and methane occur in clay but clay is hydrophilic billemont et al 2013 gensterblum et al 2014 the adsorption potential of water molecules is much higher than that of methane molecules with clay resulting in preferential adsorption of water vapor therefore the proportion of clay adsorption sites occupied by water vapor is large the ratios of the methane adsorption rates in pmds to those in the sawm vmp vm are shown in fig 13 the ratios reflected the differences in adsorption rates between the two experiments when the ratio was greater than 1 water vapor produced an inhibitory effect on methane adsorption conversely it yielded an enhancing effect when the ratio was less than 1 as indicated in table 5 the ratios ranged from 0 3 to 585 2 c1 0 8 335 6 c2 and 2 3 1035 5 c3 the maximum ratio for c3 was obviously higher than those for c1 and c2 which reveals that water vapor imposed the strongest inhibitory effect on methane adsorption for c3 the minimum ratios for c1 and c2 were less than 1 fig 13 indicates that ratios lower than 1 only occurred in the late stages of adsorption processes at 3 mpa c1 and 5 mpa c2 and this phenomenon was observed for a relatively short time the rate of methane adsorption decreased as adsorption proceeded and the initial rate was the highest the initial ratio was adopted as a basic value with which to measure the rate decay for methane in the two experiments table 5 indicates that the basic values ranged from 30 5 to 110 4 c1 69 1 204 9 c2 and 14 8 74 4 c3 the rate decay in the sawm was higher than that in pmds when the ratio was higher than the basic value conversely rate decay occurred faster in pmds when the ratio was lower than the basic value as shown in fig 13 the ratio was first higher and then lower than the basic value during the adsorption process at 1 mpa the critical point occurred after t90 at 5 mpa it occurred before t30 this indicates that the rate decay of methane was the same when a critical ed value was reached in the two experiments before the critical ed value was reached the rate decay in the sawm occurred more rapidly while after the critical ed value it occurred more rapidly in pmds with increasing total pressure ed occurred earlier in the adsorption process in the sawm adsorbed water impeded methane adsorption which increased the time required for methane to reach adsorption equilibrium the adsorbed water also affected the reduction in the methane adsorption rate the above experimental results suggest the following relationship between the adsorption rate and amount of water vapor adsorbed 17 v m c e d w where vm is the methane adsorption rate in the sawm mmol g s and c and d are positive parameters parameter c approximates the adsorption rate of methane at initiation and d is a coefficient reflecting the degree of adsorption rate change with changes in the amount of water vapor adsorbed the result for fitting of the function is provided in table 6 r2 was larger than 0 73 and d was positive parameter d was positively correlated with total pressure which indicates that the impact of the amount of water vapor adsorbed on the methane adsorption rate decreased with increasing total pressure in the sawm the amount of water vapor adsorbed was negatively correlated with the total pressure the bulk and interface diffusion processes of methane were affected by the amount of water vapor adsorbed and their diffusion intensities were positively correlated with the methane adsorption rate with regard to bulk diffusion the thickness of the adsorbed water layer decreased with decreasing amounts of water vapor adsorbed furthermore the pore diameters of effective gas migration channels widened and the probability of channel blocking decreased this indicates that the resistance to bulk diffusion was reduced in terms of interface diffusion the number of adsorption sites occupied by water molecules decreased and the adsorption potential energy increased with decreasing water vapor adsorption hence the range of methane interface diffusion expanded and the driving force for the interface diffusion process of methane also increased 5 conclusions an experimental method was proposed in this paper to explain the simultaneous adsorption of water and methane onto shales several conclusions were drawn based on the experimental results under the condition of simultaneous adsorption of water vapor and methane the adsorption of water vapor onto shale clearly occurred preferentially and the equilibrium amount of water vapor adsorbed we was much larger than that of methane me the we values for the three shale samples ranged from 0 931 to 1 761 mmol g and me ranged from 0 028 to 0 280 mmol g when the equilibrium total pressure was increased from 1 to 5 mpa we was 6 5 62 9 times c1 3 3 32 1 times c2 and 7 2 35 8 times c3 as high as me with equilibrium total pressure changed we decreased with increasing total pressure while me increased with increasing total pressure in the sawm the water vapor and methane adsorption rates decreased over time the adsorption equilibration time for water vapor was much longer than that of methane when the equilibrium total pressure was increased from 1 to 5 mpa the t50 value of water vapor ranged from 0 05 to 21 5 h and the t50 value of methane ranged from 0 12 to 0 55 h the t80 value of water vapor ranged from 0 8 to 63 h and the t80 value of methane ranged from 0 3 to 1 5 h with pmds me was lower than mpe and the time required to reach adsorption equilibrium was longer the me value decreased by 10 59 and t50 and t80 increased by 12 0 108 0 and 9 0 115 2 times respectively in the two experiments the rates of methane adsorption decay were the same when the threshold ed was reached before reaching this threshold ed the decay in the sawm rate occurred more rapidly and after threshold ed the decay in the pmds rate occurred more rapidly credit

3817,due to the increased frequency and magnitude of urban flooding events there is a pressing need to improve the accuracy of numerical tools to better assess the hydraulic performance of new drainage systems nowadays such models are inherently challenging to verify due to the difficulty of acquiring reliable data during the flood event meaning that most models are calibrated using only an estimated measure of the extent of flooding to address this gap this study investigated flooding scenarios using an experimental scale facility of an urban street and manhole network delivering a novel data set in terms of the scale of the facility used several hydraulic conditions are investigated within a variety of street configurations incorporating parking slots cars on the road and various locations of the manhole within the street this enabled the quantification of flow exchange during hypothetical flood events for multiple cases as well as the characterisation of energy losses a crucial parameter that is often a source of uncertainty within numerical modelling tools furthermore the experimental system was equipped with an injection system to replicate the transport of pollutants during flooding events and this enabled the estimation of the exchange of soluble pollutants between the minor and major systems for each flooding scenario results obtained have confirmed the applicability of the orifice equation for the estimation of flow exchange between the two systems showing that i the discharge coefficients obtained 0 126 0 138 decrease as the width of the street channel becomes narrower ii the surface energy loss coefficient was unaffected by all street configurations tested iii all tested geometries displayed significant pollutant exchange from the sewer to the street in the range of 28 39 demonstrating that situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the mass of pollutants being exchanged to the surface and the presence of parking spaces alone did not appear to affect the mass of pollutant exchanged these results have provided a novel series of datasets including flowrates flow exchange energy losses and discharge coefficients that could be used to calibrate and validate numerical models and be utilised as a benchmark keywords sewer surface flow interactions urban flooding drainage systems head losses pollutant transport flow exchange 1 introduction flooding events in urban areas are known to have hugely detrimental effects on society by the resultant damage to infrastructure and properties as well as posing a threat to the wellbeing of the people residing in the area chang 2016 hou et al 2019 global warming has led to deviations from the earth s natural hydrological cycle as it has caused widespread melting of the earth s icecaps and increased the water vapour content in the atmosphere the rise in temperature has led to changes in precipitation patterns resulting in more intense rainfall which has increased the occurrence of flooding bates et al 2008 rubinato et al 2019 ostad ali askari et al 2019 for example it is predicted that there will be a 2 28 rise in the uk s winter precipitation by 2050 arnell et al 2015 furthermore the process of urbanisation makes new developments increasingly susceptible to flooding zevenbergen et al 2008 rubinato et al 2020a due to the increasing number of impermeable surfaces swan 2010 and as population growth continues the number of people at risk from urban flooding will only rise with an increase of 900 000 more people expected to be at risk in the uk by 2050 houston et al 2011 to aggravate the current situation many of the urban drainage systems used are not able to perform effectively with the flow capacity of storm sewers being limited as they were not originally designed to accommodate for the increasing levels of flow caused by urbanisation in comparison to the times when the drainage systems were built ofwat 2011 this is particularly prevalent in historic cities where combined sewer systems are still in use aronica and lanza 2005 exposure to contaminants is a risk to health that can be associated with urban floodwater depending on the source of the water de man et al 2013 shucksmith et al 2018 contaminants are released into wastewater due to agricultural processes and the waste that is produced by industries and the population deblonde et al 2011 this results in surface runoff and sewage overflow transporting waterborne pathogens into the surface water during flood events which is sourced from contaminants including faecal matter both from humans and animals schets et al 2008 among these contaminants are bacteria such as e coli marsalek and rochfort 2010 and antibiotic resistant bacteria which are found to have adverse health effects kim and aga 2007 arnone and perdeck walling 2007 rossi et al 2004 blanchoud et al 2007 sales ortells et al 2015 flood modelling tools are increasingly necessary for predicting possible hydraulic behaviours in the event of a flood and are essential for a variety of purposes such as sewer system re design damage assessment hazard maps and real time management applications from the data generated by flood modelling along with consideration of economic social and environmental factors gallegos et al 2009 preventative measures can be put in place to reduce the impacts of flooding accordingly djordjevic et al 2013 first introduced a dual drainage model that explained all the steps needed to assess flood hazard to date state of the art dual drainage models couple 1d sewer network flow models to 2d floodplain models lee et al 2013 using orifice and weir equations to estimate the flow exchange between the two systems as a function of relative hydraulic head in the sewer and the surface djordjević et al 2005 furthermore geometrical features such as pipe expansion contraction as well as hydraulic conditions supercritical or subcritical can alter the energy losses inside manholes and the effect of shallow water running over streets on surcharging manholes is also yet to be fully investigated mignot et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 therefore not being able to accurately represent sub surface flow exchange as well as energy losses can be considered as a potential source of uncertainty leading to errors and inaccurate predictions to calibrate and validate these tools modellers rely on footage obtained from cctv cameras during flood events as it is not safe for operators to record the events themselves in person during a flood tsubaki fujita and tsutsumi 2010 this makes it extremely challenging to provide databases for these models reducing the reliability of the results produced hammond et al 2013 to support the calibration of numerical tools studies have been recently conducted to investigate the interactions between surface flows and sewer systems rubinato et al 2013 rubinato et al 2017 lee et al 2015 chen et al 2016 noh et al 2016 jang et al 2018 chang et al 2018 fraga et al 2015 gómez et al 2013 gómez et al 2016 saldarriaga et al 2017 gómez et al 2013 lopes et al 2015 martins et al 2017 rubinato et al 2017 beg et al 2018 beg et al 2019 rubinato et al 2018a rubinato et al 2018b martins et al 2018 kemper and schlenkhoff 2019 gómez et al 2019 tellez alvarez et al 2020 chibane et al 2021 golian et al 2020 the studies available in literature have been conducted to test different flow exchange scenarios or surface flood extent however they all replicate specific conditions such as inlet conditions open manholes lopes et al 2015 martins et al 2014 or disconnected systems additionally other researchers bazin et al 2014 have also tested manholes in series however the scale of the model adopted and the consequent flows tested were limited to a narrow range of hydraulic conditions with reynolds number not always suitable for flooding conditions many parameters have been found to affect energy losses in manholes such as the depth ratio between up and down stream pipes hsu et al 1998 hydraulic conditions in different branches del giudice et al 2000 bed discordance within the manhole junction biron et al 1996 the presence of external pipes linking laterally to the manhole ramamurthy and zhu 1997 zhao et al 2006 however energy losses in manholes during sewer to surface surcharge events have only been previously investigated within the same facility used in this study for different hydraulic conditions and geometrical setup rubinato et al 2018b despite all the progress made within this field there remains a lack of validation of linking equations and a gap in the estimation of energy losses associated with surcharging manholes connected with various street profiles bruwier et al 2020 additionally water escaping from manholes during flooding events is often polluted and can contain sediments which are transported across urban areas and are a source of health risk although the presence of contaminants such as these in surface flows is well known naves et al 2020 there is still a lack of research into the extent of the exchange of pollutants during flood events between drainage networks and surface flows beg et al 2020 this includes the quantification of the exchange and its spreading despite some progress made in the field to optimise measuring techniques nichols and rubinato 2016 rojas arques et al 2018 nevertheless recent attempts have been made to include health risk assessment within urban flood models based on a prediction of wastewater concentration within surface flood waters mark et al 2018 current modelling approaches to determine how wastewater concentrations vary spatially and temporally relative to sewer surcharge events are based on the solution of the advection diffusion equation ade the ade was originally developed by taylor 1954 for turbulent pipe flow although it is now commonly applied within a range of water quality applications including surface waters and urban drainage networks to implement an accurate use of the 2d ade it is fundamental to understand both the local 2d velocity fields as well as the turbulent diffusion coefficients on top of this information which is needed nowadays there is a current lack of data on the flow exchange between sewer systems and urban surfaces this is important as the risk of infection can be dependent on a pathogen s concentration in the water hofstra 2011 gaining a better understanding of the potential quantities of these pollutants that are being transported into surface flows will aid in making informed decisions these decisions can be on things such as what further measures need to be taken in sewage treatment facilities as well as altering the designs of future sewage systems to mitigate against these risks mostafa et al 2016 the primary aim of this research is to quantify and provide a better understanding of flow exchange between sewers and urban surfaces to improve flood modelling nowadays it is important to demonstrate the theoretical capability of the current modelling types available via robust experimental validation as this provides confidence in future numerical studies that investigate surface to sewer exchange flow therefore we strongly believe that the results provided could be an essential source for numerical modellers across the world to be used to calibrate and validate numerical tools furthermore the applicability of the orifice equation was tested for these complex configurations and the tests conducted were analysed to study the effects that the geometry of a street can have on i the flow exchange estimation between a sewer and a hypothetical surface ii the energy losses inside a surcharging manhole during urban flooding events and iii the transport of soluble pollutants between the two systems 2 experimental model to address the gaps identified in various literature an experimental campaign was conducted using a physical model constructed and situated at the university of sheffield rubinato 2015 this model consists of a linked sewer surface system at a scale of 1 6 as shown in fig 1 and has previously been used to compare infoworks results to experimental data rubinato et al 2013 as well as to provide a better understanding of urban flooding phenomena beg et al 2020 rubinato et al 2017 martins et al 2018 rubinato et al 2018a b and martins et al 2017 lopes et al 2014 beg et al 2018 the model constructed with clear acrylic 75 mm internal diameter replicates a sewer pipe system which is connected to a hypothetical urban surface by a manhole 240 mm diameter the surface 6 6 m long and 1 180 m wide is also made of acrylic manning s n 0 009 sm 1 3 and it is inclined at a slope of 0 001 m m at full scale these dimensions would be an acceptable and common design for a uk urban drainage system defra 2011 tests were carried out on the 5 different street profile configurations shown in fig 2 and fig a1 in appendix a in order to determine how differing geometries affect the exchange of flow and pollutants between the sewer and the surface during flooding conditions the applicability of the orifice equation commonly used to quantify the flow exchange between the major and minor systems along with the corresponding range of discharge coefficients under steady state flow conditions was obtained via a series of tests that have been conducted using the experimental facility described the inflows to the pipe were varied to generate increasing surcharge into the street via a single manhole therefore simulating conditions where the hydraulic head in the sewer system was greater than the surface flow depth the flow within the system was measured using electromagnetic flow meters which were situated at the inlets of both the surface qinf and the sewer qins while there was another located at the sewer outlet qouts steady flows into the sewer and onto the surface were controlled using a butterfly flow control valve which was controlled by labview software along with the electromagnetic flowmeters and pressure sensors rubinato 2015 the accuracy of the flowmeters has been validated using volumetric discharge readings using the laboratory measurement tank flows were able to be set and entered the model via both the sewer inlet and the floodplain inlet 4 30 l s for all cases kept steady with the flow exchange occurring within the manhole structure replicating typical flooding scenarios to obtain temporally averaged values the data was collected over a period of 5 min after the flow had been allowed to stabilise 5 mins measurement rate 2 hz to simulate the transport of solutes rhodamine wt a neutrally buoyant fluorescent dye was injected into the inflowing sewer pipe shucksmith et al 2018 the concentration of the dye was measured by two cyclops 7f fluorimeters cyclops 1 and 2 in fig 1 which were located before and after the manhole respectively this was done to assess the solute exchange under different flow conditions for dissimilar street profiles on the hypothetical urban streets the dye was released into the system in pulses 15 s and was injected at a distance greater than 10d from the manhole d being the diameter of the sewer pipe to guarantee the full mixing of the pollutant within the water and provide an accurate measurement of its concentration before and after the manhole gotfredsen et al 2020 rutherford 1994 for this experiment dye of concentration 10 3 mg l was fed into a constant head tank see image below from where injections into the sewer pipe were controlled by a manual open close valve for each test conducted the measurements were continuous and the electrical sensor output was converted into a concentration using experimentally predetermined calibration equations beg et al 2020 pressure was measured at various location within the sewer and the surface by using gems pressure transducers fitted within the pipe invert and the bed of the hypothetical surface transducers were calibrated such that transducer output signal ma can be directly related to gauge pressure this step was completed using a pointer gauge with an averaged recorded error between measured values and defined calibration relationships psewer accuracy 0 72 mm within the water depth of 0 600 mm and psurface 0 109 mm within the water depth of 0 100 mm were located 350 mm and 460 mm respectively from the centre of the manhole fig a2 in appendix a this equipment was calibrated so that the electrical output signal ma could be directly related to gauge pressure rubinato et al 2017 all pressure transducers were linked to labview software such that the readings from the facility instrumentation were logged against time 2 1 method for analysis of results 2 1 1 estimation flow exchange to determine the quantity of the flow from the sewer that reaches the surface the mean

structure and entered the floodplain was measured by comparing the concentration in the sewer flow upstream of the manhole and that of the sewer pipe downstream of the manhole the reduction in

follows 12 r e ud v where r e reynolds number u velocity of fluid m s d diameter of pipe m v kinematic viscosity of water m2 s the reynolds values calculated were used to classify the turbulence of

linking equations the hydraulic conditions are displayed in table 1 and to enable the up scaling of the results obtained rubinato et al 2020b a series of non dimensional parameters resewer remanhole frsurface are included the calculated instrument error margins in table 1 show minimal potential error in the flow exchange values confirming the accuracy of the physical model and the equipment used the maximum inflow rate for the surface q1 was 4 50 l s while for the sewer q3 system it was 10 l s based on a geometrical scale of 1 to 6 this flow rate for the sewer system corresponds to approximately 65 l s in a full scale pipe system based on reynolds similitude 0 45 m the diameter of the real site manhole the velocities on the surface were quantified to be between 0 09 and 0 17 m s for the tests reported here with flow depths between 20 mm and 30 mm the surface flow froude numbers were in the range 0 179 0 356 and were hence sub critical based on the froude numbers similitude this corresponds to a real scaled velocity range of 0 225 and 0 425 m s in urban areas these values are within the range that might be expected for a shallow water running over an urban surface during a flood event and is similar to the range used by djordjevic et al 2013 for the physical modelling of gully performance during flood events table 2 shows the calculated mean discharge coefficients ci for each of the surface configurations tested and the 3 different overflow conditions the results show that as the sewer inflow increases the rate of flow exchange becomes greater for all 5 street geometries the greatest rate of flow exchange change was recorded when the manhole was situated closer to the side of the road at the highest sewer inflow fig 3 displays relationships between flow exchange qe and the orifice equation applied incorporating results existing in literature rubinato et al 2017 carried out using the same experimental model with a much wider and clear surface geometry width 4 m no street profiles replicated it can also be seen that the flow exchange orifice value relationships for each of the geometries fall within a similar range the graph shows a clear relationship between the width of the surface flow channel and the orifice value the linear regression lines of both sets of data have similar gradients while the results from rubinato et al 2017 have dissimilar orifice values within the same range of flow exchange the strength in the correlation of these values suggests that the linear regression model can be used to estimate the flow conditions for similar geometries the resultant discharge coefficients from rubinato et al 2017 were in the range of 0 160 0 174 while for a similar range of flow exchange used in this study the range found in these tests is 0 126 0 138 despite this the gradient of the linear regression model for the previous study is very similar to those derived from this experiment showing there is a clear relationship between the width of the surface and the resulting discharge coefficient considering the differences estimated as the width of the channel decreases the corresponding discharge coefficient decreases as shown in the discharge coefficient and orifice value section the flow exchange rate q e and the orifice value for each configuration show a linear relationship as the flow rate increases with the same trend being shown in the previous study by rubinato et al 2017 using a wider channel width 4 m instead of 1 180 m each of the linear regression models having an r2 value greater than 0 96 also supports the accuracy of the trendlines created this pattern suggests that the linear trendline equations for example the ones presented in table 3 for different street geometries could potentially be used to predict the flow exchange from the sewers based on the orifice value that is observed further testing at a wider range of flow exchange values would be required to confirm whether the relationship remains linear as the values increase decrease although the linear pattern shown by the results of rubinato et al 2017 across a much wider q e range indicates that the geometries from this study would likely show the same behaviours although each of the trendlines are specific to the individual configurations all 5 of the equations found in this study show very similar gradients and close x axis intercept values this indicates that the relationships shown in this study can be used to estimate the flow exchange of different street types of similar width given that they have the same sewer and manhole dimensions to do the same for streets with other sewer arrangements further experimentation such as this study would need to be carried out using physical models of these alternative sewer systems it would also be beneficial to do this so that the magnitude of the effects caused by the sewer arrangement can be compared too 3 1 1 variations in surface velocity at the position psurface upstream of the manhole the froude numbers of each geometry showed less variability and were all subcritical although the values obtained for geometry 4 were noticeably lower within the range of 0 179 0 195 while the other geometries showed similar numbers between 0 244 and 0 356 the cause of this is the velocity of the surface flow which is greatly reduced in comparison to configurations 1 3 in particular the velocity was calculated downstream of the manhole once the overflow and the surface flow were combined to make the most accurate representation of the surface velocity downstream of the manhole the reason for this being that the flow is restored to its normal sub critical conditions at this point and is no longer subject to the effects of the surcharge which causes a hydraulic jump in the region surrounding the manhole from the results obtained it can be noted that the presence of parking spaces cars on the road and the position of the manhole all have an effect in reducing the surface flow velocity the effects of parking spaces are demonstrated by the reduction of velocity from the rectangular street which was 0 204 0 209 m s to the range of 0 181 0 193 m s for both geometries 2 and 3 as the velocities are in the same range whether there is parking on one side or both sides of the street it suggests that this has minimal effect on the surface flow the presence of cars on the street appears to have the greatest effect on the velocity as there is a significant reduction to 0 134 0 146 m s between configurations 3 and 4 which had identical parking slots a reason for this could be the position of the manhole as it was positioned at the centre of the street for configuration 4 consequently the cars were located closer to the centreline of the manhole where measurement points were situated than the parking slots were having greater influence on the measurements when the manhole was positioned near the side of the street there was also an observed velocity reduction to the range of 0 15 0 161 m s although it was not as great of an increase as the one seen for geometry 4 as the number and size of the parking slots on either side was altered from that of configuration 4 they could have caused additional affects to the velocity however to determine if this was true and to confirm that cars being present on the street has a greater effect on the velocity additional tests would be required this could be done by placing the manhole on one side with identical parking arrangements to directly compare them or to assess different sizes numbers and arrangements of parking slots when the manhole is central to first identify how strong their influence is the froude numbers calculated downstream from the manhole along the surface show that the most significant difference between the froude numbers of each geometry occurs at the position that is 510 mm from the centre point of the manhole at this position the froude numbers for geometries 1 4 are supercritical whereas geometry 5 provides sub critical values this shows a clear influence from the position of the manhole on the criticality of the surface flow likely due to the interaction between the flow in proximity of the surcharging manhole with the curb of the model 3 2 characterisation of energy losses fig 4 displays the experimentally determined hydraulic heads losses h1 h3 h1 h2 and δh plotted against sewer inflow velocity head u1 2 2g components for the tests conducted in surcharging conditions it is possible to observe a clear linear relationship between head loss and velocity head of the sewer inflow by considering the slope of the regression lines fitted to the experimental data head loss coefficients k were determined these coefficients and their confidence limits r2 0 986 for all the cases are given in table 4 the results obtained are in line with what is available in literature rubinato et al 2018a b confirming that for all the cases the energy loss coefficient linked with the flow exchange k12 is higher than the energy loss coefficient associated with the flow through the sewer k13 demonstrating that higher energy losses are generated inside the manhole during surcharging conditions furthermore it is important to highlight that the trends observed are very similar for all the configurations tested this means that parking slots and the presence of cars are actually providing a negligible effect on the energy losses linked with the overflow inside the manhole however it is essential to note that the configuration which creates the more substantial change is configuration 5 with parking on both sides and the manhole on one side where k12 was calculated to be 1 296 minimum value obtained 3 3 quantification of pollutant exchange for each of the 5 geometries 6 7 tests took place at 3 different rates of flow exchange the number length and time of pollutant injections varied to investigate the effects this had on the percentage of the pollutant that is exchanged to the surface tables 5 9 in appendix b present the percentage of the pollutant entering the sewer inflow pipe that was exchanged to the surface flow on each of the surface geometries at varying flow exchange rates the data is summarised in fig 5 with exception to the rectangular street geometry all the other configurations show a linear increase in the percentage of the pollutant exchanged as the flow exchange becomes larger but it is also important to acknowledge that for cars parking on one side parking on one side and parking manhole on one side there may be a possibility of an exponential trend this requires verification needing higher concentrations of pollutant to be injected and additional hydraulic conditions to be tested the exchange values for configuration 5 and the percentage pollutant exchanged at the highest flow exchange rate for configuration 4 are significantly larger than the results shown from the other tests indicating that there is a link between the presence of obstructions around the manhole and the quantity of pollutant that is exchanged the variations in the number time and length of the pollutant injection pulses did not appear to affect the percentage of pollutant present in the sewer that was transported to the surface as there are no distinct variations between the percentages calculated under different pulse conditions this is likely due to the flow conditions being steady state meaning there were no variations in the flow conditions between pulse injections the pollutant exchange results show that for all the surface geometries a relatively large proportion of the pollutant mass was transported to the surface 28 39 fig 5 being able to quantify the percentage of pollutant reaching the surface is an important step in assessing the level of risk associated with the concentration of individual pollutants present in real sewer systems using data such as this samples can be taken of a sewer s effluent for testing so to measure the concentration of the pollutants found in the samples combining the pollutant concentrations the percentage of the pollutant discharge and the flow exchange data the mass of individual pollutants reaching the surface can be estimated so that their levels can be monitored as to whether they exceed acceptable levels doing so will help indicate whether actions need to be taken to treat the contamination the results of the various soluble pollutant tests identify that a significantly greater percentage of the pollutant was exchanged to the surface when the manhole was located closer to the edge of the model street one reason for this could be due to the decreased surface velocity compared to configurations 1 3 where there similarly are not any obstructions on the road the likely cause of the decreased flow velocity is the frictional forces acting on the water at the edge of the channel which for configuration 5 is far closer to the centreline of the manhole where the velocity was measured another noticeable value in the results is that the percentage of pollutant exchanged increased largely for configuration 4 when the flow exchange value reached 0 003248 m3 s a possible reason for this is the presence of cars on the street however this theory is not supported when the flow exchange for configuration 4 is lower as it produced similar percentages of the pollutant being exchanged as geometries 1 3 within that flow range the key difference shown is the substantial decrease in surface velocity for geometries 4 and 5 which are within the range of 0 134 0 161 m s from those shown for geometries 1 3 between 0 181 and 0 209 m s the decrease in surface velocity could allow more flow exchange between surface and manhole creating hydraulic conditions that could lead to an expansion of the hydraulic jump region when the flow exits the manhole and passes from subcritical to supercritical geometries 2 5 all show a continuing increase in pollutant exchange as the flow exchange rate increases the rectangular street is the one exception to this as when qe increases from 0 003044 to 0 003221 m3 s the percentage of pollutant exchanged decreases from 32 54 to 32 40 although this is not a large decrease it is a deviation from the patterns shown by other surface arrangements which is noteworthy the key difference in the results for geometry 1 is that its surface velocity is by far the highest however there is a slight decrease in velocity between the 2 highest exchange rates corresponding with the pollutant exchange decrease to determine whether the rectangular street would continue to deviate from the patterns displayed by the other geometries further tests at higher flow exchange rates would need to be carried out additionally the flows observed in the sewer pipes and manhole during the experimental tests showed high turbulence meaning that the movement of particles within the flow was very erratic the turbulence shown in the sewer network is likely a contributing factor to the slight variation in pollutant exchange percentages between tests carried out at the same inflow and pollutant injection times numbers despite the flow conditions being similar the random nature of the particle movement could have affected the quantity of the pollutant that left the pipe flow and entered the manhole the same principal can be applied within the manhole structure as the turbulence may have affected the quantity that was discharged to the surface and the quantity retained in the manhole that later re entered the sewer the effect of the turbulence would have been lesser in the manhole as the reynolds numbers for the manhole were much lower than those of the sewer pipes finally the similarities in the percentages exchanged for geometries 1 3 suggest that the presence of parking spaces had no noticeable effect on pollutant exchange to the surface when the manhole was positioned at the centre of the street this is despite the parking spaces causing a reduction in the surface flow velocity 3 4 limitations and suggested future research 3 4 1 unsteady flow states all tests analysed in this study were carried out under steady state flow conditions meaning the flow rates entering the sewer and the manhole remained constant these are idealised conditions as in reality it is unlikely that the flow in the sewer or on the surface for that matter will remain constant due to variance in factors such as rain intensity and sudden surges of water into the system the use of steady conditions is beneficial for observing the effects of the surface geometry more clearly both regarding flow exchange and pollutant exchange as there are fewer contributing variables now that the preliminary effects of the manhole location parking slots and presence of cars are known unsteady state conditions will be implemented to better imitate real scenarios that would occur in the event of a flood moreover the transport of pollutants in between the surface and sewer systems are particularly affected by the surrounding soil and aquifer strata ignoring the effects of aquifers and other urban underground infrastructure partly explains the linear increasing trend of pollutant exchange and the hypothetical exchange rate of 28 39 therefore the experimental model will be adjusted to account for the complex nature of dynamic hydraulic processes among surface subsurface urban infrastructure hydrogeology groundwater systems these steady state flow conditions explain why consistent percentages of the pollutant were exchanged to the surface despite the number and length of solute impulses changing if the same tests were undergone using unsteady conditions it would be expected that the solute exchange percentages would be more varied this would be most apparent when the pollutant injection patterns vary but would even be observed under identical injection quantities lengths and times between tests as there is no guarantee that the flow conditions will be the same upon the point of injection unsteady flow hydrographs based on real rainfall events could be downscaled and simulated within the experimental facility for a more complex scenario rubinato 2015 3 4 2 effects of manhole covers another characteristic of typical streets which was not included in this study was the presence of manhole covers assumed to have been removed during the worst case scenario of being lifted due to the flooding of the manhole itself the effects of different manhole covers on flow exchange into the sewer system from the surface without water entering the sewer inflow pipe and the surface velocity in the vicinity of the manhole has been investigated using the same physical model as this study by martins et al 2018 a similar method to this could be applied to the model with the manhole surcharging to investigate how the covers may influence the flow exchange to the surface and the percentage of the pollutant which is discharged in comparison to this study linking the velocity profiles within the quantity of flow exchange kesserwani et al 2015 furthermore having completed these initial tests and gained information regarding the influence of street profiles more complex scenarios involving manholes in series parallel should be considered for a more realistic replication of storm catchment basins 3 4 3 location of the manhole roughness and slopes within this experimental campaign the manhole was located at two different positions however it is essential to conduct further studies to verify the impact that various locations may have on the flow exchange between sewers and urban surfaces this is significant because different countries have dissimilar guidelines and sometimes environmental constraints determine the specific locations of the manholes furthermore manholes in series as previously mentioned could produce novel sets of data which could increase the complexity of this experimental model and test even further the performance of numerical models in assessing and predicting flow exchange between minor and major systems future work should investigate the effects of different lid and cover designs on the scale and nature of flow exchange surface to sewer interaction flows during super critical surface flows and or very low flow depths as well as the behaviours shown under more complex two phase air water flows which have not been investigated by the tests conducted here finally for this study the roughness used was 0 009 sm 1 3 however different values may have implications for relative head calculations at these interaction nodes future studies will include different rough surfaces that will be created from sand paper perforated sheet and woven wire mesh 3 4 4 limitations with availability of comparable data whilst this was a driving factor in undergoing this study due to the necessity of obtaining data it is also a hinderance to the validity of the findings though there is nothing to suggest that the results presented in this report are not an accurate representation of real flooding scenarios it is beneficial to be able to compare the results to similar studies so that comparisons can be made and inspiration for further research can be taken to broaden the available spectrum of knowledge as previously mentioned in this paper there is currently a scarcity of data within the field of quantifying flow exchange and solute exchange from sewer to surface during flooding events in urban areas one of the principal purposes of this study was to provide a better understanding of these situations delivering novel experimental datasets to be used for calibration and validation of numerical models by enhancing the accuracy of existing and new numerical models it will then be possible to inform local authorities to select design decisions for streets and sewer systems to minimise the risk of water and associated pollutant discharge when flooding occurs the results show that both the highest observed flow exchange and pollutant exchange rate occurred when the manhole was placed towards one side of the street if designs were to be purely based on these values then it would indicate that the sewer and manhole systems should be constructed at the centre of the street yet this would not take into consideration the practicality of the manhole location regarding factors such as the disruptions that would be caused by maintenance hence the relative parties would need to assess these different aspects when coming to a design decision 4 conclusions due to the predicted climate changes and the consequent increase in the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events there is a strong necessity to calibrate and validate numerical tools for a more accurate assessment of the hydraulic performance of drainage systems however due to the paucity of field data this study was conducted to replicate urban flooding scenarios to provide novel datasets including flow exchange between a sewer system and a hypothetical urban surface to enable the calibration and validation of numerical models as well as a better understanding of the relationship between overflow from manholes and the interference with multiple street profiles clear relationships between the street geometries and their corresponding flow exchange rates and discharge coefficients have been established the effects on energy losses the mass of soluble pollutant exchange caused by surface geometry and both the sewer and surface flow conditions were also determined after assessing the various contributing factors to the solute and flow exchange results as well as considering the different flow condition for the pipes and surface channel the key points to be taken from this study can be summarised as follows the qe and corresponding orifice equation values show similar positive linear relationships within the same range confirming the validation and application of this method to estimate the flow exchange during flooding conditions ci identified within the range 0 126 0 138 through comparison with previous studies rubinato et al 2017 the discharge coefficient decreases as the width of the street channel becomes narrower tests showed that the sewer to surface energy loss coefficient was unaffected by all street configurations tested suggesting that it is independent of the street layout all tested geometries displayed significant pollutant exchange from the sewer to the street in the range of 28 39 situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the mass of pollutants being exchanged to the surface the presence of parking spaces alone did not appear to affect the mass of pollutant exchanged the results found are significant as they have the potential to be used for calibrating existing and new numerical models this will enable the effects of other street geometries and conditions on the flow and pollutant exchange doing so will be important for enhancing the currently limited ability to quantify the exchanges occurring in existing sewer systems due to flood events the present study shows that situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the transport of pollutant to the surface therefore other experiments with different manhole locations as well as flow conditions higher froude numbers and more complex drain outlets that may disturb the flow pattern above the outlet are necessary municipalities could use the outcomes of this paper to either draw some new plans for the implementation of new drainage systems however the full experimental data sets provided by these experiments could help to validate detailed cfd and numerical models that are used to predict future scenarios and different flooding conditions as more research into quantifying flow and pollutant exchange becomes available better estimates will be made by relevant authorities as to how severe the impacts of individual flood events could have been to the environment this would be considered in addition to the physical damage to property and infrastructure which can already be determined giving a greater perspective of the overall impacts of flooding combining these two methods of assessment would aid in the decision making associated with design methods and the appropriate actions to take as a result of individual flood events credit

3817,due to the increased frequency and magnitude of urban flooding events there is a pressing need to improve the accuracy of numerical tools to better assess the hydraulic performance of new drainage systems nowadays such models are inherently challenging to verify due to the difficulty of acquiring reliable data during the flood event meaning that most models are calibrated using only an estimated measure of the extent of flooding to address this gap this study investigated flooding scenarios using an experimental scale facility of an urban street and manhole network delivering a novel data set in terms of the scale of the facility used several hydraulic conditions are investigated within a variety of street configurations incorporating parking slots cars on the road and various locations of the manhole within the street this enabled the quantification of flow exchange during hypothetical flood events for multiple cases as well as the characterisation of energy losses a crucial parameter that is often a source of uncertainty within numerical modelling tools furthermore the experimental system was equipped with an injection system to replicate the transport of pollutants during flooding events and this enabled the estimation of the exchange of soluble pollutants between the minor and major systems for each flooding scenario results obtained have confirmed the applicability of the orifice equation for the estimation of flow exchange between the two systems showing that i the discharge coefficients obtained 0 126 0 138 decrease as the width of the street channel becomes narrower ii the surface energy loss coefficient was unaffected by all street configurations tested iii all tested geometries displayed significant pollutant exchange from the sewer to the street in the range of 28 39 demonstrating that situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the mass of pollutants being exchanged to the surface and the presence of parking spaces alone did not appear to affect the mass of pollutant exchanged these results have provided a novel series of datasets including flowrates flow exchange energy losses and discharge coefficients that could be used to calibrate and validate numerical models and be utilised as a benchmark keywords sewer surface flow interactions urban flooding drainage systems head losses pollutant transport flow exchange 1 introduction flooding events in urban areas are known to have hugely detrimental effects on society by the resultant damage to infrastructure and properties as well as posing a threat to the wellbeing of the people residing in the area chang 2016 hou et al 2019 global warming has led to deviations from the earth s natural hydrological cycle as it has caused widespread melting of the earth s icecaps and increased the water vapour content in the atmosphere the rise in temperature has led to changes in precipitation patterns resulting in more intense rainfall which has increased the occurrence of flooding bates et al 2008 rubinato et al 2019 ostad ali askari et al 2019 for example it is predicted that there will be a 2 28 rise in the uk s winter precipitation by 2050 arnell et al 2015 furthermore the process of urbanisation makes new developments increasingly susceptible to flooding zevenbergen et al 2008 rubinato et al 2020a due to the increasing number of impermeable surfaces swan 2010 and as population growth continues the number of people at risk from urban flooding will only rise with an increase of 900 000 more people expected to be at risk in the uk by 2050 houston et al 2011 to aggravate the current situation many of the urban drainage systems used are not able to perform effectively with the flow capacity of storm sewers being limited as they were not originally designed to accommodate for the increasing levels of flow caused by urbanisation in comparison to the times when the drainage systems were built ofwat 2011 this is particularly prevalent in historic cities where combined sewer systems are still in use aronica and lanza 2005 exposure to contaminants is a risk to health that can be associated with urban floodwater depending on the source of the water de man et al 2013 shucksmith et al 2018 contaminants are released into wastewater due to agricultural processes and the waste that is produced by industries and the population deblonde et al 2011 this results in surface runoff and sewage overflow transporting waterborne pathogens into the surface water during flood events which is sourced from contaminants including faecal matter both from humans and animals schets et al 2008 among these contaminants are bacteria such as e coli marsalek and rochfort 2010 and antibiotic resistant bacteria which are found to have adverse health effects kim and aga 2007 arnone and perdeck walling 2007 rossi et al 2004 blanchoud et al 2007 sales ortells et al 2015 flood modelling tools are increasingly necessary for predicting possible hydraulic behaviours in the event of a flood and are essential for a variety of purposes such as sewer system re design damage assessment hazard maps and real time management applications from the data generated by flood modelling along with consideration of economic social and environmental factors gallegos et al 2009 preventative measures can be put in place to reduce the impacts of flooding accordingly djordjevic et al 2013 first introduced a dual drainage model that explained all the steps needed to assess flood hazard to date state of the art dual drainage models couple 1d sewer network flow models to 2d floodplain models lee et al 2013 using orifice and weir equations to estimate the flow exchange between the two systems as a function of relative hydraulic head in the sewer and the surface djordjević et al 2005 furthermore geometrical features such as pipe expansion contraction as well as hydraulic conditions supercritical or subcritical can alter the energy losses inside manholes and the effect of shallow water running over streets on surcharging manholes is also yet to be fully investigated mignot et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 therefore not being able to accurately represent sub surface flow exchange as well as energy losses can be considered as a potential source of uncertainty leading to errors and inaccurate predictions to calibrate and validate these tools modellers rely on footage obtained from cctv cameras during flood events as it is not safe for operators to record the events themselves in person during a flood tsubaki fujita and tsutsumi 2010 this makes it extremely challenging to provide databases for these models reducing the reliability of the results produced hammond et al 2013 to support the calibration of numerical

lopes et al 2015 martins et al 2014 or disconnected systems additionally other researchers bazin et al 2014 have also tested manholes in series however the scale of the model adopted and the consequent flows tested were limited to a narrow range of hydraulic conditions with reynolds number not always suitable for flooding conditions many parameters have been found to affect energy losses in manholes such as the depth ratio between up and down stream pipes hsu et al 1998 hydraulic conditions in different branches del giudice et al 2000 bed discordance within the manhole junction biron et al 1996 the presence of external pipes linking laterally to the manhole ramamurthy and zhu 1997 zhao et al 2006 however energy losses in manholes during sewer to surface surcharge events have only been previously investigated within the same facility used in this study for different hydraulic conditions and geometrical setup rubinato et al 2018b despite all the progress made within this field there remains a lack of validation of linking equations and a gap in the estimation of energy losses associated with surcharging manholes connected with various street profiles bruwier et al 2020 additionally water escaping from manholes during flooding events is often polluted and can contain sediments which are transported across urban areas and are a source of health risk although the presence of contaminants such as these in surface flows is well known naves et al 2020 there is still a lack of research into the extent of the exchange of pollutants during flood events between drainage networks and surface flows beg et al 2020 this includes the quantification of the exchange and its spreading despite some progress made in the field to optimise measuring techniques nichols and rubinato 2016 rojas arques et al 2018 nevertheless recent attempts have been made to include health risk assessment within urban flood models based on a prediction of wastewater concentration within surface flood waters mark et al 2018 current modelling approaches to determine how wastewater concentrations vary spatially and temporally relative to sewer surcharge events are based on the solution of the advection diffusion equation ade the ade was originally developed by taylor 1954 for turbulent pipe flow although it is now commonly applied within a range of water quality applications including surface waters and urban drainage networks to implement an accurate use of the 2d ade it is fundamental to understand both the local 2d velocity fields as well as the turbulent diffusion coefficients on top of this information which is needed nowadays there is a current lack of data on the flow exchange between sewer systems and urban surfaces this is important as the risk of infection can be dependent on a pathogen s concentration in the water hofstra 2011 gaining a better understanding of the potential quantities of these pollutants that are being transported into surface flows will aid in making informed decisions these decisions can be on things such as what further measures need to be taken in sewage treatment facilities as well as altering the designs of future sewage systems to mitigate against these risks mostafa et al 2016 the primary aim of this research is to quantify and provide a better understanding of flow exchange between sewers and urban surfaces to improve flood modelling nowadays it is important to demonstrate the theoretical capability of the current modelling types available via robust experimental validation as this provides confidence in future numerical studies that investigate surface to sewer exchange flow therefore we strongly believe that the results provided could be an essential source for numerical modellers across the world to be used to calibrate and validate numerical tools furthermore the applicability of the orifice equation was tested for these complex configurations and the tests conducted were analysed to study the effects that the geometry of a street can have on i the flow exchange estimation between a sewer and a hypothetical surface ii the energy losses inside a surcharging manhole during urban flooding events and iii the transport of soluble pollutants between the two systems 2 experimental model to address the gaps identified in various literature an experimental campaign was conducted using a physical model constructed and situated at the university of sheffield rubinato 2015 this model consists of a linked sewer surface system at a scale of 1 6 as shown in fig 1 and has previously been used to compare infoworks results to experimental data rubinato et al 2013 as well as to provide a better understanding of urban flooding phenomena beg et al 2020 rubinato et al 2017 martins et al 2018 rubinato et al 2018a b and martins et al 2017 lopes et al 2014 beg et al 2018 the model constructed with clear acrylic 75 mm internal diameter replicates a sewer pipe system which is connected to a hypothetical urban surface by a manhole 240 mm diameter the surface 6 6 m long and 1 180 m wide is also made of acrylic manning s n 0 009 sm 1 3 and it is inclined at a slope of 0 001 m m at full scale these dimensions would be an acceptable and common design for a uk urban drainage system defra 2011 tests were carried out on the 5 different street profile configurations shown in fig 2 and fig a1 in appendix a in order to determine how differing geometries affect the exchange of flow and pollutants between the sewer and the surface during flooding conditions the applicability of the orifice equation commonly used to quantify the flow exchange between the major and minor systems along with the corresponding range of discharge coefficients under steady state flow conditions was obtained via a series of tests that have been conducted using the experimental facility described the inflows to the pipe were varied to generate increasing surcharge into the street via a single manhole therefore simulating conditions where the hydraulic head in the sewer system was greater than the surface flow depth the flow within the system was measured using electromagnetic flow meters which were situated at the inlets of both the surface qinf and the sewer qins while there was another located at the sewer outlet qouts steady flows into the sewer and onto the surface were controlled using a butterfly flow control valve which was controlled by labview software along with the electromagnetic flowmeters and pressure sensors rubinato 2015 the accuracy of the flowmeters has been validated using volumetric discharge readings using the laboratory measurement tank flows were able to be set and entered the model via both the sewer inlet and the floodplain inlet 4 30 l s for all cases kept steady with the flow exchange occurring within the manhole structure replicating typical flooding scenarios to obtain temporally averaged values the data was collected over a period of 5 min after the flow had been allowed to stabilise 5 mins measurement rate 2 hz to simulate the transport of solutes rhodamine wt a neutrally buoyant fluorescent dye was injected into the inflowing sewer pipe shucksmith et al 2018 the concentration of the dye was measured by two cyclops 7f fluorimeters cyclops 1 and 2 in fig 1 which were located before and after the manhole respectively this was done to assess the solute exchange under different flow conditions for dissimilar street profiles on the hypothetical urban streets the dye was released into the system in pulses 15 s and was injected at a distance greater than 10d from the manhole d being the diameter of the sewer pipe to guarantee the full mixing of the pollutant within the water and provide an accurate measurement of its concentration before and after the manhole gotfredsen et al 2020 rutherford 1994 for this experiment dye of concentration 10 3 mg l was fed into a constant head tank see image below from where injections into the sewer pipe were controlled by a manual open close valve for each test conducted the measurements were continuous and the electrical sensor output was converted into a concentration using experimentally predetermined calibration equations beg et al 2020 pressure was measured at various location within the sewer and the surface by using gems pressure transducers fitted within the pipe invert and the bed of the hypothetical surface transducers were calibrated such that transducer output signal ma can be directly related to gauge pressure this step was completed using a pointer gauge with an averaged recorded error between measured values and defined calibration relationships psewer accuracy 0 72 mm within the water depth of 0 600 mm and psurface 0 109 mm within the water depth of 0 100 mm were located 350 mm and 460 mm respectively from the centre of the manhole fig a2 in appendix a this equipment was calibrated so that the electrical output signal ma could be directly related to gauge pressure rubinato et al 2017 all pressure transducers were linked to labview software such that the readings from the facility instrumentation were logged against time 2 1 method for analysis of results 2 1 1 estimation flow exchange to determine the quantity of the flow from the sewer that reaches the surface the mean

outflow of water from the sewer m3 s the instrument errors of the tests were calculated to determine the accuracy of the flow exchange results providing minimum and maximum values for the flow

exchange from the sewer to the surface when the total head in the sewer pipe is more than that of the surface flow rubinato et al 2017 the corresponding discharge can be calculated as follows 3 q e c

possible to estimate the values of the discharge coefficients that could be used for the calibration and validation of numerical tools for the experimental scenarios tested within this study thus the

maximum capacity therefore there is a flow exchange between the sewers and the floodplain according to rubinato et al 2018b if the pipe inflow meets steady flow conditions the energy balance equation

structure and entered the floodplain was measured by comparing the concentration in the sewer flow upstream of the manhole and that of the sewer pipe downstream of the manhole the reduction in

follows 12 r e ud v where r e reynolds number u velocity of fluid m s d diameter of pipe m v kinematic viscosity of water m2 s the reynolds values calculated were used to classify the turbulence of the pipe flow within the typical ranges laminar flow r e 2000 transitional flow 2000 r e 4000 and turbulent flow 4000 r e 2 1 6 froude number similarly froude numbers for the surface flows were estimated to determine whether the flow on the hypothetical streets were sub critical or super critical at different locations along the surface to do this the following equation was used 13 f r u g y where f r froude number u velocity of flow m s g acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s2 y flow depth m based on the froude numbers the surface flow could be classified as either sub critical f r 1 or supercritical f r 1 3 results and discussion this section presents the measured flow exchange and hydraulic head values for each test conducted within the experimental facility 3 1 calibration of linking equations the hydraulic conditions are displayed in table 1 and to enable the up scaling of the results obtained rubinato et al 2020b a series of non dimensional parameters resewer remanhole frsurface are included the calculated instrument error margins in table 1 show minimal potential error in the flow exchange values confirming the accuracy of the physical model and the equipment used the maximum inflow rate for the surface q1 was 4 50 l s while for the sewer q3 system it was 10 l s based on a geometrical scale of 1 to 6 this flow rate for the sewer system corresponds to approximately 65 l s in a full scale pipe system based on reynolds similitude 0 45 m the diameter of the real site manhole the velocities on the surface were quantified to be between 0 09 and 0 17 m s for the tests reported here with flow depths between 20 mm and 30 mm the surface flow froude numbers were in the range 0 179 0 356 and were hence sub critical based on the froude numbers similitude this corresponds to a real scaled velocity range of 0 225 and 0 425 m s in urban areas these values are within the range that might be expected for a shallow water running over an urban surface during a flood event and is similar to the range used by djordjevic et al 2013 for the physical modelling of gully performance during flood events table 2 shows the calculated mean discharge coefficients ci for each of the surface configurations tested and the 3 different overflow conditions the results show that as the sewer inflow increases the rate of flow exchange becomes greater for all 5 street geometries the greatest rate of flow exchange change was recorded when the manhole was situated closer to the side of the road at the highest sewer inflow fig 3 displays relationships between flow exchange qe and the orifice equation applied incorporating results existing in literature rubinato et al 2017 carried out using the same experimental model with a much wider and clear surface geometry width 4 m no street profiles replicated it can also be seen that the flow exchange orifice value relationships for each of the geometries fall within a similar range the graph shows a clear relationship between the width of the surface flow channel and the orifice value the linear regression lines of both sets of data have similar gradients while the results from rubinato et al 2017 have dissimilar orifice values within the same range of flow exchange the strength in the correlation of these values suggests that the linear regression model can be used to estimate the flow conditions for similar geometries the resultant discharge coefficients from rubinato et al 2017 were in the range of 0 160 0 174 while for a similar range of flow exchange used in this study the range found in these tests is 0 126 0 138 despite this the gradient of the linear regression model for the previous study is very similar to those derived from this experiment showing there is a clear relationship between the width of the surface and the resulting discharge coefficient considering the differences estimated as the width of the channel decreases the corresponding discharge coefficient decreases as shown in the discharge coefficient and orifice value section the flow exchange rate q e and the orifice value for each configuration show a linear relationship as the flow rate increases with the same trend being shown in the previous study by rubinato et al 2017 using a wider channel width 4 m instead of 1 180 m each of the linear regression models having an r2 value greater than 0 96 also supports the accuracy of the trendlines created this pattern suggests that the linear trendline equations for example the ones presented in table 3 for different street geometries could potentially be used to predict the flow exchange from the sewers based on the orifice value that is observed further testing at a wider range of flow exchange values would be required to confirm whether the relationship remains linear as the values increase decrease although the linear pattern shown by the results of rubinato et al 2017 across a much wider q e range indicates that the geometries from this study would likely show the same behaviours although each of the trendlines are specific to the individual configurations all 5 of the equations found in this study show very similar gradients and close x axis intercept values this indicates that the relationships shown in this study can be used to estimate the flow exchange of different street types of similar width given that they have the same sewer and manhole dimensions to do the same for streets with other sewer arrangements further experimentation such as this study would need to be carried out using physical models of these alternative sewer systems it would also be beneficial to do this so that the magnitude of the effects caused by the sewer arrangement can be compared too 3 1 1 variations in surface velocity at the position psurface upstream of the manhole the froude numbers of each geometry showed less variability and were all subcritical although the values obtained for geometry 4 were noticeably lower within the range of 0 179 0 195 while the other geometries showed similar numbers between 0 244 and 0 356 the cause of this is the velocity of the surface flow which is greatly reduced in comparison to configurations 1 3 in particular the velocity was calculated downstream of the manhole once the overflow and the surface flow were combined to make the most accurate representation of the surface velocity downstream of the manhole the reason for this being that the flow is restored to its normal sub critical conditions at this point and is no longer subject to the effects of the surcharge which causes a hydraulic jump in the region surrounding the manhole from the results obtained it can be noted that the presence of parking spaces cars on the road and the position of the manhole all have an effect in reducing the surface flow velocity the effects of parking spaces are demonstrated by the reduction of velocity from the rectangular street which was 0 204 0 209 m s to the range of 0 181 0 193 m s for both geometries 2 and 3 as the velocities are in the same range whether there is parking on one side or both sides of the street it suggests that this has minimal effect on the surface flow the presence of cars on the street appears to have the greatest effect on the velocity as there is a significant reduction to 0 134 0 146 m s between configurations 3 and 4 which had identical parking slots a reason for this could be the position of the manhole as it was positioned at the centre of the street for configuration 4 consequently the cars were located closer to the centreline of the manhole where measurement points were situated than the parking slots were having greater influence on the measurements when the manhole was positioned near the side of the street there was also an observed velocity reduction to the range of 0 15 0 161 m s although it was not as great of an increase as the one seen for geometry 4 as the number and size of the parking slots on either side was altered from that of configuration 4 they could have caused additional affects to the velocity however to determine if this was true and to confirm that cars being present on the street has a greater effect on the velocity additional tests would be required this could be done by placing the manhole on one side with identical parking arrangements to directly compare them or to assess different sizes numbers and arrangements of parking slots when the manhole is central to first identify how strong their influence is the froude numbers calculated downstream from the manhole along the surface show that the most significant difference between the froude numbers of each geometry occurs at the position that is 510 mm from the centre point of the manhole at this position the froude numbers for geometries 1 4 are supercritical whereas geometry 5 provides sub critical values this shows a clear influence from the position of the manhole on the criticality of the surface flow likely due to the interaction between the flow in proximity of the surcharging manhole with the curb of the model 3 2 characterisation of energy losses fig 4 displays the experimentally determined hydraulic heads losses h1 h3 h1 h2 and δh plotted against sewer inflow velocity head u1 2 2g components for the tests conducted in surcharging conditions it is possible to observe a clear linear relationship between head loss and velocity head of the sewer inflow by considering the slope of the regression lines fitted to the experimental data head loss coefficients k were determined these coefficients and their confidence limits r2 0 986 for all the cases are given in table 4 the results obtained are in line with what is available in literature rubinato et al 2018a b confirming that for all the cases the energy loss coefficient linked with the flow exchange k12 is higher than the energy loss coefficient associated with the flow through the sewer k13 demonstrating that higher energy losses are generated inside the manhole during surcharging conditions furthermore it is important to highlight that the trends observed are very similar for all the configurations tested this means that parking slots and the presence of cars are actually providing a negligible effect on the energy losses linked with the overflow inside the manhole however it is essential to note that the configuration which creates the more substantial change is configuration 5 with parking on both sides and the manhole on one side where k12 was calculated to be 1 296 minimum value obtained 3 3 quantification of pollutant exchange for each of the 5 geometries 6 7 tests took place at 3 different rates of flow exchange the number length and time of pollutant injections varied to investigate the effects this had on the percentage of the pollutant that is exchanged to the surface tables 5 9 in appendix b present the percentage of the pollutant entering the sewer inflow pipe that was exchanged to the surface flow on each of the surface geometries at varying flow exchange rates the data is summarised in fig 5 with exception to the rectangular street geometry all the other configurations show a linear increase in the percentage of the pollutant exchanged as the flow exchange becomes larger but it is also important to acknowledge that for cars parking on one side parking on one side and parking manhole on one side there may be a possibility of an exponential trend this requires verification needing higher concentrations of pollutant to be injected and additional hydraulic conditions to be tested the exchange values for configuration 5 and the percentage pollutant exchanged at the highest flow exchange rate for configuration 4 are significantly larger than the results shown from the other tests indicating that there is a link between the presence of obstructions around the manhole and the quantity of pollutant that is exchanged the variations in the number time and length of the pollutant injection pulses did not appear to affect the percentage of pollutant present in the sewer that was transported to the surface as there are no distinct variations between the percentages calculated under different pulse conditions this is likely due to the flow conditions being steady state meaning there were no variations in the flow conditions between pulse injections the pollutant exchange results show that for all the surface geometries a relatively large proportion of the pollutant mass was transported to the surface 28 39 fig 5 being able to quantify the percentage of pollutant reaching the surface is an important step in assessing the level of risk associated with the concentration of individual pollutants present in real sewer systems using data such as this samples can be taken of a sewer s effluent for testing so to measure the concentration of the pollutants found in the samples combining the pollutant concentrations the percentage of the pollutant discharge and the flow exchange data the mass of individual pollutants reaching the surface can be estimated so that their levels can be monitored as to whether they exceed acceptable levels doing so will help indicate whether actions need to be taken to treat the contamination the results of the various soluble pollutant tests identify that a significantly greater percentage of the pollutant was exchanged to the surface when the manhole was located closer to the edge of the model street one reason for this could be due to the decreased surface velocity compared to configurations 1 3 where there similarly are not any obstructions on the road the likely cause of the decreased flow velocity is the frictional forces acting on the water at the edge of the channel which for configuration 5 is far closer to the centreline of the manhole where the velocity was measured another noticeable value in the results is that the percentage of pollutant exchanged increased largely for configuration 4 when the flow exchange value reached 0 003248 m3 s a possible reason for this is the presence of cars on the street however this theory is not supported when the flow exchange for configuration 4 is lower as it produced similar percentages of the pollutant being exchanged as geometries 1 3 within that flow range the key difference shown is the substantial decrease in surface velocity for geometries 4 and 5 which are within the range of 0 134 0 161 m s from those shown for geometries 1 3 between 0 181 and 0 209 m s the decrease in surface velocity could allow more flow exchange between surface and manhole creating hydraulic conditions that could lead to an expansion of the hydraulic jump region when the flow exits the manhole and passes from subcritical to supercritical geometries 2 5 all show a continuing increase in pollutant exchange as the flow exchange rate increases the rectangular street is the one exception to this as when qe increases from 0 003044 to 0 003221 m3 s the percentage of pollutant exchanged decreases from 32 54 to 32 40 although this is not a large decrease it is a deviation from the patterns shown by other surface arrangements which is noteworthy the key difference in the results for geometry 1 is that its surface velocity is by far the highest however there is a slight decrease in velocity between the 2 highest exchange rates corresponding with the pollutant exchange decrease to determine whether the rectangular street would continue to deviate from the patterns displayed by the other geometries further tests at higher flow exchange rates would need to be carried out additionally the flows observed in the sewer pipes and manhole during the experimental tests showed high turbulence meaning that the movement of particles within the flow was very erratic the turbulence shown in the sewer network is likely a contributing factor to the slight variation in pollutant exchange percentages between tests carried out at the same inflow and pollutant injection times numbers despite the flow conditions being similar the random nature of the particle movement could have affected the quantity of the pollutant that left the pipe flow and entered the manhole the same principal can be applied within the manhole structure as the turbulence may have affected the quantity that was discharged to the surface and the quantity retained in the manhole that later re entered the sewer the effect of the turbulence would have been lesser in the manhole as the reynolds numbers for the manhole were much lower than those of the sewer pipes finally the similarities in the percentages exchanged for geometries 1 3 suggest that the presence of parking spaces had no noticeable effect on pollutant exchange to the surface when the manhole was positioned at the centre of the street this is despite the parking spaces causing a reduction in the surface flow velocity 3 4 limitations and suggested future research 3 4 1 unsteady flow states all tests analysed in this study were carried out under steady state flow conditions meaning the flow rates entering the sewer and the manhole remained constant these are idealised conditions as in reality it is unlikely that the flow in the sewer or on the surface for that matter will remain constant due to variance in factors such as rain intensity and sudden surges of water into the system the use of steady conditions is beneficial for observing the effects of the surface geometry more clearly both regarding flow exchange and pollutant exchange as there are fewer contributing variables now that the preliminary effects of the manhole location parking slots and presence of cars are known unsteady state conditions will be implemented to better imitate real scenarios that would occur in the event of a flood moreover the transport of pollutants in between the surface and sewer systems are particularly affected by the surrounding soil and aquifer strata ignoring the effects of aquifers and other urban underground infrastructure partly explains the linear increasing trend of pollutant exchange and the hypothetical exchange rate of 28 39 therefore the experimental model will be adjusted to account for the complex nature of dynamic hydraulic processes among surface subsurface urban infrastructure hydrogeology groundwater systems these steady state flow conditions explain why consistent percentages of the pollutant were exchanged to the surface despite the number and length of solute impulses changing if the same tests were undergone using unsteady conditions it would be expected that the solute exchange percentages would be more varied this would be most apparent when the pollutant injection patterns vary but would even be observed under identical injection quantities lengths and times between tests as there is no guarantee that the flow conditions will be the same upon the point of injection unsteady flow hydrographs based on real rainfall events could be downscaled and simulated within the experimental facility for a more complex scenario rubinato 2015 3 4 2 effects of manhole covers another characteristic of typical streets which was not included in this study was the presence of manhole covers assumed to have been removed during the worst case scenario of being lifted due to the flooding of the manhole itself the effects of different manhole covers on flow exchange into the sewer system from the surface without water entering the sewer inflow pipe and the surface velocity in the vicinity of the manhole has been investigated using the same physical model as this study by martins et al 2018 a similar method to this could be applied to the model with the manhole surcharging to investigate how the covers may influence the flow exchange to the surface and the percentage of the pollutant which is discharged in comparison to this study linking the velocity profiles within the quantity of flow exchange kesserwani et al 2015 furthermore having completed these initial tests and gained information regarding the influence of street profiles more complex scenarios involving manholes in series parallel should be considered for a more realistic replication of storm catchment basins 3 4 3 location of the manhole roughness and slopes within this experimental campaign the manhole was located at two different positions however it is essential to conduct further studies to verify the impact that various locations may have on the flow exchange between sewers and urban surfaces this is significant because different countries have dissimilar guidelines and sometimes environmental constraints determine the specific locations of the manholes furthermore manholes in series as previously mentioned could produce novel sets of data which could increase the complexity of this experimental model and test even further the performance of numerical models in assessing and predicting flow exchange between minor and major systems future work should investigate the effects of different lid and cover designs on the scale and nature of flow exchange surface to sewer interaction flows during super critical surface flows and or very low flow depths as well as the behaviours shown under more complex two phase air water flows which have not been investigated by the tests conducted here finally for this study the roughness used was 0 009 sm 1 3 however different values may have implications for relative head calculations at these interaction nodes future studies will include different rough surfaces that will be created from sand paper perforated sheet and woven wire mesh 3 4 4 limitations with availability of comparable data whilst this was a driving factor in undergoing this study due to the necessity of obtaining data it is also a hinderance to the validity of the findings though there is nothing to suggest that the results presented in this report are not an accurate representation of real flooding scenarios it is beneficial to be able to compare the results to similar studies so that comparisons can be made and inspiration for further research can be taken to broaden the available spectrum of knowledge as previously mentioned in this paper there is currently a scarcity of data within the field of quantifying flow exchange and solute exchange from sewer to surface during flooding events in urban areas one of the principal purposes of this study was to provide a better understanding of these situations delivering novel experimental datasets to be used for calibration and validation of numerical models by enhancing the accuracy of existing and new numerical models it will then be possible to inform local authorities to select design decisions for streets and sewer systems to minimise the risk of water and associated pollutant discharge when flooding occurs the results show that both the highest observed flow exchange and pollutant exchange rate occurred when the manhole was placed towards one side of the street if designs were to be purely based on these values then it would indicate that the sewer and manhole systems should be constructed at the centre of the street yet this would not take into consideration the practicality of the manhole location regarding factors such as the disruptions that would be caused by maintenance hence the relative parties would need to assess these different aspects when coming to a design decision 4 conclusions due to the predicted climate changes and the consequent increase in the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events there is a strong necessity to calibrate and validate numerical tools for a more accurate assessment of the hydraulic performance of drainage systems however due to the paucity of field data this study was conducted to replicate urban flooding scenarios to provide novel datasets including flow exchange between a sewer system and a hypothetical urban surface to enable the calibration and validation of numerical models as well as a better understanding of the relationship between overflow from manholes and the interference with multiple street profiles clear relationships between the street geometries and their corresponding flow exchange rates and discharge coefficients have been established the effects on energy losses the mass of soluble pollutant exchange caused by surface geometry and both the sewer and surface flow conditions were also determined after assessing the various contributing factors to the solute and flow exchange results as well as considering the different flow condition for the pipes and surface channel the key points to be taken from this study can be summarised as follows the qe and corresponding orifice equation values show similar positive linear relationships within the same range confirming the validation and application of this method to estimate the flow exchange during flooding conditions ci identified within the range 0 126 0 138 through comparison with previous studies rubinato et al 2017 the discharge coefficient decreases as the width of the street channel becomes narrower tests showed that the sewer to surface energy loss coefficient was unaffected by all street configurations tested suggesting that it is independent of the street layout all tested geometries displayed significant pollutant exchange from the sewer to the street in the range of 28 39 situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the mass of pollutants being exchanged to the surface the presence of parking spaces alone did not appear to affect the mass of pollutant exchanged the results found are significant as they have the potential to be used for calibrating existing and new numerical models this will enable the effects of other street geometries and conditions on the flow and pollutant exchange doing so will be important for enhancing the currently limited ability to quantify the exchanges occurring in existing sewer systems due to flood events the present study shows that situating the manhole closer to the edge of the street increased the transport of pollutant to the surface therefore other experiments with different manhole locations as well as flow conditions higher froude numbers and more complex drain outlets that may disturb the flow pattern above the outlet are necessary municipalities could use the outcomes of this paper to either draw some new plans for the implementation of new drainage systems however the full experimental data sets provided by these experiments could help to validate detailed cfd and numerical models that are used to predict future scenarios and different flooding conditions as more research into quantifying flow and pollutant exchange becomes available better estimates will be made by relevant authorities as to how severe the impacts of individual flood events could have been to the environment this would be considered in addition to the physical damage to property and infrastructure which can already be determined giving a greater perspective of the overall impacts of flooding combining these two methods of assessment would aid in the decision making associated with design methods and the appropriate actions to take as a result of individual flood events credit

3818,this paper analyses a fractional kinematic wave equation fkwe for overland flow and evaluates its solutions for applications using data from overland flow flumes with simulated rainfall in the laboratory solutions of fkwe presented have been derived for large time or when the laplace transform variable s 0 which is one of the most important situations for overland flow the solutions include expressions for the depth velocity and unit discharge of overland flow fitting the approximate solution for the depth of overland flow to the data yields the values of the order of space fractional derivatives ρ which is around ρ 1 5 it is found that ρ increases with the slope gradient and the rainfall intensity the approximate order of ρ 1 5 which is about the average of order 1 for the advection equation and 2 for the diffusion equation implies that diffusive mechanisms manifest in the overland flow the findings mean that either an fkwe is used or a diffusion term is needed to account for dynamic forces in overland flow as the fkwe captures more physical mechanisms keywords fractional kinematic wave equation overland flow analytical solutions kinematic and dynamic forces laboratory flow experiments 1 introduction overland flow is one major process which causes direct soil erosion leading to land degradation the indirect impacts of overland flow on animals and the natural environment are less obvious but they have serious consequences which include soil and groundwater pollution leading to the contamination of the food chains this paper aims to improve mathematical models of overland flow so that soil erosion and other runoff related processes can be better understood overland flow can be either described by the full mathematical models in hydraulics namely the saint venant equations or their simplified forms such as the kinematic wave equation eagleson 1970 chow et al 1988 the saint venant equations are a set of equations which include the continuity equation with terms accounting for dynamic diffusion and kinematic waves and a momentum equation simpler forms of the saint venant equations could be a term or terms in the saint venant equations which account for both dynamic and kinematic waves or the kinematic wave alone chow et al 1988 p 281 the kinematics is only concerned with the motion of fluids exclusive of the mass and forces while dynamics include both mass and forces for flow of small depths such as overland flow the kinematic wave equation kwe due to lighthill and whitham 1955 has been widely used for more than 60 years in the kwe the simplified continuity equation in the conservation form to distinguish it from the non conservation form for overland flow is considered only chow et al 1988 p 281 with this approach the motion of overland flow is interpreted as the result of the gravity force due to the existence of the slope gradient in addition to these integer based models such as the saint venant equations and kinematic wave equation the applications of fractional calculus based methods in hydraulics in recent decades particularly fractional partial differential equations fpdes are becoming increasingly popular in modelling various environmental transport processes such as flow processes in hydraulics hydrology and hydrodynamics compte 1997 schumer et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2017a 2017b merchado et al 2012 su 2021 these extensive findings appeared in the literature suggest that mathematical models based on fractional calculus can capture more information about material transport in the environment it is expected that the new fkwe for overland flow could also better capture new information about the transport processes and provide a more detailed insight into the physical and mathematical relationships of the flow fractional models for overland flow have been presented by other researchers kavvas and ercan 2015 2017 kavvas et al 2021 what distinguishes the present fkwe from these published models are the detailed analytical solutions here which show the functional relationships between the depth also the velocity and discharge of overland flow and the order of fractional derivatives and other parameters the objective of this paper is to analyse a fractional kinematic wave equation fkwe for overland flow which is a special form of the fpde and to evaluate and analyse the order of the fkwe and other parameters using data from flow flumes in simulated laboratory experiments 2 anomalous overland flow the fractional kinetic wave equation the kwe lighthill and whitham 1955 is the conservation form of the continuity equation and takes the following form eagleson 1970 p 332 chow et al 1988 p 281 for the cross sectional area of the flow a w h with h being the depth of runoff and w the constant width 1 h t q x r t i t where q is the volumetric discharge of runoff per unit width or unit discharge with the dimension of l 2 t 1 or q q w where q is the volumetric discharge with dimensions of l 3 t 1 and w the width of the flow r t is the effective rainfall intensity i t is the infiltration rate x is the slope length and t is time the velocity of overland flow v is the ratio of the volumetric discharge and the cross sectional area of the flow a i e v q a empirical formulae are often used for relating the velocity with other parameters and one such formula is the manning equation the manning equation for the velocity of turbulent flow with the si units is written as chow et al 1988 eq 2 5 6 2 v s f 1 2 r 2 3 n where n is the manning roughness coefficient and r is the hydraulic radius defined as 3 r a p where p is the wetted perimeter of the flow which is that portion of the perimeter of the cross section where there is direct contact between the flow and the solid boundary daugherty et al 1989 p 206 on a planar surface the wetted perimeter is simply the width of the cross section so that the hydraulic radius is r w h w h with the dimensionless friction slope s f the dimension of n is t l 1 3 the momentum equation relating the unit volumetric discharge and the depth of runoff is more generally written as an empirical formula eagleson 1970 emmett 1970 4 q c h m where c is a coefficient and m is a parameter depending on flow patterns clearly eq 4 is not only an empirical formula its parameters c and m also represent flow patterns and accommodate the units or dimensions the values of m in the kinematic wave model vary for two types of flow m 3 for laminar overland flow and m 5 3 for turbulent overland flow eagleson 1970 p 331 349 however the earlier observations from natural surfaces suggested that m 2 horton 1938 which has been confirmed by others also see eagleson 1970 p 332 for overland flow the kwe has been successfully used to approximate the full saint venant flow equations since lighthill and whitham 1955 in the application of the kwe further simplicity can be made for flow with small depths and in such cases the friction slope for overland flow s f can be set to equal to the slope gradient of the land surface s 0 cos λ s where λ s is the angle of the slope the friction slope for overland flow s f is the energy gradient given by h f l where h f is the difference in the depth of the flow along the flow length l chow et al 1988 p 33 34 with the discharge of overland flow on a planar surface the cross sectional area of the flow is a w h and the unit discharge is q v h with the unit width in eq 4 and r h the manning equation for velocity v with s f s 0 can be written as 5 v s 0 1 2 n h m 1 the unit discharge in eq 4 is then written as 6 q s 0 1 2 n h m which relates the coefficient c in eq 4 with the friction slope and roughness c s 0 1 2 n with the friction slope s 0 dimensionless in eq 6 the dimension of n is t l m 2 which for three cases discussed earlier spans n t l 1 3 for m 5 3 n t for m 2 and n t l for m 3 in order to accommodate the usual dimensions of the discharge per unit width q l 2 t 1 the kinematic wave model of overland flow on a planar slope in eq 1 can now be written as 7 h t s 0 1 2 n h m x r t i t because eq 7 is the conservation form of the continuity equation for a planar slope the terms on the right hand side represent the net change in the flow with both the input r t and output i t spatially uniform in addition to eq 7 which has been widely used since lighthill and whitham 1955 presented it nearly 70 years ago several versions of fractional formulations have also been reported as applications of fractional calculus models in hydraulics of overland flow and open channel flow the examples of the fractional counterpart of eq 7 for overland flow include time and space fractional kinematic wave equations fkwes by kavvas and ercan 2015 2017 and by kavvas et al 2021 the tempered kwe by zhang et al 2016 and space fkwe by su 2021 eq 8 9 in addition to these simpler fractional models other fractional forms of the manning equation were also reported earlier fuentes et al 1996 merchado et al 2012 but those implicit functional relationships are difficult to apply in practice in this paper we analyse the fractional version of eq 7 by su 2021 with a new roughness n f replacing the roughness n in the conventional kinematic wave equation the fkwe is written as 8 h t s 0 1 2 n f ρ h m x ρ r t i t where ρ is the order of fractional derivatives with the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 tracing back to the empirical manning equation and the momentum equation in eq 6 a different dimension enters eq 8 following the introduction of fractional derivatives in eq 7 with the dimensionless friction slope s 0 s f the dimension of n is t l m 2 in the fractional version in eq 8 either the new roughness parameter n f embraces the newly introduced dimensions or another parameter is added kilbas et al 2006 p 464 so that the rest of the dimensions in eq 8 remain unchanged in the fkwe without introducing any new parameter in eq 8 and with the dimensionless slope s 0 the dimension of n f is now t l m ρ 1 which for ρ 1 becomes t l m 2 and is consistent with the dimensions of n in eqs 6 and 7 in various approximate solutions of eq 8 however different dimensions may be needed when the approximations in different terms change the definitions of the parameters in eq 8 a constant or a parameter in a mathematical model is often used to reconcile and justify the units for the variables such as the diffusivity in the classic diffusion equation when the fractional model is used for runoff the new roughness coefficient n f also plays the role in maintaining the dimensions of other variables such as the depth of water the distance and time equation 8 is a nonlinear fpde and is specifically a fractional advection equation the fkwe with a spatial fractional derivative ρ offers more flexibility on the spatial variability of the discharge or discharge per unit width the unit discharge the fractional derivatives in fpdes can be either time fractional or space fractional alone or both time and space fractional or mixed fractional derivatives explanations of the space and time fractional derivatives can be found in the works of morales casique et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 561 562 and benson et al 2013 479 the fkwe can be derived from at least three approaches 1 the first approach is simply the use of a generalised flux in a fractional form to replace eq 6 2 the second approach is the mass balance approach kavvas and ercan 2015 and 3 the third approach to derive it is based on the continuous time random walk ctrw theory by neglecting the diffusion and considering advection only in the mass balance approach the fkwe can be derived when the change in mass flux throughout the incremental channel section is a fractional derivative as a result of the generalised taylor series approximation to the planar overland flow similar to the applications to flow and transport in porous media the fractional approach to overland flow also explains the nonlocality property of transport processes in the flow process the nonlocality explains that the concentrations of a tracer depth of flow or any other quantities at previous times and or upstream locations contribute to the variation of the concentration or fluid velocity at the point of observation due to an uncertain velocity field the spatial nonlocality means that the change in the concentration or depth of flow at the point of observation depends on its upstream value while the temporal nonlocality implies that the change in the concentration or depth of flow at the point of observation depends on the prior concentration loading benson et al 2013 or a change in the depth of flow the nonlocality implies scale dependence and history dependence which can be described by non linear integer pdes su 2021 3 solutions of the fractional kinetic wave models for overland flow the analytical solutions of eq 8 can be derived in different forms in this section the derivation of an analytical solution is detailed its asymptotic solution expressed as a power function and approximate solutions are also presented 3 1 detailed solutions of the fractional kinematic wave model eq 8 the solutions of eq 8 can be derived by different methods subject to different initial condition ic and boundary conditions bc here we use the following ic and bcs of the first kind for flow on a slope 9 h x t f x t 0 x 0 10 h x t h 0 t 0 x 0 and 11 h x t h l t 0 x l which state that the initial water profile on the slope is f x the depths of water on the upper and lower boundaries are respectively h 0 and h l these ic and bcs apply to situations when there is an initial depth of water on the slope f x before new runoff develops from the rainfall excess when the condition r t i t 0 is met this situation can be further simplified for the case of f x 0 when the initial surface is dry with the following transform kevorkian 1990 cetinkaya and demir 2020 12 h x t h x t x l h 0 h l h 0 the ic and bcs in eqs 9 10 and 11 can be transformed to the following homogeneous conditions 13 h x t f x x l h 0 h l h 0 t 0 x 0 14 h x t 0 t 0 x 0 and 15 h x t 0 t 0 x l in our study the simpler conditions are f x 0 h 0 0 and h l 0 and the transformed ic and bcs are then simplified as 16 h x t 0 t 0 x 0 17 h 0 t 0 h l t 0 t 0 and once the solution of h x t is known then eq 12 yields the solution in terms of the original variable 18 h x h x t x l h l the equation for infiltration into a soil with mobile and immobile zones su 2012 was used in the previous analysis su 2021 as an alternative model for infiltration we use the following rate of infiltration i t based on the earlier works by su 2014 2021 eq 6 60 19 i t a s β s 2 λ 1 s t β 2 λ 1 1 where a s is the final infiltration rate β is the order of time fractional derivatives λ is the order of space fractional derivatives t is time and s is the sorptivity given by 20 s 2 λ 1 θ s θ i 2 λ d 0 2 γ 1 β γ 2 λ k 0 cos λ s 1 2 λ 1 with γ 1 β and γ 2 λ being gamma functions θ s and θ i the saturated and initial water ratios k 0 the hydraulic conductivity d 0 the diffusivity and cos λ s s 0 is the slope with the λ s as the angle of the slope in addition to eq 19 other simpler models of infiltration can also be used such as when λ 2 in eq 19 or other time fractional equations of infiltration su 2010 2014 2021 with i t given by eq 19 the laplace transform of eq 8 and its initial condition ic and boundary conditions bcs in eqs 16 17 and 18 yields 21 s 0 1 2 n f d ρ d x ρ h m x s s h x s r s s a s s β 2 λ 1 s γ β 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 where γ β 2 λ 1 is the gamma function of β 2 λ 1 and s is the laplace transform variable r s is the laplace transformation of r t and the bcs are now transformed to 22 h x s 0 x 0 23 h x s 0 x l it has been shown that eq 21 can be solved subject to the conditions in eqs 22 and 23 kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1996 with the transformation 24 g x s h m x s eq 21 is written as 25 d ρ g d x ρ f g x where 26 f g x n s 0 1 2 r s s a s s β 2 λ 1 s γ β 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 s g 1 m x and the bcs becomes 27 g 0 x 0 28 g 0 x l the solution of eq 25 with the original variable in eq 24 is given as delbosco and rodino 1996 podlubny 1999 kilbas and marzan 2005 29 h m x s 1 γ ρ 0 x f g x x τ 1 ρ d τ the first part of f g x in eq 26 can be integrated gradshteyn and ryzhik 2007 eq 3 383 1 p 347 resulting in the solution as a nonlinear volterra equation of the second kind 30 h m x s b x ρ n f s γ ρ s 0 1 2 0 x h x s x ξ 1 ρ d ξ where 31 b γ ρ n f γ ρ 1 s 0 1 2 s r s a s β s γ β 2 λ 1 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 1 equation 30 is nonlinear and can be solved only analytically in limited cases which include exact solutions and asymptotic solutions gorenflo and kilbas 1995 kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1999 with exact solutions known for limited cases only kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1996 here we are interested in an exact solution of eq 30 in the following form given by kilbas et al 1995 and kilbas and saigo 1996 32 h x s ξ x β ξ x ρ m with the relationship m β ρ or β ρ m and ξ appears in the following algebraic equation kilbas et al 1995 eq 6 8 33 ξ m a ξ b 0 with 34 a n f s s 0 1 2 the solution in eq 32 is in the laplace domain and for practical applications it is desirable to be inverted to the time domain with the aid of the inverse laplace transform 3 2 solutions of the fractional kinematic wave model with a parameter determined from field data 3 2 1 solutions for m 2 in eq 32 as briefly overviewed in section 2 the value of m in the kinematic wave model vary in theory for two types of flow with m 3 for laminar overland flow and m 5 3 for turbulent overland flow eagleson 1970 however for natural land surfaces where flow patterns vary depending on the micro topographies on the flow paths the actual value of m is less likely to be precisely either 3 or 5 3 the earlier observations by horton 1938 suggested that m 2 which has been confirmed by others eagleson 1970 here with m 2 two solutions of eq 33 ξ 1 and ξ 2 can be found as 35 ξ 1 2 a a 2 4 b 1 2 2 for which the value of δ a 2 4 b determines three possible types of the two solutions 1 δ 0 means that the solutions ξ 1 and ξ 2 are real and unequal 2 δ 0 yields the two real and equal solutions ξ 1 ξ 2 and 3 δ 0 has two complex conjugate solutions in this section we use the first positive solution in eq 34 and with m 2 eq 32 is expressed as 36 h x s 1 2 a a 2 4 b 1 2 x ρ 2 equation 36 is in the laplace domain which looks simple but it is not easy to solve explicitly when the parameters a and b are functions it seems that the solution in the laplace domain in eq 46 can only be derived for large time or when s 0 which in fact is one of the most important situations for overland flow for large time or s 0 which yields a 0 then eq 36 with the first positive root can be approached by 37 h x s b 1 2 x ρ 2 equation 37 with b from eq 31 for a constant rainfall intensity r 0 can be written as 38 h x s b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 1 2 s 1 2 1 ω s α 1 2 x ρ 2 where b ρ 1 is the beta function given as 39 b ρ 1 γ ρ γ ρ 1 40 α β 2 λ 1 1 and 41 ω β s γ β 2 λ 1 2 λ 1 r 0 a s with γ ρ γ ρ 1 and γ β 2 λ 1 being the gamma functions the inverse laplace transform of eq 38 yields the solution of eq 8 kilbas et al 2004 haubold et al 2011 42 h x t b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 1 2 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α x ρ 2 where 43 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α t 1 2 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α is the generalised prabhakar function gpf the prabhakar function 1971 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α is written as prabhakar 1971 kilbas et al 2004 44 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α k 0 1 2 k k ω t α k γ α k 1 2 where the pochhammer symbol is 1 2 k 45 1 2 k γ k 1 2 γ 1 2 k 0 1 2 the gamma function with a negative argument γ 1 2 in eq 45 can be alternatively expressed via the reflection function abramowitz and stegun 1965 p 256 as γ 1 2 2 γ 1 2 2 π 1 2 with π 3 14 then the pochhammer symbol can be written as 46 1 2 k γ k 1 2 2 π 1 2 k 0 1 2 and eq 44 is now written as 47 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α k 0 γ k 1 2 2 π 1 2 γ k 1 ω t α k γ α k 1 2 with eq 38 the solution in eq 42 can now be written in an expanded form 48 h x t b ρ 1 r

given by mainardi and garrappa 2015 51 e α 1 2 1 2 ω t α t α 1 2 γ α 1 2 t as α 1 2 0 the asymptotic solution is monotonically decreasing over time and more properties of the gpf can be found in garra and garrappa 2018 with eq 51 the asymptotic solution for the depth of overland flow as t is derived from eq 39 52 h x t 1 γ α 1 2 b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 α 1 2 the velocity and discharges for turbulent flow with m 5 3 eagleson 1970 are given respectively by substitution of eq 52 in eqs 5 and 6 with n f n as 53 v x t s 0 n f 2 1 3 1 γ α 1 2 b ρ 1 r 0 a s x ρ t 1 α 1 2 2 3 and 54 q x t s

in the gpf 55 h x t b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 with π 3 14 and ω is given by eq 41 the solution with the original variable through eq 18 is 56 h x h l l x b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 x ρ 2 and the velocity given by eq 5 can now be expressed as follows by incorporating eq 56 with n f n and m 2 57 v s 0 1 2 n f h l l x b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 x ρ 2 and the approximate unit discharge is given by combining eqs 6 and 56 with n f n and m 2 58 q x t s 0 1 2 n f h l l x b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 x ρ 2 2 in the above analysis the unit discharge q is related to the total discharge q through the width of flow by q w q as the order of magnitude for runoff on hillslopes compared to that of the slope is about 3 and higher i e h l is usually of the order of millimetres while l is metres or larger the term h l l x 0 particularly for small values of x then eq 55 is a good approximation to eq 56 and the velocity in eq 57 and discharge eq 58 derived from eq 56 can also be simplified by neglecting the term h l l x 3 2 4 special cases when the soil is saturated s 0 and ω 0 eq 55 then simplifies as 59 h x t b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 or written as 60 h x t c 1 x ρ t 1 2 where 61 c 1 b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 1 2 a special case of eq 59 is where there is no infiltration with a s 0 or negligible infiltration then the following expression results 62 h x t b ρ 1 n f r 0 x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 which for ρ 1 eq 62 becomes 63 h x t n f r 0 x s 0 1 2 t 1 2 these special cases can also apply to eqs 57 and 58 for the velocity and discharge respectively the depth of overland flow in eq 56 and its simplifications monotonically decrease with time and increase with the distance the length dimension of h in l should be retained which requires that other traditional dimensions be changed to accommodate the fractional dimensions in time and space variables the option presented here is that the changes in the dimensions are incorporated in the manning roughness coefficient so that other dimensions remain the same as in the classic models 4 verification of the model with data 4 1 laboratory flume setup and experiments the data used in this study were published previously and some details on the experimental procedures can be found in zhang et al 2014 2015 and zhang and wang 2017 for the convenience of the readers a brief description of the facilities used for the data collection and the data are provided here the data on overland flow were collected using runoff flumes with simulated rainfall in a laboratory the loessian loamy soil was used in the flumes and the observations were made at five locations of the slope namely at the slope lengths of 0 4 m 0 8 m 1 2 m 1 6 m and 2 m the flumes were adjusted to five slope gradients 18 27 36 47 and 58 and the experiments used five rainfall intensities 48 mm h 1 62 4 mm h 1 102 mm h 1 149 mm h 1 and 170 mm h 1 with different slope gradients and rainfall intensities a total of 125 combinations observations was designed and each combination had two replicates yielding a data set of 250 observations the loessian loamy soil had a composition of 38 7 sand 45 6 silt 15 7 clay and 0 5 organic matter which was collected from the 0 25 cm soil layer in a cultivated field in ansai county shaanxi province located in the northern loess plateau in the laboratory the sampled soil was air dried and crushed before sieved through a 4 0 mm sieve and kept an antecedent moisture content at around 14 for all experiments the prepared soil was packed into the metal flumes with dimensions of 0 4 m wide 0 25 m deep and five different lengths with adjusted slope gradients ranging from 0 to 84 and a perforated base during packing of the soil four 5 5 cm thick soil layers whose surface was gently scored before packing the next layer were arranged in the flumes with a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 and then the surface of the top soil layer was smoothed a total of 250 tests of simulated rainfall events were carried out at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau institute of soil and water conservation cas and mwr yangling shaanxi china rainfall drops from the simulated rainfall had a median diameter of about 2 2 mm and fall height of 8 67 m which was generated by dik 6000 rainfall simulators daiki riga kogyo co ltd konosu city japan which had a very uniform spatial variation 85 uniformity across the effective rainfall area of 2 m by 3 m each simulated rainfall event lasted for 60 min min the vast majority of the experiments did not initiate rill erosion and scoured holes were only observed during a few events at the end of the rainfall sediment and runoff outputs from the flumes were collected continuously at intervals of 1 min 2 min 3 min 4 min and 5 min within the first 15 min after the onset of runoff and then at 5 min intervals thereafter the quantities of sediment and runoff were determined based on the measured volume of sediment and runoff mixture weight and their density while collecting runoff the flow velocity of runoff was traced and measured using a kmno4 dye method in the lowest 40 cm segment at two positions 10 cm from each sidewall the average velocity of the two positions along with the corresponding total runoff volumes was used to calculate the mean flow depth for the segment the average of the values at the final six quasi steady state in each experiment was used in this study 4 2 results in the development above different solutions have been presented for the depth of overland flow flow velocity and unit discharge in the examples provided below data on the depth of overland flow from laboratory flume experiments were analysed and the relationships between the depth and flow length examined eq 56 was respectively fitted to the overall mean data and all individual observations which yielded fig 1 the almost exact fitting of the observed data to the new model fkwe in contrast to the unsatisfactory fitting of the conventional kwe in fig 1 confirms that the new fractional model is more suitable to the field conditions the excellent fitting of the fkwe also suggests that the new model captures more physical mechanisms with the introduction of the fractional order ρ in addition to the variation of the order of spatial fractional derivatives along the flow path shown in fig 1 the effects of the slope gradient and rainfall intensity have also been examined the variation of the order of fractional derivatives on different slopes has been shown on average to be ρ 1 49 on different slopes fig 2 a while the variation of the order with rainfall intensities 0 8 mm min 1 to 2 835 mm min 1 averaged on all slope gradients is ρ 1 47 fig 2 b the value of ρ 1 5 in figs 1 and 2 is approximately the average order of the kinematic wave equation of order 1 and order 2 the better representation of overland flow by the fkwe means that the fractional model is more appropriate for overland flow than its integer counterpart in a fashion similar to the fdwe models for anomalous diffusion gorenflo et al 2000 mainardi et al 2001 in addition to the laboratory data analysed above eq 56 in this paper was also fitted to one dataset from overland flow experiments in the field by emmett 1970 table e which yielded ρ 2 the value ρ 1 in the fkwe implies that a higher order diffusive mechanism manifests in the overland flow which is better represented by a fpde with an order higher than the kinematic wave equation with the order 1 in the derivatives when ρ approaches 2 the diffusion mechanism is more profound than the kinematic force which has the order ρ 1 the super advection with ρ 1 5 revealed in this study rather than the classic advection with ρ 1 means that the velocity of overland flow increases as it moves downslope this phenomenon is a result of two mechanisms one factor is the gradual increase in the depth of runoff on the slope due to the continual supply of uniform rainfall over the whole slope and the second reason is the acceleration due to gravity on a slope the simple manning equation in eq 5 explains these quantitative relationships as the length of the slope increases the depth of water on the slope increases resulting in an increased velocity which requires a higher order of ρ this is the reason why ρ 2 was derived from emmett s 1970 experiment which had a longer slope the overland flow pattern of super advection is in contrast to sub diffusion in porous media in which pores slow down the flow by trapping the flow through irregular channels and pores 5 conclusions and discussions this paper presents both theoretical analyses and experimental verification of a fractional kinematic wave equation using laboratory data an explicit solution of the new model is derived for large time or when the laplace transform variable s 0 which in fact is one of the most important situations for overland flow the analysis shows that with the data on the depth of overland flow under both different slope gradients and rainfall intensities under the laboratory conditions the order of space fractional derivatives in the fkwe is found to be around ρ 1 5 and the value of ρ 1 5 is consistent with both individual data points and averaged values it is also shown that the value of ρ increases with the slope gradient under the same rainfall intensity and with the rainfall intensity for a given slope gradient the approximate order ρ 1 5 which is the average value of order 1 for the kinematic wave equation and 2 for the diffusion equation implies that the diffusive mechanism manifests in the overland flow one data set from field experiments emmett 1970 confirms ρ 2 these findings mean that either a fractional kinematic wave equation is more suitable for modelling overland flow or a diffusion term is needed in the classic kinematic wave equation to account for dynamic forces in

3818,this paper analyses a fractional kinematic wave equation fkwe for overland flow and evaluates its solutions for applications using data from overland flow flumes with simulated rainfall in the laboratory solutions of fkwe presented have been derived for large time or when the laplace transform variable s 0 which is one of the most important situations for overland flow the solutions include expressions for the depth velocity and unit discharge of overland flow fitting the approximate solution for the depth of overland flow to the data yields the values of the order of space fractional derivatives ρ which is around ρ 1 5 it is found that ρ increases with the slope gradient and the rainfall intensity the approximate order of ρ 1 5 which is about the average of order 1 for the advection equation and 2 for the diffusion equation implies that diffusive mechanisms manifest in the overland flow the findings mean that either an fkwe is used or a diffusion term is needed to account for dynamic forces in overland flow as the fkwe captures more physical mechanisms keywords fractional kinematic wave equation overland flow analytical solutions kinematic and dynamic forces laboratory flow experiments 1 introduction overland flow is one major process which causes direct soil erosion leading to land degradation the indirect impacts of overland flow on animals and the natural environment are less obvious but they have serious consequences which include soil and groundwater pollution leading to the contamination of the food chains this paper aims to improve mathematical models of overland flow so that soil erosion and other runoff related processes can be better understood overland flow can be either described by the full mathematical models in hydraulics namely the saint venant equations or their simplified forms such as the kinematic wave equation eagleson 1970 chow et al 1988 the saint venant equations are a set of equations which include the continuity equation with terms accounting for dynamic diffusion and kinematic waves and a momentum equation simpler forms of the saint venant equations could be a term or terms in the saint venant equations which account for both dynamic and kinematic waves or the kinematic wave alone chow et al 1988 p 281 the kinematics is only concerned with the motion of fluids exclusive of the mass and forces while dynamics include both mass and forces for flow of small depths such as overland flow the kinematic wave equation kwe due to lighthill and whitham 1955 has been widely used for more than 60 years in the kwe the simplified continuity equation in the conservation form to distinguish it from the non conservation form for overland flow is considered only chow et al 1988 p 281 with this approach the motion of overland flow is interpreted as the result of the gravity force due to the existence of the slope gradient in addition to these integer based models such as the saint venant equations and kinematic wave equation the applications of fractional calculus based methods in hydraulics in recent decades particularly fractional partial differential equations fpdes are becoming increasingly popular in modelling various environmental transport processes such as flow processes in hydraulics hydrology and hydrodynamics compte 1997 schumer et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2017a 2017b merchado et al 2012 su 2021 these extensive findings appeared in the literature suggest that mathematical models based on fractional calculus can capture more information about material transport in the environment it is expected that the new fkwe for overland flow could also better capture new information about the transport processes and provide a more detailed insight into the physical and mathematical relationships of the flow fractional models for overland flow have been presented by other researchers kavvas and ercan 2015 2017 kavvas et al 2021 what distinguishes the present fkwe from these published models are the detailed analytical solutions here which show the functional relationships between the depth also the velocity and discharge of overland flow and the order of fractional derivatives and other parameters the objective of this paper is to analyse a fractional kinematic wave equation fkwe for overland flow which is a special form of the fpde and to evaluate and analyse the order of the fkwe and other parameters using data from flow flumes in simulated laboratory experiments 2 anomalous overland flow the fractional kinetic wave equation the kwe lighthill and whitham 1955 is the conservation form of the continuity equation and takes the following form eagleson 1970 p 332 chow et al 1988 p 281 for the cross sectional area of the flow a w h with h being the depth of runoff and w the constant width 1 h t q x r t i t where q is the volumetric discharge of runoff per unit width or unit discharge with the dimension of l 2 t 1 or q q w where q is the volumetric discharge with dimensions of l 3 t 1 and w the width of the flow r t is the effective rainfall intensity i t is the infiltration rate x is the slope length and t is time the velocity of overland flow v is the ratio of the volumetric discharge and the cross sectional area of the flow a i e v q a empirical formulae are often used for relating the velocity with other parameters and one such formula is the manning equation the manning equation for the velocity of turbulent flow with the si units is written as chow et al 1988 eq 2 5 6 2 v s f 1 2 r 2 3 n where n is the manning roughness coefficient and r is the hydraulic radius defined as 3 r a p where p is the wetted perimeter of the flow which is that portion of the perimeter of the cross section where there is direct contact between the flow and the solid boundary daugherty et al 1989 p 206 on a planar surface the wetted perimeter is simply the width of the cross section so that the hydraulic radius is r w h w h with the dimensionless friction slope s f the dimension of n is t l 1 3 the momentum equation relating the unit volumetric discharge and the depth of runoff is more generally written as an empirical formula eagleson 1970 emmett 1970 4 q c h m where c is a coefficient and m is a parameter depending on flow patterns clearly eq 4 is not only an empirical formula its parameters c and m also represent flow patterns and accommodate the units or dimensions the values of m in the kinematic wave model vary for two types of flow m 3 for laminar overland flow and m 5 3 for turbulent overland flow eagleson 1970 p 331 349 however the earlier observations from natural surfaces suggested that m 2 horton 1938 which has been confirmed by others also see eagleson 1970 p 332 for overland flow the kwe has been successfully used to approximate the full saint venant flow equations since lighthill and whitham 1955 in the application of the kwe further simplicity can be made for flow with small depths and in such cases the friction slope for overland flow s f can be set to equal to the slope gradient of the land surface s 0 cos λ s where λ s is the angle of the slope the friction slope for overland flow s f is the energy gradient given by h f l where h f is the difference in the depth of the flow along the flow length l chow et al 1988 p 33 34 with the discharge of overland flow on a planar surface the cross sectional area of the flow is a w h and the unit discharge is q v h with the unit width in eq 4 and r h the manning equation for velocity v with s f s 0 can be written as 5 v s 0 1 2 n h m 1 the unit discharge in eq 4 is then written as 6 q s 0 1 2 n h m which relates the coefficient c in eq 4 with the friction slope and roughness c s 0 1 2 n with the friction slope s 0 dimensionless in eq 6 the dimension of n is t l m 2 which for three cases discussed earlier spans n t l 1 3 for m 5 3 n t for m 2 and n t l for m 3 in order to accommodate the usual dimensions of the discharge per unit width q l 2 t 1 the kinematic wave model of overland flow on a planar slope in eq 1 can now be written as 7 h t s 0 1 2 n h m x r t i t because eq 7 is the conservation form of the continuity equation for a planar slope the terms on the right hand side represent the net change in the flow with both the input r t and output i t spatially uniform in addition to eq 7 which has been widely used since lighthill and whitham 1955 presented it nearly 70 years ago several versions of fractional formulations have also been reported as applications of fractional calculus models in hydraulics of overland flow and open channel flow the examples of the fractional counterpart of eq 7 for overland flow include time and space fractional kinematic wave equations fkwes by kavvas and ercan 2015 2017 and by kavvas et al 2021 the tempered kwe by zhang et al 2016 and space fkwe by su 2021 eq 8 9 in addition to these simpler fractional models other fractional forms of the manning equation were also reported earlier fuentes et al 1996 merchado et al 2012 but those implicit functional relationships are difficult to apply in practice in this paper we analyse the fractional version of eq 7 by su 2021 with a new roughness n f replacing the roughness n in the conventional kinematic wave equation the fkwe is written as 8 h t s 0 1 2 n f ρ h m x ρ r t i t where ρ is the order of fractional derivatives with the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 tracing back to the empirical manning equation and the momentum equation in eq 6 a different dimension enters eq 8 following the introduction of fractional derivatives in eq 7 with the dimensionless friction slope s 0 s f the dimension of n is t l m 2 in the fractional version in eq 8 either the new roughness parameter n f embraces the newly introduced dimensions or another parameter is added kilbas et al 2006 p 464 so that the rest of the dimensions in eq 8 remain unchanged in the fkwe without introducing any new parameter in eq 8 and with the dimensionless slope s 0 the dimension of n f is now t l m ρ 1 which for ρ 1 becomes t l m 2 and is consistent with the dimensions of n in eqs 6 and 7 in various approximate solutions of eq 8 however different dimensions may be needed when the approximations in different terms change the definitions of the parameters in eq 8 a constant or a parameter in a mathematical model is often used to reconcile and justify the units for the variables such as the diffusivity in the classic diffusion equation when the fractional model is used for runoff the new roughness coefficient n f also plays the role in maintaining the dimensions of other variables such as the depth of water the distance and time equation 8 is a nonlinear fpde and is specifically a fractional advection equation the fkwe with a spatial fractional derivative ρ offers more flexibility on the spatial variability of the discharge or discharge per unit width the unit discharge the fractional derivatives in fpdes can be either time fractional or space fractional alone or both time and space fractional or mixed fractional derivatives explanations of the space and time fractional derivatives can be found in the works of morales casique et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 561 562 and benson et al 2013 479 the fkwe can be derived from at least three approaches 1 the first approach is simply the use of a generalised flux in a fractional form to replace eq 6 2 the second approach is the mass balance approach kavvas and ercan 2015 and 3 the third approach to derive it is based on the continuous time random walk ctrw theory by neglecting the diffusion and considering advection only in the mass balance approach the fkwe can be derived when the change in mass flux throughout the incremental channel section is a fractional derivative as a result of the generalised taylor series approximation to the planar overland flow similar to the applications to flow and transport in porous media the fractional approach to overland flow also explains the nonlocality property of transport processes in the flow process the nonlocality explains that the concentrations of a tracer depth of flow or any other quantities at previous times and or upstream locations contribute to the variation of the concentration or fluid velocity at the point of observation due to an uncertain velocity field the spatial nonlocality means that the change in the concentration or depth of flow at the point of observation depends on its upstream value while the temporal nonlocality implies that the change in the concentration or depth of flow at the point of observation depends on the prior concentration loading benson et al 2013 or a change in the depth of flow the nonlocality implies scale dependence and history dependence which can be described by non linear integer pdes su 2021 3 solutions of the fractional kinetic wave models for overland flow the analytical solutions of eq 8 can be derived in different forms in this section the derivation of an analytical solution is detailed its asymptotic solution expressed as a power function and approximate solutions are also presented 3 1 detailed solutions of the fractional kinematic wave model eq 8 the solutions of eq 8 can be derived by different methods subject to different initial condition ic and boundary conditions bc here we use the following ic and bcs of the first kind for flow on a slope 9 h x t f x t 0 x 0 10 h x t h 0 t 0 x 0 and 11 h x t h l t 0 x l which state that the initial water profile on the slope is f x the depths of water on the upper and lower boundaries are respectively h 0 and h l these ic and bcs apply to situations when there is an initial depth of water on the slope f x before new runoff develops from the rainfall excess when the condition r t i t 0 is met this situation can be further simplified for the case of f x 0 when the initial surface is dry with the following transform kevorkian 1990 cetinkaya and demir 2020 12 h x t h x t x l h 0 h l h 0 the ic and bcs in eqs 9 10 and 11 can be transformed to the following homogeneous conditions 13 h x t f x x l h 0 h l h 0 t 0 x 0 14 h x t 0 t 0 x 0 and 15 h x t 0 t 0 x l in our study the simpler conditions are f x 0 h 0 0 and h l 0 and the transformed ic and bcs are then simplified as 16 h x t 0 t 0 x 0 17 h 0 t 0 h l t 0 t 0 and once the solution of h x t is known then eq 12 yields the solution in terms of the original variable 18 h x h x t x l h l the equation for infiltration into a soil with mobile and immobile zones su 2012 was used in the previous analysis su 2021 as an alternative model for infiltration we use the following rate of infiltration i t based on the earlier works by su 2014 2021 eq 6 60 19 i t a s β s 2 λ 1 s t β 2 λ 1 1 where a s is the final infiltration rate β is the order of time fractional derivatives λ is the order of space fractional derivatives t is time and s is the sorptivity given by 20 s 2 λ 1 θ s θ i 2 λ d 0 2 γ 1 β γ 2 λ k 0 cos λ s 1 2 λ 1 with γ 1 β and γ 2 λ being gamma functions θ s and θ i the saturated and initial water ratios k 0 the hydraulic conductivity d 0 the diffusivity and cos λ s s 0 is the slope with the λ s as the angle of the slope in addition to eq 19 other simpler models of infiltration can also be used such as when λ 2 in eq 19 or other time fractional equations of infiltration su 2010 2014 2021 with i t given by eq 19 the laplace transform of eq 8 and its initial condition ic and boundary conditions bcs in eqs 16 17 and 18 yields 21 s 0 1 2 n f d ρ d x ρ h m x s s h x s r s s a s s β 2 λ 1 s γ β 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 where γ β 2 λ 1 is the gamma function of β 2 λ 1 and s is the laplace transform variable r s is the laplace transformation of r t and the bcs are now transformed to 22 h x s 0 x 0 23 h x s 0 x l it has been shown that eq 21 can be solved subject to the conditions in eqs 22 and 23 kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1996 with the transformation 24 g x s h m x s eq 21 is written as 25 d ρ g d x ρ f g x where 26 f g x n s 0 1 2 r s s a s s β 2 λ 1 s γ β 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 s g 1 m x and the bcs becomes 27 g 0 x 0 28 g 0 x l the solution of eq 25 with the original variable in eq 24 is given as delbosco and rodino 1996 podlubny 1999 kilbas and marzan 2005 29 h m x s 1 γ ρ 0 x f g x x τ 1 ρ d τ the first part of f g x in eq 26 can be integrated gradshteyn and ryzhik 2007 eq 3 383 1 p 347 resulting in the solution as a nonlinear volterra equation of the second kind 30 h m x s b x ρ n f s γ ρ s 0 1 2 0 x h x s x ξ 1 ρ d ξ where 31 b γ ρ n f γ ρ 1 s 0 1 2 s r s a s β s γ β 2 λ 1 2 λ 1 s β 2 λ 1 1 equation 30 is nonlinear and can be solved only analytically in limited cases which include exact solutions and asymptotic solutions gorenflo and kilbas 1995 kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1999 with exact solutions known for limited cases only kilbas et al 1995 kilbas and saigo 1996 here we are interested in an exact solution of eq 30 in the following form given by kilbas et al 1995 and kilbas and saigo 1996 32 h x s ξ x β ξ x ρ m with the relationship m β ρ or β ρ m and ξ appears in the following algebraic equation kilbas et al 1995 eq 6 8 33 ξ m a ξ b 0 with 34 a n f s s 0 1 2 the solution in eq 32 is in the laplace domain and for practical applications it is desirable to be inverted to the time domain with the aid of the inverse laplace transform 3 2 solutions of the fractional kinematic wave model with a parameter determined from field data 3 2 1 solutions for m 2 in eq 32 as briefly overviewed in section 2 the value of m in the kinematic wave model vary in theory for two types of flow with m 3 for laminar overland flow and m 5 3 for turbulent overland flow eagleson 1970 however for natural land surfaces where flow patterns vary depending on the micro topographies on the flow paths the actual value of m is less likely to be precisely either 3 or 5 3 the earlier observations by horton 1938 suggested that m 2 which has been confirmed by others eagleson 1970 here with m 2 two solutions of eq 33 ξ 1 and ξ 2 can be found as 35 ξ 1 2 a a 2 4 b 1 2 2 for which the value of δ a 2 4 b determines three possible types of the two solutions 1 δ 0 means that the solutions ξ 1 and ξ 2 are real and unequal 2 δ 0 yields the two real and equal solutions ξ 1 ξ 2 and 3 δ 0 has two complex conjugate solutions in this section we use the first positive solution in eq 34 and with m 2 eq 32 is expressed as 36 h x s 1 2 a a 2 4 b 1 2 x ρ 2 equation 36 is in the laplace domain which looks simple but it is not easy to solve explicitly when the parameters a and b are functions it seems that the solution in the laplace domain in eq 46 can only be derived for large time or when s 0 which in fact is one of the most important situations for overland flow for large time or s 0 which yields a 0 then eq 36 with the first positive root can be approached by 37 h x s b 1 2 x ρ 2 equation 37 with b from eq 31 for a constant rainfall intensity r 0 can be written as 38 h x s b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 1 2 s 1 2 1 ω s α 1 2 x ρ 2 where b ρ 1 is the beta function given as 39 b ρ 1 γ ρ γ ρ 1 40 α β 2 λ 1 1 and 41 ω β s γ β 2 λ 1 2 λ 1 r 0 a s with γ ρ γ ρ 1 and γ β 2 λ 1 being the gamma functions the inverse laplace transform of eq 38 yields the solution of eq 8 kilbas et al 2004 haubold et al 2011 42 h x t b ρ 1

in the gpf 55 h x t b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 with π 3 14 and ω is given by eq 41 the solution with the original variable through eq 18 is 56 h x h l l x b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α π 1 2 x ρ 2 and the velocity given by eq 5 can now be expressed as follows by incorporating eq 56 with n f n and m 2 57 v s 0 1 2 n f h l l x b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 t 1 2 1 ω t α

analysis the unit discharge q is related to the total discharge q through the width of flow by q w q as the order of magnitude for runoff on hillslopes compared to that of the slope is about 3 and higher i e h l is usually of the order of millimetres while l is metres or larger the term h l l x 0 particularly for small values of x then eq 55 is a good approximation to eq 56 and the velocity in eq 57 and discharge eq 58 derived from eq 56 can also be simplified by neglecting the term h l l x 3 2 4 special cases when the soil is saturated s 0 and ω 0 eq 55 then simplifies as 59 h x t b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 or written as 60 h x t c 1 x ρ t 1 2 where 61 c 1 b ρ 1 r 0 a s n f s 0 1 2 1 2 a special case of eq 59 is where there is no infiltration with a s 0 or negligible infiltration then the following expression results 62 h x t b ρ 1 n f r 0 x ρ s 0 1 2 t 1 2 which for ρ 1 eq 62 becomes 63 h x t n f r 0 x s 0 1 2 t 1 2 these special cases can also apply to eqs 57 and 58 for the velocity and discharge respectively the depth of overland flow in eq 56 and its simplifications monotonically decrease with time and increase with the distance the length dimension of h in l should be retained which requires that other traditional dimensions be changed to accommodate the fractional dimensions in time and space variables the option presented here is that the changes in the dimensions are incorporated in the manning roughness coefficient so that other dimensions remain the same as in the classic models 4 verification of the model with data 4 1 laboratory flume setup and experiments the data used in this study were published previously and some details on the experimental procedures can be found in zhang et al 2014 2015 and zhang and wang 2017 for the convenience of the readers a brief description of the facilities used for the data collection and the data are provided here the data on overland flow were collected using runoff flumes with simulated rainfall in a laboratory the loessian loamy soil was used in the flumes and the observations were made at five locations of the slope namely at the slope lengths of 0 4 m 0 8 m 1 2 m 1 6 m and 2 m the flumes were adjusted to five slope gradients 18 27 36 47 and 58 and the experiments used five rainfall intensities 48 mm h 1 62 4 mm h 1 102 mm h 1 149 mm h 1 and 170 mm h 1 with different slope gradients and rainfall intensities a total of 125 combinations observations was designed and each combination had two replicates yielding a data set of 250 observations the loessian loamy soil had a composition of 38 7 sand 45 6 silt 15 7 clay and 0 5 organic matter which was collected from the 0 25 cm soil layer in a cultivated field in ansai county shaanxi province located in the northern loess plateau in the laboratory the sampled soil was air dried and crushed before sieved through a 4 0 mm sieve and kept an antecedent moisture content at around 14 for all experiments the prepared soil was packed into the metal flumes with dimensions of 0 4 m wide 0 25 m deep and five different lengths with adjusted slope gradients ranging from 0 to 84 and a perforated base during packing of the soil four 5 5 cm thick soil layers whose surface was gently scored before packing the next layer were arranged in the flumes with a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 and then the surface of the top soil layer was smoothed a total of 250 tests of simulated rainfall events were carried out at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau institute of soil and water conservation cas and mwr yangling shaanxi china rainfall drops from the simulated rainfall had a median diameter of about 2 2 mm and fall height of 8 67 m which was generated by dik 6000 rainfall simulators daiki riga kogyo co ltd konosu city japan which had a very uniform spatial variation 85 uniformity across the effective rainfall area of 2 m by 3 m each simulated rainfall event lasted for 60 min min the vast majority of the experiments did not initiate rill erosion and scoured holes were only observed during a few events at the end of the rainfall sediment and runoff outputs from the flumes were collected continuously at intervals of 1 min 2 min 3 min 4 min and 5 min within the first 15 min after the onset of runoff and then at 5 min intervals thereafter the quantities of sediment and runoff were determined based on the measured volume of sediment and runoff mixture weight and their density while collecting runoff the flow velocity of runoff was traced and measured using a kmno4 dye method in the lowest 40 cm segment at two positions 10 cm from each sidewall the average velocity of the two positions along with the corresponding total runoff volumes was used to calculate the mean flow depth for the segment the average of the values at the final six quasi steady state in each experiment was used in this study 4 2 results in the development above different solutions have been presented for the depth of overland flow flow velocity and unit discharge in the examples provided below data on the depth of overland flow from laboratory flume experiments were analysed and the relationships between the depth and flow length examined eq 56 was respectively fitted to the overall mean data and all individual observations which yielded fig 1 the almost exact fitting of the observed data to the new model fkwe in contrast to the unsatisfactory fitting of the conventional kwe in fig 1 confirms that the new fractional model is more suitable to the field conditions the excellent fitting of the fkwe also suggests that the new model captures more physical mechanisms with the introduction of the fractional order ρ in addition to the variation of the order of spatial fractional derivatives along the flow path shown in fig 1 the effects of the slope gradient and rainfall intensity have also been examined the variation of the order of fractional derivatives on different slopes has been shown on average to be ρ 1 49 on different slopes fig 2 a while the variation of the order with rainfall intensities 0 8 mm min 1 to 2 835 mm min 1 averaged on all slope gradients is ρ 1 47 fig 2 b the value of ρ 1 5 in figs 1 and 2 is approximately the average order of the kinematic wave equation of order 1 and order 2 the better representation of overland flow by the fkwe means that the fractional model is more appropriate for overland flow than its integer counterpart in a fashion similar to the fdwe models for anomalous diffusion gorenflo et al 2000 mainardi et al 2001 in addition to the laboratory data analysed above eq 56 in this paper was also fitted to one dataset from overland flow experiments in the field by emmett 1970 table e which yielded ρ 2 the value ρ 1 in the fkwe implies that a higher order diffusive mechanism manifests in the overland flow which is better represented by a fpde with an order higher than the kinematic wave equation with the order 1 in the derivatives when ρ approaches 2 the diffusion mechanism is more profound than the kinematic force which has the order ρ 1 the super advection with ρ 1 5 revealed in this study rather than the classic advection with ρ 1 means that the velocity of overland flow increases as it moves downslope this phenomenon is a result of two mechanisms one factor is the gradual increase in the depth of runoff on the slope due to the continual supply of uniform rainfall over the whole slope and the second reason is the acceleration due to gravity on a slope the simple manning equation in eq 5 explains these quantitative relationships as the length of the slope increases the depth of water on the slope increases resulting in an increased velocity which requires a higher order of ρ this is the reason why ρ 2 was derived from emmett s 1970 experiment which had a longer slope the overland flow pattern of super advection is in contrast to sub diffusion in porous media in which pores slow down the flow by trapping the flow through irregular channels and pores 5 conclusions and discussions this paper presents both theoretical analyses and experimental verification of a fractional kinematic wave equation using laboratory data an explicit solution of the new model is derived for large time or when the laplace transform variable s 0 which in fact is one of the most important situations for overland flow the analysis shows that with the data on the depth of overland flow under both different slope gradients and rainfall intensities under the laboratory conditions the order of space fractional derivatives in the fkwe is found to be around ρ 1 5 and the value of ρ 1 5 is consistent with both individual data points and averaged values it is also shown that the value of ρ increases with the slope gradient under the same rainfall intensity and with the rainfall intensity for a given slope gradient the approximate order ρ 1 5 which is the average value of order 1 for the kinematic wave equation and 2 for the diffusion equation implies that the diffusive mechanism manifests in the overland flow one data set from field experiments emmett 1970 confirms ρ 2 these findings mean that either a fractional kinematic wave equation is more suitable for modelling overland flow or a diffusion term is needed in the classic kinematic wave equation to account for dynamic forces in

3819,changes in the cryosphere caused by global warming are expected to alter the hydrological cycle with consequences to freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems here we combine data assimilation cross correlation analysis simulation techniques and the conceptual steady state budyko framework to examine the driving mechanisms of historical hydrological changes at annual seasonal and monthly scales we focus on two southern siberian basins with different landscape properties the semi arid selenga characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost and the boreal aldan which is underlain by continuous permafrost our results indicate that the two basins show divergent trends in river runoff over the period 1954 2013 in selenga runoff exhibits a significant decreasing trend 1 3 km3 10yrs p 0 05 whereas a remarkable increasing trend 4 4 km3 10yrs p 0 05 occurs in aldan given the negligible trends in precipitation over both basins we attribute these contrasting changes to different impacts from warming induced permafrost degradation the selenga basin which is dominated by lateral degradation i e decreasing permafrost extent suffers from severe water loss via the enhanced infiltration of water that was previously stored close to the surface this leads to a water deficit surface condition in the aldan basin in contrast vertical degradation prevails the thickened active layer is still underlain by a frozen layer with low permeability that sustains water rich surface conditions furthermore summer runoff shows contrasting oscillations with wet dry wet dry and dry wet dry wet state evolutions in the selenga and aldan basins respectively we attribute such variabilities to the seesaw like oscillations in summer precipitation associated with the propagation of rossby wave trains across the eurasian continent we also find that warming induced permafrost degradation over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 has led to strong regime shifts in river runoff in both basins our study highlights the importance of examining the mechanisms that drive changes in water availability from an integrated land hydrology atmosphere system perspective keywords siberia water availability permafrost degradation climate change 1 introduction unprecedented climate change and its associated effects on the landscape severely impact the

g dobinski 2011 woo 2012 further complicates the water dynamics in the subsurface system quinton et al 2011 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 however owing to the absence of long term permafrost monitoring data frampton et al 2011 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 it is not yet understood how climate change and its effects on permafrost influence regional hydrology walvoord and kurylyk 2016 permafrost acts as an aquiclude that suppresses subsurface water movement due to its low hydraulic conductivity woo 2012 during the warm season the top of the frozen layer called the active layer melts and becomes a seasonally thawed soil layer above the permafrost table i e the boundary between the active layer and the permanently frozen ground the frozen layer beneath the active layer nevertheless still serves as an effective barrier that prevents water from percolating deeply as a result the active layer can sustain high degrees of soil moisture iijima et al 2014 which can increase surface runoff but limit subsurface drainage continued climate warming is expected to alter the thermal state grosse et al 2011 biskaborn et al 2019 and hydrogeologic structure of permafrost kurylyk et al 2014 connon et al 2014 causing diverse patterns of degradation walvoord and kurylyk 2016 evans et al 2020 in the ice rich continuous permafrost region where more than 90 of the landscape is underlain by permafrost a warming environment leads primarily to a vertical degradation that increases the thickness of the active layer during the warm season muskett and romanovsky 2009 romanovsky et al 2010 in regions with less extensive permafrost i e discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost the thawing process can lead to a complete degradation of the frozen layer which eventually reduces the lateral extent of permafrost woo 2012 such lateral degradation may lead to the formation and expansion of open taliks i e unfrozen bodies of soil beneath the active layer and within the permafrost or widespread permafrost loss muskett and romanovsky 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in both cases permafrost degradation enhances the pathways connecting the surface and the subsurface water systems rowland et al 2010 muskett and romanovsky 2009 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 it also increases water storage and the movement of subsurface water and groundwater smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 evans et al 2020 different states of permafrost degradation are likely to result in divergent surface moisture conditions ford and frauenfeld 2016 vecellio et al 2019 in the case of vertical degradation the topsoil remains relatively moist because the thicker active layer is still underlain by a frozen layer with lower permeability vecellio et al 2019 in the event of exacerbated lateral degradation however increased infiltration and percolation into the groundwater system through a larger permafrost free area are triggered this results in drier surface and soil moisture conditions during the thawing season ishikawa et al 2005 ford and frauenfeld 2016 these findings on the drying and wetting of different permafrost states have been employed to investigate the changed dynamics of wetlands and lakes smith et al 2005 carroll et al 2011 as well as of land surface and atmosphere interactions ford and frauenfeld 2016 vecellio et al 2019 in northern eurasia yet the corresponding changes in water availability in response to such permafrost related drying and wetting have not been fully studied at the basin scale walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang and kane 2021 in this study we focus on two southern siberian basins with diverse landscape characteristics the selenga basin characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost in the transition belt from semi arid land to the boreal ecosystem and the aldan basin which is underlain by continuous permafrost in a boreal ecotone the majority of the southern siberian region suffers from inadequate hydro climatic data rawlins et al 2010 including a lack of actual evapotranspiration bring et al 2016 and long term permafrost observations frampton et al 2011 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 thus some significant limitations exist with regard to the analysis of the hydrological response to changes in climate and permafrost in this region nevertheless many approaches have been employed to resolve this issue firstly investigations based on field observations ishikawa et al 2005 kopp et al 2014 ohta et al 2008 iijima et al 2014 have verified the changing active layer and soil moisture dynamics under a changing climate secondly long term records have been used to identify patterns of historical hydro climatic changes over large river basins such as the lena yang et al 2002 tananaev et al 2016 yenisei berezovskaya et al 2005 ob oshima et al 2018 and selenga river basins törnqvist et al 2014 muskett and romanovsky 2009 and velicogna et al 2012 used remote satellite data to identify an increase in groundwater storage in the lena river basin during the 2000s similarly boike et al 2016 observed expanding lakes in the outlet region of the aldan basin from 2002 through 2009 both of these studies indicate that permafrost degradation has important hydrological consequences moreover the summer precipitation variability over southern siberia is highly associated with rossby waves propagating across the northern eurasian continent iwao and takahashi 2006 it is therefore essential to investigate the long term changes and dry wet state shift of water availability in response to multiple drivers including atmospheric oscillation changing climate and permafrost degradation based on these analyses one could further explore from an interconnected land hydrology atmosphere perspective the historical evolution of the drying and wetting mechanisms under different permafrost degradation states induced by rapid warming in southern siberia in this paper we use both multi source datasets and hydrologic modeling to analyze the historical hydroclimatic changes and associated processes over the two river catchments in particular we examine long term trends and short term oscillations to detect hydro climatic change patterns we also study cross correlations between runoff and precipitation over 60 and 30 year periods to identify the historical dynamics of the runoff generation processes finally we analyze the multi year regime detection and conceptual steady state budyko framework to investigate shifts in water availability in response to both climate change and permafrost disturbance 2 study area in order to identify suitable case studies for our investigations we defined two main selection criteria first the selected river basins should show the full range of permafrost conditions from continuous to discontinuous to sporadic second the flow regimes of the rivers should not be interrupted by dams or other forms of human intervention after thorough examination we identified the aldan and selenga basins as suitable candidates fig 1 the aldan river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost with boreal forest as the dominant landcover the selenga river basin in contrast represents the transition between discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost this transition is also reflected by a gradual change in landcover from boreal forest to dry steppe 2 1 selenga river basin the selenga river basin is situated in the central siberian plateau fig 1 and encompasses an area of about 440 000 km2 the majority of which lies in mongolia it is characterized by a number of basins and ranges with the khangai and khentii mountains peaking at or above 2800 m a s l the selenga river has a flow length of 943 km and discharges into the lake baikal in southern siberia this region is characterized by a harsh continental climate with long cold winters and moderately warm summers the average monthly temperature is close to 15 c in july and about 23 c in january reference period 1954 2013 cru fig s1 the total annual precipitation is about 310 mm approximately 2 3 of which is concentrated in the summer months munkhjargal et al 2020 the remainder occurs as snowfall between mid october and mid april fig s1 precipitation and air temperature show strong spatial variations between the mountains and the basins 1954 2013 gpcc fig s2 generally the mountainous areas in the southwest are characterized by extremely cold and dry conditions whereas the valley regions close to the lake baikal are somewhat milder and moister the selenga river is fed by both snowmelt and precipitation as evinced by two runoff peaks over a hydrological year törnros and menzel 2010 fig s1 the first peak occurs around may and is triggered by the snowmelt freshet the other more significant peak occurs mainly in august and is due to strong summer precipitation the dry season is concentrated from november to march and is characterized by relatively low runoff ranging from 1 to 5 l s km2 compared to the wet season april to september ranging from 8 to 29 l s km2 the geology of the selenga basin is very complex with a predominance of magmatic rocks as well as metamorphic and volcanogenic formations kasimov et al 2020 the upstream region of the basin is dominated by a forest steppe mosaic kopp et al 2014 while the downstream region is primarily covered by boreal forest but includes some agricultural areas klinge et al 2018 the selenga river basin is characterized by a mixture of permafrost types with discontinuous permafrost underlying the mountainous regions and sporadic isolated permafrost occurring toward the center of the basin törnqvist et al 2014 2 2 aldan river basin aldan river is the second longest tributary of the lena river it is 2 273 km long and drains an area of approximately 696 000 km2 providing nearly 30 of the discharge of the lena river fig 1 the climate in the aldan basin is characterized by long cold winters with minimum temperatures of 37 c in january and short moderately warm summers with maximum temperatures of up to 14 c in july reference period 1954 2013 cru the average annual precipitation is around 390 mm 1954 2013 gpcc with almost 70 occurring between may and september the area is snow covered from early october until the end of april spatially the southern region is dominated by relatively mild and wet climatic conditions whereas the north is cold and dry fig s3 as a snowmelt fed river basin the aldan river experiences peak runoff in june 185 l s km2 due to the low temperatures continuously below 0 c from november to april runoff is very limited 3 10 l s km2 during the cold season as compared to the flood season may to october 36 185 l s km2 geographically the aldan basin is located on the prilenskoe plateau and is composed mainly of limestone and limestone terrigenic sediments rachold et al 1996 taiga or boreal forest is the dominant landcover type in the basin bartsch et al 2009 more than 90 of the aldan river basin is dominated by deep and ice rich continuous permafrost ye et al 2009 in addition the population density is relatively low and human influence in the basin is limited 3 datasets and methodology 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 runoff observations long term 1954 2013 mean monthly river runoff records measured at the gauging stations located at the river mouths selenga mostovoy aldan verkhoyanskiy perevoz are available from the global river runoff center grdc http www bafg de grdc table 1 due to the presence of river ice during the low flow period large uncertainties exist in the daily measurements of river runoff in siberian basins however these uncertainties can be significantly reduced when the daily data are aggregated to monthly seasonal or annual scales shiklomanov et al 2006 for this reason the statistical analyses in this study are based mainly on seasonal and annual runoff data which have been aggregated from monthly runoff records to compare the magnitude of river runoff runoff production per unit area in the two basins streamflow data are converted from m3 s to l s km2 specific runoff for monthly and seasonal time series units of km3 yr are used to quantify historical changes in discharge at the annual time scale 3 1 2 meteorological data because the meteorological station network in southern siberia is sparse and records are irregular rawlins et al 2010 bring et al 2016 we use multiple global gridded datasets in this study precipitation data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet data were downloaded from the climate research unit cru and evapotranspiration et and global radiation data were derived from era interim basic information such as spatial resolution time step and access details are provided in table 1 more detail can be found in the supplementary material monthly time series of these datasets were extracted at the basin scale and the basin wide averaged monthly series was further used to aggregate to seasonal and annual series these series are further applied for statistical time series analysis for the same time period as the discharge data 1954 2013 except for era interim which starts in 1984 3 2 train model 3 2 1 forcing data because there is no et observation network in the selenga and aldan basins or anywhere close bring et al 2016 we used the distributed hydrological model train menzel 1997 to simulate et this is regarded as an additional source of information and complements data gathered from the gridded era interim dataset train is driven by multi source based data i e station observations reanalysis estimates including air temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity and global radiation the model considers the vertical water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere system and their drivers for the simulation of transpiration the model uses the penman monteith equation the determination of canopy resistances follows an approach described in menzel 1996 that considers current meteorological conditions soil water status and the stage of vegetation development when precipitation occurs the model also considers the processes of interception and interception evaporation menzel 1997 the calculation of the soil moisture content and of percolation is based on the conceptual approach from the hbv model bergström 1995 further information on model development based on field experiments as well as on model applications can be found in stork and menzel 2016 törnros and menzel 2014 and tijdeman and menzel 2021 information regarding soil depth and soil water holding capacity leaf area index lai and vegetation crop height is also essential for running the model information about lai and vegetation crop height can be provided directly to the model or estimated within the model from typical values for example the seasonal development of lai depends on the specific crop or vegetation type the station based daily meteorological data for the application of train comes from the gsod dataset for the calculation of et 17 stations in the aldan basin and 10 stations in the selenga basin were selected the gsod daily precipitation dataset suffers from large gaps during the late 1990s and early 2000s fig s4 gridded daily precipitation data from the gpcc dataset at the corresponding stations has been used to fill those gaps the validation of the gpcc daily data is provided in the supplementary materials fig s5 data regarding short wave incoming radiation can be obtained from a new version of the global energy balance archive geba developed and maintained at eth zurich switzerland wild et al 2017 however the geba based observations are very limited in our study region with only five stations located in or within the vicinity of the selenga basin thus the long term global radiation forcing data from the era interim reanalysis dataset have been used as a substitute additionally the five geba radiation observations have been applied to validate the gridded era interim radiation data see fig s6 in the supplementary material the full input datasets especially wind speed relative humidity and global radiation are only available after the year 1979 as a consequence the corresponding et analysis is limited to the second period of this study 1984 2013 note that for the calculation of daily et at each station we assumed short grass as the vegetation also for comparability identical soil physical parameters were assumed at all stations 3 2 2 validation of et data we used water balance closure to validate both the remote sensing era interim and model based train et data we found that the gridded era interim evaporation data extracted based on the geographic extents of the selenga and aldan watersheds always produce large deviations in the annual water balance p et r p 46 and 35 for selenga and aldan respectively table s2 with the train simulated et this deviation in the annual water balance is reduced to 3 8 in selenga but remains high at 40 for the aldan basin the negative deviation in the water balance in the aldan basin i e p et r 0 is in agreement with previous water balance evaluations for siberian regions with continuous permafrost serreze et al 2006 fig 1 the change in groundwater storage induced by permafrost degradation may play an important role in the imbalances observed in the water cycle in eastern siberia muskett and romanovsky 2009 velicogna et al 2012 we used the reconstructed grace terrestrial water storage tws data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to account for the increased groundwater storage and found that it accounts for 10 of the precipitation in the aldan basin table s2 this indicates an enhanced subsurface connectivity in a warmer climate walvoord and kurylyk 2016 we also compared both the train simulation and the era interim reanalysis with the et data measured by ohta et al 2008 at an observation site that is geographically close approximately 190 km to one of the meteorological stations curapca in the aldan basin the annual average et values of the train simulation and the era interim reanalysis differ from the observed average et by 12 8 and 33 respectively table s3 because the et data simulated by the train model are more consistent with the observation data we use them to evaluate the historical et variations in the following analysis 3 3 budyko framework the budyko framework budyko et al 1974 is a simple and widely used tool for estimating shifts in basin water availability in response to climate change and landscape disturbances at mean annual scales berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2014 teuling et al 2019 it first defines a dryness index 3 d i p e t p to capture the ratio between the atmospheric water demand pet and the atmospheric water supply p this equation can be used to determine climate classifications for different basins humid or energy limited di 1 5 dry sub humid or transition 1 5 di 2 and semi arid or water limited 2 di 5 unep 1992 then the framework defines an evaporative index 4 e i e t p to reflect the water consumed by the actual evapotranspiration process since actual evapotranspiration et can neither exceed the potential evapotranspiration pet nor exceed the water supply p ei satisfies ei min di 1 here we assume that precipitation is the only water source however depending on the region other sources such as lakes wetlands and glaciers may contribute water to the evapotranspiration process making ei 1 for water limited basins ei is constrained by the available water supply in energy limited basins the magnitude of ei is controlled by the available evaporative energy in this study we used gpcc precipitation cru potential evapotranspiration and et data to compute station based di and ei combinations for the selenga 17 stations and aldan 10 stations basins over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 the average of these station based combinations in each basin is aggregated to represent the hydro climatic characteristics at the basin scale the shift in the water availability is reflected by the average change in di and ei between the earlier and later 15 year periods 3 4 statistical methods 3 4 1 trend detection in this study trend detection for the hydro climatic series is performed in two steps first the determination of trend magnitude is calculated using both ordinary linear regression and sen s slope sen 1968 second the statistical significance of the trend is computed using the nonparametric mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 the trend is defined to be statistically significant when the p value is smaller than 0 05 the mk test is one of the most commonly used and robust methods for detecting statistical significance of long term trends in hydro climatic time series yue and wang 2002 déry and wood 2005 shiklomanov et al 2006 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 its performance can be relied on only when the data have no serial correlation the hydro climatic regimes of the aldan and selenga river basins show strong seasonality fig s1 the time series of hydro climatic variables are therefore assumed to be serially independent 3 4 2 moving window average approach although trend detection can reveal the long term rate of hydrological change its magnitude and significance are sensitive to the selected time period kundzewicz and robson 2004 hannaford and buys 2012 we therefore apply a 10 year moving window approach to analyze the long term time series this approach reduces the bias caused by year to year variations and possible extreme conditions in individual years as such it can robustly illustrate the oscillation patterns in the hydro climatic series which can be used to detect the potential connections between hydro climatic variables 3 4 3 cross correlation analysis although cross correlation does not always imply causality it can nonetheless be used to express the strength of the relationship between runoff and its drivers seneviratne et al 2010 it can also provide valuable information about the mechanisms driving the hydrological change in a specific basin spearman s correlation is a rank based parametric measure of correlation that has been successfully applied to analyze the relationship between climatic components and river runoff e g pavelsky and smith 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ x y between two sets of subseries x t and y t is defined as 1 ρ x t y t y t x t y t x t y 2 t y t 2 x 2 t x t 2 where x t and y t are the mean of x t and y t respectively the relationship between x t and y t is quantified by the correlation coefficients ρ x y and is treated as statistically significant when p 0 05 river runoff conveys integrated characteristics of climatic change over a given basin it is naturally lagged and smoothed from precipitation through surface and subsurface hydrological processes brutsaert and hiyama 2012 therefore to further examine the lag relationship between seasonal runoff and precipitation we generalize the spearman s rank correlation by introducing a time lag τ into the variable x t τ keener et al 2010 djebou et al 2015 this lagged correlation coefficient between the two sets of subseries x t τ and y t is defined as 2 ρ x t τ y t y t x t τ y t x t τ y 2 t y t 2 x 2 t τ x t τ 2 in our study x t and y t are the seasonal river runoff and precipitation in season t respectively τ 0 1 2 3 represents the number of seasons lagged between river runoff and precipitation for example with regard to summer precipitation τ 0 means runoff in summer while τ 1 denotes runoff in autumn and so on 4 results 4 1 inter annual hydroclimatic variability 4 1 1 annual scale the long term inter annual variability of hydroclimatic variables such as air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and river runoff is shown in fig 2 for the selenga and aldan basins significant warming has been registered over both basins with an increase in the mean annual air temperature maat of 1 9 c p 0 001 and 2 3 c p 0 001 over the 60 year period from 1954 to 2013 in the selenga and aldan respectively such robust warming has led to a significant increase in pet in the selenga basin 0 66 mm yr p 0 001 however the pet trend in the aldan basin is negligible 0 04 mm yr p 0 05 the distinct pet trends in response to similar warming tendencies over the two basins indicate the higher energy demand in the colder aldan basin furthermore the mean annual precipitation in both basins shows no notable persistent long term trend the moving averages dashed lines in fig 2 reveal short term oscillations over both basins a seesaw pattern exists between the selenga and aldan basins iwao and takahashi 2006 when precipitation decreases in the selenga basin it increases in the aldan basin and vice versa these contrasting oscillations between dry and wet precipitation regimes correspond well with the atmospheric circulation between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 this north south seesaw circulation pattern may be related to the propagation of rossby waves and the associated development of atmospheric wave train structures over the northern hemisphere holton and staley 1973 iwao and takahashi 2006 fujinami et al 2016 hiyama et al 2016 the aforementioned oscillation patterns in annual precipitation result in a similar alternation between high wet and low dry flow periods in the selenga and aldan basins fig 2 the strong relationship between runoff and precipitation is evident in their significantly positive correlations table s1 over both the selenga 0 76 p 0 001 and the aldan basins 0 68 p 0 001 in contrast to the insignificant long term trends in annual precipitation during the 1954 2013 period the long term variability in the annual runoff reveals pronounced divergent trends between these two basins these divergent trends in runoff i e declining in selenga 0 13 km3 yr p 0 05 but increasing in aldan 0 44 km3 yr p 0 05 strongly indicate the different roles of the warming related processes on the hydrologic dynamics under different permafrost conditions fig 3 shows how the actual evapotranspiration et has changed over the latter 30 years 1984 2013 in the selenga basin despite pronounced warming and increased pet fig 2 most of the stations have experienced decreasing et over this period 0 72 mm yr p 0 05 this reduction in the annual et might be a consequence of decreasing precipitation during 1984 2013 1 42 mm yr p 0 05 indicating a limited water availability for the surface latent heat flux in this semi arid region in the aldan basin about half of the stations exhibit significantly increased et from 1984 through 2013 resulting in an overall basin scale increase in et of 1 62 mm yr p 0 05 given that there is no significant change in the pet in this basin the increase in et can be attributed to increased precipitation and rising air temperature over this period a more detailed discussion on the relationship between et and other hydro climatic factors such as precipitation runoff and pet is in the section 4 3 4 1 2 seasonal scale fig 4 shows the inter annual variability of air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and river runoff for each season over the selenga and aldan basins similar to the robust increase in maat over both basins rapid and significant warming trends are evident for each season a sharp rise in the summer air temperature over both basins since the middle of the 1980s is particularly obvious consequently there are significant increases in pet from spring to autumn in the selenga basin however changes in pet in the aldan basin are of lower magnitude even during summer when solar radiation is strong in the northern hemisphere this indicates limited energy feedback from the land surface to the atmosphere in this colder region for precipitation the insignificant trends in the annual time series shown in fig 2 are reflected in the non significant seasonal trends illustrated in fig 4 the pronounced seesaw like oscillations in precipitation between the selenga and aldan basins are mainly observed in summer when the rossby wave train plays a more significant role in precipitation variability iwao and takahashi 2006 for seasonal runoff the oscillation patterns of summer runoff in the selenga and aldan basins mirror those of summer precipitation fig 4 runoff in the selenga basin shows a wet dry wet dry pattern whereas the aldan basin exhibits a dry wet dry wet pattern interestingly similar oscillation patterns are also evident in the runoff from autumn to spring although precipitation during these seasons shows no apparent oscillation patterns such cross season oscillations illustrate how the characteristics of summer precipitation propagate forward through the lagged runoff precipitation response the selenga river has experienced decreased runoff during all seasons except winter which shows a slight insignificant increase given that runoff in spring and autumn shows little change over time the decline in annual runoff fig 2 is dominated by the substantial reduction in summer runoff 0 43 l s km2 yr p 0 05 in the aldan basin however the robust positive trend in annual runoff is governed by a combination of contributions from spring 1 20 l s km2 yr p 0 05 autumn 0 93 l s km2 yr p 0 05 and winter 0 30 l s km2 yr p 0 001 runoff although the changes in seasonal runoff differ between the two basins both exhibit a noted increase in winter runoff and a decrease in summer runoff this indicates a shift in the seasonal runoff distribution that is potentially induced by permafrost degradation under a warming climate walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in addition seasonal et over the latter 30 year period 1984 2013 shows changes similar to those of the annual et over both the selenga and aldan basins the selenga exhibits decreasing trends in et for most seasons whereas et over the aldan basin increases from spring to autumn fig s10 4 2 changed seasonal runoff precipitation response we used cross correlation analysis to investigate the lagged relationship between seasonal precipitation and runoff fig 5 in fig 5a and b we present the 60 year period correlations then illustrate the changes in the correlations between the earlier fig 5c d and later 30 year periods fig 5e f the comparison of the two 30 year periods allows us to detect changes in the runoff precipitation response that were likely induced by enhanced permafrost degradation in general summer jja precipitation shows strong significant correlations with the runoff of the concurrent and subsequent seasons in both basins this phenomenon reflects the strong lagged relationship between runoff and precipitation that is induced by the thawing of the active layer during the warm season ye et al 2003 frampton et al 2011 sjöberg et al 2013 when comparing the two basins the magnitudes of the cross correlations between the summer jja precipitation and the runoff in a given season in the selenga basin are always larger than the corresponding values in the aldan basin this suggests that summer precipitation plays a dominant role in the generation of runoff in the semi arid selenga basin furthermore the seasonal runoff precipitation correlations show longer time lags in selenga as compared to aldan we attribute this to the different types of permafrost coverage discontinuous and sporadic vs continuous present in the two basins it may therefore be the case that regions with less permafrost extent and more developed subsurface connections have stronger and longer runoff precipitation responses walvoord and kurylyk 2016 a comparison of the earlier and later 30 year periods indicates that both basins have experienced warming enhanced permafrost degradation since 1984 for instance during the earlier 30 year period the strong lagged correlation with ρ 0 5 between the jja precipitation and subsequent runoff continues into the winter in selenga and into autumn in aldan fig 5c d however during the latter 30 years it has been extended by one season into spring and winter for selenga and aldan respectively fig 5e f rising temperatures over the past 30 years have affected the underground hydrogeological structure by activating the development of previously impermeable flowpaths kurylyk et al 2014 these newly formed flowpaths allow for greater infiltration and percolation into the subsurface soil layer and groundwater system during summer and autumn the increased storage of water in the soil sustains surface runoff for a longer period of time thereby extending the precipitation to runoff lag this enhanced hydrological input is reflected in the shift in the runoff regime during 1984 2013 as compared to the 30 year period prior to 1984 in particular the later period shows less intra annual variability due to the increase in winter runoff and the decrease in summer runoff fig s11 another phenomenon is the advent of strong significant correlations between autumn son precipitation and the seasonal runoff in the second 30 year period fig 5e f one may assume that it is the result of an enhanced runoff response to autumn precipitation however we argue that these enhanced cross correlations are also a consequence of the strong similarities between the precipitation in summer and autumn during the period from 1984 to 2013 furthermore the small unexpected correlations between summer precipitation and summer runoff in the aldan basin during the earlier 30 years fig 5d are mainly the result of divergent change patterns between spring and summer precipitation fig 4 these phenomena indicate that when performing cross correlation analysis the change patterns of the time series must be taken into account to exclude random results 4 3 hydrological change during 1984 2013 4 3 1 hydroclimatic regime shifts to provide a more quantitative analysis of these enhanced hydro climatic connections we investigated the shifts in the intra annual regimes of precipitation p river runoff r and evapotranspiration et during the more recent 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 we also looked at shifts between two 15 year periods 1984 1998 and 1999 2013 fig 6 in the selenga basin the shifts in the precipitation fig 6a and et fig 6c regimes between the two periods are slight in contrast river runoff exhibits a distinct regime change before and after 1999 fig 6b the runoff of the first 15 year period is dominated by summer rainfall and there is a significant difference between the spring and summer runoff peaks during the second 15 year period this peak difference is negligible resulting in a flattening of the intra annual distributed runoff regime the absolute amount of rainfall between the two periods also changes with a strong drop in precipitation between june and september during the 1999 2013 period as compared to the earlier period fig 6a this is mainly a result of oscillations in the large scale atmospheric circulation iwao and takahashi 2006 noted in section 4 1 following this substantial reduction in warm season precipitation after 1999 both river runoff and et exhibit a pronounced drop during the second 15 year period fig 6b c the decrease in all three hydroclimatic variables indicates the governing role of summer precipitation on the surface hydrological processes in the semi arid selenga basin in august and september runoff and et in selenga drop much more fig 6b c than precipitation fig 6a this suggests that the reduced surface water availability is likely also affected by warming induced permafrost degradation in general the active layer can sustain a wet surface due to the presence of permafrost iijima et al 2014 as temperature increases the selenga basin which is characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost tends to experience lateral permafrost degradation such as the formation of open or lateral taliks and or whole scale permafrost loss ishikawa et al 2005 davaa and jambaljav 2014 in response to these warming induced subsurface changes the soil layer becomes drier due to the enhanced infiltration and percolation of water this has led to a decrease in the amount of water available for surface hydrologic processes i e et and runoff in the late summer and early autumn in the aldan basin however widespread positive shifts are observed during the 1999 2013 period for all three variables fig 6d e f indicating a pronounced wetting over this period this wet state is also a consequence of large scale atmospheric oscillation but reflects a seesaw pattern with respect to the dry state in the selenga basin iwao and takahashi 2006 the strong increase in summer precipitation during the more recent 15 year period is accompanied by a shift in the precipitation peak from july to august as a consequence the runoff also exhibits a clear increase in august and september with a plateau from july to september thus there has been a prominent shift from a snow fed runoff regime to a snow rainfall fed regime in contrast to the sharp changes in precipitation the plateau in river runoff reveals the enhanced lagged response of runoff to precipitation resulting from permafrost degradation see section 4 2 furthermore the aldan runoff in may shows a much stronger upward shift than does precipitation but the runoff peak in june suffers from a substantial loss in spite of the increased precipitation during this month since runoff in may june is fed mainly by snow melt this indicates a warming enhanced earlier snowmelt during the second 15 year period in other words most of the accumulated snow has melted to contribute to runoff in may in addition the et in june and july exhibits a much larger increase fig 6f than do precipitation and runoff fig 6d e this can be attributed to the thickening and moistening of the active layer due to vertical permafrost degradation under rapid warming ford and frauenfeld 2016 iijima et al 2014 the deepening active layer retains more liquid water since the remaining permafrost prevents water from draining away consequently this thicker saturated or near saturated active layer results in an enhanced et fraction during the warm season which in turn reduces the surface runoff fraction in the corresponding months e g june and july 4 3 2 hydro climatic system dynamics the change in water availability i e the drying and wetting dynamics discussed above in the selenga and aldan basins can also be detected using the budyko framework fig 7 the selenga basin is a typical example of a basin at the threshold between transitional and water limited regimes during the second 15 year period 1999 2013 a higher dryness index i e higher atmospheric water demand pet as compared to the available water supply precipitation is evident in this basin given the strong decrease in precipitation during this period fig 6a the substantially increased dryness index indicates that the water limited dry selenga basin gets even drier under a warming and drying climatic condition this drying condition is consistent with the severe droughts in the mid latitude regions of central and east asia described by huang et al 2016 additionally the evaporative index i e the ratio between evapotranspiration and precipitation also exhibits strong reduction during 1999 2013 despite the robust warming and enhanced pet during this period fig 2 together with a persistent decline in river runoff this reduced evaporative index implies a significant surface water deficit via the enhanced infiltration induced by warming associated lateral permafrost degradation section 4 3 1 in the humid aldan basin most of the stations are located in the energy limited wet region with a few stations belonging to the transitional zone the averaged dryness index decreases during 1999 2013 as compared to the first 15 year period this decreased dryness index indicates wetter conditions in the latter 15 years in response to increased precipitation fig 6d the wetting condition in the aldan basin agrees well with the observed increase in water availability in southeastern siberia during this period e g muskett and romanovsky 2009 velicogna et al 2012 shiklomanov and lammers 2014 iijima et al 2014 fedorov et al 2014 boike et al 2016 meanwhile a clear drop in the evaporative index is also evident which means that more water is present on the relatively moist surfaces than can be evaporated by the available energy pet this further implies that the energy available is not sufficient to meet the energy demand of the saturated or near saturated surface for evapotranspiration as a result the surplus water could yield higher runoff in this energy limited basin because infiltration is still blocked by the underlying permafrost the wetting state in the energy limited aldan basin has therefore been driven by increased precipitation and intensified vertical permafrost degradation in recent years 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological change in southern siberia a quantitative understanding of historical changes in regional water availability and their drivers at multiple scales is essential for predicting future changes using a moving window average visualization we have identified two dry regimes and two wet regimes during the 60 year period from 1954 to 2013 in both selenga and aldan basins while the wet and dry regimes occur alternatively in each basin the wet dry wet dry pattern in selenga oscillates out of phase with the dry wet dry wet pattern experienced in aldan this spatial seesaw relationship mirrors the temporal atmospheric circulations between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 this means that although there was substantial drying wetting during 1999 2013 in the selenga aldan basin one may expect a wetting or drying state in selenga aldan in the 15 years after 2013 driven by the natural atmosphere variability however the consequence of warming related processes manifesting as a long term drying wetting trend in river runoff in the selenga aldan basin may weaken the magnitude of the wetting drying conditions in selenga aldan in the period after 2013 furthermore rapid population growth malsy et al 2017 and ongoing economic development e g rapid growth of mining activities urbanization and agriculture in the selenga basin are likely to exacerbate issues of water availability priess et al 2011 wang et al 2019 these activities also make it difficult to determine the extent to which the reduction in summer runoff results from the enhanced infiltration due to permafrost degradation however human water consumption tends to have immediate consequences on the magnitude of water availability whereas permafrost degradation usually exerts a lagged effect on the seasonal runoff distribution this cross season effect is evident in the cross correlation analysis used in this study as well as in the increased winter runoff fig 4 previous hydroclimatic studies in the siberian region suggest that potential uncertainties exist in the dataset for example the accuracy of precipitation data is affected by the poor distribution of gauges in siberia mcclelland et al 2004 groisman et al 2012 bring et al 2016 similarly there is uncertainty in the winter river discharge measurements because river ice affects the gauging technique stage discharge relationship shiklomanov et al 2006 however these uncertainties do not affect the coherent cross correlations i e strongly lagged correlations between summer precipitation and winter runoff nor our conclusions regarding the enhanced seasonal runoff precipitation relationship induced by permafrost degradation under a warming climate 5 2 hydrological implications of permafrost degradation direct evidence of permafrost evolution and its effect on regional hydrological processes can be obtained from field observations romanovsky et al 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 however such observations are usually of limited spatial scale and temporal coverage brutsaert and hiyama 2012 to gain a longer term perspective many researchers have used historical base flow river runoff sustained by the groundwater system records to investigate permafrost evolution based on basin scale permafrost hydrology dynamics lyon et al 2009 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 however base flow is based on daily streamflow and suffers from large uncertainties in southern siberia shiklomanov et al 2006 where daily measurements are limited thus other approaches based on long term runoff records are needed the seasonal runoff precipitation correlation analysis used in this study provides evidence of basin scale permafrost evolution in response to changing climate conditions generalizing the findings obtained from small scale in situ observations to the basin scale can improve our physical understanding of the integrated hydrologic system mcdonnell et al 2007 our investigations of basin scale drying and wetting dynamics are consistent with field observations over both basins in the selenga basin field observations provide evidence of permafrost degradation ishikawa et al 2005 kopp et al 2014 although permafrost below the north facing forest slopes is characterized by vertical degradation and a wet active layer the permafrost below flat pasture plains suffers from complete thawing that may lead to lateral degradation with dry soil layers our results indicate that this field scale phenomenon of lateral degradation may happen over the entire selenga basin as summer temperatures continue to rise in fact the 0 c isotherm of maat in the selenga basin has moved to the north by around 40 km on average over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 in comparison to the 30 year period before 1984 fig s12 as a result the southern boundaries of permafrost in this region migrate northward davaa and jambaljav 2014 in the aldan basin strong vertical permafrost degradation and associated wetting mechanisms assumed by our basin scale analysis are supported by field observations at a station approximately 190 km to the northwest of the basin iijima et al 2014 the consistency between those in situ observations and our basin scale investigations suggests that significant climate warming has already led to widespread permafrost degradation throughout the southern siberian region 5 3 the changing land hydrology atmosphere system hydrological processes are tightly coupled in the land hydrology atmosphere system seneviratne et al 2010 the interactions and feedbacks between climate factors hydrological variables and land surface properties are expected to alter both the water cycle and the energy cycle in a given region seneviratne et al 2006 in the selenga basin the combination of decreased precipitation and enhanced soil moisture loss has led to decreased et indicating reductions in the latent heat flux and evaporative vapor from the land surface to the atmosphere this will in turn result in an increased sensible heat flux partition that can potentially increase the temperature in the troposphere jung et al 2010 consequently the drier and warmer atmospheric conditions in this semi arid region are likely to trigger more frequent heatwave events that further exacerbate land surface drying erdenebat and sato 2016 and lead to a drier land hydrology atmosphere system ford and frauenfeld 2016 zhang et al 2020 in contrast the increasingly moist surface condition and latent heat flux in aldan is intensified by warming and the associated thickening of the active layer park et al 2008 atmospheric moisture is largely increased through the higher latent heat flux leading to a humid low level troposphere with more cloud cover in this region vecellio et al 2019 as a result the humid and cloudy atmosphere will induce a higher probability of precipitation that could contribute positively to the water balance iijima et al 2014 this is likely to result in a wetter land hydrology atmosphere system over this boreal region fig 2 the severe drying condition in the semi arid selenga basin and the enhanced wetting condition in the boreal aldan basin might result in adverse and inevitable ecological consequences in the water limited selenga basin the ecosystem is fragile and sensitive to climate changes karthe et al 2017 as air temperatures continue to rise warming associated processes such as enhanced lateral permafrost degradation and increased potential evapotranspiration pet are likely to result in a stronger water deficit at the land surface cook et al 2014 this climate induced water stress is likely to threaten forest and grassland growth bao et al 2014 wang et al 2019 as well as lead to increased wildfire frequency in the selenga region and beyond bartsch et al 2009 kopp et al 2017 hessl et al 2018 munkhjargal et al 2020 in the wet aldan basin the thawing of the upper ice rich permafrost might cause thermokarst subsidence and the formation of depressions séjourné et al 2015 iijima et al 2014 meanwhile the saturated or near saturated surface conditions will reduce the canopy stomatal conductance of the forest iijima et al 2014 affecting the growth of the boreal forest and changing the vegetation classes in this region furthermore forest fire events induced by natural or human disturbance could change the energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere which may conversely accelerate permafrost degradation over the southern siberian region boike et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study we examined historical 1954 2013 changes in water availability and the corresponding mechanisms driving these changes at multiple temporal scales over two southern siberian basins the basins have diverse landscape characteristics the semi arid selenga is characterized by discontinuous sporadic to isolated permafrost whereas the boreal aldan is underlain by continuous permafrost although trends in precipitation over both basins are negligible during the 60 year period each basin exhibits different responses to the changing climatic conditions in the selenga basin river runoff shows a significant decline 7 8 km3 60yrs p 0 05 in the aldan the trend is positive 26 4 km3 60yrs p 0 05 although many factors such as actual evapotranspiration and human intervention contribute to these divergent changes the different permafrost degradation scenarios over the two basins may be the main driver the enhanced lag between precipitation and runoff as revealed by our seasonal runoff precipitation cross correlation analysis indicates strong permafrost degradation over both basins however the discontinuous permafrost in the selenga basin is mainly the result of lateral degradation which stimulates direct vertical loss of surface water in contrast the continuous permafrost in the aldan basin still has a frozen layer with low permeability during the warm season thus warming induces vertical permafrost degradation or a deepening of the active layer which retains more water that contributes to surface hydrological processes i e runoff and et furthermore these two basins are located at the two ends of the seesaw like atmospheric circulations between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 the corresponding differences in precipitation oscillations have led to a short term wet dry wet dry pattern in the selenga basin but a dry wet dry wet pattern in the aldan basin as a consequence precipitation plays a major role in controlling water availability at the decadal scale over both basins nevertheless the effect of warming induced permafrost degradation on water availability is still pronounced lateral permafrost degradation stimulates water loss in the selenga basin and leads to a water deficit runoff regime during periods of low precipitation as occurred between 1999 and 2013 in the aldan basin the vertical degradation of permafrost sustains a water rich surface condition and yields higher runoff during the rainy season resulting in a snow rainfall fed runoff regime this study illustrates the potential benefits of using hydrological models and multi source hydrometric and meteorological datasets to investigate climate hydrology and landscape interactions in sparsely monitored regions with limited empirical observations in particular it shows how cross correlation analysis can be used to reflect long term permafrost degradation

3819,changes in the cryosphere caused by global warming are expected to alter the hydrological cycle with consequences to freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems here we combine data assimilation cross correlation analysis simulation techniques and the conceptual steady state budyko framework to examine the driving mechanisms of historical hydrological changes at annual seasonal and monthly scales we focus on two southern siberian basins with different landscape properties the semi arid selenga characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost and the boreal aldan which is underlain by continuous permafrost our results indicate that the two basins show divergent trends in river runoff over the period 1954 2013 in selenga runoff exhibits a significant decreasing trend 1 3 km3 10yrs p 0 05 whereas a remarkable increasing trend 4 4 km3 10yrs p 0 05 occurs in aldan given the negligible trends in precipitation over both basins we attribute these contrasting changes to different impacts from warming induced permafrost degradation the selenga basin which is dominated by lateral degradation i e decreasing permafrost extent suffers from severe water loss via the enhanced infiltration of water that was previously stored close to the surface this leads to a water deficit surface condition in the aldan basin in contrast vertical degradation prevails the thickened active layer is still underlain by a frozen layer with low permeability that sustains water rich surface conditions furthermore summer runoff shows contrasting oscillations with wet dry wet dry and dry wet dry wet state evolutions in the selenga and aldan basins respectively we attribute such variabilities to the seesaw like oscillations in summer precipitation associated with the propagation of rossby wave trains across the eurasian continent we also find that warming induced permafrost degradation over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 has led to strong regime shifts in river runoff in both basins our study highlights the importance of examining the mechanisms that drive changes in water availability from an integrated land hydrology atmosphere system

warming environment leads primarily to a vertical degradation that increases the thickness of the active layer during the warm season muskett and romanovsky 2009 romanovsky et al 2010 in regions with less extensive permafrost i e discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost the thawing process can lead to a complete degradation of the frozen layer which eventually reduces the lateral extent of permafrost woo 2012 such lateral degradation may lead to the formation and expansion of open taliks i e unfrozen bodies of soil beneath the active layer and within the permafrost or widespread permafrost loss muskett and romanovsky 2009 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in both cases permafrost degradation enhances the pathways connecting the surface and the subsurface water systems rowland et al 2010 muskett and romanovsky 2009 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 it also increases water storage and the movement of subsurface water and groundwater smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 evans et al 2020 different states of permafrost degradation are likely to result in divergent surface moisture conditions ford and frauenfeld 2016 vecellio et al 2019 in the case of vertical degradation the topsoil remains relatively moist because the thicker active layer is still underlain by a frozen layer with lower permeability vecellio et al 2019 in the event of exacerbated lateral degradation however increased infiltration and percolation into the groundwater system through a larger permafrost free area are triggered this results in drier surface and soil moisture conditions during the thawing season ishikawa et al 2005 ford and frauenfeld 2016 these findings on the drying and wetting of different permafrost states have been employed to investigate the changed dynamics of wetlands and lakes smith et al 2005 carroll et al 2011 as well as of land surface and atmosphere interactions ford and frauenfeld 2016 vecellio et al 2019 in northern eurasia yet the corresponding changes in water availability in response to such permafrost related drying and wetting have not been fully studied at the basin scale walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang and kane 2021 in this study we focus on two southern siberian basins with diverse landscape characteristics the selenga basin characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost in the transition belt from semi arid land to the boreal ecosystem and the aldan basin which is underlain by continuous permafrost in a boreal ecotone the majority of the southern siberian region suffers from inadequate hydro climatic data rawlins et al 2010 including a lack of actual evapotranspiration bring et al 2016 and long term permafrost observations frampton et al 2011 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 thus some significant limitations exist with regard to the analysis of the hydrological response to changes in climate and permafrost in this region nevertheless many approaches have been employed to resolve this issue firstly investigations based on field observations ishikawa et al 2005 kopp et al 2014 ohta et al 2008 iijima et al 2014 have verified the changing active layer and soil moisture dynamics under a changing climate secondly long term records have been used to identify patterns of historical hydro climatic changes over large river basins such as the lena yang et al 2002 tananaev et al 2016 yenisei berezovskaya et al 2005 ob oshima et al 2018 and selenga river basins törnqvist et al 2014 muskett and romanovsky 2009 and velicogna et al 2012 used remote satellite data to identify an increase in groundwater storage in the lena river basin during the 2000s similarly boike et al 2016 observed expanding lakes in the outlet region of the aldan basin from 2002 through 2009 both of these studies indicate that permafrost degradation has important hydrological consequences moreover the summer precipitation variability over southern siberia is highly associated with rossby waves propagating across the northern eurasian continent iwao and takahashi 2006 it is therefore essential to investigate the long term changes and dry wet state shift of water availability in response to multiple drivers including atmospheric oscillation changing climate and permafrost degradation based on these analyses one could further explore from an interconnected land hydrology atmosphere perspective the historical evolution of the drying and wetting mechanisms under different permafrost degradation states induced by rapid warming in southern siberia in this paper we use both multi source datasets and hydrologic modeling to analyze the historical hydroclimatic changes and associated processes over the two river catchments in particular we examine long term trends and short term oscillations to detect hydro climatic change patterns we also study cross correlations between runoff and precipitation over 60 and 30 year periods to identify the historical dynamics of the runoff generation processes finally we analyze the multi year regime detection and conceptual steady state budyko framework to investigate shifts in water availability in response to both climate change and permafrost disturbance 2 study area in order to identify suitable case studies for our investigations we defined two main selection criteria first the selected river basins should show the full range of permafrost conditions from continuous to discontinuous to sporadic second the flow regimes of the rivers should not be interrupted by dams or other forms of human intervention after thorough examination we identified the aldan and selenga basins as suitable candidates fig 1 the aldan river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost with boreal forest as the dominant landcover the selenga river basin in contrast represents the transition between discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost this transition is also reflected by a gradual change in landcover from boreal forest to dry steppe 2 1 selenga river basin the selenga river basin is situated in the central siberian plateau fig 1 and encompasses an area of about 440 000 km2 the majority of which lies in mongolia it is characterized by a number of basins and ranges with the khangai and khentii mountains peaking at or above 2800 m a s l the selenga river has a flow length of 943 km and discharges into the lake baikal in southern siberia this region is characterized by a harsh continental climate with long cold winters and moderately warm summers the average monthly temperature is close to 15 c in july and about 23 c in january reference period 1954 2013 cru fig s1 the total annual precipitation is about 310 mm approximately 2 3 of which is concentrated in the summer months munkhjargal et al 2020 the remainder occurs as snowfall between mid october and mid april fig s1 precipitation and air temperature show strong spatial variations between the mountains and the basins 1954 2013 gpcc fig s2 generally the mountainous areas in the southwest are characterized by extremely cold and dry conditions whereas the valley regions close to the lake baikal are somewhat milder and moister the selenga river is fed by both snowmelt and precipitation as evinced by two runoff peaks over a hydrological year törnros and menzel 2010 fig s1 the first peak occurs around may and is triggered by the snowmelt freshet the other more significant peak occurs mainly in august and is due to strong summer precipitation the dry season is concentrated from november to march and is characterized by relatively low runoff ranging from 1 to 5 l s km2 compared to the wet season april to september ranging from 8 to 29 l s km2 the geology of the selenga basin is very complex with a predominance of magmatic rocks as well as metamorphic and volcanogenic formations kasimov et al 2020 the upstream region of the basin is dominated by a forest steppe mosaic kopp et al 2014 while the downstream region is primarily covered by boreal forest but includes some agricultural areas klinge et al 2018 the selenga river basin is characterized by a mixture of permafrost types with discontinuous permafrost underlying the mountainous regions and sporadic isolated permafrost occurring toward the center of the basin törnqvist et al 2014 2 2 aldan river basin aldan river is the second longest tributary of the lena river it is 2 273 km long and drains an area of approximately 696 000 km2 providing nearly 30 of the discharge of the lena river fig 1 the climate in the aldan basin is characterized by long cold winters with minimum temperatures of 37 c in january and short moderately warm summers with maximum temperatures of up to 14 c in july reference period 1954 2013 cru the average annual precipitation is around 390 mm 1954 2013 gpcc with almost 70 occurring between may and september the area is snow covered from early october until the end of april spatially the southern region is dominated by relatively mild and wet climatic conditions whereas the north is cold and dry fig s3 as a snowmelt fed river basin the aldan river experiences peak runoff in june 185 l s km2 due to the low temperatures continuously below 0 c from november to april runoff is very limited 3 10 l s km2 during the cold season as compared to the flood season may to october 36 185 l s km2 geographically the aldan basin is located on the prilenskoe plateau and is composed mainly of limestone and limestone terrigenic sediments rachold et al 1996 taiga or boreal forest is the dominant landcover type in the basin bartsch et al 2009 more than 90 of the aldan river basin is dominated by deep and ice rich continuous permafrost ye et al 2009 in addition the population density is relatively low and human influence in the basin is limited 3 datasets and methodology 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 runoff observations long term 1954 2013 mean monthly river runoff records measured at the gauging stations located at the river mouths selenga mostovoy aldan verkhoyanskiy perevoz are available from the global river runoff center grdc http www bafg de grdc table 1 due to the presence of river ice during the low flow period large uncertainties exist in the daily measurements of river runoff in siberian basins however these uncertainties can be significantly reduced when the daily data are aggregated to monthly seasonal or annual scales shiklomanov et al 2006 for this reason the statistical analyses in this study are based mainly on seasonal and annual runoff data which have been aggregated from monthly runoff records to compare the magnitude of river runoff runoff production per unit area in the two basins streamflow data are converted from m3 s to l s km2 specific runoff for monthly and seasonal time series units of km3 yr are used to quantify historical changes in discharge at the annual time scale 3 1 2 meteorological data because the meteorological station network in southern siberia is sparse and records are irregular rawlins et al 2010 bring et al 2016 we use multiple global gridded datasets in this study precipitation data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet data were downloaded from the climate research unit cru and evapotranspiration et and global radiation data were derived from era interim basic information such as spatial resolution time step and access details are provided in table 1 more detail can be found in the supplementary material monthly time series of these datasets were extracted at the basin scale and the basin wide averaged monthly series was further used to aggregate to seasonal and annual series these series are further applied for statistical time series analysis for the same time period as the discharge data 1954 2013 except for era interim which starts in 1984 3 2 train model 3 2 1 forcing data because there is no et observation network in the selenga and aldan basins or anywhere close bring et al 2016 we used the distributed hydrological model train menzel 1997 to simulate et this is regarded as an additional source of information and complements data gathered from the gridded era interim dataset train is driven by multi source based data i e station observations reanalysis estimates including air temperature precipitation wind speed relative humidity and global radiation the model considers the vertical water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere system and their drivers for the simulation of transpiration the model uses the penman monteith equation the determination of canopy resistances follows an approach described in menzel 1996 that considers current meteorological conditions soil water status and the stage of vegetation development when precipitation occurs the model also considers the processes of interception and interception evaporation menzel 1997 the calculation of the soil moisture content and of percolation is based on the conceptual approach from the hbv model bergström 1995 further information on model development based on field experiments as well as on model applications can be found in stork and menzel 2016 törnros and menzel 2014 and tijdeman and menzel 2021 information regarding soil depth and soil water holding capacity leaf area index lai and vegetation crop height is also essential for running the model information about lai and vegetation crop height can be provided directly to the model or estimated within the model from typical values for example the seasonal development of lai depends on the specific crop or vegetation type the station based daily meteorological data for the application of train comes from the gsod dataset for the calculation of et 17 stations in the aldan basin and 10 stations in the selenga basin were selected the gsod daily precipitation dataset suffers from large gaps during the late 1990s and early 2000s fig s4 gridded daily precipitation data from the gpcc dataset at the corresponding stations has been used to fill those gaps the validation of the gpcc daily data is provided in the supplementary materials fig s5 data regarding short wave incoming radiation can be obtained from a new version of the global energy balance archive geba developed and maintained at eth zurich switzerland wild et al 2017 however the geba based observations are very limited in our study region with only five stations located in or within the vicinity of the selenga basin thus the long term global radiation forcing data from the era interim reanalysis dataset have been used as a substitute additionally the five geba radiation observations have been applied to validate the gridded era interim radiation data see fig s6 in the supplementary material the full input datasets especially wind speed relative humidity and global radiation are only available after the year 1979 as a consequence the corresponding et analysis is limited to the second period of this study 1984 2013 note that for the calculation of daily et at each station we assumed short grass as the vegetation also for comparability identical soil physical parameters were assumed at all stations 3 2 2 validation of et data we used water balance closure to validate both the remote sensing era interim and model based train et data we found that the gridded era interim evaporation data extracted based on the geographic extents of the selenga and aldan watersheds always produce large deviations in the annual water balance p et r p 46 and 35 for selenga and aldan respectively table s2 with the train simulated et this deviation in the annual water balance is reduced to 3 8 in selenga but remains high at 40 for the aldan basin the negative deviation in the water balance in the aldan basin i e p et r 0 is in agreement with previous water balance evaluations for siberian regions with continuous permafrost serreze et al 2006 fig 1 the change in groundwater storage induced by permafrost degradation may play an important role in the imbalances observed in the water cycle in eastern siberia muskett and romanovsky 2009 velicogna et al 2012 we used the reconstructed grace terrestrial water storage tws data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to account for the increased groundwater storage and found that it accounts for 10 of the precipitation in the aldan basin table s2 this indicates an enhanced subsurface connectivity in a warmer climate walvoord and kurylyk 2016 we also compared both the train simulation and the era interim reanalysis with the et data measured by ohta et al 2008 at an observation site that is geographically close approximately 190 km to one of the meteorological stations curapca in the aldan basin the annual average et values of the train simulation and the era interim reanalysis differ from the observed average et by 12 8 and 33 respectively table s3 because the et data simulated by the train model are more consistent with the observation data we use them to evaluate the historical et variations in the following analysis 3 3 budyko framework the budyko framework budyko et al 1974 is a simple and widely used tool for estimating shifts in basin water availability in response to climate change and landscape disturbances at mean annual scales berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2014 teuling et al 2019 it first defines a dryness index 3 d i p e t p to capture the ratio between the atmospheric water demand pet and the atmospheric water supply p this equation can be used to determine climate classifications for different basins humid or energy limited di 1 5 dry sub humid or transition 1 5 di 2 and semi arid or water limited 2 di 5 unep 1992 then the framework defines an evaporative index 4 e i e t p to reflect the water consumed by the actual evapotranspiration process since actual evapotranspiration et can neither exceed the potential evapotranspiration pet nor exceed the water supply p ei satisfies ei min di 1 here we assume that precipitation is the only water source however depending on the region other sources such as lakes wetlands and glaciers may contribute water to the evapotranspiration process making ei 1 for water limited basins ei is constrained by the available water supply in energy limited basins the magnitude of ei is controlled by the available evaporative energy in this study we used gpcc precipitation cru potential evapotranspiration and et data to compute station based di and ei combinations for the selenga 17 stations and aldan 10 stations basins over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 the average of these station based combinations in each basin is aggregated to represent the hydro climatic characteristics at the basin scale the shift in the water availability is reflected by the average change in di and ei between the earlier and later 15 year periods 3 4 statistical methods 3 4 1 trend detection in this study trend detection for the hydro climatic series is performed in two steps first the determination of trend magnitude is calculated using both ordinary linear regression and sen s slope sen 1968 second the statistical significance of the trend is computed using the nonparametric mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 the trend is defined to be statistically significant when the p value is smaller than 0 05 the mk test is one of the most commonly used and robust methods for detecting statistical significance of long term trends in hydro climatic time series yue and wang 2002 déry and wood 2005 shiklomanov et al 2006 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 its performance can be relied on only when the data have no serial correlation the hydro climatic regimes of the aldan and selenga river basins show strong seasonality fig s1 the time series of hydro climatic variables are therefore assumed to be serially independent 3 4 2 moving window average approach although trend detection can reveal the long term rate of hydrological change its magnitude and significance are sensitive to the selected time period kundzewicz and robson 2004 hannaford and buys 2012 we therefore apply a 10 year moving window approach to analyze the long term time series this approach reduces the bias caused by year to year variations and possible extreme conditions in individual years as such it can robustly illustrate the oscillation patterns in the hydro climatic series which can be used to detect the potential connections between hydro climatic variables 3 4 3 cross correlation analysis although cross correlation does not always imply causality it can nonetheless be used to express the strength of the relationship between runoff and its drivers seneviratne et al 2010 it can also provide valuable information about the mechanisms driving the hydrological change in a specific basin spearman s correlation is a rank based parametric measure of correlation that has been successfully applied to analyze the relationship between climatic components and river runoff e g pavelsky and smith 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ x y between two sets of subseries x t and y t is defined as 1 ρ x t y t y t x t y t x t y 2 t y t 2 x 2 t x t 2 where x t and y t are the mean of x t and y t respectively the relationship between x t and y t is quantified by the correlation coefficients ρ x y and is treated as statistically significant when p 0 05 river runoff conveys integrated characteristics of climatic change over a given basin it is naturally lagged and smoothed from precipitation through surface and subsurface hydrological processes brutsaert and hiyama 2012 therefore to further examine the lag relationship between seasonal runoff and precipitation we generalize the spearman s rank correlation by introducing a time lag τ into the variable x t τ keener et al 2010 djebou et al 2015 this lagged correlation coefficient between the two sets of subseries x t τ and y t is defined as 2 ρ x t τ y t y t x t τ y t x t τ y 2 t y t 2 x 2 t τ x t τ 2 in our study x t and y t are the seasonal river runoff and precipitation in season t respectively τ 0 1 2 3 represents the number of seasons lagged between river runoff and precipitation for example with regard to summer precipitation τ 0 means runoff in summer while τ 1 denotes runoff in autumn and so on 4 results 4 1 inter annual hydroclimatic variability 4 1 1 annual scale the long term inter annual variability of hydroclimatic variables such as air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and river runoff is shown in fig 2 for the selenga and aldan basins significant warming has been registered over both basins with an increase in the mean annual air temperature maat of 1 9 c p 0 001 and 2 3 c p 0 001 over the 60 year period from 1954 to 2013 in the selenga and aldan respectively such robust warming has led to a significant increase in pet in the selenga basin 0 66 mm yr p 0 001 however the pet trend in the aldan basin is negligible 0 04 mm yr p 0 05 the distinct pet trends in response to similar warming tendencies over the two basins indicate the higher energy demand in the colder aldan basin furthermore the mean annual precipitation in both basins shows no notable persistent long term trend the moving averages dashed lines in fig 2 reveal short term oscillations over both basins a seesaw pattern exists between the selenga and aldan basins iwao and takahashi 2006 when precipitation decreases in the selenga basin it increases in the aldan basin and vice versa these contrasting oscillations between dry and wet precipitation regimes correspond well with the atmospheric circulation between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 this north south seesaw circulation pattern may be related to the propagation of rossby waves and the associated development of atmospheric wave train structures over the northern hemisphere holton and staley 1973 iwao and takahashi 2006 fujinami et al 2016 hiyama et al 2016 the aforementioned oscillation patterns in annual precipitation result in a similar alternation between high wet and low dry flow periods in the selenga and aldan basins fig 2 the strong relationship between runoff and precipitation is evident in their significantly positive correlations table s1 over both the selenga 0 76 p 0 001 and the aldan basins 0 68 p 0 001 in contrast to the insignificant long term trends in annual precipitation during the 1954 2013 period the long term variability in the annual runoff reveals pronounced divergent trends between these two basins these divergent trends in runoff i e declining in selenga 0 13 km3 yr p 0 05 but increasing in aldan 0 44 km3 yr p 0 05 strongly indicate the different roles of the warming related processes on the hydrologic dynamics under different permafrost conditions fig 3 shows how the actual evapotranspiration et has changed over the latter 30 years 1984 2013 in the selenga basin despite pronounced warming and increased pet fig 2 most of the stations have experienced decreasing et over this period 0 72 mm yr p 0 05 this reduction in the annual et might be a consequence of decreasing precipitation during 1984 2013 1 42 mm yr p 0 05 indicating a limited water availability for the surface latent heat flux in this semi arid region in the aldan basin about half of the stations exhibit significantly increased et from 1984 through 2013 resulting in an overall basin scale increase in et of 1 62 mm yr p 0 05 given that there is no significant change in the pet in this basin the increase in et can be attributed to increased precipitation and rising air temperature over this period a more detailed discussion on the relationship between et and other hydro climatic factors such as precipitation runoff and pet is in the section 4 3 4 1 2 seasonal scale fig 4 shows the inter annual variability of air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and river runoff for each season over the selenga and aldan basins similar to the robust increase in maat over both basins rapid and significant warming trends are evident for each season a sharp rise in the summer air temperature over both basins since the middle of the 1980s is particularly obvious consequently there are significant increases in pet from spring to autumn in the selenga basin however changes in pet in the aldan basin are of lower magnitude even during summer when solar radiation is strong in the northern hemisphere this indicates limited energy feedback from the land surface to the atmosphere in this colder region for precipitation the insignificant trends in the annual time series shown in fig 2 are reflected in the non significant seasonal trends illustrated in fig 4 the pronounced seesaw like oscillations in precipitation between the selenga and aldan basins are mainly observed in summer when the rossby wave train plays a more significant role in precipitation variability iwao and takahashi 2006 for seasonal runoff the oscillation patterns of summer runoff in the selenga and aldan basins mirror those of summer precipitation fig 4 runoff in the selenga basin shows a wet dry wet dry pattern whereas the aldan basin exhibits a dry wet dry wet pattern interestingly similar oscillation patterns are also evident in the runoff from autumn to spring although precipitation during these seasons shows no apparent oscillation patterns such cross season oscillations illustrate how the characteristics of summer precipitation propagate forward through the lagged runoff precipitation response the selenga river has experienced decreased runoff during all seasons except winter which shows a slight insignificant increase given that runoff in spring and autumn shows little change over time the decline in annual runoff fig 2 is dominated by the substantial reduction in summer runoff 0 43 l s km2 yr p 0 05 in the aldan basin however the robust positive trend in annual runoff is governed by a combination of contributions from spring 1 20 l s km2 yr p 0 05 autumn 0 93 l s km2 yr p 0 05 and winter 0 30 l s km2 yr p 0 001 runoff although the changes in seasonal runoff differ between the two basins both exhibit a noted increase in winter runoff and a decrease in summer runoff this indicates a shift in the seasonal runoff distribution that is potentially induced by permafrost degradation under a warming climate walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in addition seasonal et over the latter 30 year period 1984 2013 shows changes similar to those of the annual et over both the selenga and aldan basins the selenga exhibits decreasing trends in et for most seasons whereas et over the aldan basin increases from spring to autumn fig s10 4 2 changed seasonal runoff precipitation response we used cross correlation analysis to investigate the lagged relationship between seasonal precipitation and runoff fig 5 in fig 5a and b we present the 60 year period correlations then illustrate the changes in the correlations between the earlier fig 5c d and later 30 year periods fig 5e f the comparison of the two 30 year periods allows us to detect changes in the runoff precipitation response that were likely induced by enhanced permafrost degradation in general summer jja precipitation shows strong significant correlations with the runoff of the concurrent and subsequent seasons in both basins this phenomenon reflects the strong lagged relationship between runoff and precipitation that is induced by the thawing of the active layer during the warm season ye et al 2003 frampton et al 2011 sjöberg et al 2013 when comparing the two basins the magnitudes of the cross correlations between the summer jja precipitation and the runoff in a given season in the selenga basin are always larger than the corresponding values in the aldan basin this suggests that summer precipitation plays a dominant role in the generation of runoff in the semi arid selenga basin furthermore the seasonal runoff precipitation correlations show longer time lags in selenga as compared to aldan we attribute this to the different types of permafrost coverage discontinuous and sporadic vs continuous present in the two basins it may therefore be the case that regions with less permafrost extent and more developed subsurface connections have stronger and longer runoff precipitation responses walvoord and kurylyk 2016 a comparison of the earlier and later 30 year periods indicates that both basins have experienced warming enhanced permafrost degradation since 1984 for instance during the earlier 30 year period the strong lagged correlation with ρ 0 5 between the jja precipitation and subsequent runoff continues into the winter in selenga and into autumn in aldan fig 5c d however during the latter 30 years it has been extended by one season into spring and winter for selenga and aldan respectively fig 5e f rising temperatures over the past 30 years have affected the underground hydrogeological structure by activating the development of previously impermeable flowpaths kurylyk et al 2014 these newly formed flowpaths allow for greater infiltration and percolation into the subsurface soil layer and groundwater system during summer and autumn the increased storage of water in the soil sustains surface runoff for a longer period of time thereby extending the precipitation to runoff lag this enhanced hydrological input is reflected in the shift in the runoff regime during 1984 2013 as compared to the 30 year period prior to 1984 in particular the later period shows less intra annual variability due to the increase in winter runoff and the decrease in summer runoff fig s11 another phenomenon is the advent of strong significant correlations between autumn son precipitation and the seasonal runoff in the second 30 year period fig 5e f one may assume that it is the result of an enhanced runoff response to autumn precipitation however we argue that these enhanced cross correlations are also a consequence of the strong similarities between the precipitation in summer and autumn during the period from 1984 to 2013 furthermore the small unexpected correlations between summer precipitation and summer runoff in the aldan basin during the earlier 30 years fig 5d are mainly the result of divergent change patterns between spring and summer precipitation fig 4 these phenomena indicate that when performing cross correlation analysis the change patterns of the time series must be taken into account to exclude random results 4 3 hydrological change during 1984 2013 4 3 1 hydroclimatic regime shifts to provide a more quantitative analysis of these enhanced hydro climatic connections we investigated the shifts in the intra annual regimes of precipitation p river runoff r and evapotranspiration et during the more recent 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 we also looked at shifts between two 15 year periods 1984 1998 and 1999 2013 fig 6 in the selenga basin the shifts in the precipitation fig 6a and et fig 6c regimes between the two periods are slight in contrast river runoff exhibits a distinct regime change before and after 1999 fig 6b the runoff of the first 15 year period is dominated by summer rainfall and there is a significant difference between the spring and summer runoff peaks during the second 15 year period this peak difference is negligible resulting in a flattening of the intra annual distributed runoff regime the absolute amount of rainfall between the two periods also changes with a strong drop in precipitation between june and september during the 1999 2013 period as compared to the earlier period fig 6a this is mainly a result of oscillations in the large scale atmospheric circulation iwao and takahashi 2006 noted in section 4 1 following this substantial reduction in warm season precipitation after 1999 both river runoff and et exhibit a pronounced drop during the second 15 year period fig 6b c the decrease in all three hydroclimatic variables indicates the governing role of summer precipitation on the surface hydrological processes in the semi arid selenga basin in august and september runoff and et in selenga drop much more fig 6b c than precipitation fig 6a this suggests that the reduced surface water availability is likely also affected by warming induced permafrost degradation in general the active layer can sustain a wet surface due to the presence of permafrost iijima et al 2014 as temperature increases the selenga basin which is characterized by discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost tends to experience lateral permafrost degradation such as the formation of open or lateral taliks and or whole scale permafrost loss ishikawa et al 2005 davaa and jambaljav 2014 in response to these warming induced subsurface changes the soil layer becomes drier due to the enhanced infiltration and percolation of water this has led to a decrease in the amount of water available for surface hydrologic processes i e et and runoff in the late summer and early autumn in the aldan basin however widespread positive shifts are observed during the 1999 2013 period for all three variables fig 6d e f indicating a pronounced wetting over this period this wet state is also a consequence of large scale atmospheric oscillation but reflects a seesaw pattern with respect to the dry state in the selenga basin iwao and takahashi 2006 the strong increase in summer precipitation during the more recent 15 year period is accompanied by a shift in the precipitation peak from july to august as a consequence the runoff also exhibits a clear increase in august and september with a plateau from july to september thus there has been a prominent shift from a snow fed runoff regime to a snow rainfall fed regime in contrast to the sharp changes in precipitation the plateau in river runoff reveals the enhanced lagged response of runoff to precipitation resulting from permafrost degradation see section 4 2 furthermore the aldan runoff in may shows a much stronger upward shift than does precipitation but the runoff peak in june suffers from a substantial loss in spite of the increased precipitation during this month since runoff in may june is fed mainly by snow melt this indicates a warming enhanced earlier snowmelt during the second 15 year period in other words most of the accumulated snow has melted to contribute to runoff in may in addition the et in june and july exhibits a much larger increase fig 6f than do precipitation and runoff fig 6d e this can be attributed to the thickening and moistening of the active layer due to vertical permafrost degradation under rapid warming ford and frauenfeld 2016 iijima et al 2014 the deepening active layer retains more liquid water since the remaining permafrost prevents water from draining away consequently this thicker saturated or near saturated active layer results in an enhanced et fraction during the warm season which in turn reduces the surface runoff fraction in the corresponding months e g june and july 4 3 2 hydro climatic system dynamics the change in water availability i e the drying and wetting dynamics discussed above in the selenga and aldan basins can also be detected using the budyko framework fig 7 the selenga basin is a typical example of a basin at the threshold between transitional and water limited regimes during the second 15 year period 1999 2013 a higher dryness index i e higher atmospheric water demand pet as compared to the available water supply precipitation is evident in this basin given the strong decrease in precipitation during this period fig 6a the substantially increased dryness index indicates that the water limited dry selenga basin gets even drier under a warming and drying climatic condition this drying condition is consistent with the severe droughts in the mid latitude regions of central and east asia described by huang et al 2016 additionally the evaporative index i e the ratio between evapotranspiration and precipitation also exhibits strong reduction during 1999 2013 despite the robust warming and enhanced pet during this period fig 2 together with a persistent decline in river runoff this reduced evaporative index implies a significant surface water deficit via the enhanced infiltration induced by warming associated lateral permafrost degradation section 4 3 1 in the humid aldan basin most of the stations are located in the energy limited wet region with a few stations belonging to the transitional zone the averaged dryness index decreases during 1999 2013 as compared to the first 15 year period this decreased dryness index indicates wetter conditions in the latter 15 years in response to increased precipitation fig 6d the wetting condition in the aldan basin agrees well with the observed increase in water availability in southeastern siberia during this period e g muskett and romanovsky 2009 velicogna et al 2012 shiklomanov and lammers 2014 iijima et al 2014 fedorov et al 2014 boike et al 2016 meanwhile a clear drop in the evaporative index is also evident which means that more water is present on the relatively moist surfaces than can be evaporated by the available energy pet this further implies that the energy available is not sufficient to meet the energy demand of the saturated or near saturated surface for evapotranspiration as a result the surplus water could yield higher runoff in this energy limited basin because infiltration is still blocked by the underlying permafrost the wetting state in the energy limited aldan basin has therefore been driven by increased precipitation and intensified vertical permafrost degradation in recent years 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological change in southern siberia a quantitative understanding of historical changes in regional water availability and their drivers at multiple scales is essential for predicting future changes using a moving window average visualization we have identified two dry regimes and two wet regimes during the 60 year period from 1954 to 2013 in both selenga and aldan basins while the wet and dry regimes occur alternatively in each basin the wet dry wet dry pattern in selenga oscillates out of phase with the dry wet dry wet pattern experienced in aldan this spatial seesaw relationship mirrors the temporal atmospheric circulations between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 this means that although there was substantial drying wetting during 1999 2013 in the selenga aldan basin one may expect a wetting or drying state in selenga aldan in the 15 years after 2013 driven by the natural atmosphere variability however the consequence of warming related processes manifesting as a long term drying wetting trend in river runoff in the selenga aldan basin may weaken the magnitude of the wetting drying conditions in selenga aldan in the period after 2013 furthermore rapid population growth malsy et al 2017 and ongoing economic development e g rapid growth of mining activities urbanization and agriculture in the selenga basin are likely to exacerbate issues of water availability priess et al 2011 wang et al 2019 these activities also make it difficult to determine the extent to which the reduction in summer runoff results from the enhanced infiltration due to permafrost degradation however human water consumption tends to have immediate consequences on the magnitude of water availability whereas permafrost degradation usually exerts a lagged effect on the seasonal runoff distribution this cross season effect is evident in the cross correlation analysis used in this study as well as in the increased winter runoff fig 4 previous hydroclimatic studies in the siberian region suggest that potential uncertainties exist in the dataset for example the accuracy of precipitation data is affected by the poor distribution of gauges in siberia mcclelland et al 2004 groisman et al 2012 bring et al 2016 similarly there is uncertainty in the winter river discharge measurements because river ice affects the gauging technique stage discharge relationship shiklomanov et al 2006 however these uncertainties do not affect the coherent cross correlations i e strongly lagged correlations between summer precipitation and winter runoff nor our conclusions regarding the enhanced seasonal runoff precipitation relationship induced by permafrost degradation under a warming climate 5 2 hydrological implications of permafrost degradation direct evidence of permafrost evolution and its effect on regional hydrological processes can be obtained from field observations romanovsky et al 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 however such observations are usually of limited spatial scale and temporal coverage brutsaert and hiyama 2012 to gain a longer term perspective many researchers have used historical base flow river runoff sustained by the groundwater system records to investigate permafrost evolution based on basin scale permafrost hydrology dynamics lyon et al 2009 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 however base flow is based on daily streamflow and suffers from large uncertainties in southern siberia shiklomanov et al 2006 where daily measurements are limited thus other approaches based on long term runoff records are needed the seasonal runoff precipitation correlation analysis used in this study provides evidence of basin scale permafrost evolution in response to changing climate conditions generalizing the findings obtained from small scale in situ observations to the basin scale can improve our physical understanding of the integrated hydrologic system mcdonnell et al 2007 our investigations of basin scale drying and wetting dynamics are consistent with field observations over both basins in the selenga basin field observations provide evidence of permafrost degradation ishikawa et al 2005 kopp et al 2014 although permafrost below the north facing forest slopes is characterized by vertical degradation and a wet active layer the permafrost below flat pasture plains suffers from complete thawing that may lead to lateral degradation with dry soil layers our results indicate that this field scale phenomenon of lateral degradation may happen over the entire selenga basin as summer temperatures continue to rise in fact the 0 c isotherm of maat in the selenga basin has moved to the north by around 40 km on average over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 in comparison to the 30 year period before 1984 fig s12 as a result the southern boundaries of permafrost in this region migrate northward davaa and jambaljav 2014 in the aldan basin strong vertical permafrost degradation and associated wetting mechanisms assumed by our basin scale analysis are supported by field observations at a station approximately 190 km to the northwest of the basin iijima et al 2014 the consistency between those in situ observations and our basin scale investigations suggests that significant climate warming has already led to widespread permafrost degradation throughout the southern siberian region 5 3 the changing land hydrology atmosphere system hydrological processes are tightly coupled in the land hydrology atmosphere system seneviratne et al 2010 the interactions and feedbacks between climate factors hydrological variables and land surface properties are expected to alter both the water cycle and the energy cycle in a given region seneviratne et al 2006 in the selenga basin the combination of decreased precipitation and enhanced soil moisture loss has led to decreased et indicating reductions in the latent heat flux and evaporative vapor from the land surface to the atmosphere this will in turn result in an increased sensible heat flux partition that can potentially increase the temperature in the troposphere jung et al 2010 consequently the drier and warmer atmospheric conditions in this semi arid region are likely to trigger more frequent heatwave events that further exacerbate land surface drying erdenebat and sato 2016 and lead to a drier land hydrology atmosphere system ford and frauenfeld 2016 zhang et al 2020 in contrast the increasingly moist surface condition and latent heat flux in aldan is intensified by warming and the associated thickening of the active layer park et al 2008 atmospheric moisture is largely increased through the higher latent heat flux leading to a humid low level troposphere with more cloud cover in this region vecellio et al 2019 as a result the humid and cloudy atmosphere will induce a higher probability of precipitation that could contribute positively to the water balance iijima et al 2014 this is likely to result in a wetter land hydrology atmosphere system over this boreal region fig 2 the severe drying condition in the semi arid selenga basin and the enhanced wetting condition in the boreal aldan basin might result in adverse and inevitable ecological consequences in the water limited selenga basin the ecosystem is fragile and sensitive to climate changes karthe et al 2017 as air temperatures continue to rise warming associated processes such as enhanced lateral permafrost degradation and increased potential evapotranspiration pet are likely to result in a stronger water deficit at the land surface cook et al 2014 this climate induced water stress is likely to threaten forest and grassland growth bao et al 2014 wang et al 2019 as well as lead to increased wildfire frequency in the selenga region and beyond bartsch et al 2009 kopp et al 2017 hessl et al 2018 munkhjargal et al 2020 in the wet aldan basin the thawing of the upper ice rich permafrost might cause thermokarst subsidence and the formation of depressions séjourné et al 2015 iijima et al 2014 meanwhile the saturated or near saturated surface conditions will reduce the canopy stomatal conductance of the forest iijima et al 2014 affecting the growth of the boreal forest and changing the vegetation classes in this region furthermore forest fire events induced by natural or human disturbance could change the energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere which may conversely accelerate permafrost degradation over the southern siberian region boike et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study we examined historical 1954 2013 changes in water availability and the corresponding mechanisms driving these changes at multiple temporal scales over two southern siberian basins the basins have diverse landscape characteristics the semi arid selenga is characterized by discontinuous sporadic to isolated permafrost whereas the boreal aldan is underlain by continuous permafrost although trends in precipitation over both basins are negligible during the 60 year period each basin exhibits different responses to the changing climatic conditions in the selenga basin river runoff shows a significant decline 7 8 km3 60yrs p 0 05 in the aldan the trend is positive 26 4 km3 60yrs p 0 05 although many factors such as actual evapotranspiration and human intervention contribute to these divergent changes the different permafrost degradation scenarios over the two basins may be the main driver the enhanced lag between precipitation and runoff as revealed by our seasonal runoff precipitation cross correlation analysis indicates strong permafrost degradation over both basins however the discontinuous permafrost in the selenga basin is mainly the result of lateral degradation which stimulates direct vertical loss of surface water in contrast the continuous permafrost in the aldan basin still has a frozen layer with low permeability during the warm season thus warming induces vertical permafrost degradation or a deepening of the active layer which retains more water that contributes to surface hydrological processes i e runoff and et furthermore these two basins are located at the two ends of the seesaw like atmospheric circulations between northeast asia and siberia iwao and takahashi 2006 the corresponding differences in precipitation oscillations have led to a short term wet dry wet dry pattern in the selenga basin but a dry wet dry wet pattern in the aldan basin as a consequence precipitation plays a major role in controlling water availability at the decadal scale over both basins nevertheless the effect of warming induced permafrost degradation on water availability is still pronounced lateral permafrost degradation stimulates water loss in the selenga basin and leads to a water deficit runoff regime during periods of low precipitation as occurred between 1999 and 2013 in the aldan basin the vertical degradation of permafrost sustains a water rich surface condition and yields higher runoff during the rainy season resulting in a snow rainfall fed runoff regime this study illustrates the potential benefits of using hydrological models and multi source hydrometric and meteorological datasets to investigate climate hydrology and landscape interactions in sparsely monitored regions with limited empirical observations in particular it shows how cross correlation analysis can be used to reflect long term permafrost degradation
