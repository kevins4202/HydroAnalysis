23620,system vulnerability is of critical concern when evaluating the operational performance of a naval vessel the identification of system failures as well as subsequent cascading failures of related systems is required to understand if the vessel s distributed systems can survive a damage scenario through the prevention of large scale failures in late stage ship design high fidelity system analysis and scenario simulations can identify this type of emergent failure however in early stages when distributed system design information is limited vulnerability analysis typically focuses on component damage and vessel layout without considering the effect of distributed system design the identification of cascading failures can not be identified early in the design process to address this problem the authors describe a distributed system model and corresponding vulnerability analyses to consider how vessel layout and distributed system configuration impact vessel performance under damage with limited information the approach uses network based methods to reduce the design detail required for distributed system modeling and vulnerability analysis this approach is demonstrated on illustrative cases and a naval ship concept example to illustrate the importance of identifying cascading failures in early stage design keywords distributed systems analysis ship vulnerability interdependent networks cascading failures early stage ship design essd vessel operability 1 introduction increased connectedness and interdependence of distributed systems on board naval vessels compounds the ever growing potential for emergent system failures system wide failures driven by damage propagation through distributed systems are a critical factor in vessel vulnerability while many emergent behaviors are beneficial such as in the case of the functionality of the internet and artificial intelligence mitchell 2009 other behaviors such as cascading failures are detrimental even catastrophic buldyrev et al 2010 cascading failures start in a small section of a system and quickly spread through interdependencies between system components rendering large portions of the system non functional notable examples include the blackouts experienced in the eastern united states as well as italy in 2003 dobson et al 2007 cascading failures are also present in the naval domain the uss yorktown was a u s navy guided missile cruiser which incorporated high powered radars computer systems and new automation technology on september 21 1997 an error in the main monitoring computer caused a ship control system fault to spread through lan switches into the engine controllers and ultimately caused the ship to go dead in the water slabodkin 1998 u k royal navy s newest vessels type 45 destroyers have suffered complete power failures in warm climates when outside temperatures rise intercoolers providing chilled air to the primary turbines become overloaded this causes the turbines to overheat and shutdown leading to a significant power load to smaller diesel generators which in turn fail leaving the vessel with no sources of power or propulsion project napier sees twin 2016 brown 2016 these examples show how relatively small amounts of damage spread rapidly through all of the integrated shipboard systems failure propagation of this sort presents serious operational and vulnerability concerns especially in the face of increasing complexity and interdependence of systems and components piff 2013 piperakis 2013 rigterink et al 2013 trapp 2015 studies have analyzed and proposed qualitative system design solutions that attempt to minimize the opportunity for cascading failures in naval power systems amy 2002 doerry 2006 2014 however many cascading failures are a function of multiple systems and thus can only be identified through an interdependent analysis paradigm interdependent systems present the opportunity for failures to cascade through the coupling of components spatially asztalos et al 2014 and functionally issacharoff et al 2008 carreras et al 2014 naval ship systems are coupled in both space and functionality which can result in extreme vulnerabilities and exhibit cascading failures under limited damage bashan et al 2013 strong spatial coupling occurs when system components or their supporting distribution systems are co located in the vessel high degrees of functional coupling result from the limited number of components within a vessel and the self contained nature of naval operations increasing system density and the interdependence of automation and component functions in all electric warship designs will continue to drive both spatial and functional coupling in the future this makes the early identification and prevention of emergent catastrophic failure modes a critical design activity dougal and langland 2016 measuring the performance of interdependent ship systems has been approached through simulation of system dynamics whitcomb 1992 cramer 2007 fang et al 2009 cramer et al 2011 and linear programming analysis of network flows butler et al 2001 cramer et al 2009 trapp 2015 these methods require significant modeling effort to represent various types of resource flow primarily electrical and chilled water through their respective conduits however in the concept design phase the requisite level of detail may not be available without making significant assumptions may be unknown due to concurrent technology development or may incur unsustainable computation effort when applied across a large design space kassel et al 2010 the disconnect between the information available in early design stages and in the information required to model these systems limits their utility in an effort to introduce system performance analysis earlier in the design process naval distributed ship service systems are approached from an architectural perspective the overall system behavior can be decomposed into interactions between architectures defining the system environment the functional interdependencies between system components and how those components are used thus the overall architecture of distributed ship service systems can be discussed in terms of physical architecture logical architecture and operational architecture 1 1 this description reflects the findings of an ongoing research program studying the design of naval distributed systems research collaborators include students researchers and faculty at the university of michigan virginia polytechnic institute and state university the university college london and delft university of technology the program is supported by the u s office of naval research grant no n00014 15 1 2752 physical architecture describes the system environment defined as the spatial relationships within the vessel for example how compartments are geometrically related and component locations logical architecture describes the relationships between vessel components that are required to generate system functionality e g generator provides power to a radar operational architecture defines how the distributed system is utilized through time for a given scenario here we analyze the system response by defining the physical logical and operational architectures the intersection of the physical and logical architectures create a physical solution which describes the material manifestation of components within the vessel and distributed system routings between components specifically a physical solution representing an early stage design of an all electric warship is considered in the following study we focus on vulnerability analysis which considers how damage to the physical solution impacts the overall system functionality vulnerability of the vessel is analyzed under three different operational architectures based on network measures understanding the vulnerability characteristics of a distributed system design earlier in the design process can complement and guide existing higher fidelity analyses identifying critical damage scenarios and non robust designs will enable designers to apply high fidelity analyses where needed this limits the significant modeling and computation effort required by complex scenario modeling and provides a new early stage design differentiator traditionally engineers address this in concept design with component damage analyses that identify how probabilistic attacks result in component failures this overlooks system vulnerabilities which may exist in the connectivity between components and limits observable failure modes concept design survivability analysis relies on reliability diagrams and proximity based damage of shipboard components doerry 2007 these analysis methods apply probabilistic damage scenarios to the physical architecture remove hit components and calculate the corresponding functionality loss in the logical architecture brown and waltham sajdak 2015 using recently developed network based representations of systems and vessel arrangements this can now be expanded to include physical connectivity between components rigterink 2014 shields et al 2016 including distributed system representations when applying traditional methods will help identify critical cascading failure modes during concept design using only rudimentary network analysis this paper describes and demonstrates a method to extend early stage naval system vulnerability analysis to include the connectivity effects of distribution systems within the vessel this extension is shown to identify cascading failures which cannot be identified through component based reliability analysis or high fidelity analysis of systems independently first a recursive damage propagation algorithm and three network based damage analyses are presented the algorithm and methods are demonstrated in two illustrative cases and applied to a representative naval combatant concept design results and analysis are used to discuss the capabilities provided by a connectivity based approach and to compare the proposed analysis methods 2 analyzing damage in naval design in this section networks are introduced as tools to define physical and logical design relationships at preliminary design stages networks can be used to both represent functional and physical relationships between system components without the need for high fidelity models or detailed system design parameters they also provide the ability to conduct various analyses on multiple distributed subsystems coupled by physical and logical relationships informally a network is a set of objects nodes which are linked to one another through relationships edges the generality of defining what the nodes and edges represent provides immense flexibility in network applications examining the way nodes are connected to one another which comprises the network s structure allows better understanding of the relationships between individual nodes and the system response in the naval domain networks have been used to model both geometric and distributed system structures shields et al 2017 with limited information for a comprehensive overview of network theory see newman 2010 the most fundamental network structure is a simplex network in which a set of n nodes are connected by k edges in general edges are undirected meaning connections exist between nodes but no additional information about the nature of their connection edges can also be directed which limits the relationships between nodes to a single direction at an additional level of detail nodes can be given values of demand which allows them to be treated as a source or sink the edges in this case become pipes through which demand can flow the edges are assigned capacities this enables an additional level of analysis from the conventional connectivity case fig 1 illustrates a multiplex network in which the aforementioned simplex networks are expanded into n layers this creates a network of networks each of these n layers have the same set of n nodes but can have different numbers of edges these edges represent different functional representations and relationships between the nodes kurant and thiran 2006 each duplicate node in a subsequent layer is connected across all layers to the same node which represents interdependencies across the network plexes shown in the figure as grey lines between layers the vulnerability analysis conducted in this paper follows the flow chart shown in fig 2 the process begins by representing the physical architecture and logical architecture as networks the physical architecture defines the locations of components and relationships between vessel spaces the logical architecture defines the resource relationships between onboard components that provide system functionalities logical architecture relationships are then routed through the physical architecture to create a physical solution fig 3 the physical solution describes locations of components and their supporting distribution system survivability can then be assessed by inflicting damage on the physical system solution and evaluating the loss of functionality under a network based operational architecture analysis this process can be extended to consider ensembles of physical system architectures logical system architectures and physical system solutions several types of analyses can be conducted using the interdependence between operational architecture and physical solution for the purposes of this paper let us consider damage to be the removal of a node in any one of the layers we then consider a functional component as one that is supported in the physical solution by all of its relationships in the logical architecture in this work support is defined as a functioning logical relationship within the physical solution between components under the operational architecture thus for a fixed physical solution vulnerability analyses can be categorized based on the operational architecture definition this study considers three types of operational architectures 1 undirected connectivity a path between components exists through an undirected network representation of the physical solution 2 directed connectivity a path between components exists through a directed network representation of the physical solution 3 flow analysis components receive sufficient resource flow from a source to satisfy demand through a flow network representation of the physical solution where each edge has a capacity and components are assigned resource supply or demand values resource flow between components is distributed to maximize the number of satisfied components to better contextualize what the above operational architectures entail consider a radar component with logical connections to the chill water center for cooling and the electrical generator for power in undirected connectivity the radar is functional if there is any path through the physical solution network from the chill water center to the radar through the chill water layer and from electrical generator to the radar through the electrical power layer in directed connectivity the same analysis is conducted using directed network paths versus undirected network paths flow analysis considers if there is sufficient resource flow from the chill water center and the generator through their respective flow network plexes each of these analysis types can be conducted on a single plex of the interdependent network independently or can be extended to include the entire multiplex network as one in this study we consider each of the three static responses for both the independent and interdependent cases for a total of six analysis conditions to compare each of these damage analysis types a score function was created representing the ratio of functioning components in the presence of damage to the initial total number of components in the system fig 1 describes how each operational architecture can be used in early stage ship design essd and the implications of independent and interdependent system analysis table 1 summarizes the primary defining aspects of each analysis method the table separates the analysis methods into two distinct groups those which consider individual systems independently and those which consider the net integrated system design as was previously outlined the amount of required knowledge increases between the undirected directed and flow analyses the integrated solution requires the presence of interdependencies to be known and represented between network plexes and thus the amount of information required to conduct the analysis increases moving down the table the increase in required information allows for more detailed system information to be elicited and thus would be expected to occur later in essd stages 2 1 vulnerability analysis methodology the undirected connectivity directed connectivity and flow analyses are applied separately to each independent network and are also applied to the total interdependent network these analysis methods match the level of knowledge a system designer would possess in early stages of design for example when component load profiles are unknown connectivity information may be available and survivability analyses can still be conducted thus these different algorithms were considered in order to understand what conditions can elicit cascading failures using the same network structures this section presents an overview of how these algorithms are applied to each network structure each analysis method has the same basic algorithmic structure when applied to the layers independently or to the total interdependent network in both cases damage is inflicted to the physical system solution network by removing a node or group of nodes and all edges connected to that node or nodes in all system layers after damage each component in the physical system solution is checked for functionality the method in which the demand is satisfied differs among the undirected directed and flow analyses the goals of including these analysis methods are as follows independent cases the goal of analyzing the systems independently is to show that the survivability of the integrated system solution is not a simple combination of individual survivability analyses and that cascading failures are not elicited interdependent cases the goal of analyzing the interdependent networks is to illustrate that considering interdependencies between distributed systems is crucial to accurately represent vessel vulnerabilities and to show that cascading failures can be elicited in early stages of design connectivity cases the goal is to show that additional information is required to elicit cascades other than a simple connectivity model although areas of concern can be highlighted directed cases the goal is to show that adding directed edges uncovers additional failure modes and provides value to designers in essd flow cases the goal is to show that network flow analyses provide enough detail for early stages of distributed system design to highlight areas of concern in the integrated ship solution by uncovering cascading failures in the independent case each plex of the multiplex network structure is analyzed separately a separate vulnerability analysis is conducted on each system a component which loses functionality in one layer will not transfer that damage to any other layers in the interdependent network analyses the same metric is applied to each layer however if a component loses functionality in one layer the component loses functionality in all other layers this adds an additional iterative step to each analysis method this is summarized in fig 4 the undirected and directed connectivity analyses identify if each component s demand is satisfied by checking if paths exist from the demand source to that component in the presence of damage on a single layer if a single path exists between the demand source and component then the component is considered functioning if no paths exist then the component loses functionality in the independent case the component only loses functionality within that system in the interdependent case the loss of functionality propagates potentially causing new component failures in other layers the flow analysis methods calculate component demand satisfaction in slightly more detail a minimum cost network flow analysis is used to determine demand routings through the network and determine which components are functioning as capacities are specified for edges in each logical system architecture the network flows are functions of both the component demands as well as the edge capacities the vulnerability analysis process is summarized in fig 5 the boxes in black indicate the processes conducted in the independent network vulnerability analyses and the red boxes indicate the additional processes required for the interdependent analyses 2 2 illustrative cases before demonstrating the algorithm and analyses on the full scale ship network consider two illustrative examples that elucidate the differences between the analysis methods we begin by considering the simple 2 2 grid shown in fig 6 this set of nodes represents the physical system architecture a generator g is placed at node 0 and a component c is located at node 3 in this example two indicative distributed systems are routed through the physical system architecture network and are highlighted as edges in green and blue for system 1 and 2 respectively the generator supplies 1 unit negative demand to the component in system 1 which requires 1 unit to function positive demand in system 2 the component supplies 1 unit to the generator which requires 1 unit to operate thus there is a coupling between the two components which are linked through two different systems to analyze this set of systems each node in the physical solution network is removed sequentially the analyses are conducted and the operability scores are recorded the operability score is defined as the fraction of the total number of original components which remain functional across all systems when a node is removed from the network the results from this analysis are presented in fig 7 the results displayed in fig 7 highlight the importance of considering interdependent systems for all analysis conditions removing either the generator or component at nodes 0 and 3 respectively causes the system to fail however when considered as two independent networks either g or c remain functional when node 1 or 2 is removed which breaks the path between the components in at least one of the two systems but suggests the components are still operational the score of 50 arises from the separate consideration of the two systems in one system the path is broken and the sink cannot receive the adequate demand from the source while the other system path remains unchanged this analysis method does not account for the subsequent failure in the non damaged system due to an inoperable component due to coupling in these systems it is expected that the entire system should fail if any node in the physical network is damaged which is highlighted in the interdependent analyses which scores zeros for all node removals it is also worth noting that this example illustrates the ability to consider damage of the physical connectivity between components rather than just the components themselves while the previous example highlights the importance of considering interdependent systems it is too simple to highlight differences between the directed undirected and flow analysis methods for this we expand our 2 2 physical system architecture to a larger 4 4 grid three components are located within this network one generator g and two components c 1 and c 2 two systems are routed through these geometric nodes in two separate plexes of an interdependent network fig 8 fig 8 depicts the two systems shown in blue and green routed through the 4 4 physical system architecture in the first system the generator is a source with a value of 10 units and each component has a demand of 5 units in this system the generator has sufficient supply for both components in the second system each component is a source producing 5 units and the generator has a demand of 10 units system 2 could represent a feedback system which requires input from the components to operate cooling water information etc in this case it is assumed that each sink requires 100 of its demand in order to operate each edge is assigned a maximum capacity of 10 units such that any one edge can support all of the flow from any source to sink in either system the problem has been formulated in this way such that the removal of any component or node on a critical path should cause a cascade of failures throughout both systems each node is damaged removed one at a time and the system s static response is analyzed using the operability scoring metric for each of the 6 aforementioned methods the results from this analysis are presented in fig 9 the static system s score after damage is plotted as a function of the individually damaged node this provides interesting insight into the response of the tested system under the different analysis methods it is important to note that in all analysis cases the removal of the generator node 0 causes a complete failure of the system which is to be expected while the previous 2 2 example highlighted the importance of considering the greater interdependent network this larger example highlights the impact of the analysis method on the way the system s response is understood the undirected connectivity cases for both the independent and cross connected cases demonstrate the least severe response this is because the undirected nodes do not account for the directivity of the connections it is simply a measure of whether paths exist throughout the grid to get from the sources to the sinks the undirected nodes allow for many additional paths to be realized throughout the network which can circumvent a removed node much more easily it also does not account for the demands of each component the scores decrease to 2 3 for the cases where nodes 12 and 15 are removed individually which correspond to components 1 and 2 respectively this suggests that the system is still operable in the event that component 1 or component 2 is removed in this case the results from the independent and interdependent networks are the same as the only node which affects the score is a component which is removed i e there always exists numerous paths throughout the interdependent and cross connected networks between the sources and sinks the directed connectivity analysis provides more conservative results than the undirected case by highlighting two additional nodes which cause a decrease in score this is due to the consideration of the direction of edges throughout the network which limits the number of paths that can be taken from the source to sinks in addition to the components themselves nodes 4 and 8 also cause failures to be realized in the system this is because nodes 4 and 8 both lie on the only directed path between the generator node 0 and component 1 node 12 thus removing either of these nodes will cause a failure in component 1 which will reduce the system score to 2 3 functional components although these values are more conservative than the undirected cases they still suggest that the system is mostly operable under these damage conditions similar to the undirected case the interdependent and independent networks have identical score functions as the physical system architecture is dense enough so that a path always exists between sources and sinks even when that node is removed in both systems the flow analysis is the most conservative estimation of the static system response to damage and behaves differently in the cases between independent and interdependent networks in the independent case the same critical nodes are highlighted from the connectivity case however node 1 is also highlighted as an area of concern this is because node 1 lies on all potential paths to receive demand from component 2 in system 2 thus component 2 fails in system 2 but due to the consideration of these systems as independent the failures do not cascade this also results in lower scores being recorded when nodes 12 or 15 are damaged which correspond to the two components in this case damaging the component in system 2 results in insufficient demand satisfaction in the generator which results in only one of the three components remaining operational the flow analysis conducted on the cross connected system is the most conservative and the most accurate analysis method this method captures the total failure of the system in the event that any component or critical node is removed the entire system fails this is the only tested method which captures the full extent of the connected systems failures and uncovers cascading failures the results are summarized in table 2 3 ship case study using the same approach as the two illustrative cases an analysis was conducted on a model based on the electric ship research and development consortium medium voltage dc esrdc mvdc all electric ship chalfant and chryssostomidis 2011 chryssostomidis and cooke 2015 this ship model was selected due to the crucial role the distributed electrical system plays in both the combat and propulsion systems this provides a platform on which to conduct the vulnerability analyses as there exists enough detail to conduct each analysis method on the electrical system at a preliminary design level the physical system architecture network was created to describe the three dimensional spatial arrangement basic layout of the esrdc all electric ship with the fewest possible nodes a total of 135 nodes were used to create the physical system architecture fig 10 the model consists of three transverse layers each comprised of 45 nodes the three transverse layers are identical in layout and are arranged to match the basic geometry of the esrdc ship each node in the transverse layer is connected to the node in the same geometric location transversely the vessel is separated longitudinally into 4 damage zones with 4 load centers so the created model was selected to be 8 nodes long this enabled each damage zone to have a forward and aft node vertically the model has a total of 8 decks 5 within the hull and 3 in the superstructure this was selected to provide enough nodes to adequately model the ship s geometry as well as the locations of the system components it is worth noting that although the ship model s physical system architecture is described in 3d physical space the connections between compartments and the relationships between the geometry is describable in 2d network space which enables the multiplex network to be created fig 11 two distributed systems were considered as logical system architectures an electrical system chalfant and chryssostomidis 2011 chryssostomidis and cooke 2015 and a representative cooling water system a brief description of each system will be outlined in this section the electrical system consists of two prime movers two emergency generators port and starboard two propulsion motors port and starboard an energy storage device radar four representative load centers and one pulsed load all components are fed by a ring bus layout the electrical system is separated into 4 damage zones each pair of motors generators and prime movers are intentionally located in different longitudinal damage zones each damage zone contains two power control modules pcm one located forward and one aft the forward pcm is located starboard low and the aft port high these are responsible for converting electrical power appropriately for the components in each zone the supply and demand values for the electrical system components were also based on the equipment loads described in the esrdc ship the physical electrical system solution was created and is shown in fig 12 the cooling water system was developed as an illustrative example by which to consider an additional distribution system this system contains two cooling sources which are located low in the vessel along the centerline also connected to a ring bus layout the demands on the cooling water system were developed to be indicative of a different systems onboard all components provided with electrical power are also provided with cooling water with routings emanating from the ring bus this system is illustrated in fig 13 the above physical system solutions were used to conduct a vulnerability analysis similar to that described in the demonstrative cases the same algorithms were employed and the results are displayed in fig 14 the results shown in fig 14 provide some interesting insights into the performance of each analysis method and the vessel s observed vulnerability the analysis results follow comparatively similar behavior to that seen in the illustrative cases first the flow analyses identify more severe failure dynamics than both forms of connectivity analyses second consideration of system interdependence is required for identification of many critical failure modes directed and undirected analyses differ slightly between independent and interdependent cases small differences exist at nodes 6 and 7 the similarity is likely due to the density of the network as was discussed in the second illustrative case when a sufficient number of paths exist throughout the network the removal of any one node does not in general affect the ability to route through the network whether the edges are directed or not in all cases nodes 48 and 53 are identified as areas of concern by showing a significant drop in score when those nodes are damaged node 48 coincides with the location of one of the cooling sources and node 53 lies on a critical path to and from that cooling source in both systems see figs 12 and 13 for reference this analysis illustrates that the entire system takes a large hit when this source is damaged this too coincides with the illustrative cases the most significant damage to the system is observed when a component takes a direct hit and the routings are less critical these yield predictable results which fall within the scope of traditional vulnerability assessments but do not highlight cascading failures although the directed and undirected results are generally similar for this application the undirected cases still provide the most conservative results in viewing nodes 6 8 112 120 127 and 131 the undirected cases provide a score higher by approximately 4 this follows previous observations of the analysis methods undirected connectivity analysis allows branches of the distribution system which connects components to the main bus to act as a redundant path for the damaged routing in the directed connectivity analysis these branches only allow paths to the component but not through it preventing the redundancy in particular scenarios this limitation can reduce the number of components functioning after damage the flow independent cases highlight the same damage propagation as the directed and undirected connectivity cases while increasing severity and identifying new failure modes for example the flow independent case highlights nodes 46 and node 51 as additional areas of concern which correspond with the other cooling source and its critical paths in both systems none of the connectivity algorithms highlight this node as a failure mode as there is no demand requirement being considered the components in the power system are still connected to the other cooling source and thus pass the connectivity case although in reality they may not actually be functioning due to an insufficient cooling water supply interdependent flow analysis identifies cascades which are not highlighted in other methods this is evident in nodes 6 8 and 51 of which 8 is the most severe damage at node 8 highlights a cascade resulting in the entire system being inoperable which is not elicited in any other of the tested analysis methods these critical nodes correspond to locations in each of the systems crucial routing paths between the sources and sinks these damage scenarios highlight cases where damage to the physical connectivity between components can have a significant effect on the system s ability to withstand damage once again the differences between analysis results confirm the behavior shown in the illustrative cases and the limitations of each method independent flow analysis considers the functionality of components at the supply and demand level further restricting the connectivity results introducing the interdependent case causes damage propagation through flow bottlenecks and successive component loss flow bottlenecks occur when the capacity on an edge is less than the total demand it is required to support this causes one or multiple components supported by that edge to fail due to lacking supply successive component loss occurs when the failure of one component prevents it from supplying resources to other components causing subsequent failures the severity of damage was increased by including a damage radius measure within the algorithm when an individual node is damaged the damage radius indicates how many adjacent nodes from the target node are damaged for this example the radius is set at 1 meaning that for each node damaged all adjacent nodes were also damaged as well as all edges associated with that node this mimics a larger or more severe blast or perhaps the case where a blast in one compartment affects the components in adjacent compartments the results from this analysis are presented in fig 15 comparing the results in fig 15 with those in fig 14 it is obvious that the damage is more severe than the individual node damage this is evidenced by the lower average scores as well as the higher number of detrimental hits in this case larger sections of adjacent nodes are removed resulting in more damage to the paths through the network this analysis confirms the same susceptible locations as the one node damage case and highlights system failures which would otherwise have low predictability more cascades are elicited than in the previous case and the importance of interdependent networks becomes even more critical the results from increased damage elicit a structure in the results which was not present in the previous damage case for all analysis methods scores increase between nodes 0 44 45 89 and 90 134 which correspond to the starboard center and port layers of the ship respectively figs 12 and 13 this trend highlights that damage incurred low in the vessel towards the stern has the most significant affect on the ship s operability and thus is critical from a system design perspective the same areas in the network are highlighted as susceptible to hits around nodes 8 and 48 with some small differences while the exact node damaged changes slightly the areas of concern remain the same for example in damaging node 48 the score remains much the same as the one node damage case slightly lower scores however additional failure modes are elicited in damaging nodes 47 and 52 in this case all analysis methods highlight that a hit at node 47 causes complete system failures as both cooling sources get damaged however the interdependent analyses are the only methods which highlight the complete loss of system functionality at node 52 which destroys all critical pathways to and from each cooling source these are critical cases to consider as these additional failures are only elicited by a larger blast radius additionally a similar trend is observed when considering the difference between independent and interdependent systems with added damage for example in fig 14 a hit incurred at node 7 has very little effect on the system s overall operability when considering additional damage node 7 becomes a critical node in the directed case node 7 has a significantly larger impact on system operability in the interdependent case than in the independent case when node 7 is severely damaged the ring bus configuration is damaged in both the power and cooling systems which causes a cascade of failures resulting in the complete loss of the system thus it has been shown that the system responses differ in the presence of different damage extents by exploring the effects of more severe damage additional insight is gained into the system design and highlights additional areas of susceptibility in the system design which may affect the vessel s survivability the results to be concluded from this analysis are summarized below connectivity and directed analysis methods highlight a few areas of concern however do not accurately reflect the systems final vulnerability score the connectivity analysis methods yield the most conservative results highlights the fewest areas of concern the directed connectivity highlights additional areas of concern however the flow analyses elicit the most cascades and most accurately highlights the integrated system vulnerability the flow analyses highlight additional failure modes associated with critical paths between components considering systems independently do not capture the integrated system vulnerabilities accurately the system interdependencies are crucial in capturing cascades the analysis method enables a range of damage extents to be considered these damage radii are critical in highlighting additional system failure modes 4 conclusion in this paper the ability to conduct distributed system centric vulnerability analysis during the early stages of ship design has been illustrated and demonstrated employing network descriptions of distributed system solutions enables novel survivability analyses that extend the current component based methods several new vulnerability analyses have been described which consider an array of methodologies including undirected and directed connectivity analyses as well as sink source flow analyses these analysis methods were compared in interdependent and dependent systems to identify the effect of cascading failures the importance of considering these factors was demonstrated using two illustrative examples these vulnerability analysis methods were applied to distributed systems in a developed ship model which confirmed the lessons learned in the illustrative examples additionally cascading failures were shown to exist and were highlighted using our analysis methods the method described in this paper has the flexibility toward application to any distributed system configuration coupling component reliability with distributed system connectivity analysis enables a novel approach to survivability most importantly it enables the designer to better understand key areas of the systems which may cause cascading failures rendering a ship dead in the water and to understand this at early design stages it also allows the designer to evaluate varying degrees of damage to explore the systems vulnerabilities the approach presented enables the additional failure modes in the connections between components to be uncovered as shown in the comparison between independent and interdependent analyses many of these failure modes cannot be identified without considering the effects of distributed systems additionally this method could also be utilized to consider a range of ship configurations to investigate the effect of physical ship architectures on vessel survivability the method is flexible enough to consider different zonal layouts and redundancies in both superstructure arrangements and multi hull architectures highlighting areas of concern for cascading failures in naval ships is an area which will continue to emerge as a crucial step in the ship design process as distributed systems on naval vessels continue to become more interconnected identifying critical failure modes early in the design process will be crucial in delivering the future of naval ships while this work has provided value by allowing distributed systems to be analyzed earlier in the ship design process it has several limitations this work only considers static representations of the developed networks and thus there exists extensive work to be conducted on the following quasi static and or dynamic consideration of flows and system response larger networks with more components and more routed systems expanding the algorithm to damage different parts of the vessel not just geometrically adjacent nodes by expanding the network to contain more nodes and systems with additional operational detail it is believed that additional complex interactions and cascading failures will be elicited and can be combated in early stages of ship design

23620,system vulnerability is of critical concern when evaluating the operational performance of a naval vessel the identification of system failures as well as subsequent cascading failures of related systems is required to understand if the vessel s distributed systems can survive a damage scenario through the prevention of large scale failures in late stage ship design high fidelity system analysis and scenario simulations can identify this type of emergent failure however in early stages when distributed system design information is limited vulnerability analysis typically focuses on component damage and vessel layout without considering the effect of distributed system design the identification of cascading failures can not be identified early in the design process to address this problem the authors describe a distributed system model and corresponding vulnerability analyses to consider how vessel layout and distributed system configuration impact vessel performance under damage with limited information the approach uses network based methods to reduce the design detail required for distributed system modeling and vulnerability analysis this approach is demonstrated on illustrative cases and a naval ship concept example to illustrate the importance of identifying cascading failures in early stage design keywords distributed systems analysis ship vulnerability interdependent networks cascading failures early stage ship design essd vessel operability 1 introduction increased connectedness and interdependence of distributed systems on board naval vessels compounds the ever growing potential for emergent system failures system wide failures driven by damage propagation through distributed systems are a critical factor in vessel vulnerability while many emergent behaviors are beneficial such as in the case of the functionality of the internet and artificial intelligence mitchell 2009 other behaviors such as cascading failures are detrimental even catastrophic buldyrev et al 2010 cascading failures start in a small section of a system and quickly spread through interdependencies between system components rendering large portions of the system non functional notable examples include the blackouts experienced in the eastern united states as well as italy in 2003 dobson et al 2007 cascading failures are also present in the naval domain the uss yorktown was a u s navy guided missile cruiser which incorporated high powered radars computer systems and new automation technology on september 21 1997 an error in the main monitoring computer caused a ship control system fault to spread through lan switches into the engine controllers and ultimately caused the ship to go dead in the water slabodkin 1998 u k royal navy s newest vessels type 45 destroyers have suffered complete power failures in warm climates when outside temperatures rise intercoolers providing chilled air to the primary turbines become overloaded this causes the turbines to overheat and shutdown leading to a significant power load to smaller diesel generators which in turn fail leaving the vessel with no sources of power or propulsion project napier sees twin 2016 brown 2016 these examples show how relatively small amounts of damage spread rapidly through all of the integrated shipboard systems failure propagation of this sort presents serious operational and vulnerability concerns especially in the face of increasing complexity and interdependence of systems and components piff 2013 piperakis 2013 rigterink et al 2013 trapp 2015 studies have analyzed and proposed qualitative system design solutions that attempt to minimize the opportunity for cascading failures in naval power systems amy 2002 doerry 2006 2014 however many cascading failures are a function of multiple systems and thus can only be identified through an interdependent analysis paradigm interdependent systems present the opportunity for failures to cascade through the coupling of components spatially asztalos et al 2014 and functionally issacharoff et al 2008 carreras et al 2014 naval ship systems are coupled in both space and functionality which can result in extreme vulnerabilities and exhibit cascading failures under limited damage bashan et al 2013 strong spatial coupling occurs when system components or their supporting distribution systems are co located in the vessel high degrees of functional coupling result from the limited number of components within a vessel and the self contained nature of naval operations increasing system density and the interdependence of automation and component functions in all electric warship designs will continue to drive both spatial and functional coupling in the future this makes the early identification and prevention of emergent catastrophic failure modes a critical design activity dougal and langland 2016 measuring the performance of interdependent ship systems has been approached through simulation of system dynamics whitcomb 1992 cramer 2007 fang et al 2009 cramer et al 2011 and linear programming analysis of network flows butler et al 2001 cramer et al 2009 trapp 2015 these methods require significant modeling effort to represent various types of resource flow primarily electrical and chilled water through their respective conduits however in the concept design phase the requisite level of detail may not be available without making significant assumptions may be unknown due to concurrent technology development or may incur unsustainable computation effort when applied across a large design space kassel et al 2010 the disconnect between the information available in early design stages and in the information required to model these systems limits their utility in an effort to introduce system performance analysis earlier in the design process naval distributed ship service systems are approached from an architectural perspective the overall system behavior can be decomposed into interactions between architectures defining the system environment the functional interdependencies between system components and how those components are used thus the overall architecture of distributed ship service systems can be discussed in terms of physical architecture logical architecture and operational architecture 1 1 this description reflects the findings of an ongoing research program studying the design of naval distributed systems research collaborators include students researchers and faculty at the university of michigan virginia polytechnic institute and state university the university college london and delft university of technology the program is supported by the u s office of naval research grant no n00014 15 1 2752 physical architecture describes the system environment defined as the spatial relationships within the vessel for example how compartments are geometrically related and component locations logical architecture describes the relationships between vessel components that are required to generate system functionality e g generator provides power to a radar operational architecture defines how the distributed system is utilized through time for a given scenario here we analyze the system response by defining the physical logical and operational architectures the intersection of the physical and logical architectures create a physical solution which describes the material manifestation of components within the vessel and distributed system routings between components specifically a physical solution representing an early stage design of an all electric warship is considered in the following study we focus on vulnerability analysis which considers how damage to the physical solution impacts the overall system functionality vulnerability of the vessel is analyzed under three different operational architectures based on network measures understanding the vulnerability characteristics of a distributed system design earlier in the design process can complement and guide existing higher fidelity analyses identifying critical damage scenarios and non robust designs will enable designers to apply high fidelity analyses where needed this limits the significant modeling and computation effort required by complex scenario modeling and provides a new early stage design differentiator traditionally engineers address this in concept design with component damage analyses that identify how probabilistic attacks result in component failures this overlooks system vulnerabilities which may exist in the connectivity between components and limits observable failure modes concept design survivability analysis relies on reliability diagrams and proximity based damage of shipboard components doerry 2007 these analysis methods apply probabilistic damage scenarios to the physical architecture remove hit components and calculate the corresponding functionality loss in the logical architecture brown and waltham sajdak 2015 using recently developed network based representations of systems and vessel arrangements this can now be expanded to include physical connectivity between components rigterink 2014 shields et al 2016 including distributed system representations when applying traditional methods will help identify critical cascading failure modes during concept design using only rudimentary network analysis this paper describes and demonstrates a method to extend early stage naval system vulnerability analysis to include the connectivity effects of distribution systems within the vessel this extension is shown to identify cascading failures which cannot be identified through component based reliability analysis or high fidelity analysis of systems independently first a recursive damage propagation algorithm and three network based damage analyses are presented the algorithm and methods are demonstrated in two illustrative cases and applied to a representative naval combatant concept design results and analysis are used to discuss the capabilities provided by a connectivity based approach and to compare the proposed analysis methods 2 analyzing damage in naval design in this section networks are introduced as tools to define physical and logical design relationships at preliminary design stages networks can be used to both represent functional and physical relationships between system components without the need for high fidelity models or detailed system design parameters they also provide the ability to conduct various analyses on multiple distributed subsystems coupled by physical and logical relationships informally a network is a set of objects nodes which are linked to one another through relationships edges the generality of defining what the nodes and edges represent provides immense flexibility in network applications examining the way nodes are connected to one another which comprises the network s structure allows better understanding of the relationships between individual nodes and the system response in the naval domain networks have been used to model both geometric and distributed system structures shields et al 2017 with limited information for a comprehensive overview of network theory see newman 2010 the most fundamental network structure is a simplex network in which a set of n nodes are connected by k edges in general edges are undirected meaning connections exist between nodes but no additional information about the nature of their connection edges can also be directed which limits the relationships between nodes to a single direction at an additional level of detail nodes can be given values of demand which allows them to be treated as a source or sink the edges in this case become pipes through which demand can flow the edges are assigned capacities this enables an additional level of analysis from the conventional connectivity case fig 1 illustrates a multiplex network in which the aforementioned simplex networks are expanded into n layers this creates a network of networks each of these n layers have the same set of n nodes but can have different numbers of edges these edges represent different functional representations and relationships between the nodes kurant and thiran 2006 each duplicate node in a subsequent layer is connected across all layers to the same node which represents interdependencies across the network plexes shown in the figure as grey lines between layers the vulnerability analysis conducted in this paper follows the flow chart shown in fig 2 the process begins by representing the physical architecture and logical architecture as networks the physical architecture defines the locations of components and relationships between vessel spaces the logical architecture defines the resource relationships between onboard components that provide system functionalities logical architecture relationships are then routed through the physical architecture to create a physical solution fig 3 the physical solution describes locations of components and their supporting distribution system survivability can then be assessed by inflicting damage on the physical system solution and evaluating the loss of functionality under a network based operational architecture analysis this process can be extended to consider ensembles of physical system architectures logical system architectures and physical system solutions several types of analyses can be conducted using the interdependence between operational architecture and physical solution for the purposes of this paper let us consider damage to be the removal of a node in any one of the layers we then consider a functional component as one that is supported in the physical solution by all of its relationships in the logical architecture in this work support is defined as a functioning logical relationship within the physical solution between components under the operational architecture thus for a fixed physical solution vulnerability analyses can be categorized based on the operational architecture definition this study considers three types of operational architectures 1 undirected connectivity a path between components exists through an undirected network representation of the physical solution 2 directed connectivity a path between components exists through a directed network representation of the physical solution 3 flow analysis components receive sufficient resource flow from a source to satisfy demand through a flow network representation of the physical solution where each edge has a capacity and components are assigned resource supply or demand values resource flow between components is distributed to maximize the number of satisfied components to better contextualize what the above operational architectures entail consider a radar component with logical connections to the chill water center for cooling and the electrical generator for power in undirected connectivity the radar is functional if there is any path through the physical solution network from the chill water center to the radar through the chill water layer and from electrical generator to the radar through the electrical power layer in directed connectivity the same analysis is conducted using directed network paths versus undirected network paths flow analysis considers if there is sufficient resource flow from the chill water center and the generator through their respective flow network plexes each of these analysis types can be conducted on a single plex of the interdependent network independently or can be extended to include the entire multiplex network as one in this study we consider each of the three static responses for both the independent and interdependent cases for a total of six analysis conditions to compare each of these damage analysis types a score function was created representing the ratio of functioning components in the presence of damage to the initial total number of components in the system fig 1 describes how each operational architecture can be used in early stage ship design essd and the implications of independent and interdependent system analysis table 1 summarizes the primary defining aspects of each analysis method the table separates the analysis methods into two distinct groups those which consider individual systems independently and those which consider the net integrated system design as was previously outlined the amount of required knowledge increases between the undirected directed and flow analyses the integrated solution requires the presence of interdependencies to be known and represented between network plexes and thus the amount of information required to conduct the analysis increases moving down the table the increase in required information allows for more detailed system information to be elicited and thus would be expected to occur later in essd stages 2 1 vulnerability analysis methodology the undirected connectivity directed connectivity and flow analyses are applied separately to each independent network and are also applied to the total interdependent network these analysis methods match the level of knowledge a system designer would possess in early stages of design for example when component load profiles are unknown connectivity information may be available and survivability analyses can still be conducted thus these different algorithms were considered in order to understand what conditions can elicit cascading failures using the same network structures this section presents an overview of how these algorithms are applied to each network structure each analysis method has the same basic algorithmic structure when applied to the layers independently or to the total interdependent network in both cases damage is inflicted to the physical system solution network by removing a node or group of nodes and all edges connected to that node or nodes in all system layers after damage each component in the physical system solution is checked for functionality the method in which the demand is satisfied differs among the undirected directed and flow analyses the goals of including these analysis methods are as follows independent cases the goal of analyzing the systems independently is to show that the survivability of the integrated system solution is not a simple combination of individual survivability analyses and that cascading failures are not elicited interdependent cases the goal of analyzing the interdependent networks is to illustrate that considering interdependencies between distributed systems is crucial to accurately represent vessel vulnerabilities and to show that cascading failures can be elicited in early stages of design connectivity cases the goal is to show that additional information is required to elicit cascades other than a simple connectivity model although areas of concern can be highlighted directed cases the goal is to show that adding directed edges uncovers additional failure modes and provides value to designers in essd flow cases the goal is to show that network flow analyses provide enough detail for early stages of distributed system design to highlight areas of concern in the integrated ship solution by uncovering cascading failures in the independent case each plex of the multiplex network structure is analyzed separately a separate vulnerability analysis is conducted on each system a component which loses functionality in one layer will not transfer that damage to any other layers in the interdependent network analyses the same metric is applied to each layer however if a component loses functionality in one layer the component loses functionality in all other layers this adds an additional iterative step to each analysis method this is summarized in fig 4 the undirected and directed connectivity analyses identify if each component s demand is satisfied by checking if paths exist from the demand source to that component in the presence of damage on a single layer if a single path exists between the demand source and component then the component is considered functioning if no paths exist then the component loses functionality in the independent case the component only loses functionality within that system in the interdependent case the loss of functionality propagates potentially causing new component failures in other layers the flow analysis methods calculate component demand satisfaction in slightly more detail a minimum cost network flow analysis is used to determine demand routings through the network and determine which components are functioning as capacities are specified for edges in each logical system architecture the network flows are functions of both the component demands as well as the edge capacities the vulnerability analysis process is summarized in fig 5 the boxes in black indicate the processes conducted in the independent network vulnerability analyses and the red boxes indicate the additional processes required for the interdependent analyses 2 2 illustrative cases before demonstrating the algorithm and analyses on the full scale ship network consider two illustrative examples that elucidate the differences between the analysis methods we begin by considering the simple 2 2 grid shown in fig 6 this set of nodes represents the physical system architecture a generator g is placed at node 0 and a component c is located at node 3 in this example two indicative distributed systems are routed through the physical system architecture network and are highlighted as edges in green and blue for system 1 and 2 respectively the generator supplies 1 unit negative demand to the component in system 1 which requires 1 unit to function positive demand in system 2 the component supplies 1 unit to the generator which requires 1 unit to operate thus there is a coupling between the two components which are linked through two different systems to analyze this set of systems each node in the physical solution network is removed sequentially the analyses are conducted and the operability scores are recorded the operability score is defined as the fraction of the total number of original components which remain functional across all systems when a node is removed from the network the results from this analysis are presented in fig 7 the results displayed in fig 7 highlight the importance of considering interdependent systems for all analysis conditions removing either the generator or component at nodes 0 and 3 respectively causes the system to fail however when considered as two independent networks either g or c remain functional when node 1 or 2 is removed which breaks the path between the components in at least one of the two systems but suggests the components are still operational the score of 50 arises from the separate consideration of the two systems in one system the path is broken and the sink cannot receive the adequate demand from the source while the other system path remains unchanged this analysis method does not account for the subsequent failure in the non damaged system due to an inoperable component due to coupling in these systems it is expected that the entire system should fail if any node in the physical network is damaged which is highlighted in the interdependent analyses which scores zeros for all node removals it is also worth noting that this example illustrates the ability to consider damage of the physical connectivity between components rather than just the components themselves while the previous example highlights the importance of considering interdependent systems it is too simple to highlight differences between the directed undirected and flow analysis methods for this we expand our 2 2 physical system architecture to a larger 4 4 grid three components are located within this network one generator g and two components c 1 and c 2 two systems are routed through these geometric nodes in two separate plexes of an interdependent network fig 8 fig 8 depicts the two systems shown in blue and green routed through the 4 4 physical system architecture in the first system the generator is a source with a value of 10 units and each component has a demand of 5 units in this system the generator has sufficient supply for both components in the second system each component is a source producing 5 units and the generator has a demand of 10 units system 2 could represent a feedback system which requires input from the components to operate cooling water information etc in this case it is assumed that each sink requires 100 of its demand in order to operate each edge is assigned a maximum capacity of 10 units such that any one edge can support all of the flow from any source to sink in either system the problem has been formulated in this way such that the removal of any component or node on a critical path should cause a cascade of failures throughout both systems each node is damaged removed one at a time and the system s static response is analyzed using the operability scoring metric for each of the 6 aforementioned methods the results from this analysis are presented in fig 9 the static system s score after damage is plotted as a function of the individually damaged node this provides interesting insight into the response of the tested system under the different analysis methods it is important to note that in all analysis cases the removal of the generator node 0 causes a complete failure of the system which is to be expected while the previous 2 2 example highlighted the importance of considering the greater interdependent network this larger example highlights the impact of the analysis method on the way the system s response is understood the undirected connectivity cases for both the independent and cross connected cases demonstrate the least severe response this is because the undirected nodes do not account for the directivity of the connections it is simply a measure of whether paths exist throughout the grid to get from the sources to the sinks the undirected nodes allow for many additional paths to be realized throughout the network which can circumvent a removed node much more easily it also does not account for the demands of each component the scores decrease to 2 3 for the cases where nodes 12 and 15 are removed individually which correspond to components 1 and 2 respectively this suggests that the system is still operable in the event that component 1 or component 2 is removed in this case the results from the independent and interdependent networks are the same as the only node which affects the score is a component which is removed i e there always exists numerous paths throughout the interdependent and cross connected networks between the sources and sinks the directed connectivity analysis provides more conservative results than the undirected case by highlighting two additional nodes which cause a decrease in score this is due to the consideration of the direction of edges throughout the network which limits the number of paths that can be taken from the source to sinks in addition to the components themselves nodes 4 and 8 also cause failures to be realized in the system this is because nodes 4 and 8 both lie on the only directed path between the generator node 0 and component 1 node 12 thus removing either of these nodes will cause a failure in component 1 which will reduce the system score to 2 3 functional components although these values are more conservative than the undirected cases they still suggest that the system is mostly operable under these damage conditions similar to the undirected case the interdependent and independent networks have identical score functions as the physical system architecture is dense enough so that a path always exists between sources and sinks even when that node is removed in both systems the flow analysis is the most conservative estimation of the static system response to damage and behaves differently in the cases between independent and interdependent networks in the independent case the same critical nodes are highlighted from the connectivity case however node 1 is also highlighted as an area of concern this is because node 1 lies on all potential paths to receive demand from component 2 in system 2 thus component 2 fails in system 2 but due to the consideration of these systems as independent the failures do not cascade this also results in lower scores being recorded when nodes 12 or 15 are damaged which correspond to the two components in this case damaging the component in system 2 results in insufficient demand satisfaction in the generator which results in only one of the three components remaining operational the flow analysis conducted on the cross connected system is the most conservative and the most accurate analysis method this method captures the total failure of the system in the event that any component or critical node is removed the entire system fails this is the only tested method which captures the full extent of the connected systems failures and uncovers cascading failures the results are summarized in table 2 3 ship case study using the same approach as the two illustrative cases an analysis was conducted on a model based on the electric ship research and development consortium medium voltage dc esrdc mvdc all electric ship chalfant and chryssostomidis 2011 chryssostomidis and cooke 2015 this ship model was selected due to the crucial role the distributed electrical system plays in both the combat and propulsion systems this provides a platform on which to conduct the vulnerability analyses as there exists enough detail to conduct each analysis method on the electrical system at a preliminary design level the physical system architecture network was created to describe the three dimensional spatial arrangement basic layout of the esrdc all electric ship with the fewest possible nodes a total of 135 nodes were used to create the physical system architecture fig 10 the model consists of three transverse layers each comprised of 45 nodes the three transverse layers are identical in layout and are arranged to match the basic geometry of the esrdc ship each node in the transverse layer is connected to the node in the same geometric location transversely the vessel is separated longitudinally into 4 damage zones with 4 load centers so the created model was selected to be 8 nodes long this enabled each damage zone to have a forward and aft node vertically the model has a total of 8 decks 5 within the hull and 3 in the superstructure this was selected to provide enough nodes to adequately model the ship s geometry as well as the locations of the system components it is worth noting that although the ship model s physical system architecture is described in 3d physical space the connections between compartments and the relationships between the geometry is describable in 2d network space which enables the multiplex network to be created fig 11 two distributed systems were considered as logical system architectures an electrical system chalfant and chryssostomidis 2011 chryssostomidis and cooke 2015 and a representative cooling water system a brief description of each system will be outlined in this section the electrical system consists of two prime movers two emergency generators port and starboard two propulsion motors port and starboard an energy storage device radar four representative load centers and one pulsed load all components are fed by a ring bus layout the electrical system is separated into 4 damage zones each pair of motors generators and prime movers are intentionally located in different longitudinal damage zones each damage zone contains two power control modules pcm one located forward and one aft the forward pcm is located starboard low and the aft port high these are responsible for converting electrical power appropriately for the components in each zone the supply and demand values for the electrical system components were also based on the equipment loads described in the esrdc ship the physical electrical system solution was created and is shown in fig 12 the cooling water system was developed as an illustrative example by which to consider an additional distribution system this system contains two cooling sources which are located low in the vessel along the centerline also connected to a ring bus layout the demands on the cooling water system were developed to be indicative of a different systems onboard all components provided with electrical power are also provided with cooling water with routings emanating from the ring bus this system is illustrated in fig 13 the above physical system solutions were used to conduct a vulnerability analysis similar to that described in the demonstrative cases the same algorithms were employed and the results are displayed in fig 14 the results shown in fig 14 provide some interesting insights into the performance of each analysis method and the vessel s observed vulnerability the analysis results follow comparatively similar behavior to that seen in the illustrative cases first the flow analyses identify more severe failure dynamics than both forms of connectivity analyses second consideration of system interdependence is required for identification of many critical failure modes directed and undirected analyses differ slightly between independent and interdependent cases small differences exist at nodes 6 and 7 the similarity is likely due to the density of the network as was discussed in the second illustrative case when a sufficient number of paths exist throughout the network the removal of any one node does not in general affect the ability to route through the network whether the edges are directed or not in all cases nodes 48 and 53 are identified as areas of concern by showing a significant drop in score when those nodes are damaged node 48 coincides with the location of one of the cooling sources and node 53 lies on a critical path to and from that cooling source in both systems see figs 12 and 13 for reference this analysis illustrates that the entire system takes a large hit when this source is damaged this too coincides with the illustrative cases the most significant damage to the system is observed when a component takes a direct hit and the routings are less critical these yield predictable results which fall within the scope of traditional vulnerability assessments but do not highlight cascading failures although the directed and undirected results are generally similar for this application the undirected cases still provide the most conservative results in viewing nodes 6 8 112 120 127 and 131 the undirected cases provide a score higher by approximately 4 this follows previous observations of the analysis methods undirected connectivity analysis allows branches of the distribution system which connects components to the main bus to act as a redundant path for the damaged routing in the directed connectivity analysis these branches only allow paths to the component but not through it preventing the redundancy in particular scenarios this limitation can reduce the number of components functioning after damage the flow independent cases highlight the same damage propagation as the directed and undirected connectivity cases while increasing severity and identifying new failure modes for example the flow independent case highlights nodes 46 and node 51 as additional areas of concern which correspond with the other cooling source and its critical paths in both systems none of the connectivity algorithms highlight this node as a failure mode as there is no demand requirement being considered the components in the power system are still connected to the other cooling source and thus pass the connectivity case although in reality they may not actually be functioning due to an insufficient cooling water supply interdependent flow analysis identifies cascades which are not highlighted in other methods this is evident in nodes 6 8 and 51 of which 8 is the most severe damage at node 8 highlights a cascade resulting in the entire system being inoperable which is not elicited in any other of the tested analysis methods these critical nodes correspond to locations in each of the systems crucial routing paths between the sources and sinks these damage scenarios highlight cases where damage to the physical connectivity between components can have a significant effect on the system s ability to withstand damage once again the differences between analysis results confirm the behavior shown in the illustrative cases and the limitations of each method independent flow analysis considers the functionality of components at the supply and demand level further restricting the connectivity results introducing the interdependent case causes damage propagation through flow bottlenecks and successive component loss flow bottlenecks occur when the capacity on an edge is less than the total demand it is required to support this causes one or multiple components supported by that edge to fail due to lacking supply successive component loss occurs when the failure of one component prevents it from supplying resources to other components causing subsequent failures the severity of damage was increased by including a damage radius measure within the algorithm when an individual node is damaged the damage radius indicates how many adjacent nodes from the target node are damaged for this example the radius is set at 1 meaning that for each node damaged all adjacent nodes were also damaged as well as all edges associated with that node this mimics a larger or more severe blast or perhaps the case where a blast in one compartment affects the components in adjacent compartments the results from this analysis are presented in fig 15 comparing the results in fig 15 with those in fig 14 it is obvious that the damage is more severe than the individual node damage this is evidenced by the lower average scores as well as the higher number of detrimental hits in this case larger sections of adjacent nodes are removed resulting in more damage to the paths through the network this analysis confirms the same susceptible locations as the one node damage case and highlights system failures which would otherwise have low predictability more cascades are elicited than in the previous case and the importance of interdependent networks becomes even more critical the results from increased damage elicit a structure in the results which was not present in the previous damage case for all analysis methods scores increase between nodes 0 44 45 89 and 90 134 which correspond to the starboard center and port layers of the ship respectively figs 12 and 13 this trend highlights that damage incurred low in the vessel towards the stern has the most significant affect on the ship s operability and thus is critical from a system design perspective the same areas in the network are highlighted as susceptible to hits around nodes 8 and 48 with some small differences while the exact node damaged changes slightly the areas of concern remain the same for example in damaging node 48 the score remains much the same as the one node damage case slightly lower scores however additional failure modes are elicited in damaging nodes 47 and 52 in this case all analysis methods highlight that a hit at node 47 causes complete system failures as both cooling sources get damaged however the interdependent analyses are the only methods which highlight the complete loss of system functionality at node 52 which destroys all critical pathways to and from each cooling source these are critical cases to consider as these additional failures are only elicited by a larger blast radius additionally a similar trend is observed when considering the difference between independent and interdependent systems with added damage for example in fig 14 a hit incurred at node 7 has very little effect on the system s overall operability when considering additional damage node 7 becomes a critical node in the directed case node 7 has a significantly larger impact on system operability in the interdependent case than in the independent case when node 7 is severely damaged the ring bus configuration is damaged in both the power and cooling systems which causes a cascade of failures resulting in the complete loss of the system thus it has been shown that the system responses differ in the presence of different damage extents by exploring the effects of more severe damage additional insight is gained into the system design and highlights additional areas of susceptibility in the system design which may affect the vessel s survivability the results to be concluded from this analysis are summarized below connectivity and directed analysis methods highlight a few areas of concern however do not accurately reflect the systems final vulnerability score the connectivity analysis methods yield the most conservative results highlights the fewest areas of concern the directed connectivity highlights additional areas of concern however the flow analyses elicit the most cascades and most accurately highlights the integrated system vulnerability the flow analyses highlight additional failure modes associated with critical paths between components considering systems independently do not capture the integrated system vulnerabilities accurately the system interdependencies are crucial in capturing cascades the analysis method enables a range of damage extents to be considered these damage radii are critical in highlighting additional system failure modes 4 conclusion in this paper the ability to conduct distributed system centric vulnerability analysis during the early stages of ship design has been illustrated and demonstrated employing network descriptions of distributed system solutions enables novel survivability analyses that extend the current component based methods several new vulnerability analyses have been described which consider an array of methodologies including undirected and directed connectivity analyses as well as sink source flow analyses these analysis methods were compared in interdependent and dependent systems to identify the effect of cascading failures the importance of considering these factors was demonstrated using two illustrative examples these vulnerability analysis methods were applied to distributed systems in a developed ship model which confirmed the lessons learned in the illustrative examples additionally cascading failures were shown to exist and were highlighted using our analysis methods the method described in this paper has the flexibility toward application to any distributed system configuration coupling component reliability with distributed system connectivity analysis enables a novel approach to survivability most importantly it enables the designer to better understand key areas of the systems which may cause cascading failures rendering a ship dead in the water and to understand this at early design stages it also allows the designer to evaluate varying degrees of damage to explore the systems vulnerabilities the approach presented enables the additional failure modes in the connections between components to be uncovered as shown in the comparison between independent and interdependent analyses many of these failure modes cannot be identified without considering the effects of distributed systems additionally this method could also be utilized to consider a range of ship configurations to investigate the effect of physical ship architectures on vessel survivability the method is flexible enough to consider different zonal layouts and redundancies in both superstructure arrangements and multi hull architectures highlighting areas of concern for cascading failures in naval ships is an area which will continue to emerge as a crucial step in the ship design process as distributed systems on naval vessels continue to become more interconnected identifying critical failure modes early in the design process will be crucial in delivering the future of naval ships while this work has provided value by allowing distributed systems to be analyzed earlier in the ship design process it has several limitations this work only considers static representations of the developed networks and thus there exists extensive work to be conducted on the following quasi static and or dynamic consideration of flows and system response larger networks with more components and more routed systems expanding the algorithm to damage different parts of the vessel not just geometrically adjacent nodes by expanding the network to contain more nodes and systems with additional operational detail it is believed that additional complex interactions and cascading failures will be elicited and can be combated in early stages of ship design

23621,recently along with the development of data driven models artificial neural networks ann have been used in ocean wave forecasting models hybridization of ann with wavelet analysis or fuzzy logic approach has also been used the wavelet and neural network hybrid models wnn models show better performance than ann models however their accuracy decreases with increasing lead time because they do not consider the relation between wave and meteorological variables moreover the wnn model has been developed to forecast the wave height at a single location where the past wave height data are available to resolve these problems in this paper a hybrid model is developed by combining the empirical orthogonal function analysis and wavelet analysis with the neural network abbreviated as eofwnn

specific location is required for ocean and coastal engineering operations since the physical process of wave generation by wind is basically uncertain complex non linear and non stationary it is not fully understood yet despite of considerable advances in computational techniques the solutions obtained by numerically solving the equations of wave growth are neither exact nor uniformly applicable at all sites and at all times due to the complexity and uncertainty of the wave generation phenomenon deo et al 2001 since the last decade an alternative approach based on the use of data driven

suitable for partially understood underlying physical processes such as wind wave relationship a major issue in this type of forecasting is the selection of appropriate input data patterns that are likely to influence the desired output even though the ann has flexibility it may not be able to cope with non stationary data without preprocessing the input and output data cannas et al 2006 in recent years hybridization of ann with other techniques has been used in wave height forecasting to overcome the limitation of ann and to provide effective modelling özger 2010 proposed the combination of wavelet and fuzzy logic approaches to forecast wave heights up to 48 h lead time the correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted wave heights were between 0 647 and 0 745 which were larger than those of auto regressive moving average arma ann and fuzzy logic models deka and prahlada 2012 and prahlada and deka 2015 used a wavelet and neural network wnn model to forecast significant wave heights up to 48 h lead time using 3 hourly wave height observation data their results showed good predictions at shorter lead times but lower accuracies at longer lead times dixit and londhe 2016 also used wnn technique to predict extreme wave heights up to 36 h lead time for five major hurricanes shahabi et al 2017 developed genetic programming based wavelet transform to forecast significant wave heights up to 48 h lead time the wnn hybrid model showed better prediction performance than the ann model but some deviation was observed at longer lead times in many hybrid models for forecasting wave heights only wave height data have been used as the input data the dominance of persistence in the wave height time series should be considered in wave forecasting models however the dominance of persistence decreases as the lag time increases therefore considering the relationship between wave and meteorological variables becomes more important as the lead time increases however it is difficult to interpret the relationship between spatially distributed meteorological and wave data using an ann or wnn model moreover there is a limitation in using ann or wnn model in that the model cannot forecast spatially distributed wave heights together in other words it is necessary to develop and run the model for each location separately in this study an eofwnn model is developed by combining the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis and wavelet analysis with the neural network to forecast significant wave heights in multiple locations simultaneously the input data of the model are the past wave height data and the past and future meteorological reanalysis data in the surrounding area including the wave stations the model then calculates the wave heights in the locations simultaneously for various lead times the developed model is employed to forecast significant wave heights in eight wave observation stations in the coastal waters around the east japan sea 2 description of data the significant wave height data were obtained at two wave stations gangneung and wangdolcho operated by kiost korea institute of ocean science and technology and at six different locations genkainada tottori fukui sakata aomori and rumoi of nowphas nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours fig 1 shows the locations of wave measurement and table 1 presents the information on the wave stations and the statistical properties of wave data at each station the stations are located along the coast of the east japan sea even though they are far from one another the entire area in the east japan sea is governed by an identical meteorological system therefore it is assumed that the wave data at different stations show similar physical processes the wave data of kiost were obtained every 30 min whereas the wave data of nowphas were obtained every 20 min since the time intervals of the input data at multiple stations must be same the latter were converted into 30 min interval data the data at every hour were used as they were but the data at 30 min after every hour were calculated by taking the average of the data observed at 20 and 40 min after the hour the meteorological data used in this paper were the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis data provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate diagnostics center noaa cdc the 10 m height wind speeds in the u direction east west and v direction north south and the sea level pressure were used the temporal resolution was 30 min interval interpolated from 6 h interval data and the spatial resolution was t62 gaussian grid for wind speed data which roughly corresponds to 220 km in the u direction and to 280 km in the v direction and are 2 5 2 5 grid for sea level pressure data fig 2 shows the region of meteorological data which is 127 142 e 33 46 n experiments were conducted for winter season from october to february the period used in this study was from october 2010 to february 2011 3 methodology the eof analysis is a useful tool to interpret physical processes in spatio temporal data because it can separate the spatial patterns and temporal fluctuations of the data in this study the eof analysis is introduced to interpret the relationship between waves and meteorological data also the eof analysis enables the proposed model to forecast waves at multiple stations simultaneously the eof analysis assumes stationarity of the data however some geophysical and climatic variables have periodically time dependent covariance statistics or non stationarity the stationarity assumption is often not appropriate for such geophysical and climate variables even after removing the diurnal cycle or the seasonal cycle kim et al 2015 to overcome the stationarity assumption of the eof analysis the wavelet analysis is incorporated in this study the wavelet analysis which provides a perfect filtering characteristic has been used in various fields of mathematics science and engineering unlike the fourier technique or eof analysis the basis function of the wavelet transform has the key property of localization in time or space and frequency this makes the wavelets handle non stationary and transient signals as well as fractal type structure murguia and campos cantón 2006 it may seem more reasonable to perform the wavelet analysis first and then perform the eof analysis to make the signal stationary however the wavelet analysis can only deal with spatial or temporal data the wave and meteorological data used in this study were not independent data at each station but spatio temporal data the eof analysis can separate the spatio temporal data into spatial distribution and temporal variation therefore we performed the eof analysis first and then additionally performed the wavelet analysis to overcome the stationarity assumption of the eof analysis the decomposed wavelet time series are then used as inputs to the ann which can handle non stationary nonlinear data efficiently 3 1 eof analysis the eof analysis also known as the principal component analysis or singular value decomposition method can be effectively utilized to link the spatial and temporal patterns of a data field legler 1983 the eof analysis is mainly based on using the spatial correlation of the field and this technique aims at finding a new set of variables that capture most of the observed variance from the data through a linear combination of the original variables hannachi 2004 the analysis partitions the temporal variance of the data into orthogonal spatial patterns called eigenvectors the assumption in the eof analysis is the stationarity of the data it means that the covariance function of the data does not depend on time the spatio temporal data can be decomposed in terms of eofs that is 1 t x t n t n t b n x where b n x are called the eigenfunctions and t n t are the expansion of the coefficients that are functions of time eq 1 is called the eof decomposition only if b n x are mutually orthogonal to each other and t n t are mutually uncorrelated that is 2 b n x b m x 1 n x 1 n b n x b m x δ n m 3 t n t t m t 1 n t 1 n t n t t m t λ n δ n m where δ n m is the kronecker delta and λ n is the eigenvalues often b n x are called the loading vectors t n t the principal component pc time series 3 2 wavelet analysis the wavelet analysis is used to decompose or reconstruct a signal using the wavelet functions the wavelets are a family of orthogonal functions of type 4 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a a b r a 0 generated from a mother wavelet function ψ t by dilation and translation operations which are governed by the scale factor a and shift factor b respectively the continuous wavelet transform cwt and its reconstruction version of a signal f t l 2 r are defines as 5 w f a b a 1 2 f t ψ t b a d t f t ψ a b 6 f t c ψ 1 w f a b ψ a b t a 2 d a d b where ψ t b a is the complex conjugate of ψ t b a c ψ f ψ ω 2 ω d ω and f ψ ω is the fourier transform of ψ t to avoid the redundancy in cwt the so called dyadic discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually adopted in engineering practice letting a 2 j a n d b 2 j k j k z eqs 5 and 6 may be rewritten in a dyadic discrete form 7 w f a b w f 2 j 2 j k 2 j ψ 2 j t k f t d t 8 f t j k w f 2 j 2 j k ψ 2 j t k a detailed explanation of the wavelet decomposition procedure can be found in wang et al 2004 in the wavelet analysis the original series are decomposed into an approximation and details the approximation is the high scale low frequency component of the signal whereas the details are the low scale high frequency components by the filtering process at its most basic level the original signal passes through two complementary filters and emerges as two signals the selection of a suitable level for the hierarchy depends on the signal and experience often the level is chosen based on a desired low pass cutoff frequency there are several types of wavelet families such as daubechies biorthogonal coiflets symlets and morlet some researchers to forecast significant wave heights using a wnn model have used daubechies deka and prahlada 2012 prahlada and deka 2015 however coiflet5 coif5 was used in this study which was built by i daubechies at the request of r coifman and which is similar to daubechies wavelet in a certain level but much more symmetrical than daubechies the symmetry property is useful in the signal analysis due to the linear phase of the transfer function huang and hsieh 2002 the wavelet analysis was carried out using matlab 3 3 artificial neural networks the artificial neural network ann is suitable for partially understood underlying physical processes such as wind wave relationship fig 3 shows the structure of feed forward back propagation type of ann which consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer these layers have one or more nodes to avoid the problem of overfitting that may occur while an ann is being trained the number of nodes in the hidden layer z of the nets employed in the first stage of the study was computed using one of the empirical expressions mentioned by fletcher and goss 1993 9 2 n 1 2 m where n is the number of input nodes and m is the number of output nodes there are several training algorithms such as resilient back propagation rp scaled conjugate gradient scg conjugate gradient powell beale cgb broyden fletcher goldfarb bfg and levenberg marquardt lm among the algorithms the lm is the fastest method for training moderate sized feedforward neural networks however it requires the storage of some matrices that can be quite large for certain problems in this study the network is very large so one of the conjugated gradient algorithms is recommended beale et al 2012 kalra et al 2005 compared the prediction performance of the five algorithms and mentioned that the cgb produced the most accurate results among the algorithms therefore the cgb scheme was used in this study the ann model implementation was carried out using matlab toolbox in this paper ann ensembles were used to improve the generalization ability of ann the simplest way for creating various ensemble members was used which is to train each network using randomly initialized weights after averaging the whole ensemble members the rmse root mean square error between ensemble average result and each ensemble member was calculated the two cases with the largest rmse were removed and then the remaining ensemble members were averaged the iteration was 20 times and the networks training was stopped after maximum 10 000 epochs 3 4 eof wavelet ann eofwnn model the eofwnn model was constructed by combining the eof analysis and discrete wavelet transform with neural networks to obtain a powerful nonlinear ability and to forecast spatially distributed wave height series fig 4 is the schematic diagram of the eofwnn model first the eof analysis is conducted for wave data and meteorological data to separate spatial and temporal components for training period each variable is decomposed into several modes which corresponded 99 9 variance of the series second the wavelet analysis is applied to each pc time series of wave data and meteorological data the decomposed wavelet signal at level n is consisted of sub signals of an approximation and n details next training is conducted with the decomposed wavelet signals of wind speed sea level pressure and wave height data as input data and with each pc time series of wave height data for various lead times as target finally the forecasted wave height pc time series and the lvs obtained in the first step i e eof analysis are reconstructed to calculate the wave height time series at multiple stations for various lead times 4 model formulations as mentioned above the decomposed wavelet signals of wave data and meteorological data are used as the input to the ann which are those of all the decomposed pc time series of significant wave height and the approximations of 90 pc time series of meteorological data to consider the dominance of persistence in the wave height time series the significant wave heights at the present time and the previous two time steps were used as predictors to consider the time lag effect of the meteorological data the meteorological data at the forecast lead time and at one and six time steps ahead of that time were used as predictors in summary the scenario formed by the predictor configuration to predict h t n δ t is h t h t δ t h t 2 δ t w n d t n δ t w n d t n δ t δ t w n d t n δ t 6 δ t s l p t n δ t s l p t n δ t δ t s l p t n δ t 6 δ t here h t is the wavelet component of the present wave height h t δ t and h t 2 δ t are those of previous time steps h t n δ t is the pc time series of significant wave height at the forecast lead time w n d t n δ t and s l p t n δ t are the wavelet components of wind speed and sea level pressure at the forecast lead time and w n d t n δ t δ t w n d t n δ t 6 δ t s l p t n δ t δ t and s l p t n δ t 6 δ t are those at previous time steps from the forecast lead time and n δ t denotes the forecast lead time the lead times were fixed as 1 3 12 and 24 h with the use of δ t 0 5 hr the meteorological data at δ t and 6 δ t ahead of the forecast lead time were arbitrarily chosen by supposing that the wave height at a certain time would be closely related to the meteorological conditions at 30 min and 3 h ahead of the time experiments were conducted for the winter season from october to february during which extratropical storms frequently occur in the east japan sea the experimental period in this study was from october 2010 to february 2011 two models are used for forecasting real time significant wave heights the first model is for 1 and 3 h lead times and the second is for 12 and 24 h lead times in the first model training was conducted for 120 days 00 00 october 1 2010 to 23 30 january 28 2011 and testing was conducted for 7 days 00 00 january 29 2011 to 23 30 february 4 2011 using the weights and bias obtained from the training period in the second model training was conducted for 120 days before each forecast time and testing was conducted for the consecutive 3 day period deep uncertainty exists in forecasting real time significant wave heights especially at longer lead times therefore training was conducted for 120 days to reflect the physical processes such as seasonal variations in training and to reduce the end effect of the wavelet analysis generally it is suggested to use about 70 and 30 of the data for training and testing respectively in this study however we validated the model for a short period when peak events occur the eofwnn model was used to forecast the wave heights for various lead times of 1 h 24 h with 3rd 5th and 7th wavelet decomposition levels 5 analysis and results to evaluate the performance of the eofwnn and wnn models the results of the two models were compared at gangneung sakata and aomori wave stations the first two stations are located at the open coasts on the korean side and japanese side respectively with similar latitudes whereas the aomori station is located inside a bay where the wave heights are relatively small to find the effect of spatially distributed meteorological variables we compared the results depending on the input variables for two models only wave height records or wave heights and meteorological variables wind speed and sea level pressure the eofwnn model with wave heights and meteorological variables and the wnn model with wave heights were compared depending on the decomposed wavelet levels the decomposed level for the eofwnn model with wave heights only and the wnn model with whole inputs was fixed at 7 to evaluate the performance of the models three different performance indices are employed which are correlation coefficient r index of agreement i a and normalized root mean square error nrmse calculated by eqs 10 12 10 r 1 i x i y i 2 i x i x 2 11 i a 1 i x i y i 2 i y i y x i x 2 12 n r m s e i x i y i 2 n x where x i y i x y and n are the observed wave height forecasted wave height mean of observed wave height mean of forecasted wave height and the number of observations respectively table 2 shows the results of the wnn model at gangneung sakata and aomori for several lead times for 1 and 3 h lead times the values of r and i a were close to one regardless of the decomposition level and the nrmse values were distributed between 0 073 and 0 164 for longer lead times the values of r and i a decreased drastically and the nrmse values increased the model prediction accuracy is reduced with increasing lead time whereas it is enhanced with higher decomposition level it is worthy of note that the model accuracy at aomori is lower than those at other stations because the wave heights are relatively small at aomori which is located inside a bay as shown in fig 1 the first stage of the eofwnn model is the eof analysis of the wave and meteorological data through the eof analysis the input time series are decomposed into several modes and separated into spatial and temporal components figs 5 and 6 show the first four modes of the eigenvectors of wind velocity and sea level pressure respectively they represent the physical patterns of the spatial distribution of the meteorological data figs 7 and 8 show the corresponding pc time series note that the leading eof modes that explain 90 of variance are used in the following analysis even though only the first four modes are shown in the figures fig 9 represent the first four modes of the pc time series for significant wave height next by employing the wavelet analysis for each pc time series for 3 5 and 7 decomposition levels several wavelet components were produced fig 10 shows the wavelet components for the 3rd decomposition level of the first mode of the significant wave height pc time series which consist of one approximation and three details the decomposed subseries were then used as input parameters to forecast the pc time series of the significant wave height for different lead times after training the model the pc time series of the significant wave height were forecasted using the testing data then the forecasted pc time series and the lvs from the eof analysis were reconstructed to obtain the predicted wave height the results obtained from the eofwnn model at the eight stations are summarized in tables 3 6 for different lead times the performance of the eofwnn model for short lead times i e 1 and 3 h was similar to those of the wnn model the values of r and i a were close to one regardless of the decomposition level and the nrmse values were distributed between 0 074 and 0 265 the eofwnn model showed high accuracy even for longer lead times i e 12 and 24 h even at the 3rd decomposition level the values of nrmse were under 0 226 figs 11 13 show the observed and forecasted significant wave height time series by the wnn and eofwnn models with the 7th decomposition level at 24 h lead time in gangneung sakata and aomori respectively both models forecasted the overall behavior of the observed data but the eofwnn model proposed in this study showed more accurate results than the wnn model fig 14 compares the index of agreement of the eofwnn and wnn models corresponding to different decomposition levels for different lead times at gangneung sakata and aomori both models show lower accuracy with increasing lead time and higher accuracy with increasing decomposition level the accuracy of the wnn model with low decomposition level drastically declined for longer lead times however the accuracy of the eofwnn model was not significantly affected by the decomposition level the accuracy of the eofwnn model was much better than that of the wnn model for longer lead times 6 conclusions previous wnn model was used to forecast significant wave heights by only training the observed wave data at a single location showing lower accuracy at longer lead times probably due to the lack of consideration of the relationship between spatially distributed meteorological variables and waves in this study an eofwnn model was developed to take this relationship into account by combining the eof analysis and wavelet analysis with the neural network and by using the observed wave data at multiple locations and the past and future meteorological data in the surrounding area including the wave observation stations the developed model is also able to forecast the wave heights at multiple locations simultaneously and thus it is more convenient and more accurate than the previous wnn model that was developed for each location separately the developed model was employed to forecast significant wave heights for various lead times at eight stations in the coastal waters around the east japan sea the model results at gangneung sakata and aomori were compared with those of the wnn model depending on different input conditions only wave data or both wave and the meteorological data the wnn model using both data showed bad performance because the ann cannot find the relationship between the spatially distributed meteorological variables and waves when only the wave data are used the two models showed similar performance with slightly better accuracy by the wnn model the values of nrmse for the wnn model for 24 hr lead time were between 0 140 and 0 289 and those for the eofwnn model were between 0 155 and 0 263 even though all the wave observation stations are located in the east japan sea they are far from each other therefore using the individual wave data at each station gives better performance than using all the wave data at multiple locations for longer lead times on the other hand the eofwnn model using both wave and meteorological data showed much better performance than the wnn model using only wave data for all the lead times regardless of the wavelet decomposition level even at the 3rd decomposition level the nrmse values for the eofwnn model were under 0 226 for longer lead times while those for the wnn model were under 0 446 the high accuracy of the eofwnn model is attributed to considering the effect of spatially distributed meteorological variables by the eof analysis the eofwnn model is better than the wnn model in that the former shows higher accuracy for longer lead times regardless of the decomposition level and that it forecasts the wave heights at multiple locations together in short the eofwnn model can be a promising tool for forecasting the significant wave heights at multiple locations for a relatively long lead time with high accuracy lastly it should be mentioned that the model showed lower accuracy at the aomori station which is located inside a bay and thus in which the wave height is small compared with other stations it may be desirable to use the model for the wave stations which are located in open coasts so that the magnitudes of wave height are similar to one another acknowledgements this study was performed by the project of investigation of large swell waves and rip currents and development of the disaster response system no

discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually adopted in engineering practice letting a 2 j a n d b 2 j k j k z eqs 5 and 6 may be rewritten in a dyadic discrete form 7 w f a b w f 2 j 2 j k 2 j ψ 2 j t k f t d t 8 f t j k w f 2 j 2 j k ψ 2 j t k a detailed explanation of the wavelet decomposition procedure can be found in wang et al 2004 in the wavelet analysis the original series are decomposed into an approximation and details the approximation is the high scale low frequency component of the signal whereas the details are the low scale high frequency components by the filtering process at its most basic level the original signal passes through two complementary filters and emerges as two signals the selection of a suitable level for the hierarchy depends on the signal and experience often the level is chosen based on a desired low pass cutoff frequency there are several types of wavelet families such as daubechies biorthogonal coiflets symlets and morlet some researchers to forecast significant wave heights using a wnn model have used daubechies deka and prahlada 2012 prahlada and deka 2015 however coiflet5 coif5 was used in this study which was built by i daubechies at the request of r coifman and which is similar to daubechies wavelet in a certain level but much more symmetrical than daubechies the symmetry property is useful in the signal analysis due to the linear phase of the transfer function huang and hsieh 2002 the wavelet analysis was carried out using matlab 3 3 artificial neural networks the artificial neural network ann is suitable for partially understood underlying physical processes such as wind wave relationship fig 3 shows the structure of feed forward back propagation type of ann which consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer these layers have one or more nodes to avoid the problem of overfitting that may occur while an ann is being trained the number of nodes in the hidden layer z of the nets employed in the first stage of the study was computed using one of the empirical expressions mentioned by fletcher and goss 1993 9 2 n 1 2 m where n is the number of input nodes and m is the number of output nodes there are several training algorithms such as resilient back propagation rp scaled conjugate gradient scg conjugate gradient powell beale cgb broyden fletcher goldfarb bfg and levenberg marquardt lm among the algorithms the lm is the fastest method for training moderate sized feedforward neural networks however it requires the storage of some matrices that can be quite large for certain problems in this study the network is very large so one of the conjugated gradient algorithms is recommended beale et al 2012 kalra et al 2005 compared the prediction performance of the five algorithms and mentioned that the cgb produced the most accurate results among the algorithms therefore the cgb scheme was used in this study the ann model implementation was carried out using matlab toolbox in this paper ann ensembles were used to improve the generalization ability of ann the simplest way for creating various ensemble members was used which is to train each network using randomly initialized weights after averaging the whole ensemble members the rmse root mean square error between ensemble average result and each ensemble member was calculated the two cases with the largest rmse were removed and then the remaining ensemble members were averaged the iteration was 20 times and the networks training was stopped after maximum 10 000 epochs 3 4 eof wavelet ann eofwnn model the eofwnn model was constructed by combining the eof analysis and discrete wavelet transform with neural networks to obtain a powerful nonlinear ability and to forecast spatially distributed wave height series fig 4 is the schematic diagram of the eofwnn model first the eof analysis is conducted for wave data and meteorological data to separate spatial and temporal components for training period each variable is decomposed into several modes which corresponded 99 9 variance of the series second the wavelet analysis is applied to each pc time series of wave data and meteorological data the decomposed wavelet signal at level n is consisted of sub signals of an approximation and n details next training is conducted with the decomposed wavelet signals of wind speed sea level pressure and wave height data as input data and with each pc time series of wave height data for various lead times as target finally the forecasted wave height pc time series and the lvs obtained in the first step i e eof analysis are reconstructed to calculate the wave height time series at multiple stations for various lead times 4 model formulations as mentioned above the decomposed wavelet signals of wave data and meteorological data are used as the input to the ann which are those of all the decomposed pc time series of significant wave height and the approximations of 90 pc time series of meteorological data to consider the dominance of persistence in the wave height time series the significant wave heights at the present time and the previous two time steps were used as predictors to consider the time lag effect of the meteorological data the meteorological data at the forecast lead time and at one and six time steps ahead of that time were used as predictors in summary the scenario formed by the predictor configuration to predict h t n δ t is h t h t δ t h t 2 δ t w n d t n δ t w n d t n δ t δ t w n d t n δ t 6 δ t s l p t n δ t s l p t n δ t δ t s l p t n δ t 6 δ t here h t is the wavelet component of the present wave height h t δ t and h t 2 δ t are those of previous time steps h t n δ t is the pc time series of significant wave height at the forecast lead time w n d t n δ t and s l p t n δ t are the wavelet components of wind speed and sea level pressure at the forecast lead time and w n d t n δ t δ t w n d t n δ t 6 δ t s l p t n δ t δ t and s l p t n δ t 6 δ t are those at previous time steps from the forecast lead time and n δ t denotes the forecast lead time the lead times were fixed as 1 3 12 and 24 h with the use of δ t 0 5 hr the meteorological data at δ t and 6 δ t ahead of the forecast lead time were arbitrarily chosen by supposing that the wave height at a certain time would be closely related to the meteorological conditions at 30 min and 3 h ahead of the time experiments were conducted for the winter season from october to february during which extratropical storms frequently occur in the east japan sea the experimental period in this study was from october 2010 to february 2011 two models are used for forecasting real time significant wave heights the first model is for 1 and 3 h lead times and the second is for 12 and 24 h lead times in the first model training was conducted for 120 days 00 00 october 1 2010 to 23 30 january 28 2011 and testing was conducted for 7 days 00 00 january 29 2011 to 23 30 february 4 2011 using the weights and bias obtained from the training period in the second model training was conducted for 120 days before each forecast time and testing was conducted for the consecutive 3 day period deep uncertainty exists in forecasting real time significant wave heights especially at longer lead times therefore training was conducted for 120 days to reflect the physical processes such as seasonal variations in training and to reduce the end effect of the wavelet analysis generally it is suggested to use about 70 and 30 of the data for training and testing respectively in this study however we validated the model for a short period when peak events occur the eofwnn model was used to forecast the wave heights for various lead times of 1 h 24 h with 3rd 5th and 7th wavelet decomposition levels 5 analysis and results to evaluate the performance of the eofwnn and wnn models the results of the two models were compared at gangneung sakata and aomori wave stations the first two stations are located at the open coasts on the korean side and japanese side respectively with similar latitudes whereas the aomori station is located inside a bay where the wave heights are relatively small to find the effect of spatially distributed meteorological variables we compared the results depending on the input variables for two models only wave height records or wave heights and meteorological variables wind speed and sea level pressure the eofwnn model with wave heights and meteorological variables and the wnn model with wave heights were compared depending on the decomposed wavelet levels the decomposed level for the eofwnn model with wave heights only and the wnn model with whole inputs was fixed at 7 to evaluate the performance of the models three different performance indices are employed which are correlation coefficient r index of agreement i a and normalized root mean square error nrmse calculated by eqs 10 12 10 r 1 i x i y i 2 i x i x 2 11 i a 1 i x i y i 2 i y i y x i x 2 12 n r m s e i x i y i 2 n x where x i y i x y and n are the observed wave height forecasted wave height mean of observed wave height mean of forecasted wave height and the number of observations respectively table 2 shows the results of the wnn model at gangneung sakata and aomori for several lead times for 1 and 3 h lead times the values of r and i a were close to one regardless of the decomposition level and the nrmse values were distributed between 0 073 and 0 164 for longer lead times the values of r and i a decreased drastically and the nrmse values increased the model prediction accuracy is reduced with increasing lead time whereas it is enhanced with higher decomposition level it is worthy of note that the model accuracy at aomori is lower than those at other stations because the wave heights are relatively small at aomori which is located inside a bay as shown in fig 1 the first stage of the eofwnn model is the eof analysis of the wave and meteorological data through the eof analysis the input time series are decomposed into several modes and separated into spatial and temporal components figs 5 and 6 show the first four modes of the eigenvectors of wind velocity and sea level pressure respectively they represent the physical patterns of the spatial distribution of the meteorological data figs 7 and 8 show the corresponding pc time series note that the leading eof modes that explain 90 of variance are used in the following analysis even though only the first four modes are shown in the figures fig 9 represent the first four modes of the pc time series for significant wave height next by employing the wavelet analysis for each pc time series for 3 5 and 7 decomposition levels several wavelet components were produced fig 10 shows the wavelet components for the 3rd decomposition level of the first mode of the significant wave height pc time series which consist of one approximation and three details the decomposed subseries were then used as input parameters to forecast the pc time series of the significant wave height for different lead times after training the model the pc time series of the significant wave height were forecasted using the testing data then the forecasted pc time series and the lvs from the eof analysis were reconstructed to obtain the predicted wave height the results obtained from the eofwnn model at the eight stations are summarized in tables 3 6 for different lead times the performance of the eofwnn model for short lead times i e 1 and 3 h was similar to those of the wnn model the values of r and i a were close to one regardless of the decomposition level and the nrmse values were distributed between 0 074 and 0 265 the eofwnn model showed high accuracy even for longer lead times i e 12 and 24 h even at the 3rd decomposition level the values of nrmse were under 0 226 figs 11 13 show the observed and forecasted significant wave height time series by the wnn and eofwnn models with the 7th decomposition level at 24 h lead time in gangneung sakata and aomori respectively both models forecasted the overall behavior of the observed data but the eofwnn model proposed in this study showed more accurate results than the wnn model fig 14 compares the index of agreement of the eofwnn and wnn models corresponding to different decomposition levels for different lead times at gangneung sakata and aomori both models show lower accuracy with increasing lead time and higher accuracy with increasing decomposition level the accuracy of the wnn model with low decomposition level drastically declined for longer lead times however the accuracy of the eofwnn model was not significantly affected by the decomposition level the accuracy of the eofwnn model was much better than that of the wnn model for longer lead times 6 conclusions previous wnn model was used to forecast significant wave heights by only training the observed wave data at a single location showing lower accuracy at longer lead times probably due to the lack of consideration of the relationship between spatially distributed meteorological variables and waves in this study an eofwnn model was developed to take this relationship into account by combining the eof analysis and wavelet analysis with the neural network and by using the observed wave data at multiple locations and the past and future meteorological data in the surrounding area including the wave observation stations the developed model is also able to forecast the wave heights at multiple locations simultaneously and thus it is more convenient and more accurate than the previous wnn model that was developed for each location separately the developed model was employed to forecast significant wave heights for various lead times at eight stations in the coastal waters around the east japan sea the model results at gangneung sakata and aomori were compared with those of the wnn model depending on different input conditions only wave data or both wave and the meteorological data the wnn model using both data showed bad performance because the ann cannot find the relationship between the spatially distributed meteorological variables and waves when only the wave data are used the two models showed similar performance with slightly better accuracy by the wnn model the values of nrmse for the wnn model for 24 hr lead time were between 0 140 and 0 289 and those for the eofwnn model were between 0 155 and 0 263 even though all the wave observation stations are located in the east japan sea they are far from each other therefore using the individual wave data at each station gives better performance than using all the wave data at multiple locations for longer lead times on the other hand the eofwnn model using both wave and meteorological data showed much better performance than the wnn model using only wave data for all the lead times regardless of the wavelet decomposition level even at the 3rd decomposition level the nrmse values for the eofwnn model were under 0 226 for longer lead times while those for the wnn model were under 0 446 the high accuracy of the eofwnn model is attributed to considering the effect of spatially distributed meteorological variables by the eof analysis the eofwnn model is better than the wnn model in that the former shows higher accuracy for longer lead times regardless of the decomposition level and that it forecasts the wave heights at multiple locations together in short the eofwnn model can be a promising tool for forecasting the significant wave heights at multiple locations for a relatively long lead time with high accuracy lastly it should be mentioned that the model showed lower accuracy at the aomori station which is located inside a bay and thus in which the wave height is small compared with other stations it may be desirable to use the model for the wave stations which are located in open coasts so that the magnitudes of wave height are similar to one another acknowledgements this study was performed by the project of investigation of large swell waves and rip currents and development of the disaster response system no

23622,long term low cyclic loads are often encountered in marine environment but the cyclic behavior of soil under this loading condition is rarely studied undrained pore pressure behavior of soft marine clay subjected to long term low cyclic loading is of considerable importance for the proper design and maintenance planning of foundations of near and off shore structures in this paper a new hyperbolic model is proposed to predict the development of undrained pore pressure this model is verified by experimental data from literature compared with the existing models the proposed model has better capability and performance with use of the proposed model a hyperbolic relationship between cumulative plastic strain and pore pressure was derived and verified by experimental data finally the effects of cyclic stress ratio confining pressure and loading frequency on pore pressure are investigated in summary this work provides a novel model and some innovative observations to better understanding undrained pore pressure behavior of soft marine clay under long term low cyclic loads keywords undrained pore pressure prediction model long term low cyclic loads soft marine clay 1 introduction soft marine clay widely distributed in the east area of china is very fragile to be disturbed due to its own physical and mechanical properties e g high sensitivity high void ratio low permeability etc ren et al 2018 in this marine environment many off and near shore structures are founded such as suction anchors seawalls ports etc whose foundations are usually subjected to cyclic loads caused by waves traffic vehicles and machines these cyclic loads usually being of numerous repeated applications and low stress level can generate excess pore water pressure the generated excess pore water pressure probably not result in a failure of soil but can lead to a deterioration of bearing capacity and soil strength ansal and erken 1989 moses et al 2003 andersen 2009 li et al 2011 wichtmann et al 2013 and to unexpected deformation ren et al 2012 deng and ren 2017 ng et al 2013 lei et al 2016 thus for proper design and maintenance planning of the foundations of near and off shore structures it is essential to investigate the response of pore water pressure of soft marine clay under cyclic loads many researchers have investigated on pore pressure development of soils under cyclic loading e g lo 1969a 1969b wilson and greenwood 1974 yasuhara et al 1982 hyde and ward 1985 hyodo et al 1992 zhou and gong 2001 jeng and cha 2003 moses and rao 2007 wang et al 2013 2017 tang et al 2015 some empirical models matsui et al 1980 yasuhara et al 1982 ohara and matsuda 1988 hyde et al 1993 xu et al 1997 moses et al 2003 nie et al 2007 and theoretical models carter et al 1980 ramsamooj and alwash 1990 li and meissner 2002 ni et al 2015 have been proposed to describe the pore water pressure development of clayey soils based on cyclic triaxial tests because of the complexity of parameters and computation cost the theoretical models have not been as widely used as the empirical models in practical engineering these excellent works provide solid tools for further understanding the cyclic behavior of soils under different loading conditions however most of these studies focused on the loading condition only for a small number of cyclic applications usually smaller than 2000 in the marine or traffic environment however the number of loading cycles usually reach hundreds of thousands or even more meanwhile its applied cyclic stress level is usually lower than the critical cyclic stress of soil this loading condition is called long term low cyclic loading herein under this condition pore water pressure behavior of soft clay has been rarely studied before in present study we aim to propose a new empirical model to describe the pore pressure development of soft marine clay under the long term low cyclic loads this model particularly focuses on two aspects of loading conditions not considered in previous models 1 lower stress level that the cyclic stress is lower than the critical cyclic stress see detailed definition and discussion of critical cyclic stress for different soft soils in ren et al 2018 and 2 larger loading cycles in the following firstly we briefly review the existing pore pressure models and propose a new model specifically for long term low cyclic loading condition in section 2 secondly verification and application of the new model are made in section 3 then the effects of cyclic stress ratio confining pressure and loading frequency on pore pressure as well as limitations of the current study are discussed in section 4 at last summary and main conclusions are drawn in the last part of the paper 2 pore pressure buildup modeling 2 1 a brief review of pore pressure model the two most widely used empirical models are briefly introduced in this section hyde and ward 1985 proposed a power model for pore pressure of silty clay under unstrained conditions using monotonic strain controlled cyclic triaxial tests a simpler similar power model was put forth by huang et al 2000 for shanghai clay as follows 1 u p 0 a n b where u is the pore pressure p 0 is the initial mean effective stress p 0 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 n is the number of cyclic application a b are model parameters and depend on cyclic stress ohara and matsuda 1988 carried out a series of two way strain controlled cyclic simple shear tests under the undrained condition for kaolinite clay they developed a hyperbolic model to describe pore pressure development with respect to the number of cycles considering that it is difficult to determine the model parameters by cyclic strain following ohara and matsuda 1988 a similar hyperbolic model was suggested by paul et al 2015 wherein model parameters are dependent on stress state e g loading frequency cyclic stress confining pressure and soil properties e g plasticity index i p it was expressed as the following equation 2 u σ v c n α β n where σ v c is the effective confining pressure α and β are model parameters which can be expressed as a function of cyclic stress effective confining pressure loading frequency and plasticity index some other similar power hyperbolic models or other type models have been proposed by hyodo et al 1988 matasovic and vucetic 1995 nie et al 2007 yao et al 2012 the above two models were proposed on the basis of experiments conducted under the loading condition of only a few cycles with high cyclic stress level under this condition the excess pore pressure would accumulate and increase steeply even resulting in a failure of soil within a few cycles under long term lower cyclic stress level however the pore pressure will accumulate at a smaller rate and the increment of pore pressure will decrease over loading cycles when the increment of pore pressure is small enough and equal to its dissipation over a long time the generated pore pressure will finally tend to be plateaued without leading to a failure of soil this has been experimentally confirmed by many researchers e g ohara and matsuda 1988 zhou and gong 2001 moses and rao 2007 cui et al 2014 2 2 a new pore pressure model for long term low cyclic loading condition following the above observations pore pressure development under the long term low cyclic loading can not be predicted by the power equation 1 because the pore pressure that this model demonstrates will increase endlessly instead of being plateaued over against the loading cycles n although the equation 2 proposed by paul et al 2015 is capable of describing the plateaued curve it will produce large error when used to predict pore pressure generated by long term low cyclic loading seen from later section 3 1 because the model is not proposed specifically for this loading condition to accurately predict the undrained pore pressure a new model is proposed specifically for the long term low cyclic loading condition as follows 3 u p 0 n b a c n b where u is the pore pressure p 0 is the initial mean effective stress p 0 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 and p 0 is equal to σ v c eq 2 when it is in isotropic consolidation a b c are model parameters that depend on stress state and physical properties of soil when b 1 the eq 3 is simplified into paul s model of eq 2 2 3 parameters of the proposed equation as the pore pressure is strain related lo 1969a 1969b hyde et al 1993 moses and rao 2007 tang et al 2015 the factors that control the strain will also be the dominant factors of pore pressure e g cyclic stress effective confining pressure soil static strength etc the influence of these factors can be captured by the model parameters to better analyze the physical meaning of the parameters a b c in the proposed model they can be analogized respectively to the parameters a b c in ren s model ren et al 2018 because this two models are consistent in mathematical form the exponent parameter b represents the slope of pore pressure ratio u p 0 versus log 10 n plot it characterizes the rate of pore pressure developing but it does not affect the permanent pore pressure generation this indicates that the parameter b may only depend on the physical properties of the soil itself and should be independent of stress state to examine whether the parameter b is cyclic stress state dependent or not we plot the parameter b versus the cyclic stress ratio csr as shown in fig 1 the values of the parameter b are obtained by regression method with use of eq 3 fitting the compiled experimental data it can be seen from fig 1 that the parameter b seems to have no clear relationship with the csr which confirms the above speculation that the b only depends on the soil type but is independent of the cyclic stress state in other words the parameter b should be a constant for a given soil this observation is consistent with previous studies ohara and matsuda 1988 paul et al 2015 where the constant b is equal to 1 0 as shown in eq 2 however for soft clay under long term low cyclic loads the most best fit values of the b locate in the range of 0 28 1 0 as shown in the cyan area of fig 1 they have an average value of 0 56 that is far away from 1 0 the parameter b is therefore recommended to be a constant value of 0 5 the eq 3 is consequently simplified into eq 4 as follows 4 u p 0 n 0 5 a c n 0 5 when the number of cyclic load applications n approaches infinity i e n the pore pressure ratio u p 0 is equal to be a constant of 1 c it indicates that the permanent pore pressure is only characterized by the parameters c regardless of the a accordingly the factors that affect the permanent pore pressure e g cyclic stress state and physical properties of soils will also control the parameter c as the n is the product of loading frequency f and loading application time t i e n tf the pore pressure ratio will approach 1 a when t approaching 0 t 0 thus the parameter a captures the degree of difficulty of initial pore pressure and will determine the amount of pore pressure generated during the first cycle of load combining with the parameter c because u p 0 1 a c however the true value of pore pressure during the first cycle is difficult to measure because of the low permeability of soft clay which makes the measured pore pressure in the early stage delayed and unreliable andersen et al 1980 wang et al 2013 this brings a big obstacle to suggest a generalized function for the parameter a and c with stress state and soil state by statistical regression analysis method 3 verification and application of the new model 3 1 verification to verify the proposed model eq 4 a large number of experimental data of pore pressure under cyclic loads are compiled from the existing literature those experimental data involve four different types of soft clay soils obtained via cyclic triaxial tests under long term low cyclic stress loading reported by moses and rao 2007 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 and tang et al 2015 respectively the proposed model eq 4 the power model eq 1 and the hyperbolic model eq 2 are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 2 taking fig 2 c for an example the experimental data was obtained by tang et al 2015 for guangzhou soft clay under long term low cyclic loading the soil physical states stress states and other information about the tests are available in the reference of tang et al 2015 the pore pressure ratios computed by the proposed model eq 4 the power model eq 1 and the hyperbolic model eq 2 are shown by black solid the red dotted line and the blue dotted line in fig 2 c respectively it clearly shows that the proposed model well reproduced the experimental data and had a much higher correlation coefficient r2 but lower root mean square error rmse than the other two models especially at a large number of loading cycles the same conclusion can also be drawn from a b and d in fig 2 this observation indicates that the proposed model has a better performance to describe the pore pressure development of soft clay soils under long term low cyclic loading this also indirectly proves the exponent b in the hyperbolic model of eq 3 should be 0 5 rather than 1 0 recommended by paul et al 2015 under this loading condition furthermore the experimental data of the pore pressure under the effective confining pressure of 100 kpa reported by hyodo et al 1988 wang et al 2013 and moses et al 2003 are used to examine the prediction capability of eq 4 the least squares method was used to obtain the parameters a and c in the eq 4 by fitting the data set of u p 0 versus n reported by hyodo et al 1988 and wang et al 2013 the fitted results are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that both the parameters a and c have as strong correlation with the csr and their relationship expressions are also obtained 5 a 13 38 c s r 1 91 6 c 0 90 c s r 1 25 with the parameters a and c calculated by eqs 5 and 6 see table 1 pore water pressure under different csrs is computed by the proposed eq 4 a comparison is made between the predicted experimental data reported by moses et al 2003 that was not used in the regression analysis of parameters the comparison results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the predicted results agree very well with the measured experimental data and most of the predicted values fall within 10 prediction error area those observations indicate the proposed model has a good capability to predict the pore pressure of soft soil under long term low cyclic loading condition 3 2 application ren et al 2018 examined numerous cyclic triaxial data for several different soft soils and proposed a general model to describe the development of the cumulative plastic strain ε p under long term low cyclic loading which was presented as follows 7 ε p n 0 5 a c n 0 5 substituting the equation 7 into the equation 4 by eliminating the portion of n 0 5 the relationship between pore pressure ratio and cumulative plastic strain is obtained 8 u p 0 ε p a a a c a c a ε p assuming h a a k a c a c a the equation 7 can be simplified as the following expression 9 u p 0 ε p h k ε p eq 9 shows that for soft marine clay under the condition of long term low cyclic loading there exists a hyperbolic relationship between the cumulative plastic strain and the accumulated excess pore water pressure ratio this observation is consistent with the conclusion by lo 1969a yasuhara et al 1982 and hyodo et al 1992 fig 5 presents the experimental data reported by tang et al 2015 and shahin et al 2011 to illustrate the relationship between ε p and u p 0 these experimental data reveal a good hyperbolic relationship between ε p and u p 0 all of those data are compared with the regression curves given by the eq 9 most of the coefficients of correlation r2 resulted from the regression analyses are more than 0 98 it is therefore concluded that the eq 9 is of capability to describe the relationship between ε p and u p 0 for this loading condition also it indicates further an additional rationality and accuracy of the equation 4 proposed in this paper and the eq 7 proposed by ren et al 2018 according to equation 9 the plastic strain increment δ ε p can be expressed as the following function 10 δ ε p h k ε p 2 p 0 δ u the excess pore pressure δ u can be computed by the proposed equation 4 once the plastic strain increment has been constructed it may be used as a variable to describe the history of deformation upon which hardening or softening depends 4 pore pressure buildup analysis and limitations of the current study 4 1 effect of csr it has been well known that the pore pressure of soft soils under cyclic loading is related to the cyclic strain and the microstructural changes lo 1969a 1969b wilson and greenwood 1974 hyde et al 1993 zhou and gong 2001 tang et al 2015 for a given soil the cyclic strain mainly depends on its cyclic stress li and selig 1996 ren et al 2012 the cyclic stress ratio csr defined as the ratio between the cyclic stress and the undrained static strength zergoun and vaid 1994 moses et al 2003 is the most dominant factor that influences the cyclic strain ren et al 2018 then therefore indirectly influences the pore water pressure this observation has been shown by many researchers through experiments moses and rao 2007 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 tang et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 nevertheless it is worth noting that the csr probably has no effect on the pore pressure ratio strain relation fig 6 a and b shows the experimental results of soft marine clay under different cyclic stress levels conducted by tang et al 2015 and shahin et al 2011 respectively it is clear from these results that the pore pressure ratio strain relation is independent of the csr this is because the plastic strain and the pore pressure are interrelated and simultaneously change under the cyclic stress 4 2 effect of confining pressure effect of confining pressure on pore pressure development of soils under undrained cyclic loading have been investigated by many researchers e g hyodo et al 1988 moses et al 2003 moses and rao 2007 they observed that the normalized pore pressure varies significantly with different effective confining pressures following their observations a recent pore pressure prediction model proposed by paul et al 2015 has been specifically classified into three sets based on distinct effective confining pressure regimes 100 kpa 100 150 kpa and 150 kpa and model parameter expressions with stress state and soil state were presented for each regime respectively the variation in parameter expression resulting from the confining pressure becomes the biggest obstacle to propose a generalized model for prediction of pore pressure in fig 7 a and b the parameter a and c in the eq 4 are respectively presented along with csr under different confining pressure ranging from 50 kpa to 300 kpa for the parameter a it can be expressed as a function of csr for each confining pressure regime and there is an overall increasing tendency with confining pressure increasing meanwhile it seems that there is not a stratified general expression existing for all confining pressures for the parameter c its expressions with csr for different confining pressures vary not as much as the parameter a as shown in fig 7 b the best fit line black solid line for all data is close to the best fit lines both for σ c 50 kpa blue dotted line and for σ c 300 kpa red dotted line as mentioned in the section of 2 3 the parameter a captures the degree of difficulty of initial pore pressure generation whose values are consequently controlled by the pore pressure generated during the initial cycles however those pore pressures may not reflect the actual values since sufficient time is not allowed for equalization especially for soft clay specimen with low permeability sangrey et al 1978 ansal and erken 1989 this may be the reason for the variation of parameter expression for different effective confining pressure as the number of cycles increases however the rate of pore pressure buildup decreases significantly and there is enough time for the equalization of pore pressure sangrey et al 1978 andersen et al 1980 wang et al 2013 it is believed that at late stage the measured pore pressures are able to reflect the actual values in other words the error or gap between the measured values of pore pressure and the actual values decreases as the number of cycles increases thus the best fit values of the parameter c which captures the permanent pore pressure are more reliable compared with those of the parameter a following this observation compared with fig 7 a and b much better reflect the real impact of the confining pressure on the model parameters thus unlike shown in fig 7 a generalized expressions both for the parameter a and the parameter c with csr under different effective confining pressures may exist but further experimental study is needed 4 3 effect of loading frequency the influence of loading frequency on accumulated pore pressure and plastic strain has been investigated by many researchers through cyclic triaxial tests and cyclic simple shear tests however it has not been known clearly some experimental results indicate that the decrease of loading frequency leads to an increase both in the accumulated pore pressure and strain with respect to the number of cycles e g matsui et al 1980 zhou and gong 2001 thammathiwat and chim oye 2004 li et al 2011 some other response patterns of loading frequency on cyclic behavior also have been proposed ansal and erken 1989 reported that the effect of loading frequency is more dominant during the initial cycles and as the number of cycles increases this effect diminishes progressively while hyde et al 1993 observed that the loading frequency has little influence on the buildup of pore water pressure on the contrary yasuhara et al 1982 conducted undrained stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests and found a more predominately pore water pressure was generated by larger frequency the most popular response pattern that the pore pressure increases with decreasing the loading frequency was obtained on the basis of the plot of pore pressure versus the number of cycles as was shown in the left column of the fig 8 however this response pattern would not be true if the same experimental data of pore pressure were replotted with the duration of cyclic loading as shown in the right column of the fig 8 where the pore pressure seems to be independent of the cyclic loading frequency thus we can not simply conclude a response pattern of the effect of loading frequency without pointing out which it is studied with respect to the number of cycles or the duration of cyclic loading the loading frequency seems to have no impact on the pore pressure buildup with respect to time chen et al 2004 tested undisturbed marine clay under cyclic loading at frequencies of 0 05 1 0 hz and suggested that the frequency has no consistent effect on the pore water pressure development li et al 2011 found that the effect of loading frequency is related to the applied cyclic stress in light of these observations mentioned above it may be more suitable to display the effect of loading frequency in terms of the number of cycles duration of cyclic loading and the applied cyclic stress which may be interrelated in addition ansal and erken 1989 conducted a series of cyclic simple shear tests for normally consolidated clays and found that for a large number of cycles the loading frequency has no significant effect on cyclic behavior after that chen et al 2004 obtained a similar conclusion this observation indicates that from a practical point of view the effect of loading frequency on cyclic behavior can be probably ignored in problems of soft foundation of off and near shore structures subjected to wave or traffic loads as the number of cycles of these cyclic loads is usually over hundreds of thousands or even more that is to say for the loading condition of long term low cyclic loading studied herein the pore pressure can be predicted without considering the effect of loading frequency 4 4 limitations of the current study 1 within the scope of this study the proposed model is capable to describe the undrained pore pressure development only for soft clay and the model misses some other important factors such as the over consolidation the cyclic stress paths and the anisotropy 2 the parameters a and c in the proposed model are not readily determined by experiments they could be estimated by a power function of csr only for a given confining pressure in other words if we use the proposed model to predict the undrained cyclic pore water pressure behavior the values of the parameters a and c need to be evaluated case by case for different confining pressure to instill greater confidence in the use of the new model further testing on soft clay over a broader range of confining pressures is highly desirable 3 the dataset compiled here is affected by common experimental biases especially for values of the initial loading cycles due to the delay equilibrium of pore pressure which weakens the accuracy of the proposed model in practice 5 summary

23622,long term low cyclic loads are often encountered in marine environment but the cyclic behavior of soil under this loading condition is rarely studied undrained pore pressure behavior of soft marine clay subjected to long term low cyclic loading is of considerable importance for the proper design and maintenance planning of foundations of near and off shore structures in this paper a new hyperbolic model is proposed to predict the development of undrained pore pressure this model is verified by experimental data from literature compared with the existing models the proposed model has better capability and performance with use of the proposed model a hyperbolic relationship between cumulative plastic strain and pore pressure was derived and verified by experimental data finally the effects of cyclic stress ratio confining pressure and loading frequency on pore pressure are investigated in summary this work provides a novel model and some innovative observations to better understanding undrained pore pressure behavior of soft marine clay under long term low cyclic loads keywords undrained pore pressure prediction model long term low cyclic loads soft marine clay 1 introduction soft marine clay widely distributed in the east area of china is very fragile to be disturbed due to its own physical and mechanical properties e g high sensitivity high void ratio low permeability etc ren et al 2018 in this marine environment many off and near shore structures are founded such as suction anchors seawalls ports etc whose foundations are usually subjected to cyclic loads caused by waves traffic vehicles and machines these cyclic loads usually being of numerous repeated applications and low stress level can generate excess pore water pressure the generated excess pore water pressure probably not result in a failure of soil but can lead to a deterioration of bearing capacity and soil strength ansal and erken 1989 moses et al 2003 andersen 2009 li et al 2011 wichtmann et al 2013 and to unexpected deformation ren et al 2012 deng and ren 2017 ng et al 2013 lei et al 2016 thus for proper design and maintenance planning of the foundations of near and off shore structures it is essential to investigate the response of pore water pressure of soft marine clay under cyclic loads many researchers have investigated on pore pressure development of soils under cyclic loading e g lo 1969a 1969b wilson and greenwood 1974 yasuhara et al 1982 hyde and ward 1985 hyodo et al 1992 zhou and gong 2001 jeng and cha 2003 moses and rao 2007 wang et al 2013 2017 tang et al 2015 some empirical models matsui et al 1980 yasuhara et al 1982 ohara and matsuda 1988 hyde et al 1993 xu et al 1997 moses et al 2003 nie et al 2007 and theoretical models carter et al 1980 ramsamooj and alwash 1990 li and meissner 2002 ni et al 2015 have been proposed to describe the pore water pressure development of clayey soils based on cyclic triaxial tests because of the complexity of parameters and computation cost the theoretical models have not been as widely used as the empirical models in practical engineering these excellent works provide solid tools for further understanding the cyclic behavior of soils under different loading conditions however most of these studies focused on the loading condition only for a small number of cyclic applications usually smaller than 2000 in the marine or traffic environment however the number of loading cycles usually reach hundreds of thousands or even more meanwhile its applied cyclic stress level is usually lower than the critical cyclic stress of soil this loading condition is called long term low cyclic loading herein under this condition pore water pressure behavior of soft clay has been rarely studied before in present study we aim to propose a new empirical model to describe the pore pressure development of soft marine clay under the long term low cyclic loads this model particularly focuses on two aspects of loading conditions not considered in previous models 1 lower stress level that the cyclic stress is lower than the critical cyclic stress see detailed definition and discussion of critical cyclic stress for different soft soils in ren et al 2018 and 2 larger loading cycles in the following firstly we briefly review the existing pore pressure models and propose a new model specifically for long term low cyclic loading condition in section 2 secondly verification and application of the new model are made in section 3 then the effects of cyclic stress ratio confining pressure and loading frequency on pore pressure as well as limitations of the current study are discussed in section 4 at last summary and main conclusions are drawn in the last part of the paper 2 pore pressure buildup modeling 2 1 a brief review of pore pressure model the two most widely used empirical models are briefly introduced in this section hyde and ward 1985 proposed a power model for pore pressure of silty clay under unstrained conditions using monotonic strain controlled cyclic triaxial tests a simpler similar power model was put forth by huang et al 2000 for shanghai clay as follows 1 u p 0 a n b where u is the pore pressure p 0 is the initial mean effective stress p 0 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 n is the number of cyclic application a b are model parameters and depend on cyclic stress ohara and matsuda 1988 carried out a series of two way strain controlled cyclic simple shear tests under the undrained condition for kaolinite clay they developed a hyperbolic model to describe pore pressure development with respect to the number of cycles considering that it is difficult to determine the model parameters by cyclic strain following ohara and matsuda 1988 a similar hyperbolic model was suggested by paul et al 2015 wherein model parameters are dependent on stress state e g loading frequency cyclic stress confining pressure and soil properties e g plasticity index i p it was expressed as the following equation 2 u σ v c n α β n where σ v c is the effective confining pressure α and β are model parameters which can be expressed as a function of cyclic stress effective confining pressure loading frequency and plasticity index some other similar power hyperbolic models or other type models have been proposed by hyodo et al 1988 matasovic and vucetic 1995 nie et al 2007 yao et al 2012 the above two models were proposed on the basis of experiments conducted under the loading condition of only a few cycles with high cyclic stress level under this condition the excess pore pressure would accumulate and increase steeply even resulting in a failure of soil within a few cycles under long term lower cyclic stress level however the pore pressure will accumulate at a smaller rate and the increment of pore pressure will decrease over loading cycles when the increment of pore pressure is small enough and equal to its dissipation over a long time the generated pore pressure will finally tend to be plateaued without leading to a failure of soil this has been experimentally confirmed by many researchers e g ohara and matsuda 1988 zhou and gong 2001 moses and rao 2007 cui et al 2014 2 2 a new pore pressure model for long term low cyclic loading condition following the above observations pore pressure development under the long term low cyclic loading can not be predicted by the power equation 1 because the pore pressure that this model demonstrates will increase endlessly instead of being plateaued over against the loading cycles n although the equation 2 proposed by paul et al 2015 is capable of describing the plateaued curve it will produce large error when used to predict pore pressure generated by long term low cyclic loading seen from later section 3 1 because the model is not proposed specifically for this loading condition to accurately predict the undrained pore pressure a new model is proposed specifically for the long term low cyclic loading condition as follows 3 u p 0 n b a c n b where u is the pore pressure p 0 is the initial mean effective stress p 0 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 and p 0 is equal to σ v c eq 2 when it is in isotropic consolidation a b c are model parameters that depend on stress state and physical properties of soil when b 1 the eq 3 is simplified into paul s model of eq 2 2 3 parameters of the proposed equation as the pore pressure is strain related lo 1969a 1969b hyde et al 1993 moses and rao 2007 tang et al 2015 the factors that control the strain will also be the dominant factors of pore pressure e g cyclic stress effective confining pressure soil static strength etc the influence of these factors can be captured by the model parameters to better analyze the physical meaning of the parameters a b c in the proposed model they can be analogized respectively to the parameters a b c in ren s model ren et al 2018 because this two models are consistent in mathematical form the exponent parameter b represents the slope of pore pressure ratio u p 0 versus log 10 n plot it characterizes the rate of pore pressure developing but it does not affect the permanent pore pressure generation this indicates that the parameter b may only depend on the physical properties of the soil itself and should be independent of stress state to examine whether the parameter b is cyclic stress state dependent or not we plot the parameter b versus the cyclic stress ratio csr as shown in fig 1 the values of the parameter b are obtained by regression method with use of eq 3 fitting the compiled experimental data it can be seen from fig 1 that the parameter b seems to have no clear relationship with the csr which confirms the above speculation that the b only depends on the soil type but is independent of the cyclic stress state in other words the parameter b should be a constant for a given soil this observation is consistent with previous studies ohara and matsuda 1988 paul et al 2015 where the constant b is equal to 1 0 as shown in eq 2 however for soft clay under long term low cyclic loads the most best fit values of the b locate in the range of 0 28 1 0 as shown in the cyan area of fig 1 they have an average value of 0 56 that is far away from 1 0 the parameter b is therefore recommended to be a constant value of 0 5 the eq 3 is consequently simplified into eq 4 as follows 4 u p 0 n 0 5 a c n 0 5 when the number of cyclic load applications n approaches infinity i e n the pore pressure ratio u p 0 is equal to be a constant of 1 c it indicates that the permanent pore pressure is only characterized by the parameters c regardless of the a accordingly the factors that affect the permanent pore pressure e g cyclic stress state and physical properties of soils will also control the parameter c as the n is the product of loading frequency f and loading application time t i e n tf the pore pressure ratio will approach 1 a when t approaching 0 t 0 thus the parameter a captures the degree of difficulty of initial pore pressure and will determine the amount of pore pressure generated during the first cycle of load combining with the parameter c because u p 0 1 a c however the true value of pore pressure during the first cycle is difficult to measure because of the low permeability of soft clay which makes the measured pore pressure in the early stage delayed and unreliable andersen et al 1980 wang et al 2013 this brings a big obstacle to suggest a generalized function for the parameter a and c with stress state and soil state by statistical regression analysis method 3 verification and application of the new model 3 1 verification to verify the proposed model eq 4 a large number of experimental data of pore pressure under cyclic loads are compiled from the existing literature those experimental data involve four different types of soft clay soils obtained via cyclic triaxial tests under long term low cyclic stress loading reported by moses and rao 2007 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 and tang et al 2015 respectively the proposed model eq 4 the power model eq 1 and the hyperbolic model eq 2 are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 2 taking fig 2 c for an example the experimental data was obtained by tang et al 2015 for guangzhou soft clay under long term low cyclic loading the soil physical states stress states and other information about the tests are available in the reference of tang et al 2015 the pore pressure ratios computed by the proposed model eq 4 the power model eq 1 and the hyperbolic model eq 2 are shown by black solid the red dotted line and the blue dotted line in fig 2 c respectively it clearly shows that the proposed model well reproduced the experimental data and had a much higher correlation coefficient r2 but lower root mean square error rmse than the other two models especially at a large number of loading cycles the same conclusion can also be drawn from a b and d in fig 2 this observation indicates that the proposed model has a better performance to describe the pore pressure development of soft clay soils under long term low cyclic loading this also indirectly proves the exponent b in the hyperbolic model of eq 3 should be 0 5 rather than 1 0 recommended by paul et al 2015 under this loading condition furthermore the experimental data of the pore pressure under the effective confining pressure of 100 kpa reported by hyodo et al 1988 wang et al 2013 and moses et al 2003 are used to examine the prediction capability of eq 4 the least squares method was used to obtain the parameters a and c in the eq 4 by fitting the data set of u p 0 versus n reported by hyodo et al 1988 and wang et al 2013 the fitted results are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that both the parameters a and c have as strong correlation with the csr and their relationship expressions are also obtained 5 a 13 38 c s r 1 91 6 c 0 90 c s r 1 25 with the parameters a and c calculated by eqs 5 and 6 see table 1 pore water pressure under different csrs is computed by the proposed eq 4 a comparison is made between the predicted experimental data reported by moses et al 2003 that was not used in the regression analysis of parameters the comparison results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the predicted results agree very well with the measured experimental data and most of the predicted values fall within 10 prediction error area those observations indicate the proposed model has a good capability to predict the pore pressure of soft soil under long term low cyclic loading condition 3 2 application ren et al 2018 examined numerous cyclic triaxial data for several different soft soils and proposed a general model to describe the development of the cumulative plastic strain ε p under long term low cyclic loading which was presented as follows 7 ε p n 0 5 a c n 0 5 substituting the equation 7 into the equation 4 by eliminating the portion of n 0 5 the relationship between pore pressure ratio and cumulative plastic strain is obtained 8 u p 0 ε p a a a c a c a ε p assuming h a a k a c a c a the equation 7 can be simplified as the following expression 9 u p 0 ε p h k ε p eq 9 shows that for soft marine clay under the condition of long term low cyclic loading there exists a hyperbolic relationship between the cumulative plastic strain and the accumulated excess pore water pressure ratio this observation is consistent with the conclusion by lo 1969a yasuhara et al 1982 and hyodo et al 1992 fig 5 presents the experimental data reported by tang et al 2015 and shahin et al 2011 to illustrate the relationship between ε p and u p 0 these experimental data reveal a good hyperbolic relationship between ε p and u p 0 all of those data are compared with the regression curves given by the eq 9 most of the coefficients of correlation r2 resulted from the regression analyses are more than 0 98 it is therefore concluded that the eq 9 is of capability to describe the relationship between ε p and u p 0 for this loading condition also it indicates further an additional rationality and accuracy of the equation 4 proposed in this paper and the eq 7 proposed by ren et al 2018 according to equation 9 the plastic strain increment δ ε p can be expressed as the following function 10 δ ε p h k ε p 2 p 0 δ u the excess pore pressure δ u can be computed by the proposed equation 4 once the plastic strain increment has been constructed it may be used as a variable to describe the history of deformation upon which hardening or softening depends 4 pore pressure buildup analysis and limitations of the current study 4 1 effect of csr it has been well known that the pore pressure of soft soils under cyclic loading is related to the cyclic strain and the microstructural changes lo 1969a 1969b wilson and greenwood 1974 hyde et al 1993 zhou and gong 2001 tang et al 2015 for a given soil the cyclic strain mainly depends on its cyclic stress li and selig 1996 ren et al 2012 the cyclic stress ratio csr defined as the ratio between the cyclic stress and the undrained static strength zergoun and vaid 1994 moses et al 2003 is the most dominant factor that influences the cyclic strain ren et al 2018 then therefore indirectly influences the pore water pressure this observation has been shown by many researchers through experiments moses and rao 2007 shahin et al 2011 wang et al 2013 tang et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 nevertheless it is worth noting that the csr probably has no effect on the pore pressure ratio strain relation fig 6 a and b shows the experimental results of soft marine clay under different cyclic stress levels conducted by tang et al 2015 and shahin et al 2011 respectively it is clear from these results that the pore pressure ratio strain relation is independent of the csr this is because the plastic strain and the pore pressure are interrelated and simultaneously change under the cyclic stress 4 2 effect of confining pressure effect of confining pressure on pore pressure development of soils under undrained cyclic loading have been investigated by many researchers e g hyodo et al 1988 moses et al 2003 moses and rao 2007 they observed that the normalized pore pressure varies significantly with different effective confining pressures following their observations a recent pore pressure prediction model proposed by paul et al 2015 has been specifically classified into three sets based on distinct effective confining pressure regimes 100 kpa 100 150 kpa and 150 kpa and model parameter expressions with stress state and soil state were presented for each regime respectively the variation in parameter expression resulting from the confining pressure becomes the biggest obstacle to propose a generalized model for prediction of pore pressure in fig 7 a and b the parameter a and c in the eq 4 are respectively presented along with csr under different confining pressure ranging from 50 kpa to 300 kpa for the parameter a it can be expressed as a function of csr for each confining pressure regime and there is an overall increasing tendency with confining pressure increasing meanwhile it seems that there is not a stratified general expression existing for all confining pressures for the parameter c its expressions with csr for different confining pressures vary not as much as the parameter a as shown in fig 7 b the best fit line black solid line for all data is close to the best fit lines both for σ c 50 kpa blue dotted line and for σ c 300 kpa red dotted line as mentioned in the section of 2 3 the parameter a captures the degree of difficulty of initial pore pressure generation whose values are consequently controlled by the pore pressure generated during the initial cycles however those pore pressures may not reflect the actual values since sufficient time is not allowed for equalization especially for soft clay specimen with low permeability sangrey et al 1978 ansal and erken 1989 this may be the reason for the variation of parameter expression for different effective confining pressure as the number of cycles increases however the rate of pore pressure buildup decreases significantly and there is enough time for the equalization of pore pressure sangrey et al 1978 andersen et al 1980 wang et al 2013 it is believed that at late stage the measured pore pressures are able to reflect the actual values in other words the error or gap between the measured values of pore pressure and the actual values decreases as the number of cycles increases thus the best fit values of the parameter c which captures the permanent pore pressure are more reliable compared with those of the parameter a following this observation compared with fig 7 a and b much better reflect the real impact of the confining pressure on the model parameters thus unlike shown in fig 7 a generalized expressions both for the parameter a and the parameter c with csr under different effective confining pressures may exist but further experimental study is needed 4 3 effect of loading frequency the influence of loading frequency on accumulated pore pressure and plastic strain has been investigated by many researchers through cyclic triaxial tests and cyclic simple shear tests however it has not been known clearly some experimental results indicate that the decrease of loading frequency leads to an increase both in the accumulated pore pressure and strain with respect to the number of cycles e g matsui et al 1980 zhou and gong 2001 thammathiwat and chim oye 2004 li et al 2011 some other response patterns of loading frequency on cyclic behavior also have been proposed ansal and erken 1989 reported that the effect of loading frequency is more dominant during the initial cycles and as the number of cycles increases this effect diminishes progressively while hyde et al 1993 observed that the loading frequency has little influence on the buildup of pore water pressure on the contrary yasuhara et al 1982 conducted undrained stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests and found a more predominately pore water pressure was generated by larger frequency the most popular response pattern that the pore pressure increases with decreasing the loading frequency was obtained on the basis of the plot of pore pressure versus the number of cycles as was shown in the left column of the fig 8 however this response pattern would not be true if the same experimental data of pore pressure were replotted with the duration of cyclic loading as shown in the right

pointing out which it is studied with respect to the number of cycles or the duration of cyclic loading the loading frequency seems to have no impact on the pore pressure buildup with respect to time

23623,in this paper a two raft type wave energy converter wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic power take off pto unit is considered the hydraulic pto unit composed of two hydraulic cylinders two gas accumulators and a hydraulic motor coupled with a generator is available to capture wave power by using the relative pitch motion between the two rafts to investigate the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec a combined model based on the linear wave theory and basic hydraulic equations is presented the model is validated by comparison of the present results with the data obtained by a hardware in the loop hil test rig and there is a good agreement based on the validated model the influence of piston area rod to piston area ratio and mounting position of the hydraulic cylinder displacement of the hydraulic motor initial volume and pre charge pressure of the high pressure hp gas accumulator and effective damping of

wave power with large energy flux density is regarded as one of the most promising renewable energy source how to extract and utilize this type of energy from the ocean waves has received considerable attention from the researchers and engineering designers in many countries over the past two decades so far numerous concepts of wave energy conversion have been proposed and many of wave energy conversion techniques have been patented drew et al 2009 among the various concepts of wave energy converters wecs the raft type wecs consisting of a series of semi submerged rafts hinged end to end by the joints with hydraulic power take off pto systems are proven to have high stability and energy conversion efficiency since their pto units react against their own body rather than against a separate external reaction frame which enable them to quickly adapt to the extreme sea states for a good survivability mccormick 2007 yemm et al 2012 the raft type wecs are offshore floating slack moored devices normally they are aligned with the predominant wave propagation direction such that they can use the wave curvatures to improve the energy extraction haren and mei 1982 yemm et al 2012 as the wave passes along the length of the rafts each raft outputs surge heave and pitch motions the relative pitch motion between different rafts around the joint would force the hydraulic cylinders to pump the high pressure hp oil through the hp gas accumulator to the hydraulic motor then the difference pressure between the hp gas accumulator and low pressure lp gas accumulator drives the hydraulic motor shaft to rotate and this rotation forces the generator to produce electricity henderson 2006 liu et al 2017 the concept of the raft type device seems to be first conceived by cockerell who designed a raft type articulated barge system called cockerell raft in 1974 wooley and platts 1975 later in 1978 haren 1978 used a two dimensional fluid structure coupling model to make a comprehensive theoretical study of a hagen cockerell raft by assuming the hydraulic pto unit as a linear damper and proved that the efficiency of a floating raft hinged at a vertical wall can reach 100 when the damping coefficient of the pto unit is optimized following the research of haren 1978 kraemer 2001 and nolan et al 2003 studied another similar raft type wave energy conversion device which is known as mccabe wave pump mwp the mwp is composed of three rectangular steel floating pontoons articulated together in which the heave motion of the central pontoon is damped by a submerged horizontal plate wan nik et al 2011 two sets of hydraulic cylinders are equipped in the device such that the relative pitch motion between the barges around the joint could be used to drive the hydraulic cylinder to convert the wave energy into useful energy or desalinize seawater a study of the mwp showed that the pitch motion and energy absorption can be optimized by adjusting the ratio between the length of barges and the wavelength kraemer 2001 in comparison with mwp the pelamis wec is another more cost effective raft type device containing four or five cylindrical segments articulated end to end by the joints it can utilize not only the relative pitch motion around the joints but also the relative yaw motion to pump hp oil into hp gas accumulators and then drive the generators to produce electricity henderson 2006 yemm et al 2012 the wave energy conversion capability and the ability of resistance to aggressive wave conditions of the pelamis wec had been explored by retzler et al 2003 whose results showed that the maximum power capture width of the device could reach a value as large as 1 5 times of its displacement width in the recent studies the power capture ability of a raft type like wave energy conversion device m4 consisting of three cylindrical floats was experimentally investigated by stansby et al 2014 2015a 2015b in their research the power capture abilities of the devices m4 with rounded base floats were compared with that with flat base floats and their finding showed that the floats with rounded base can extract more 60 energy due to reducing energy losses zheng et al 2015 investigated the effects of cross section of the raft and raft radius of gyration on the wave energy conversion capacity of a raft type wec with an elliptic cylinder shape and with the assumption of linear pto unit two theoretical models for maximizing wave energy conversion of the device was proposed in the research of zheng et al 2016a 2016b considering the combined action of non linear waves and viscous flows chen et al 2016 studied the influence of wave height wave period pto damping coefficient and flow velocity on the wave energy dissipator ratio and wave transmission coefficient of a twin raft wave energy dissipator following the work of zheng et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 yu et al 2016 combined the advantage of raft type wecs and pendulum type wecs and proposed a novel wec called wave loong composed of two rafts hinged end to end by the joint and one pendulum hung at the hinged joint the effect of pendulum radius of gyration pendulum length pendulum mass raft length pto damping and wavelength on the capture ability of the novel wec was investigated more recently with the consideration of dynamics of hydraulic circuit and hydraulic components liu et al 2017 investigated the performance of a two raft type wec connected with a hydraulic pto unit they highlighted the difference in the behavior of a raft type wec with a hydraulic pto unit and with a linear pto unit and the relationships among the optimal power capture ability the normalized optimal magnitude of the hydraulic pto force and the wave states were numerically revealed in their research so far most of the previous studies are limited to characterizing the hydraulic pto unit as a linear pto unit and to the best of the authors knowledge no work has been reported about the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the wave energy capture ability of the raft type wecs actually the wave energy capture ability of the raft type wecs relies on several parameters of the hydraulic pto unit the piston area rod to piston area ratio and mounting position of hydraulic cylinder the displacement of hydraulic motor the initial volume and pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator and the effective damping of generator this paper is an extension and a continuation of the work of liu et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to present a numerical study of a two raft type wec focusing on the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the raft type wec the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a two raft type wec is first introduced then a mathematical model for the dynamics of such a wec is presented based on the linear wave theory and hydraulic basic equations model validation and numerical investigations into the effect of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec are shown in section 3 finally conclusions are made in section 4 2 formulation of the problem we consider a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto unit called two raft type wec as shown in fig 1 the two rafts with cylindrical shape have the same length l and diameter d and are hinged by a joint with a gap d 0 between them actually the two raft type wec can be considered as a two barge pelamis device in which only the relative pitch motion between the two barges is utilized to capture energy the mass center of each raft coincides well with its geometry center the motion characteristic of the wec is described in a cartesian coordinate x y and z system with its origin o coincident with the center of the joint where the x and y axes are taken along the length and the diameter direction of the rafts in still water respectively while the z axis is in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 a 2 1 equation of motion assuming the incident wave with amplitude a w and angular frequency ɷ propagating along the positive x axis the motion of the wec takes place in xoz plane in the linear wave theory the wave force can be written as f w j t f e j t f r j t f hys j t j 1 3 5 indicates the surge heave and pitch modes of the fore raft respectively j 1 3 5 indicates the surge heave and pitch modes of the aft raft respectively falnes 2002 for the wec in the wave considered the rafts are regarded as rigid bodies since their deformation is very small based on the lagrange s equations liu et al 2017 adopted a generalized displacement vector x gen t x 0 z 0 θ 1 θ 2 t here superscript t means the transpose of a vector to describe the motion characteristic of the wec and gave the time domain motion equation as 1 m a gen add x gen t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ k gen x gen t f gen e t f pto t where a gen add is the limiting value of the generalized added mass matrix a gen add ω for ω the expressions of terms used in eq 1 are given in the appendix the wave excitation force acting on mode j of the rafts f e j t can be given by falnes 2002 2 f e j t a w γ j ω cos ω t γ j ω where γ j ɷ is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient force per unit incident wave amplitude at mode j whose modulus and argument are γ j ɷ and γ j ɷ as shown in eq 1 there is a convolution term which makes it inconvenient to perform the simulation of such type of time domain model taghipour et al 2008 and perez and fossen 2008 2011 adopted a linear time invariant parametric model in state space form to substitute the convolution term by frequency domain identification with the assumption of linearity the convolution integral in eq 1 can be approximated by a state space model 3 μ t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ x s a s x s b s x gen t μ t c s x s where a s b s and c s are coefficient matrices of the state space model x s is the state vector of the state space model 2 2 equations for the hydraulic pto unit the hydraulic pto unit widely used in the raft type wec is shown in fig 2 the chamber without piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder is connected to the chamber with piston rod of the bottom hydraulic cylinder to be chamber 14 since they perform the same function when the piston moves similarly the chamber with piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder and the chamber without piston rod of the bottom hydraulic cylinder are connected together to be chamber 23 within the linear wave theory and small amplitude motion when the wave induces a relative pitch motion θ 1 θ 2 between the two rafts the corresponding displacements of the top and bottom hydraulic pistons can be expressed as 4 d t r 0 θ 2 θ 1 5 d b r 0 θ 1 θ 2 the forces produced by the top and bottom hydraulic cylinders are 6 f t t p 14 a t p 23 1 α a t 7 f b t p 23 a b p 14 1 β a b as shown in fig 2 when the chamber 14 pumps hydraulic oil into the hp gas accumulator the check valve 2 would be opened and at the same time the chamber 23 would sink hydraulic oil from the lp gas accumulator through the check valve 3 when the pistons are in the middle position of their strokes the volumes of chamber 14 and chamber 23 are labeled as v 14 0 and v 23 0 respectively thus the pressure variation in chamber 14 and 23 can be described by the following fluid continuity equation merritt 1967 8 p 14 β e q l q 2 a t d t 1 β a b d b v 14 0 a t d t 1 β a b d b 9 p 23 β e q 3 q 4 a b d b 1 α a t d t v 23 0 a b d b 1 α a t d t where q i is the flowrate through the check valve i i 1 2 3 and 4 which can be expressed as merritt 1967 10 q i 0 δ p i 0 k δ p i δ p i 0 the compression or expansion process of gas in the hp and lp accumulators can be considered as an isentropic process thus the volume and pressure of gas in the hp and lp gas accumulators should satisfy the following equations 11 p h v h γ p h0 v h0 γ 12 p l v l γ p l0 v l0 γ where γ is the adiabatic index γ 1 4 in case of nitrogen and the instantaneous volumes of gas in the lp and hp gas accumulators v l and v h can be expressed as 13 v l v l0 0 t q l d t 14

concerning the coupling between the hydraulic motor and the electric generator is given by 18 t m j ω m b g ω m the output moment of the hydraulic motor t m is given by 19 t m d m p h p l 2 3 equations for evaluating the power capture ability the instantaneous power captured by the two raft type wec p inst cap t is given by 20 p inst cap t f b t d b f t t d t the average power captured by the two raft type wec p ave cap can be expressed as 21 p ave cap 1 t t 0 t 0 t p inst cap t d t where t 0 is a moment when the two raft type wec has come into a steady state of motion the power of the incident wave per unit width of the wave front p w can be obtained by falnes 2002 22 p w ρ g ω a w 2 4 k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h the power capture ability of a wec is widely evaluated by its capture width

parameters a uj b uj and γ j ɷ can be computed directly in the frequency domain by the boundary element method bem based on diffraction theory using the commercial program aqwa aqwa 2011 then the coefficient matrixes a s b s and c s of the state space model in eq 2 can obtained by frequency domain identification prior to illustrating the effect of hydraulic pto unit parameters on power capture ability of the two raft type wec the model presented in the previous section is first validated in section 3 1 then the validated model is utilized to explore the effect of hydraulic pto parameters on the power capture ability of the device all the studies in our work are carried out in infinite water depth 3 1 model validation assuming there is no pto unit liu et al 2017 has validated the motion equation of the two raft type wec by comparison of the results with the published results in this section we use a hardware in the loop hil test rig to validate the hydraulic pto model fig 3 shows the architecture of the hil test rig the hil test rig is designed to replicate the wave induced relative pitch motion between the two rafts and utilize the replicated relative pitch motion to drive the hydraulic pto unit to capture wave energy as shown in fig 3 the fixed base and the beam are regarded as the fore raft and the aft raft respectively a matlab xpc target real time machine is employed to run the real time motion equation of the two raft type wec the emulation of the wave induced relative pitch motion θ 1 θ 2 is implemented by a hydraulic power pack system through a hydraulic servo valve controlled a driving hydraulic cylinder the generalized wave excitation forces generated offline according to the wave states are the inputs of the hil test rig these forces together with the hydraulic cylinder forces measured by the force sensors feed into the motion equation see eq 1 of the device to evaluate a desired relative pitch motion between the two rafts real timely then the desired displacement x p d which the driving hydraulic cylinder piston should produce can be determined meanwhile the actual displacement of the driving hydraulic cylinder piston x p is measured in real time using a linear variable differential transformer lvdt displacement sensor and fed back to compare with the desired one the comparison result through the controller gives a signal δi to make the hydraulic servo valve control the hydraulic fluid through the driving hydraulic cylinder so that the actual displacement of the driving hydraulic cylinder piston x p can track the desired one x p d thus the relative pitch motion between the two rafts can be reproduced in the absence of waves and drives the hydraulic cylinders of the pto unit to pump hp oil for converting wave energy into usable electric energy as they do in the real wave condition this means that such hil test rig allows performing cheap dry test on the hydraulic pto unit of the two raft type wec thus the hil capability makes the test rig a useful tool to evaluate the power captured by the two raft type wec fig 4 shows a photo of the hil test rig in which the tested pto unit is designed for a two raft type wec with physical and geometrical parameters d 1 m l 10 m d 0 1 m m 4 025 103 kg and i c 3 618 104 kg m2 the parameters of the tested pto unit in the test rig are presented in table 1 fig 5 shows the results of behavior of the hydraulic pto unit in a regular wave condition a w 0 2 m and t 3 622 s it can be seen that the simulation results obtained by using the combined model give a good agreement with those obtained by the test rig fig 6 shows the average captured power obtained by using the combined model together with the test data in several wave states one can see that there is also a good agreement between the simulation results and the test data such a good agreement presented in figs 5 and 6 indicates that the combined model presented here would be effective and reliable as a tool for predicting what the amount of power the two raft type wec can capture from the ocean waves 3 2 influence analysis of hydraulic pto parameters in this section we aim to investigate the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec over a wide range of wave states this will let us know how the capture ability of the two raft type wec varies with the component parameters of the hydraulic pto unit and how the optimal hydraulic pto unit parameters and their corresponding peak capture width ratio vary with the wave states all these will contribute to the optimal design of the hydraulic pto unit for the raft type wec this section is conducted based on a two raft type wec with physical and geometrical parameters d 2 m l 30 m d 0 1 m m 4 83 104 kg and i c 3 807 106 kg m2 whose hydraulic pto unit parameters are given in table 2 unless otherwise specified in our study the two hydraulic cylinders installed are the same i e a t a b α β 3 2 1 influence of piston area of hydraulic cylinder as shown in eqs 6 and 7 it can be seen that the piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t directly affects the forces applied by the hydraulic cylinders it is therefore of interest to discover the influence of piston area of hydraulic cylinder on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is examined with a wide range of piston areas of hydraulic cylinder fig 7 shows the variation of power capture width ratio η cap with the piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t for four wave conditions it can be seen that the power capture width ratio η cap is affected by the piston area of hydraulic cylinder for a certain wave state with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t the power capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a peak value which indicates that there exists an optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t to obtain a peak capture width ratio η cap it can also be learned that for the wave states with the same wave period the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at any specified piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t in addition the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes also increase with the increase of piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and then decrease after reaching maximum values in order to see how the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the power capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable piston area of hydraulic cylinder is examined under a wide range of wave conditions fig 8 shows the variation of the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three wave amplitudes one can see from fig 8 a that generally the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t increases but exhibits an obvious oscillation characteristic with increasing wave period while it is hardly sensitive to the wave amplitude we can learn from fig 8 b that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value two possible reasons should be responsible for it one is that in the studied wave periods the generalized wave excitation force increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after obtaining a peak value the other is that for a specified two raft type wec there exists an optimal ratio of wavelength to raft length and the ratio of wavelength to raft length first gets close to the optimal one and then gets away from it as the wave period increases the maximum values of peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m are 2 215 2 16 and 2 116 respectively which all occur around 6 s one can also see from fig 8 b that the differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes first increase with increasing wave period and then decrease after obtaining maximum values 3 2 2 influence of rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder to recognize the difference in power capture ability of the two raft type wec among different rod to piston area ratios α it is necessary to study the influence of rod to piston area ratio α on the capture width ratio η cap a broad range of rod to piston area ratios α is examined fig 9 shows the variation of capture width ratio η cap with the rod to piston area ratio α for five wave states it can be seen from fig 9 that with the increase of rod to piston area ratio the capture width ratio η cap decreases monotonously it means that the optimal rod to piston area ratio is α 0 i e the rod area is zero however such type of hydraulic cylinder is very difficult to machine practically the rod area should be as small as possible to achieve an excellent capture width ratio meanwhile it should have enough strength rigidity and stability one can also learn that for the wave states with the same wave period the higher the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at a specified rod to piston area ratio α in addition the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes reduce with increasing rod to piston area ratio α for the device operating in the wave states with the same amplitude the capture width ratio η cap obtained at any specified rod to piston area ratio α increases with increasing wave period and then decreases 3 2 3 influence of mounting position of hydraulic cylinder the influence of mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also of concern for the purpose of better understanding how the mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 affects the capture ability of the two raft type wec a wide range of mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 is examined fig 10 presents that the capture width ratio η cap varies with mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for three wave states it is clearly shown that the capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after obtaining a peak value as the mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 increases this indicates that for a specified wave state there exists an optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 which corresponds to a peak capture width ratio η cap the peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave states with wave period t 5 5 s and wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m are 2 281 2 236 and 2 139 respectively which are obtained approximately at r 0 1 93 m 1 91 m and 1 87 m respectively a similar tendency is observed in the variation of differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes with mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 it can also be learned that for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave conditions with the same wave period larger wave amplitude leads to smaller capture width ratio in order to have an insight into how the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 is examined under a wide range of wave states fig 11 shows the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave period for three wave amplitudes it can be seen from fig 11 a that in general the optimal mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for three wave amplitudes all increase but give an obvious oscillating characteristic as wave period increases for a certain wave period the optimal mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for different wave amplitudes are almost identical only with marginal difference this indicates that the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 largely relies on the wave period and shows little relationship with the wave amplitude fig 11 b exhibits the variation of the peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three wave amplitudes one can see that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratios η cap for three wave amplitudes all increase and then decrease after achieving maximum values viz 2 409 2 328 and 2 219 for the wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m respectively which all occur around 5 75 s in addition the differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes also increase with the increase of wave period and then decrease after reaching peak values 3 2 4 influence of displacement of hydraulic motor the displacement of hydraulic motor plays an important role in accommodating both pressures in hydraulic cylinder chamber and rotation speed of hydraulic motor hence the effect of displacement of hydraulic motor on power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also explored fig 12 presents the distribution of capture width ratio η cap at different wave states along the displacement of hydraulic motor d m one can see that the capture width ratio η cap increases with increasing displacement of hydraulic motor d m and then decreases after reaching a peak value therefore there is an optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m that makes the capture width ratio achieve a peak value η cap for any specified wave period the optimal displacements of hydraulic motor d m at different wave amplitudes seem to be identical only with marginal difference which are shown more explicitly in fig 13 a in addition the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at a specified displacement of hydraulic motor d m for wave conditions with the same wave period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with increasing displacement of hydraulic motor d m and then decrease after reaching a maximum value in order to see how the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable displacement of hydraulic motor is examined at a variety of wave states fig 13 a and b illustrate the variation of the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m and the peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three different wave amplitudes respectively it can be learned from fig 13 a that the wave amplitude has a negligible effect on the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m while the wave period makes a large difference for either 4 75 s t 7 s or 7 s t 9 s the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after obtaining a local peak value we can see from fig 13 b that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value the variation of differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes with wave period also follows a similar tendency 3 2 5 influence of initial volume of hp gas accumulator the hydraulic cylinders activated by the wave induced relative pitch motion would pump hydraulic oil through the control manifolds into the hp gas accumulator for short term energy storage and then the hydraulic motors use this smooth supply from the hp gas accumulator to drive electric generator therefore the hp gas accumulator plays a key role in decoupling the electric power production from the complicated wave power absorption process this enables the hydraulic pto unit to convert the largely fluctuating wave power with low frequency into a continuous and smooth power with relatively high frequency consequently achieving a smooth electric power production required for the marketable machines liu et al 2017 here we wonder whether the parameters of the hp gas accumulator v h0 and p h0 affect the power capture ability of the two raft type wec in order to see how the initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 affects the capture width ratio η cap a wide range of initial volumes of hp gas accumulator v h0 is examined fig 14 shows the variation of initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 on the capture width ratio η cap for five wave states it can be seen that for a specified wave state the capture width ratio η cap first increases slightly with increasing v h0 and then tends to be a steady value it reveals that a small value of v h0 may have an effect on the capture width ratio η cap while a large value of v h0 seems to make no difference it can also be learned that for a wave state the larger the wave amplitude is the more obvious the influence of initial volume v h0 on the capture width ratio η cap is 3 2 6 influence of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator the effect of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also of interest a wide range of pre charge pressures of hp gas accumulator p h0 is considered fig 15 presents the variation of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 on the capture width ratio η cap for five wave states similar to the results of influence of initial volume v h0 one can see that as the pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 ranges from 1 mpa to 8 mpa the capture width ratio η cap has a slight increase and then tend to be steady after the pre charge pressure p h0 reaching a certain value it indicates that small pre charge pressure makes a difference to the capture width ratio η cap while large pre charge pressure p h0 appears to have no effect one can also learn that larger wave amplitude leads to more obvious effect of pre charge pressure p h0 on the capture width ratio η cap 3 2 7 influence of effective damping of generator in the final investigation we explore the effect of effective damping of the generator b g fig 16 shows the variation of the effective damping of the generator b g on capture width ratio η cap for four wave states it is shown that for a certain wave condition the capture width ratio η cap increases with increasing effective damping of the generator b g and then decreases after reaching a peak value there exists an optimal effective damping of the generator b g corresponding to the peak value η cap the peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave states with the same period but different wave amplitudes occur approximately at a same effective damping which means that the optimal effective damping of generator b g more depends on the wave period rather than the wave amplitude as shown more explicitly in fig 17 a in addition for the wave states with the same wave period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with the increase of effective damping and then decrease after reaching maximum values the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is to get a better understanding of how the optimal effective damping of generator b g and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the two raft type wec with variable effective damping of generator is examined under a wide variety of wave states the variations of the optimal effective damping of generator b g and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap with the wave period for three wave amplitudes are illustrated in fig 17 a and b respectively it can be seen from fig 17 a that for 4 5 s t 5 25 s the optimal effective damping of generator b g increases with increasing wave period t and then decreases after reaching a local peak value for 5 25 s t 9 s the optimal effective damping of generator b g increases with the increase of wave period t then decreases after reaching a local peak value finally increases after obtaining a local minimum value one can see from fig 17 b that as the wave period increases the peak capture width ratio η cap increases and then decreases after achieving a maximum value 4 conclusions in this paper a two raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto unit is considered the hydraulic pto unit composed of two hydraulic cylinders two gas accumulators and a hydraulic motor coupled with a generator is available to capture power by using the relative pitch motion between the two rafts to investigate the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec a combined model based on the linear wave theory and basic hydraulic equations is presented and validated by comparison of the present results with the data obtained by a hil test rig the model can be used to predict the power captured by the device from the investigation above for a specified two raft type wec the following conclusions can be made 1 the capture width ratios η cap increase with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g and then decrease after reaching peak values respectively there are optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g which correspond to the peak capture width ratios η cap the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g appear to be hardly sensitive to the wave amplitude but largely depend on the wave period their corresponding peak capture width ratios η cap increase with increasing wave period and then decrease after reaching maximum values 2 the capture width ratio η cap decreases monotonously with increasing rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder α the rod area should be as small as possible but it also should have enough strength rigidity and stability 3 small initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 or small pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 may have an effect on the capture width ratio η cap and the larger the wave amplitude is the more obvious the effect is while large value of initial volume v h0 or pre charge pressure p h0 seems to make no difference to the capture width ratio η cap 4 for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave states with the same period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m effective damping of generator b g and then decrease after reaching maximum values respectively in contrast they decrease monotonously as the rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder α increases 5 for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave states with the same wave period larger wave amplitude gives smaller capture width ratio η cap the present model may make a good prediction on the captured power of the two raft type wec however without any consideration of power losses in the hydraulic pto unit due to the undesirable physical effects such as friction leakage pressure drops and characteristics of hydraulic fluid it may over estimate the electric power production of the generator this

with the wave states are also illustrated keywords raft type wave energy converter hydraulic power take off unit hardware in the loop test rig power capture ability capture width ratio 1 introduction wave power with large energy flux density is regarded as one of the most promising renewable energy source how to extract and utilize this type of energy from the ocean waves has received considerable attention from the researchers and engineering designers in many countries over the past two decades so far numerous concepts of wave energy conversion have been proposed and many of wave energy conversion techniques have been patented drew et al 2009 among the various concepts of wave energy converters wecs the raft type wecs consisting of a series of semi submerged rafts hinged end to end by the joints with hydraulic power take off pto systems are proven to have high stability and energy conversion efficiency since their pto units react against their own body rather than against a separate external reaction frame which enable them to quickly adapt to the extreme sea states for a good survivability mccormick 2007 yemm et al 2012 the raft type wecs are offshore floating slack moored devices normally they are aligned with the predominant wave propagation direction such that they can use the wave curvatures to improve the energy extraction haren and mei 1982 yemm et al 2012 as the wave passes along the length of the rafts each raft outputs surge heave and pitch motions the relative pitch motion between different rafts around the joint would force the hydraulic cylinders to pump the high pressure hp oil through the hp gas accumulator to the hydraulic motor then the difference pressure between the hp gas accumulator and low pressure lp gas accumulator drives the hydraulic motor shaft to rotate and this rotation forces the generator to produce electricity henderson 2006 liu et al 2017 the concept of the raft type device seems to be first conceived by cockerell who designed a raft type articulated barge system called cockerell raft in 1974 wooley and platts 1975 later in 1978 haren 1978 used a two dimensional fluid structure coupling model to make a comprehensive theoretical study of a hagen cockerell raft by assuming the hydraulic pto unit as a linear damper and proved that the efficiency of a floating raft hinged at a vertical wall can reach 100 when the damping coefficient of the pto unit is optimized following the research of haren 1978 kraemer 2001 and nolan et al 2003 studied another similar raft type wave energy conversion device which is known as mccabe wave pump mwp the mwp is composed of three rectangular steel floating pontoons articulated together in which the heave motion of the central pontoon is damped by a submerged horizontal plate wan nik et al 2011 two sets of hydraulic cylinders are equipped in the device such that the relative pitch motion between the barges around the joint could be used to drive the hydraulic cylinder to convert the wave energy into useful energy or desalinize seawater a study of the mwp showed that the pitch motion and energy absorption can be optimized by adjusting the ratio between the length of barges and the wavelength kraemer 2001 in comparison with mwp the pelamis wec is another more cost effective raft type device containing four or five cylindrical segments articulated end to end by the joints it can utilize not only the relative pitch motion around the joints but also the relative yaw motion to pump hp oil into hp gas accumulators and then drive the generators to produce electricity henderson 2006 yemm et al 2012 the wave energy conversion capability and the ability of resistance to aggressive wave conditions of the pelamis wec had been explored by retzler et al 2003 whose results showed that the maximum power capture width of the device could reach a value as large as 1 5 times of its displacement width in the recent studies the power capture ability of a raft type like wave energy conversion device m4 consisting of three cylindrical floats was experimentally investigated by stansby et al 2014 2015a 2015b in their research the power capture abilities of the devices m4 with rounded base floats were compared with that with flat base floats and their finding showed that the floats with rounded base can extract more 60 energy due to reducing energy losses zheng et al 2015 investigated the effects of cross section of the raft and raft radius of gyration on the wave energy conversion capacity of a raft type wec with an elliptic cylinder shape and with the assumption of linear pto unit two theoretical models for maximizing wave energy conversion of the device was proposed in the research of zheng et al 2016a 2016b considering the combined action of non linear waves and viscous flows chen et al 2016 studied the influence of wave height wave period pto damping coefficient and flow velocity on the wave energy dissipator ratio and wave transmission coefficient of a twin raft wave energy dissipator following the work of zheng et al 2015 and chen et al 2016 yu et al 2016 combined the advantage of raft type wecs and pendulum type wecs and proposed a novel wec called wave loong composed of two rafts hinged end to end by the joint and one pendulum hung at the hinged joint the effect of pendulum radius of gyration pendulum length pendulum mass raft length pto damping and wavelength on the capture ability of the novel wec was investigated more recently with the consideration of dynamics of hydraulic circuit and hydraulic components liu et al 2017 investigated the performance of a two raft type wec connected with a hydraulic pto unit they highlighted the difference in the behavior of a raft type wec with a hydraulic pto unit and with a linear pto unit and the relationships among the optimal power capture ability the normalized optimal magnitude of the hydraulic pto force and the wave states were numerically revealed in their research so far most of the previous studies are limited to characterizing the hydraulic pto unit as a linear pto unit and to the best of the authors knowledge no work has been reported about the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the wave energy capture ability of the raft type wecs actually the wave energy capture ability of the raft type wecs relies on several parameters of the hydraulic pto unit the piston area rod to piston area ratio and mounting position of hydraulic cylinder the displacement of hydraulic motor the initial volume and pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator and the effective damping of generator this paper is an extension and a continuation of the work of liu et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to present a numerical study of a two raft type wec focusing on the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the raft type wec the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a two raft type wec is first introduced then a mathematical model for the dynamics of such a wec is presented based on the linear wave theory and hydraulic basic equations model validation and numerical investigations into the effect of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec are shown in section 3 finally conclusions are made in section 4 2 formulation of the problem we consider a raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto unit called two raft type wec as shown in fig 1 the two rafts with cylindrical shape have the same length l and diameter d and are hinged by a joint with a gap d 0 between them actually the two raft type wec can be considered as a two barge pelamis device in which only the relative pitch motion between the two barges is utilized to capture energy the mass center of each raft coincides well with its geometry center the motion characteristic of the wec is described in a cartesian coordinate x y and z system with its origin o coincident with the center of the joint where the x and y axes are taken along the length and the diameter direction of the rafts in still water respectively while the z axis is in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 a 2 1 equation of motion assuming the incident wave with amplitude a w and angular frequency ɷ propagating along the positive x axis the motion of the wec takes place in xoz plane in the linear wave theory the wave force can be written as f w j t f e j t f r j t f hys j t j 1 3 5 indicates the surge heave and pitch modes of the fore raft respectively j 1 3 5 indicates the surge heave and pitch modes of the aft raft respectively falnes 2002 for the wec in the wave considered the rafts are regarded as rigid bodies since their deformation is very small based on the lagrange s equations liu et al 2017 adopted a generalized displacement vector x gen t x 0 z 0 θ 1 θ 2 t here superscript t means the transpose of a vector to describe the motion characteristic of the wec and gave the time domain motion equation as 1 m a gen add x gen t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ k gen x gen t f gen e t f pto t where a gen add is the limiting value of the generalized added mass matrix a gen add ω for ω the expressions of terms used in eq 1 are given in the appendix the wave excitation force acting on mode j of the rafts f e j t can be given by falnes 2002 2 f e j t a w γ j ω cos ω t γ j ω where γ j ɷ is the frequency dependent complex excitation force coefficient force per unit incident wave amplitude at mode j whose modulus and argument are γ j ɷ and γ j ɷ as shown in eq 1 there is a convolution term which makes it inconvenient to perform the simulation of such type of time domain model taghipour et al 2008 and perez and fossen 2008 2011 adopted a linear time invariant parametric model in state space form to substitute the convolution term by frequency domain identification with the assumption of linearity the convolution integral in eq 1 can be approximated by a state space model 3 μ t 0 t h t τ x gen τ d τ x s a s x s b s x gen t μ t c s x s where a s b s and c s are coefficient matrices of the state space model x s is the state vector of the state space model 2 2 equations for the hydraulic pto unit the hydraulic pto unit widely used in the raft type wec is shown in fig 2 the chamber without piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder is connected to the chamber with piston rod of the bottom hydraulic cylinder to be chamber 14 since they perform the same function when the piston moves similarly the chamber with piston rod of the top hydraulic cylinder and the chamber without piston rod of the bottom hydraulic cylinder are connected together to be chamber 23 within the linear wave theory and small amplitude motion when the wave induces a relative pitch motion θ 1 θ 2 between the two rafts the corresponding displacements of the top and bottom hydraulic pistons can be expressed as 4 d t r 0 θ 2 θ 1 5 d b r 0 θ 1 θ 2 the forces produced by the top and bottom hydraulic cylinders are 6 f t t p 14 a t p 23 1 α a t 7 f b t p 23 a b p 14 1 β a b as shown in fig 2 when the chamber 14 pumps hydraulic oil into the hp gas accumulator the check valve 2 would be opened and at the same time the chamber 23 would sink hydraulic oil from the lp gas accumulator through the check valve 3 when the pistons are in the middle position of their strokes the volumes of chamber 14 and chamber 23 are labeled as v 14 0 and v 23 0 respectively thus the pressure variation in chamber 14 and 23 can be described by the following fluid continuity equation merritt 1967 8 p 14 β e q l q 2 a t d t 1 β a b d b v 14 0 a t d t 1 β a b d b 9 p 23 β e q 3 q 4 a b d b 1 α a t d t v 23 0 a b d b 1 α a t d t where q i is the flowrate through the check valve i i 1 2 3 and 4 which can be expressed as merritt 1967 10 q i 0 δ p i 0 k δ p i δ p i 0 the compression or expansion process of gas in the hp and lp accumulators can be considered as an isentropic process thus the volume and pressure of gas in the hp and lp gas accumulators should satisfy the following equations 11 p h v h γ p h0 v h0 γ 12 p l v l γ p l0 v l0 γ where γ is the adiabatic index γ 1 4 in case of nitrogen and the instantaneous volumes of gas in the lp and hp gas accumulators v l and v h can be expressed as 13 v l v l0 0 t q l d t 14 v h v h0 0 t q h d t based on fluid continuity equations of the hydraulic circuit the following equations should be satisfied 15 q h q 2 q 4 q m 16 q l q m q 1 q 3 17 q m d m ω m the dynamic equation concerning the coupling between the hydraulic motor and the electric generator is given by 18 t m j ω m b g ω m the output moment of the hydraulic motor t m is given by 19 t m d m p h p l 2 3 equations for evaluating the power capture ability the instantaneous power captured by the two raft type wec p inst cap t is given by 20 p inst cap t f b t d b f t t d t the average power captured by the two raft type wec p ave cap can be expressed as 21 p ave cap 1 t t 0 t 0 t p inst cap t d t where t 0 is a moment when the two raft type wec has come into a steady state of motion the power of the incident wave per unit width of the wave front p w can be obtained by falnes 2002 22 p w ρ g ω a w 2 4 k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h the power capture ability of a wec is widely evaluated by its capture width ratio or capture factor η cap which reflects the fraction of wave power flowing through the wec that is absorbed by the wec 23 η cap p ave cap p w d 3 results and discussion the hydrodynamic parameters a uj b uj and γ j ɷ can be computed directly in the frequency domain by the boundary element method bem based on diffraction theory using the commercial program aqwa aqwa 2011 then the coefficient matrixes a s b s and c s of the state space model in eq 2 can obtained by frequency domain identification prior to illustrating the effect of hydraulic pto unit parameters on power capture ability of the two raft type wec the model presented in the previous section is first validated in section 3 1 then the validated model is utilized to explore the effect of hydraulic pto parameters on the power capture ability of the device all the studies in our work are carried out in infinite water depth 3 1 model validation assuming there is no pto unit liu et al 2017 has validated the motion equation of the two raft type wec by comparison of the results with the published results in this section we use a hardware in the loop hil test rig to validate the hydraulic pto model fig 3 shows the architecture of the hil test rig the hil test rig is designed to replicate the wave induced relative pitch motion between the two rafts and utilize the replicated relative pitch motion to drive the hydraulic pto unit to capture wave energy as shown in fig 3 the fixed base and the beam are regarded as the fore raft and the aft raft respectively a matlab xpc target real time machine is employed to run the real time motion equation of the two raft type wec the emulation of the wave induced relative pitch motion θ 1 θ 2 is implemented by a hydraulic power pack system through a hydraulic servo valve controlled a driving hydraulic cylinder the generalized wave excitation forces generated offline according to the wave states are the inputs of the hil test rig these forces together with the hydraulic cylinder forces measured by the force sensors feed into the motion equation see eq 1 of the device to evaluate a desired relative pitch motion between the two rafts real timely then the desired displacement x p d which the driving hydraulic cylinder piston should produce can be determined meanwhile the actual displacement of the driving hydraulic cylinder piston x p is measured in real time using a linear variable differential transformer lvdt displacement sensor and fed back to compare with the desired one the comparison result through the controller gives a signal δi to make the hydraulic servo valve control the hydraulic fluid through the driving hydraulic cylinder so that the actual displacement of the driving hydraulic cylinder piston x p can track the desired one x p d thus the relative pitch motion between the two rafts can be reproduced in the absence of waves and drives the hydraulic cylinders of the pto unit to pump hp oil for converting wave energy into usable electric energy as they do in the real wave condition this means that such hil test rig allows performing cheap dry test on the hydraulic pto unit of the two raft type wec thus the hil capability makes the test rig a useful tool to evaluate the power captured by the two raft type wec fig 4 shows a photo of the hil test rig in which the tested pto unit is designed for a two raft type wec with physical and geometrical parameters d 1 m l 10 m d 0 1 m m 4 025 103 kg and i c 3 618 104 kg m2 the parameters of the tested pto unit in the test rig are presented in table 1 fig 5 shows the results of behavior of the hydraulic pto unit in a regular wave condition a w 0 2 m and t 3 622 s it can be seen that the simulation results obtained by using the combined model give a good agreement with those obtained by the test rig fig 6 shows the average captured power obtained by using the combined model together with the test data in several wave states one can see that there is also a good agreement between the simulation results and the test data such a good agreement presented in figs 5 and 6 indicates that the combined model presented here would be effective and reliable as a tool for predicting what the amount of power the two raft type wec can capture from the ocean waves 3 2 influence analysis of hydraulic pto parameters in this section we aim to investigate the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec over a wide range of wave states this will let us know how the capture ability of the two raft type wec varies with the component parameters of the hydraulic pto unit and how the optimal hydraulic pto unit parameters and their corresponding peak capture width ratio vary with the wave states all these will contribute to the optimal design of the hydraulic pto unit for the raft type wec this section is conducted based on a two raft type wec with physical and geometrical parameters d 2 m l 30 m d 0 1 m m 4 83 104 kg and i c 3 807 106 kg m2 whose hydraulic pto unit parameters are given in table 2 unless otherwise specified in our study the two hydraulic cylinders installed are the same i e a t a b α β 3 2 1 influence of piston area of hydraulic cylinder as shown in eqs 6 and 7 it can be seen that the piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t directly affects the forces applied by the hydraulic cylinders it is therefore of interest to discover the influence of piston area of hydraulic cylinder on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is examined with a wide range of piston areas of hydraulic cylinder fig 7 shows the variation of power capture width ratio η cap with the piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t for four wave conditions it can be seen that the power capture width ratio η cap is affected by the piston area of hydraulic cylinder for a certain wave state with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t the power capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a peak value which indicates that there exists an optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t to obtain a peak capture width ratio η cap it can also be learned that for the wave states with the same wave period the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at any specified piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t in addition the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes also increase with the increase of piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and then decrease after reaching maximum values in order to see how the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the power capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable piston area of hydraulic cylinder is examined under a wide range of wave conditions fig 8 shows the variation of the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three wave amplitudes one can see from fig 8 a that generally the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t increases but exhibits an obvious oscillation characteristic with increasing wave period while it is hardly sensitive to the wave amplitude we can learn from fig 8 b that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value two possible reasons should be responsible for it one is that in the studied wave periods the generalized wave excitation force increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after obtaining a peak value the other is that for a specified two raft type wec there exists an optimal ratio of wavelength to raft length and the ratio of wavelength to raft length first gets close to the optimal one and then gets away from it as the wave period increases the maximum values of peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m are 2 215 2 16 and 2 116 respectively which all occur around 6 s one can also see from fig 8 b that the differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes first increase with increasing wave period and then decrease after obtaining maximum values 3 2 2 influence of rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder to recognize the difference in power capture ability of the two raft type wec among different rod to piston area ratios α it is necessary to study the influence of rod to piston area ratio α on the capture width ratio η cap a broad range of rod to piston area ratios α is examined fig 9 shows the variation of capture width ratio η cap with the rod to piston area ratio α for five wave states it can be seen from fig 9 that with the increase of rod to piston area ratio the capture width ratio η cap decreases monotonously it means that the optimal rod to piston area ratio is α 0 i e the rod area is zero however such type of hydraulic cylinder is very difficult to machine practically the rod area should be as small as possible to achieve an excellent capture width ratio meanwhile it should have enough strength rigidity and stability one can also learn that for the wave states with the same wave period the higher the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at a specified rod to piston area ratio α in addition the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes reduce with increasing rod to piston area ratio α for the device operating in the wave states with the same amplitude the capture width ratio η cap obtained at any specified rod to piston area ratio α increases with increasing wave period and then decreases 3 2 3 influence of mounting position of hydraulic cylinder the influence of mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also of concern for the purpose of better understanding how the mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 affects the capture ability of the two raft type wec a wide range of mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 is examined fig 10 presents that the capture width ratio η cap varies with mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for three wave states it is clearly shown that the capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after obtaining a peak value as the mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 increases this indicates that for a specified wave state there exists an optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 which corresponds to a peak capture width ratio η cap the peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave states with wave period t 5 5 s and wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m are 2 281 2 236 and 2 139 respectively which are obtained approximately at r 0 1 93 m 1 91 m and 1 87 m respectively a similar tendency is observed in the variation of differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes with mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 it can also be learned that for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave conditions with the same wave period larger wave amplitude leads to smaller capture width ratio in order to have an insight into how the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 is examined under a wide range of wave states fig 11 shows the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave period for three wave amplitudes it can be seen from fig 11 a that in general the optimal mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for three wave amplitudes all increase but give an obvious oscillating characteristic as wave period increases for a certain wave period the optimal mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 for different wave amplitudes are almost identical only with marginal difference this indicates that the optimal mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 largely relies on the wave period and shows little relationship with the wave amplitude fig 11 b exhibits the variation of the peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three wave amplitudes one can see that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratios η cap for three wave amplitudes all increase and then decrease after achieving maximum values viz 2 409 2 328 and 2 219 for the wave amplitudes a w 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 m respectively which all occur around 5 75 s in addition the differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes also increase with the increase of wave period and then decrease after reaching peak values 3 2 4 influence of displacement of hydraulic motor the displacement of hydraulic motor plays an important role in accommodating both pressures in hydraulic cylinder chamber and rotation speed of hydraulic motor hence the effect of displacement of hydraulic motor on power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also explored fig 12 presents the distribution of capture width ratio η cap at different wave states along the displacement of hydraulic motor d m one can see that the capture width ratio η cap increases with increasing displacement of hydraulic motor d m and then decreases after reaching a peak value therefore there is an optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m that makes the capture width ratio achieve a peak value η cap for any specified wave period the optimal displacements of hydraulic motor d m at different wave amplitudes seem to be identical only with marginal difference which are shown more explicitly in fig 13 a in addition the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is obtained at a specified displacement of hydraulic motor d m for wave conditions with the same wave period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with increasing displacement of hydraulic motor d m and then decrease after reaching a maximum value in order to see how the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the capture ability of the two raft type wec with variable displacement of hydraulic motor is examined at a variety of wave states fig 13 a and b illustrate the variation of the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m and the peak capture width ratio η cap with wave period for three different wave amplitudes respectively it can be learned from fig 13 a that the wave amplitude has a negligible effect on the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m while the wave period makes a large difference for either 4 75 s t 7 s or 7 s t 9 s the optimal displacement of hydraulic motor d m increases with increasing wave period and then decreases after obtaining a local peak value we can see from fig 13 b that with increasing wave period the peak capture width ratio η cap first increases and then decreases after reaching a maximum value the variation of differences in peak capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes with wave period also follows a similar tendency 3 2 5 influence of initial volume of hp gas accumulator the hydraulic cylinders activated by the wave induced relative pitch motion would pump hydraulic oil through the control manifolds into the hp gas accumulator for short term energy storage and then the hydraulic motors use this smooth supply from the hp gas accumulator to drive electric generator therefore the hp gas accumulator plays a key role in decoupling the electric power production from the complicated wave power absorption process this enables the hydraulic pto unit to convert the largely fluctuating wave power with low frequency into a continuous and smooth power with relatively high frequency consequently achieving a smooth electric power production required for the marketable machines liu et al 2017 here we wonder whether the parameters of the hp gas accumulator v h0 and p h0 affect the power capture ability of the two raft type wec in order to see how the initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 affects the capture width ratio η cap a wide range of initial volumes of hp gas accumulator v h0 is examined fig 14 shows the variation of initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 on the capture width ratio η cap for five wave states it can be seen that for a specified wave state the capture width ratio η cap first increases slightly with increasing v h0 and then tends to be a steady value it reveals that a small value of v h0 may have an effect on the capture width ratio η cap while a large value of v h0 seems to make no difference it can also be learned that for a wave state the larger the wave amplitude is the more obvious the influence of initial volume v h0 on the capture width ratio η cap is 3 2 6 influence of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator the effect of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec is also of interest a wide range of pre charge pressures of hp gas accumulator p h0 is considered fig 15 presents the variation of pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 on the capture width ratio η cap for five wave states similar to the results of influence of initial volume v h0 one can see that as the pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 ranges from 1 mpa to 8 mpa the capture width ratio η cap has a slight increase and then tend to be steady after the pre charge pressure p h0 reaching a certain value it indicates that small pre charge pressure makes a difference to the capture width ratio η cap while large pre charge pressure p h0 appears to have no effect one can also learn that larger wave amplitude leads to more obvious effect of pre charge pressure p h0 on the capture width ratio η cap 3 2 7 influence of effective damping of generator in the final investigation we explore the effect of effective damping of the generator b g fig 16 shows the variation of the effective damping of the generator b g on capture width ratio η cap for four wave states it is shown that for a certain wave condition the capture width ratio η cap increases with increasing effective damping of the generator b g and then decreases after reaching a peak value there exists an optimal effective damping of the generator b g corresponding to the peak value η cap the peak capture width ratios η cap for the wave states with the same period but different wave amplitudes occur approximately at a same effective damping which means that the optimal effective damping of generator b g more depends on the wave period rather than the wave amplitude as shown more explicitly in fig 17 a in addition for the wave states with the same wave period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with the increase of effective damping and then decrease after reaching maximum values the larger the wave amplitude is the smaller the capture width ratio η cap is to get a better understanding of how the optimal effective damping of generator b g and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap vary with the wave states the two raft type wec with variable effective damping of generator is examined under a wide variety of wave states the variations of the optimal effective damping of generator b g and the corresponding peak capture width ratio η cap with the wave period for three wave amplitudes are illustrated in fig 17 a and b respectively it can be seen from fig 17 a that for 4 5 s t 5 25 s the optimal effective damping of generator b g increases with increasing wave period t and then decreases after reaching a local peak value for 5 25 s t 9 s the optimal effective damping of generator b g increases with the increase of wave period t then decreases after reaching a local peak value finally increases after obtaining a local minimum value one can see from fig 17 b that as the wave period increases the peak capture width ratio η cap increases and then decreases after achieving a maximum value 4 conclusions in this paper a two raft type wec consisting of two rafts and a hydraulic pto unit is considered the hydraulic pto unit composed of two hydraulic cylinders two gas accumulators and a hydraulic motor coupled with a generator is available to capture power by using the relative pitch motion between the two rafts to investigate the influence of hydraulic pto unit parameters on the power capture ability of the two raft type wec a combined model based on the linear wave theory and basic hydraulic equations is presented and validated by comparison of the present results with the data obtained by a hil test rig the model can be used to predict the power captured by the device from the investigation above for a specified two raft type wec the following conclusions can be made 1 the capture width ratios η cap increase with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g and then decrease after reaching peak values respectively there are optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting positions of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g which correspond to the peak capture width ratios η cap the optimal piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m and effective damping of generator b g appear to be hardly sensitive to the wave amplitude but largely depend on the wave period their corresponding peak capture width ratios η cap increase with increasing wave period and then decrease after reaching maximum values 2 the capture width ratio η cap decreases monotonously with increasing rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder α the rod area should be as small as possible but it also should have enough strength rigidity and stability 3 small initial volume of hp gas accumulator v h0 or small pre charge pressure of hp gas accumulator p h0 may have an effect on the capture width ratio η cap and the larger the wave amplitude is the more obvious the effect is while large value of initial volume v h0 or pre charge pressure p h0 seems to make no difference to the capture width ratio η cap 4 for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave states with the same period the differences in capture width ratios η cap among different wave amplitudes increase with increasing piston area of hydraulic cylinder a t mounting position of hydraulic cylinder r 0 displacement of hydraulic motor d m effective damping of generator b g and then decrease after reaching maximum values respectively in contrast they decrease monotonously as the rod to piston area ratio of hydraulic cylinder α increases 5 for a specified two raft type wec operating in the wave states with the same wave period larger wave amplitude gives smaller capture width ratio η cap the present model may make a good prediction on the captured power of the two raft type wec however without any consideration of power losses in the hydraulic pto unit due to the undesirable physical effects such as friction leakage pressure drops and characteristics of hydraulic fluid it may over estimate the electric power production of the generator this

23624,a simplified method is proposed to model the water impact of an elastic wedge by combining a modal analysis for the structural deflection and an analytical model for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body the structural deflections are expressed by wet modes shapes of the beam and are calculated using modal superposition and duhamel integral method the results from the simplified approach are compared with the calculations by using a fully coupled numerical method the fully coupled simulation is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation included in the commercial software ls dyna the lagrangian formulation is used to describe plane strain deformations of the structure and the eulerian formulation is applied to analyze the changes of the fluid the structural deflections of wedges with different deadrise angles from the simplified method are compared with published results of theoretical method and fully coupled bem fem method showing a very significant reduction of required computation time the convergence of the modal shapes is also investigated the deflections of flexible wedges with various deadrise angles impact velocities and edge boundary conditions are computed and discussed keywords water impact hydroelastic effects modified logvinovich model mlm modal superposition duhamel integral 1 introduction the hydrodynamic impact between marine structures and waves may induce impulsive pressure loads which consequently affects the ship structure both locally and globally due to the large magnitude and short duration the generated impulsive forces may lead to considerable vibrations and local structural damages and thus the accurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hulls and the associated responses are crucial in the design of marine structures the initial approaches to estimate the slamming loads and the associated responses of ship structure treated separately the two time scales involved in this problem the relative motion between the ship and the waves was determined by time simulations based on linear or non linear ship motion theories i e belik et al 1983 guedes soares 1989 rajendran et al 2015 when the location of the water impact and the relative velocity were predicted the slam induced loads on ship sections can be estimated by analytical models i e wagner 1932 howison et al 1991 mei et al 1999

wang and guedes soares 2013 2014a wagner 1932 has developed the theory of impact which is based on a flat disc approximation and potential flow theory for ideal and incompressible liquid within this approximation the wetted part of the entering body is substituted with a flat disc and the bernoulli equation is linearized and the boundary conditions are imposed on the initial position of the liquid boundary the higher order terms in bernoulli equation were taken into account within the generalized wagner model and the longinovich model see korobkin 2004 in order to improve the predictions of the classical wagner theory korobkin 2004 suggested that the modified longinovich model should be used in more general cases the review work of abrate 2013 presented the basic principles and analytical solutions of the water entry problems including the discussions on the trapped air below a flat body wang and guedes soares 2013 2014a have presented the study of the slamming loads on two dimensional and three dimensional rigid bodies by using the fully coupled ale fem method their results agree well with the experimental studies of aarsnes 1996 and de backer et al 2009 similarly a two dimensional sph algorithm has been developed and applied to the problem of ship keel and bow flare slamming in veen and gourlay 2012 which has shown reasonable agreement with measured values in hermundstad and moan 2005 on the slamming pressures facci et al 2015 have implemented a direct computational framework to study the two dimensional flow physics generated during the water entry of a rigid wedge their work show that piv based methodology allows for an accurate reconstruction of the pressure field from the measured velocity field except for early stages of the impact and for a small region close to the free surface as mentioned above these initial studies on the local slamming loads were conducted without considering the effects of elastic responses of the structure in ship hydrodynamics the impact velocities are of the order of several meters per second if the plate thickness is relatively small then hydroelasticity is a problem even for bodies with moderate deadrise angle lu et al 2000 faltinsen 1997 chen et al 2006 this hydroelastic problem is still a challenging subject due to the extremely complex flow field on the structural surface during the impact local hydroelastic slamming has been studied theoretical and experimentally for slamming problems on by faltinsen 1997 1999 2000 their studies show that the effects of hydroelasticity are based on the relationship of the material and geometric properties of the structure the impact velocity and the relative angle between the water and the structure surface lu et al 2000 have demonstrated a fully coupled analysis of the elastic wedges impacting with water the fluid flow is solved by the boundary element method bem together with the fully nonlinear free surface condition the structural response is analyzed based on linear elastic theory using the finite element method fem korobkin 1998 and khabakhpasheva 2006 have analyzed the wave impact on a simply supported elastic plate by combining the classical wagner 1932 theory and euler bernoulli beam theory wagner theory is utilized to predict the hydrodynamic loading by linearizing the boundary conditions for the potential flow on the initial water surface and accounting for the structural deformations korobkin et al 2006 and khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 have developed a similar method that coupled the beam finite element model with wagner theory of water impact because of the flat disk approximation of wagner s theory this method is only applicable to any elastic body with small deadrise angle entering water vertically at moderate velocity to study the water impact of sandwich composite hulls wagner theory in combination with a high order structural model has been considered by qin and batra 2009 wang et al 2015 have analyzed the hydroelastic responses of a horizontal plate impacting with the water by extending the method proposed by faltinsen 1997 to address forward speeds and compressions on the plate besides some researchers have proposed simplified solutions based on decoupling the structural deformation from the fluid flow by computing the hydrodynamic loading with the assumption of rigid structures i e luo et al 2012 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 luo et al 2012 have studied the slamming load and response of one complex 3d steel wedge with stiffened panels on both sides one uncoupled solution combining wagner theory and a fem code was presented to predict the stress responses of elastic structures by transient analysis the predicted results agree well with the measured data from free drop tests though the effect of elastic response on hydrodynamic pressure is not considered in the simplified solution shams and porfiri 2015 have extended the methodology proposed by khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 to address arbitrary boundary conditions and free fall impacts panciroli and porfiri 2014 have studied experimentally the hydroelastic impact of an active flexible wedge on an otherwise quiescent fluid and the measured results are interpreted through a distributed model based on linear plate theory and wagner s approximate solution for the hydrodynamic load recently computational solutions have been widely used in hydroelastic slamming problems maki et al 2011 have studied the impact of an elastic wedge onto the free surface by using a loosely coupled method which combines cfd and fem tools in a one way manner the cfd is used to assess the loading on a rigid body and the pressure and stress field is projected onto a structural model modal analysis is used to represent the wet structure their results agreed well with the calculations of lu et al 2000 a fully coupled simulation of an elastic wedge entering into water has been studied by stenius et al 2007 using an explicit finite element method hydroelastic effects on the structural response are systematically studied for different impact velocities boundary conditions and structural mass their further studies have been presented in stenius et al 2011 which includes the calculations from a simplified in house developed method the fundamental mechanisms involved in panel water impact related hydroelastic problems have been extensively investigated however comparisons between the method and other theoretical or numerical tools are not found similarly panciroli et al 2012 have developed a coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics finite element method to study water entry of flexible wedges wang and guedes soares 2014b have conducted the numerical study on the hydroelastic impact of a flexible wedge by using ls dyna and the results are in good agreement with lu et al 2000 in this work a simplified method is proposed to study the hydroelastic water entry of a wedge at a constant velocity and the results are validated against a fully coupled simulation method the simplified method is based on the assumption that the structural deformation doesn t affect the loading on the wetted surface of the structure analytical models derived from velocity potential are used for prediction of the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body and the structural responses under the impulse load are calculated by a modal analysis the present simplified method is validated through the comparison of structural deflection with the results from the fully coupled numerical method which is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation implemented in ls dyna different deadrise angles beam thicknesses edge boundary condition and impact velocities of the elastic wedge are considered their effects on the hydroelastic deflection of a plate are discussed results show that the present simplified method gives satisfactory prediction of the deflection on an elastic wedge when the hydroelastic effect is not significant this method can be easily derived and solved and with proper model for the hydrodynamic loading on a rigid wedge it could be applicable for a wedge with arbitrary deadrise angle and falling velocity the fully coupled numerical method can be used for hydroelastic water impact problems of an arbitrary geometry body though high computation effort is required 2 methodology 2 1 simplified method the symmetric water impact of a wedge with length l and deadrise angle β is illustrated in fig 1 the coordinate system x z is used for the calculation of hydrodynamic pressure on the wetted surface with the origin at the intersection between the initially calm water surface and the symmetric line the wedge enters into the water at a velocity d h d t and the half wetted length on the structural bottom is denoted as c t to represent the structural deflection of a beam a local coordinate system x z is introduced with the origin at the intersection between the keel and the center plane of the intact beam the theoretical model of the vibration of the wedge plate due to impact pressure is represented by using euler beam theory for strips of the plates assuming that the boundary conditions and loading are invariant along the width of a plate assuming that the rotary inertia is small the governing equation of motion for a beam is given by 1 e i x 4 w x 4 m x 2 w t 2 p x w t where ei is the sectional bending stiffness m is the structural mass per unit area p is the hydrodynamic pressure as a function of the beam s deflection and the position on the beam w is the deflection of the beam in z direction t is the time variable and x is a longitudinal coordinate with x l 2 in the middle of the beam the solution is written in terms of dry normal modes ψ n 2 w x t n

boundary conditions of the beam at x 0 and x l where l is the length of the beam the eigen functions can be obtained and the associated dry natural frequencies and eigen modes are obtained by substituting eq 2 into the forced vibration equation eq 1 5 e i n 1 d 4 ψ n x d x 4 a n t m n 1 ψ n x d 2 a n t t 2 p x w t combining with eq 3 eq 5 can be written as 6 n 1 ω n 2 ψ n x a n t n 1 ψ n x

the term on the right hand side of eq 7 is defined as q t by using the duhamel integral the solution of eq 7 can be expressed by 8 a n t a n 0 cos ω n t a n 0 sin ω n t ω n 1 ω n 0 t q τ sin ω n t τ d

w x t n 1 1 ω n 0 t q τ sin ω n t τ d τ ψ n x to evaluate the pressure distribution on the wetted surface c t of the wedge it is assumed that the fluid is ideal and incompressible the liquid region is of infinite depth and gravity effects and surface tension are neglected the hydrodynamic pressure p x z t in the flow domain is given by the cauchy lagrange integral korobkin 2004 10 p x z t ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 where ρ is the liquid density and the definitions of the pressure distribution p x t on the wetted surface and the velocity potential ϕ x t in the contact domain are given as 11 p x t p x f x h t

distribution at the initial stage of the impact have been performed in detail by howison et al 1991 korobkin 2004 discussed analytical models which were based on the velocity potential given by the classical wagner theory the higher order terms in the bernoulli equation were taken into account within the logvinovich model the velocity potential takes the form 15 ϕ x t φ w x 0 t h t f x h t d t where the function d t was introduced by korobkin 2004 to describe the linearization of the free surface on the contact region φ w x z t is the solution of the classical wagner problem 16 δ φ w 0 z 0

on the flexible beam does not vary with its deflection and introducing the hydrodynamic pressure see eq 26 28 into eq 9 the beam s deflection during the water impact can be calculated if a free falling velocity is taken into account the derivatives of entry penetration and wetted length should be introduced in eq 24 consider a different model for the hydrodynamic loading in eq 9 this simplified method can be extended to more water impact problems for a body which can be treated as a beam it should be noticed that the obtained pressure tends to minus infinity when x 2 c 2 it has been mentioned by korobkin 2004 that the pressure is positive on the interval a t x a t where a t is the solution of the equation p a t t 0 the details of the solution of a t for each model can be found in korobkin 2004 2 2 fully coupled ale fem method the numerical modeling of this water impact problem is conducted by the explicit finite element scheme in ls dyna the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the free surface is initially at rest the finite element analysis is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation and a penalty coupling algorithm the lagrangian formulation is used to describe plane strain deformations of the wedge the multi material eulerian formulation is used to analyze the fluids including the water and the air the deformations of the beam and of the water are coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure exerted by water on the hull and the velocity of particles on the wetted surface affecting deformations of the water the continuity of surface tractions and the inter penetrability of water into the hull are satisfied by using a penalty method which was explained by aquelet et al 2006 the governing equations for the fully coupled ale fem method can be found in wang and guedes soares 2013 here they are not recalled this fsi method has been validated by comparing the numerical predictions with experimental computational and analytical results stenius et al 2006 2007 luo et al 2011 wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 2014b 2014c wang et al 2015 regarding the hydrodynamic pressure total force and deflections on wedge shape plates and simple 3d bodies stenius et al 2006 has indicated that proper selections of mesh size and contact stiffness are crucial for the numerical results for the slamming pressure on rigid wedges convergence study of mesh size and penalty factor has been conducted in luo et al 2011 which shows that the mesh size in impact domain is of most significance with respect to hydroelastic response of flexible wedges wang et al 2015 has found that a coarse mesh size may affect slightly the peak values and the calculations at the late stage and cause lots of noises on the structural response nevertheless it reduces largely the computational efforts fig 2 shows the mesh style of the numerical model and only half of the water impact is modelled the impact domain is marked with l4 l5 l6 which have the values of 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 45 m the dimensions of the total fluid domain are l1 0 3 m l2 0 7 m and l3 1 m the fluid water blue region in fig 2 and air red region in fig 2 are modelled with solid164 element which is an 8 nodes brick element and they are defined as void materials mat null which allows equations of state to be considered without computing deviatory stresses in the water domain the gruneisen equation of state is applied with a water density of 1000 kg m3 while the air domain is described as polynomial equation of state the elastic wedge is modelled with shell163 element which is a 4 nodes element and can only be used in explicit dynamic analysis the boundaries of the fluid domain are defined as non reflecting all nodes are fixed in y direction see fig 1 because of the two dimensionality for the wedge only translational movements along z direction see fig 1 are released in line with the simplified methods a constant velocity is applied for the wedge as seen in fig 2 the mesh size of the wedge and the fluids in impact domain is 2 5 mm as to the region that is far from the impact domain the mapped area mesh which contains only quadrilateral elements is employed and the mesh size in this domain is moderately expanding towards the boundaries 3 results and discussion the above described simplified and fully coupled ale fem methods are applied to study the hydroelastic water impact of a wedge shape section with different deadrise angles and entry velocities the main particulars used for the elastic wedges are listed in table 1 where v is the constant entry velocity b is the beam thickness σ s is the structural density e is young s modulus l is the length of the plate and bc means the edge boundary conditions stenius et al 2011 showed that the influences of the membrane force on the dynamic responses are significant for the simulation of the water impact problem thus the cases with and without in plane fixation are considered for the two boundary conditions at the ends of the plate as seen in fig 3 the boundary conditions ss and cc means the simply supported and clamped at the keel and chine of the wedge while ss and cc correspond to the cases without in plane fixation unless otherwise stated t 0 s means the moment that the keel of the wedge touches the water surface 3 1 hydrodynamic loading to investigate the effects of the hydrodynamic pressure on the responses of wedge plate the slamming pressures on rigid wedges are compared between the analytical models and ls dyna for the numerical models of rigid wedges only the material of the structure is replaced with mat rigid compared to the elastic ones for a rigid wedge with l 0 4 m fig 4 gives the pressure distributions on the wetted surfaces of the plates with different deadrise angle varying from 10 to 60 the results are given in non dimensional coefficients z v t and c p where the former means the position on the plate and the latter is equal to 2 p ρ v 2 for the case with β 10 º the results show very good agreement small differences are found for the peak values the peak pressure from mlm is the highest one while the value from ls dyna is the lowest one for the case with β 30 º obvious differences are observed between the predictions from gwm and the values from other methods it should be noted that mlm gwm and wagner s solutions primarily address the impact stage before the flow separates from the chine but ls dyna can describe the stage after the flow separation as seen in these figures for the wedges with small deadrise angle the peak value is placed near the spray root of the water jet as the value of β increases β 45 º and β 60 º the peak pressure moves towards the keel of the wedge for the predictions of ls dyna and classical wagner s solution but it is still located near the spray toot for the other two analytical models for all the cases the results from ls dyna agree quite well with the numerical calculations from the boundary element method of zhao and faltinsen 1993 which has been validated by the similarity solution derived by dobrovol skaya 1969 fig 5 plots the coefficient of the maximum pressure which is given as 2 p max ρ v 2 where p max is the maximum pressure it is found that ls dyna gives smaller peak values of slamming pressure for wedges with small and moderate deadrise angle compared with the analytical models on the contrary the pressure distribution from ls dyna is higher than the analytical solutions on the plate except the nearby part where the maximum value is located for all the wedges as seen in fig 4 the pile up coefficient ϕ r c c 1 see in fig 1 can also be observed in the pressure distributions the pile up coefficient is estimated from the pressure distribution profiles by hypothesizing that the jet root location corresponds to the pressure peak on the wedge facci and ubertini 2015 the findings in facci and ubertini 2015 and panciroli et al 2015 show that the pile up coefficient increases slightly with the increase of entry penetration before the wedge is completely submerged the pressure distributions from ls dyna plotted in fig 4 are the ones at the time moment when the pressures reach the peak values it means that the observed pile up coefficients are the biggest ones in time domain as seen the values estimated from ls dyna are smaller than analytical results especially for the wedge with larger deadrise angle theoretically the pile up coefficient from the analytical models is calculated from wagner condition panciroli et al 2015 which is equal to π 2 1 for a wedge fig 6 shows the pressure distributions from ls dyna on elastic and rigid wedges with β 30 º it is clearly seen that the deflections of elastic plates affect the hydrodynamic loading 3 2 comparison between the simplified method findings and ls dyna results korobkin 2004 demonstrates that the mlm can be used in practical calculations of impact loads acting on an arbitrary blunt body and the correction for non linear terms in the bernoulli equation in combination with the flat disc approximation provides a reasonable prediction in this section the simplified method which combines the euler beam theory and mlm is applied for calculations of hydroelastic deflections of elastic wedges the fully coupled ale fem algorithm in ls dyna is used to validate the analytical results 3 2 1 hydroelastic impact of simply supported wedge for the wedge with β 10 º the maximum deflection from the present simplified method are compared with the theoretical results from korobkin 2000 the beam s length is l 0 5 m and the constant impact velocity is 4 m s three values of the beam thickness b 6 m m 12 mm and 25 mm are considered the present results of the structural deflection in the middle point are compared with the predictions from the fully coupled bem fem method in lu et al 2000 for the wedges with β 30 º and β 45 º for these two cases the beam s length is l 0 4 m and the constant impact velocity is 1 m s three different beam thicknesses b 5 m m 8 mm and 11 mm are considered the fully coupled ale fem method is also used to study the structural deflections of these wedges with simply supported ends ss and ss for the simplified method the structural responses are represented by the modal superposition method here the results with 1 mode and 5 modes are compared korobkin 2004 showed that the mlm model could be formally used for any deadrise angles even if the formulae were derived under the small deadrise angle assumption to investigate the application of this model for the structural responses of the wedge with a large deadrise angle the elastic wedges with β 60 º l 0 4 m and v 1 m s are calculated with the simplified method and compared with the predictions from the fully coupled ale fem method fig 7 shows the time histories of maximum deflection of the elastic wedges with a deadrise angle of 10 the non dimensional structural deflection is represented as the ratio between the maximum deflection w and the vertical dimension of the wedge l sin β while the non dimensional time moment is expressed as the ratio between the penetration depth v t and the vertical dimension of the wedge 0 5 b tan β where b is the horizontal dimension of the full wedge compared with the theoretical results of korobkin 2000 and numerical calculations of ls dyna the maximum deflection of the beam from the simplified method is much larger for the wedge with b 6 m m while it is smaller for the wedges with b 12 m m and b 25 m m and the difference decreases as the plate thickness becomes bigger it has been concluded that for a wedge section with a small deadrise angle the water impact load is very large when the plate thickness is small for example here b 6 mm the hydroelastic effects probably are significant due to very large structural deflections the importance of hydroelasticity to the slamming problem of a wedge shape section has been estimated by using a hydroelasticity factor an important definition of it was given by faltinsen 1999 as 29 r f tan β v e i ρ l 3 this factor r f means the ratio of the loading period to the dry structural period a value of less than two indicates that the hydroelasticity may be important for the structural response the material properties given in table 1 lead to a value of 0 24 for the 10 wedge with 6 m m plate thickness which is much smaller than 2 the important hydroelastic effects affect the loading on the wedge which in turn affects the structural deflections for a wedge with b 12 m m the hydroelasticity factor is 0 68 and it is 2 1for b 25 m m as plotted in fig 7 c the trend of the present structural maximum deflection is in good agreement with the theoretical result before the peak value occurs though some differences of the peak values are observed the differences are probably due to the discrepancies of the predicted slamming loads on the wedge it can be seen that the results from the model with 1 and 5 modes are very close for all the three cases it shows that the first mode is dominant for the structural responses for the numerical results from ls dyna it is found that the maximum deflections from the model without in plane fixation are significantly larger than the ones from the model with in plane fixation for the cases with b 6 m m and b 12 m m to investigate the effects of higher modes on the structural responses 5 different numbers of modes for the 10 wedge are applied for which the modes are from n 1 to n 20 comparisons are made in the region of maximum values as plotted in fig 8 it is clear that the first 5 modes are accurate enough to represent the deflection of the wedge beam the difference between the 1mode and 5 modes solutions is only around 0 2 it is considered that the first mode dominates the structural deflection of the wedge the simplified method with n 1 and n 5 are used in the following calculations it should be noticed that although the vertical deformation on the beam is governed by the first eigenmode other responses may get significant contributions from higher modes fig 9 shows the structural deflections at the middle point of the wedge with a deadrise angle of 30 together with the fully coupled results from lu et al 2000 which are only shown at the initial and middle stage of the impact during these stages it is seen that the calculations from the simplified method are slightly larger than the numerical results from ls dyna at the early stage while they are smaller at the middle stage and larger at the later stage compared with the coupled bem fem method the present two methods give higher predictions for the deflections of the wedges during the impact stage before the fluid separates from the bottom the differences are mainly due to the hydroelastic effects and the loading on the structure for the ls dyna model with and without in plane fixation the difference is only observed in the case with plate thickness of b 5 m m at the middle and later stage of the impact the results for the wedges with β 45 º are compared in fig 10 the simplified results are also larger than the results of lu et al 2000 and the simulation predicted values and the differences become larger than the 30 w edge for the thinnest wedge the hydroelasticity factor is 5 7 which suggests that the hydroelastic effect is not important from the analysis of korobkin 2004 it can be seen that the maximum non dimensional pressure on the rigid wedges predicted by mlm is higher than other models and the difference is larger for a bigger deadrise angle here it is believed that the overestimation of the structural deflection of the simplified method is mainly due to the loading on the structure it is also found that the differences between the ls dyna models with and without in plane fixation are very small for the prediction of the hydrodynamic pressure distribution and the force on a rigid body one advantage of the mlm method is the application to the wedge with a deadrise angle up to 60 as stated in korobkin 2004 the structural deflections at the middle point of the elastic wedge with β 60 º are calculated by the simplified method as well and compared with the numerical results from ls dyna as plotted in fig 11 as seen the simplified method gives larger results than the fully coupled ale fem method and the differences are bigger than the cases with β 30 º and β 45 º as seen in figs 8 11 the simplified solution with 1 mode gives very similar results of the structural deflections to the solution with 5 modes for the numerical results of ls dyna it is also found that the effect of the in plane fixation of the model decreases as the increase of the deadrise angle and the plate thickness 3 2 2 hydroelastic impact of clamped clamped wedge for a plate component of a ship hull the longitudinal and transverse stiffeners are supported and connected to each other the edge boundary conditions of a bottom plate are not just simply supported the hydroelastic impacts of clamped clamped wedges are studied by using the simplified method with 5 modes and the estimated structural deflections at the middle point are compared with the calculations from the fully coupled ale fem method the effects of in plane fixation on the numerical predictions are also investigated the results for the wedge with a deadrise angle of 30 and v 1 m s are presented in fig 12 it is shown that the calculations from the simplified method agree quite well with the numerical predictions at the early stage the maximum deflections from ls dyna occur about 0 05s later and the values are higher than the ones from the simplified method for the wedges with clamped clamped ends the deflections due to water impact decrease to 20 of the cases with simply supported ends it is also found that the effects of the in plane fixation become even smaller the observed differences at the later stage between the numerical models with and without in plane fixation are mainly due to the relatively large global deformation of the wedge figs 13 and 14 plot the comparisons of the structural deflections at the middle points for the wedges with β 45 º b 8 m m and β 60 º b 8 m m at the early stage of the impact the estimations of the simplified method are higher and the peak values occur earlier than the fully coupled method compared to the wedges with β 30 º and β 45 º the differences between the simplified calculations and the numerical results are bigger for the one with β 60 º it is due to discrepancies of the water impact pressure on the wetted surface of the wedges predicted by these two methods and the neglected effects of hydroelasticity on the predictions for the simplified method it can be also found that almost the same results are obtained from the models with and without in plane fixation 3 2 3 different entry velocity in this section the comparisons of the maximum deflection of wedges with different impact velocities and edge boundary conditions are presented for the cases with β 30 º the simplified model and the numerical models with and without in plane fixation are applied four impact velocities 1 m s 3 m s 6 m s 8 m s are selected it is believed that increase of the impact velocity leads to larger hydroelasticity effects for the water impact problems the same conclusion can be drawn from eq 29 a larger value of v yields a lower result of the hydroelasticity factor r f for which a value smaller than 2 means the hydroelastic effect matters table 2 lists the hydroelasticity factors for the simply supported wedges with a deadrise angle of 30 and various plate thicknesses for the thinnest plate the value is larger than 2 only when the impact velocity is 1 m s when the plate thickness is 8 m m and 11 m m the hydroelasticity is considered not important for the cases with v 1 m s and v 3 m s for the simplified method the slamming loading on the flexible structure is treated as the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid body with the same geometry if the hydroelastic effects are small the water impact problem of a wedge can be analyzed based on the present simplified method with very low computational expense on the other hand when the hydroelastic effects are significant other advanced analyses are necessary for the correction of the results fig 15 plots the maximum deflections at the middle point of the wedges with different impact velocities including the cases with simply supported and clamped clamped boundary conditions as seen in fig 15 a c and e the values in three curves are almost the same when the impact velocity is 1 m s and the values for the plates with b 8 m m and b 11 m m are very close when the impact velocity is 1 m s and 3 m s as the impact velocity increases the differences between them become larger these observations are agreement with the results of the hydroelasticity factors listed in table 2 it means that the increasing impact velocity raises the hydroelastic effects on the results of the simplified method and also causes the effects of the in plane fixation of the numerical models for the cases with clamped clamped ends as plotted in fig 15 b d and f the maximum deflections are much smaller than the values of the simply supported cases for the thinnest plate the differences between the simplified results and the numerical predictions are very small when the impact velocity is 1 m s and 3 m s the most clearly differentiates are observed in fig 15 b for the cases with v 1 m s and v 3 m s while the results of the simplified method are slightly lower than the numerical predictions for other cases it shows that the hydroelastic effects on the structural responses due to slamming loads are also related to the boundary conditions of the structure for wedges with the same material properties but different boundary conditions the simplified method gives more accurate results for the one with clamped clamped ends as to the two numerical models the one without in plane fixation always provide larger structural responses than the other one the difference between them becomes significantly large for a thin plate with a high impact velocity as seen in fig 15 a the maximum deflection of the model with ss is about five times of the value from the model with ss for the case with v 8 m s it is also observed that the effects of the in plane fixation of the numerical model on the structural responses are in line with the rule of the hydroelastic effects fig 16 plots the fluid evolutions and deformations of the simply supported wedge with β 30 º and b 5 m m at two time moments during the impact where a and b are for the case with in plane fixation while c and d are the case without in plane fixation t 1 0 01 s means one moment at the early stage before the flow passes the knuckle and t 2 0 02 s represents one moment at the late stage it can be seen that the fluid evolutions and structural deformations are very similar for the two models at the early stage at the later stage however the wedge without in plane fixation is deformed to a curved geometry for a curved section the hydrodynamic loading on the surface is significantly different from the one on a wedge shape section this is the reason that the two models agree well at the early stage but differ a lot at the late stage for the time histories of the middle deflection as seen in fig 9 a 3 3 comparison between the simplified methods through the comparisons of deflections on elastic wedge plates it can be seen that the approximation of the simplified method linear beam theory and mlm is satisfactory for predicting structural displacement of a wedge with small and moderate deadrise angle especially for the cases at low impact velocity the main inaccuracy is due to the assumption of hydrodynamic loading of a rigid plate with the same assumption the simplified methods which combine the linear beam theory with mlm gwm or the classical wagner theory could give different predictions of the hydroelastic deflections fig 17 compares the deflection at the middle point of a wedge from the three simplified solutions the plate with a length of 0 4 m is simply supported ss at the ends it can be seen for all three deadrise angle that the deflection estimated from the simplified method with the classical wagner solution is the biggest and the one with gwm is the smallest during the impact stage as shown in fig 4 the hydrodynamic pressures on the lower part of a wedge calculated from gwm are smaller and the values predicted from the classical wagner solution are larger it can be found that the maximum pressure does not affect the time history of the structural response as known the pressure distribution derived from the three models is self similar in time for a constant velocity impact it is noted that the differences of the deflection between the three models become larger as time goes on similarly the accumulative effects of the hydrodynamic loading can also be found in fig 18 which presents the deflection distribution along the plate at the early and middle stage it can be seen that the general trend of the evolution of deflection from the three models is the same though differences exist in magnitude it is observed that the location of the maximum deflection changes with time the results show that to predict accurately the dynamic response of an elastic wedge by using the present simplified method a proper model for the hydrodynamic loading is required 4 conclusions a simplified method is used to study the dynamic responses of elastic wedges impacting with calm water at a constant velocity the estimations of the structural dynamic responses induced by the impact loads are compared with the hydroelastic results from a fully coupled ale fem numerical method for the simplified method the a modal analysis is applied to represent the structural deflection which is treated s as euler beam model and an analytical model is employed for the prediction of hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body the convergence study of the present simplified method shows that the first mode is dominant for the structural responses the model with 5 modes is applied in the work for the simply supported wedges with deadrise angles of 10 30 45 and 60 the results of maximum deflection and the time history of deflection on the middle point of a wedge with different deadrise angle and plate thickness are computed by these two methods and compared with other theoretical and numerical findings the agreements are quite satisfactory for moderate deadrise angles before the flow separates from the plate when the deadrise angle is 30 the agreement between the simplified method and the ale fem method is quite good while the results from them are slightly larger than the calculations of lu et al 2000 when the deadrise angle is 45 or 60 the results of the simplified method are higher than the calculations of the other two methods the differences between the results of present simplified method and other method s findings are mainly due to the assumption of hydrodynamic loadings on a rigid body combining the comparison of pressure distribution on rigid wedges it was found that the structural deflection is not affected by the maximum pressure different impact velocities and edge boundary conditions were also applied in the calculation of the maximum structural deflections on a wedge with three plate thicknesses the results showed that as the plate thickness increased or the impact velocity decreased the hydroelastic effect reduced enormously thus a good agreement between the simplified method and the fully coupled ale fem method was achieved for the fully coupled ale fem solver it could be found that the in plane fixation affected the deflection of a wedge with a small dearies angle a thin plate thickness and a high impact velocity the computational efficiency is improved by using the simplified method and the result is satisfying for thick plate with a low impact velocity calculations have been implemented in one pc with 2 4 ghz processor and 8 gigabytes of memory to obtain the structural responses of wedge subjected to slamming loads the computational time is reduced to about 5 min by using the simplified method instead of about 24 h by the ale fem simulation for the wedge with β 30 as an example to investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic loading on the hydroelastic deflection different models for a rigid wedge are used in the present simplified method it is observed that the location of the maximum deflection changes with time to predict accurately the dynamic response of an elastic wedge induced by the water impact loads using the present simplified method a proper model for the hydrodynamic loading is required summarily results show that the present simplified method gives satisfactory prediction of the deflection on an elastic wedge when the hydroelastic effect is not significant this method can be easily derived and solved and with proper model for the hydrodynamic loading on a rigid wedge it could be applicable for a wedge with arbitrary deadrise angle and a falling velocity different edge boundary conditions of a wedge can be analyzed as well the structural deflection is represented by a euler beam model so this solution is only applicable to a body which can be treated as a beam model the fully coupled numerical method can be used for hydroelastic water impact problems of an arbitrary geometry body though high computation effort is required moreover the boundary condition at the ends of plate affects the structural responses significantly so it should be noted in the fe modeling acknowledgements this work was performed within the strategic research plan of the center for marine technology and ocean engineering

23624,a simplified method is proposed to model the water impact of an elastic wedge by combining a modal analysis for the structural deflection and an analytical model for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body the structural deflections are expressed by wet modes shapes of the beam and are calculated using modal superposition and duhamel integral method the results from the simplified approach are compared with the calculations by using a fully coupled numerical method the fully coupled simulation is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian formulation included in the commercial software ls dyna the lagrangian formulation is used to describe plane strain deformations of the structure and the eulerian formulation is applied to analyze the changes of the fluid the structural deflections of wedges with different deadrise angles from the simplified method are compared with published results of theoretical method and fully coupled bem fem method showing a very significant reduction of required computation time the convergence of the modal shapes is also investigated the deflections of flexible wedges with various deadrise angles impact velocities and edge boundary conditions are computed and discussed keywords water impact hydroelastic effects modified logvinovich model mlm modal superposition duhamel integral 1 introduction the hydrodynamic impact between marine structures and waves may induce impulsive pressure loads which consequently affects the ship structure both locally and globally due to the large magnitude and short duration the generated impulsive forces may lead to considerable vibrations and local structural damages and thus the accurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hulls and the associated responses are crucial in the design of marine structures the initial approaches to estimate the slamming loads and the associated responses of ship structure treated separately the two time scales involved in this problem the relative motion between the ship and the waves was determined by time simulations based on linear or non linear ship motion theories i e belik et al 1983 guedes soares 1989 rajendran et al 2015 when the location of the water impact and the relative velocity were predicted the slam induced loads on ship sections can be estimated by analytical models i e wagner 1932 howison et al 1991 mei et al 1999

wang and guedes soares 2013 2014a wagner 1932 has developed the theory of impact which is based on a flat disc approximation and potential flow theory for ideal and incompressible liquid within this approximation the wetted part of the entering body is substituted with a flat disc and the bernoulli equation is linearized and the boundary conditions are imposed on the initial position of the liquid boundary the higher order terms in bernoulli equation were taken into account within the generalized wagner model and the longinovich model see korobkin 2004 in order to improve the predictions of the classical wagner theory korobkin 2004 suggested that the modified longinovich model should be used in more general cases the review work of abrate 2013 presented the basic principles and analytical solutions of the water entry problems including the discussions on the trapped air below a flat body wang and guedes soares 2013 2014a have presented the study of the slamming loads on two dimensional and three dimensional rigid bodies by using the fully coupled ale fem method their results agree well with the experimental studies of aarsnes 1996 and de backer et al 2009 similarly a two dimensional sph algorithm has been developed and applied to the problem of ship keel and bow flare slamming in veen and gourlay 2012 which has shown reasonable agreement with measured values in hermundstad and moan 2005 on the slamming pressures facci et al 2015 have implemented a direct computational framework to study the two dimensional flow physics generated during the water entry of a rigid wedge their work show that piv based methodology allows for an accurate reconstruction of the pressure field from the measured velocity field except for early stages of the impact and for a small region close to the free surface as mentioned above these initial studies on the local slamming loads were conducted without considering the effects of elastic responses of the structure in ship hydrodynamics the impact velocities are of the order of several meters per second if the plate thickness is relatively small then hydroelasticity is a problem even for bodies with moderate deadrise angle lu et al 2000 faltinsen 1997 chen et al 2006 this hydroelastic problem is still a challenging subject due to the extremely complex flow field on the structural surface during the impact local hydroelastic slamming has been studied theoretical and experimentally for slamming problems on by faltinsen 1997 1999 2000 their studies show that the effects of hydroelasticity are based on the relationship of the material and geometric properties of the structure the impact velocity and the relative angle between the water and the structure surface lu et al 2000 have demonstrated a fully coupled analysis of the elastic wedges impacting with water the fluid flow is solved by the boundary element method bem together with the fully nonlinear free surface condition the structural response is analyzed based on linear elastic theory using the finite element method fem korobkin 1998 and khabakhpasheva 2006 have analyzed the wave impact on a simply supported elastic plate by combining the classical wagner 1932 theory and euler bernoulli beam theory wagner theory is utilized to predict the hydrodynamic loading by linearizing the boundary conditions for the potential flow on the initial water surface and accounting for the structural deformations korobkin et al 2006 and khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 have developed a similar method that coupled the beam finite element model with wagner theory of water impact because of the flat disk approximation of wagner s theory this method is only applicable to any elastic body with small deadrise angle entering water vertically at moderate velocity to study the water impact of sandwich composite hulls wagner theory in combination with a high order structural model has been considered by qin and batra 2009 wang et al 2015 have analyzed the hydroelastic responses of a horizontal plate impacting with the water by extending the method proposed by faltinsen 1997 to address forward speeds and compressions on the plate besides some researchers have proposed simplified solutions based on decoupling the structural deformation from the fluid flow by computing the hydrodynamic loading with the assumption of rigid structures i e luo et al 2012 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 luo et al 2012 have studied the slamming load and response of one complex 3d steel wedge with stiffened panels on both sides one uncoupled solution combining wagner theory and a fem code was presented to predict the stress responses of elastic structures by transient analysis the predicted results agree well with the measured data from free drop tests though the effect of elastic response on hydrodynamic pressure is not considered in the simplified solution shams and porfiri 2015 have extended the methodology proposed by khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 to address arbitrary boundary conditions and free fall impacts panciroli and porfiri 2014 have studied experimentally the hydroelastic impact of an active flexible wedge on an otherwise quiescent fluid and the measured results are interpreted through a distributed model based on linear plate theory and wagner s approximate solution for the hydrodynamic load recently computational solutions have been widely used in hydroelastic slamming problems maki et al 2011 have studied the impact of an elastic wedge onto the free surface by using a loosely coupled method which combines cfd and fem tools in a one way manner the cfd is used to assess the loading on a rigid body and the pressure and stress field is projected onto a structural model modal analysis is used to represent the wet structure their results agreed well with the calculations of lu et al 2000 a fully coupled simulation of an elastic wedge entering into water has been studied by stenius et al 2007 using an explicit finite element method hydroelastic effects on the structural response are systematically studied for different impact velocities boundary conditions and structural mass their further studies have been presented in stenius et al 2011 which includes the calculations from a simplified in house developed method the fundamental mechanisms involved in panel water impact related hydroelastic problems have been extensively investigated however comparisons between the method and other theoretical or numerical tools are not found similarly panciroli et al 2012 have developed a coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics finite element method to study water entry of flexible wedges wang and guedes soares 2014b have conducted the numerical study on the hydroelastic impact of a flexible wedge by using ls dyna and the results are in good agreement with lu et al 2000 in this work a simplified method is proposed to study the hydroelastic water entry of a wedge at a constant velocity and the results are validated against a fully coupled simulation method the simplified method is based on the assumption that the structural deformation doesn t affect the loading on the wetted surface of the structure analytical models derived from velocity potential are used for prediction of the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body and the structural responses under the impulse load are calculated by a modal analysis the present simplified method is validated through the comparison of structural deflection with the results from the fully coupled numerical method which is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation implemented in ls dyna different deadrise angles beam thicknesses edge boundary condition and impact velocities of the elastic wedge are considered their effects on the hydroelastic deflection of a plate are discussed results show that the present simplified method gives satisfactory prediction of the deflection on an elastic wedge when the hydroelastic effect is not significant this method can be easily derived and solved and with proper model for the hydrodynamic loading on a rigid wedge it could be applicable for a wedge with arbitrary deadrise angle and falling velocity the fully coupled numerical method can be used for hydroelastic water impact problems of an arbitrary geometry body though high computation effort is required 2 methodology 2 1 simplified method the symmetric water impact of a wedge with length l and deadrise angle β is illustrated in fig 1 the coordinate system x z is used for the calculation of hydrodynamic pressure on the wetted surface with the origin at the intersection between the initially calm water surface and the symmetric line the wedge enters into the water at a velocity d h d t and the half wetted length on the structural bottom is denoted as c t to represent the structural deflection of a beam a local coordinate system x z is introduced with the origin at the intersection between the keel and the center plane of the intact beam the theoretical model of the vibration of the wedge plate due to impact pressure is represented by using euler beam theory for strips of the plates assuming that the boundary conditions and loading are invariant along the width of a plate assuming that the rotary inertia is small the governing equation of motion for a beam is given by 1 e i x 4 w x 4 m x 2 w t 2 p x w t where ei is the sectional bending stiffness m is the structural mass per unit area p is the hydrodynamic pressure as a function of the beam s deflection and the position on the beam w is the deflection of the beam in z direction t is the time variable and x is a longitudinal coordinate with x l 2 in the middle of the beam the solution is written in terms of dry normal modes ψ n 2 w x t n 1 a n t ψ n x where a n for n 1 2 3 are the principle coordinates and ψ n for n 1 2 3 are eigenfunctions which are found by setting p x w t 0 in eq 1 a solution of the free vibration can be expressed as exp iω n t ψ n with ω n as the dry natural frequencies associated with the eigenmodes ψ n and eq 1 can be rewritten as 3 d 4 ψ n d x 4 m x ω n 2 e i x ψ n 0 defining p n 4 m x ω n 2 e i x where m x and i x are constant for the beam the general solution of eq 3 is written as 4 ψ n a n sin p n x b n cos p n x c n sinh p n x d n cosh p n x where p n is the positive and real root introducing the boundary conditions of the beam at x 0 and x l where l is the length of the beam the eigen functions can be obtained and the associated dry natural frequencies and eigen modes are obtained by substituting eq 2 into the forced vibration equation eq 1 5 e i n 1 d 4 ψ n x d x 4 a n t m n 1 ψ n x d 2 a n t t 2 p x w t combining with eq 3 eq 5 can be written as 6 n 1 ω n 2 ψ n x a n t n 1 ψ n x

classical wagner theory the higher order terms in the bernoulli equation were taken into account within the logvinovich model the velocity potential takes the form 15 ϕ x t φ w x 0 t h t f x h t d t

on the flexible beam does not vary with its deflection and introducing the hydrodynamic pressure see eq 26 28 into eq 9 the beam s deflection during the water impact can be calculated if a free falling velocity is taken into account the derivatives of entry penetration and wetted length should be introduced in eq 24 consider a different model for the hydrodynamic loading in eq 9 this simplified method can be extended to more water impact problems for a body which can be treated as a beam it should be noticed that the obtained pressure tends to minus infinity when x 2 c 2 it has been mentioned by korobkin 2004 that the pressure is positive on the interval a t x a t where a t is the solution of the equation p a t t 0 the details of the solution of a t for each model can be found in korobkin 2004 2 2 fully coupled ale fem method the numerical modeling of this water impact problem is conducted by the explicit finite element scheme in ls dyna the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the free surface is initially at rest the finite element analysis is based on an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation and a penalty coupling algorithm the lagrangian formulation is used to describe plane strain deformations of the wedge the multi material eulerian formulation is used to analyze the fluids including the water and the air the deformations of the beam and of the water are coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure exerted by water on the hull and the velocity of particles on the wetted surface affecting deformations of the water the continuity of surface tractions and the inter penetrability of water into the hull are satisfied by using a penalty method which was explained by aquelet et al 2006 the governing equations for the fully coupled ale fem method can be found in wang and guedes soares 2013 here they are not recalled this fsi method has been validated by comparing the numerical predictions with experimental computational and analytical results stenius et al 2006 2007 luo et al 2011 wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 2014b 2014c wang et al 2015 regarding the hydrodynamic pressure total force and deflections on wedge shape plates and simple 3d bodies stenius et al 2006 has indicated that proper selections of mesh size and contact stiffness are crucial for the numerical results for the slamming pressure on rigid wedges convergence study of mesh size and penalty factor has been conducted in luo et al 2011 which shows that the mesh size in impact domain is of most significance with respect to hydroelastic response of flexible wedges wang et al 2015 has found that a coarse mesh size may affect slightly the peak values and the calculations at the late stage and cause lots of noises on the structural response nevertheless it reduces largely the computational efforts fig 2 shows the mesh style of the numerical model and only half of the water impact is modelled the impact domain is marked with l4 l5 l6 which have the values of 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 45 m the dimensions of the total fluid domain are l1 0 3 m l2 0 7 m and l3 1 m the fluid water blue region in fig 2 and air red region in fig 2 are modelled with solid164 element which is an 8 nodes brick element and they are defined as void materials mat null which allows equations of state to be considered without computing deviatory stresses in the water domain the gruneisen equation of state is applied with a water density of 1000 kg m3 while the air domain is described as polynomial equation of state the elastic wedge is modelled with shell163 element which is a 4 nodes element and can only be used in explicit dynamic analysis the boundaries of the fluid domain are defined as non reflecting all nodes are fixed in y direction see fig 1 because of the two dimensionality for the wedge only translational movements along z direction see fig 1 are released in line with the simplified methods a constant velocity is applied for the wedge as seen in fig 2 the mesh size of the wedge and the fluids in impact domain is 2 5 mm as to the region that is far from the impact domain the mapped area mesh which contains only quadrilateral elements is employed and the mesh size in this domain is moderately expanding towards the boundaries 3 results and discussion the above described simplified and fully coupled ale fem methods are applied to study the hydroelastic water impact of a wedge shape section with different deadrise angles and entry velocities the main particulars used for the elastic wedges are listed in table 1 where v is the constant entry velocity b is the beam thickness σ s is the structural density e is young s modulus l is the length of the plate and bc means the edge boundary conditions stenius et al 2011 showed that the influences of the membrane force on the dynamic responses are significant for the simulation of the water impact problem thus the cases with and without in plane fixation are considered for the two boundary conditions at the ends of the plate as seen in fig 3 the boundary conditions ss and cc means the simply supported and clamped at the keel and chine of the wedge while ss and cc correspond to the cases without in plane fixation unless otherwise stated t 0 s means the moment that the keel of the wedge touches the water surface 3 1 hydrodynamic loading to investigate the effects of the hydrodynamic pressure on the responses of wedge plate the slamming pressures on rigid wedges are compared between the analytical models and ls dyna for the numerical models of rigid wedges only the material of the structure is replaced with mat rigid compared to the elastic ones for a rigid wedge with l 0 4 m fig 4 gives the pressure distributions on the wetted surfaces of the plates with different deadrise angle varying from 10 to 60 the results are given in non dimensional coefficients z v t and c p where the former means the position on the plate and the latter is equal to 2 p ρ v 2 for the case with β 10 º the results show very good agreement small differences are found for the peak values the peak pressure from mlm is the highest one while the value from ls dyna is the lowest one for the case with β 30 º obvious differences are observed between the predictions from gwm and the values from other methods it should be noted that mlm gwm and wagner s solutions primarily address the impact stage before the flow separates from the chine but ls dyna can describe the stage after the flow separation as seen in these figures for the wedges with small deadrise angle the peak value is placed near the spray root of the water jet as the value of β increases β 45 º and β 60 º the peak pressure moves towards the keel of the wedge for the predictions of ls dyna and classical wagner s solution but it is still located near the spray toot for the other two analytical models for all the cases the results from ls dyna agree quite well with the numerical calculations from the boundary element method of zhao and faltinsen 1993 which has been validated by the similarity solution derived by dobrovol skaya 1969 fig 5 plots the coefficient of the maximum pressure which is given as 2 p max ρ v 2 where p max is the maximum pressure it is found that ls dyna gives smaller peak values of slamming pressure for wedges with small and moderate deadrise angle compared with the analytical models on the contrary the pressure distribution from ls dyna is higher than the analytical solutions on the plate except the nearby part where the maximum value is located for all the wedges as seen in fig 4 the pile up coefficient ϕ r c c 1 see in fig 1 can also be observed in the pressure distributions the pile up coefficient is estimated from the pressure distribution profiles by hypothesizing that the jet root location corresponds to the pressure peak on the wedge facci and ubertini 2015 the findings in facci and ubertini 2015 and panciroli et al 2015 show that the pile up coefficient increases slightly with the increase of entry penetration before the wedge is completely submerged the pressure distributions from ls dyna plotted in fig 4 are the ones at the time moment when the pressures reach the peak values it means that the observed pile up coefficients are the biggest ones in time domain as seen the values estimated from ls dyna are smaller than analytical results especially for the wedge with larger deadrise angle theoretically the pile up coefficient from the analytical models is calculated from wagner condition panciroli et al 2015 which is equal to π 2 1 for a wedge fig 6 shows the pressure distributions from ls dyna on elastic and rigid wedges with β 30 º it is clearly seen that the deflections of elastic plates affect the hydrodynamic loading 3 2 comparison between the simplified method findings and ls dyna results korobkin 2004 demonstrates that the mlm can be used in practical calculations of impact loads acting on an arbitrary blunt body and the correction for non linear terms in the bernoulli equation in combination with the flat disc approximation provides a reasonable prediction in this section the simplified method which combines the euler beam theory and mlm is applied for calculations of hydroelastic deflections of elastic wedges the fully coupled ale fem algorithm in ls dyna is used to validate the analytical results 3 2 1 hydroelastic impact of simply supported wedge for the wedge with β 10 º the maximum deflection from the present simplified method are compared with the theoretical results from korobkin 2000 the beam s length is l 0 5 m and the constant impact velocity is 4 m s three values of the beam thickness b 6 m m 12 mm and 25 mm are considered the present results of the structural deflection in the middle point are compared with the predictions from the fully coupled bem fem method in lu et al 2000 for the wedges with β 30 º and β 45 º for these two cases the beam s length is l 0 4 m and the constant impact velocity is 1 m s three different beam thicknesses b 5 m m 8 mm and 11 mm are considered the fully coupled ale fem method is also used to study the structural deflections of these wedges with simply supported ends ss and ss for the simplified method the structural responses are represented by the modal superposition method here the results with 1 mode and 5 modes are compared korobkin 2004 showed that the mlm model could be formally used for any deadrise angles even if the formulae were derived under the small deadrise angle assumption to investigate the application of this model for the structural responses of the wedge with a large deadrise angle the elastic wedges with β 60 º l 0 4 m and v 1 m s are calculated with the simplified method and compared with the predictions from the fully coupled ale fem method fig 7 shows the time histories of maximum deflection of the elastic wedges with a deadrise angle of 10 the non dimensional structural deflection is represented as the ratio between the maximum deflection w and the vertical dimension of the wedge l sin β while the non dimensional time moment is expressed as the ratio between the penetration depth v t and the vertical dimension of the wedge 0 5 b tan β where b is the horizontal dimension of the full wedge compared with the theoretical results of korobkin 2000 and numerical calculations of ls dyna the maximum deflection of the beam from the simplified method is much larger for the wedge with b 6 m m while it is smaller for the wedges with b 12 m m and b 25 m m and the difference decreases as the plate thickness becomes bigger it has been concluded that for a wedge section with a small deadrise angle the water impact load is very large when the plate thickness is small for example here b 6 mm the hydroelastic effects probably are significant due to very large structural deflections the importance of hydroelasticity to the slamming problem of a wedge shape section has been estimated by using a hydroelasticity factor an important definition of it was given by faltinsen 1999 as 29 r f tan β v e i ρ l 3 this factor r f means the ratio of the loading period to the dry structural period a value of less than two indicates that the hydroelasticity may be important for the structural response the material properties given in table 1 lead to a value of 0 24 for the 10 wedge with 6 m m plate thickness which is much smaller than 2 the important hydroelastic effects affect the loading on the wedge which in turn affects the structural deflections for a wedge with b 12 m m the hydroelasticity factor is 0 68 and it is 2 1for b 25 m m as plotted in fig 7 c the trend of the present structural maximum deflection is in good agreement with the theoretical result before the peak value occurs though some differences of the peak values are observed the differences are probably due to the discrepancies of the predicted slamming loads on the wedge it can be seen that the results from the model with 1 and 5 modes are very close for all the three cases it shows that the first mode is dominant for the structural responses for the numerical results from ls dyna it is found that the maximum deflections from the model without in plane fixation are significantly larger than the ones from the model with in plane fixation for the cases with b 6 m m and b 12 m m to investigate the effects of higher modes on the structural responses 5 different numbers of modes for the 10 wedge are applied for which the modes are from n 1 to n 20 comparisons are made in the region of maximum values as plotted in fig 8 it is clear that the first 5 modes are accurate enough to represent the deflection of the wedge beam the difference between the 1mode and 5 modes solutions is only around 0 2 it is considered that the first mode dominates the structural deflection of the wedge the simplified method with n 1 and n 5 are used in the following calculations it should be noticed that although the vertical deformation on the beam is governed by the first eigenmode other responses may get significant contributions from higher modes fig 9 shows the structural deflections at the middle point of the wedge with a deadrise angle of 30 together with the fully coupled results from lu et al 2000 which are only shown at the initial and middle stage of the impact during these stages it is seen that the calculations from the simplified method are slightly larger than the numerical results from ls dyna at the early stage while they are smaller at the middle stage and larger at the later stage compared with the coupled bem fem method the present two methods give higher predictions for the deflections of the wedges during the impact stage before the fluid separates from the bottom the differences are mainly due to the hydroelastic effects and the loading on the structure for the ls dyna model with and without in plane fixation the difference is only observed in the case with plate thickness of b 5 m m at the middle and later stage of the impact the results for the wedges with β 45 º are compared in fig 10 the simplified results are also larger than the results of lu et al 2000 and the simulation predicted values and the differences become larger than the 30 w edge for the thinnest wedge the hydroelasticity factor is 5 7 which suggests that the hydroelastic effect is not important from the analysis of korobkin 2004 it can be seen that the maximum non dimensional pressure on the rigid wedges predicted by mlm is higher than other models and the difference is larger for a bigger deadrise angle here it is believed that the overestimation of the structural deflection of the simplified method is mainly due to the loading on the structure it is also found that the differences between the ls dyna models with and without in plane fixation are very small for the prediction of the hydrodynamic pressure distribution and the force on a rigid body one advantage of the mlm method is the application to the wedge with a deadrise angle up to 60 as stated in korobkin 2004 the structural deflections at the middle point of the elastic wedge with β 60 º are calculated by the simplified method as well and compared with the numerical results from ls dyna as plotted in fig 11 as seen the simplified method gives larger results than the fully coupled ale fem method and the differences are bigger than the cases with β 30 º and β 45 º as seen in figs 8 11 the simplified solution with 1 mode gives very similar results of the structural deflections to the solution with 5 modes for the numerical results of ls dyna it is also found that the effect of the in plane fixation of the model decreases as the increase of the deadrise angle and the plate thickness 3 2 2 hydroelastic impact of clamped clamped wedge for a plate component of a ship hull the longitudinal and transverse stiffeners are supported and connected to each other the edge boundary conditions of a bottom plate are not just simply supported the hydroelastic impacts of clamped clamped wedges are studied by using the simplified method with 5 modes and the estimated structural deflections at the middle point are compared with the calculations from the fully coupled ale fem method the effects of in plane fixation on the numerical predictions are also investigated the results for the wedge with a deadrise angle of 30 and v 1 m s are presented in fig 12 it is shown that the calculations from the simplified method agree quite well with the numerical predictions at the early stage the maximum deflections from ls dyna occur about 0 05s later and the values are higher than the ones from the simplified method for the wedges with clamped clamped ends the deflections due to water impact decrease to 20 of the cases with simply supported ends it is also found that the effects of the in plane fixation become even smaller the observed differences at the later stage between the numerical models with and without in plane fixation are mainly due to the relatively large global deformation of the wedge figs 13 and 14 plot the comparisons of the structural deflections at the middle points for the wedges with β 45 º b 8 m m and β 60 º b 8 m m at the early stage of the impact the estimations of the simplified method are higher and the peak values occur earlier than the fully coupled method compared to the wedges with β 30 º and β 45 º the differences between the simplified calculations and the numerical results are bigger for the one with β 60 º it is due to discrepancies of the water impact pressure on the wetted surface of the wedges predicted by these two methods and the neglected effects of hydroelasticity on the predictions for the simplified method it can be also found that almost the same results are obtained from the models with and without in plane fixation 3 2 3 different entry velocity in this section the comparisons of the maximum deflection of wedges with different impact velocities and edge boundary conditions are presented for the cases with β 30 º the simplified model and the numerical models with and without in plane fixation are applied four impact velocities 1 m s 3 m s 6 m s 8 m s are selected it is believed that increase of the impact velocity leads to larger hydroelasticity effects for the water impact problems the same conclusion can be drawn from eq 29 a larger value of v yields a lower result of the hydroelasticity factor r f for which a value smaller than 2 means the hydroelastic effect matters table 2 lists the hydroelasticity factors for the simply supported wedges with a deadrise angle of 30 and various plate thicknesses for the thinnest plate the value is larger than 2 only when the impact velocity is 1 m s when the plate thickness is 8 m m and 11 m m the hydroelasticity is considered not important for the cases with v 1 m s and v 3 m s for the simplified method the slamming loading on the flexible structure is treated as the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid body with the same geometry if the hydroelastic effects are small the water impact problem of a wedge can be analyzed based on the present simplified method with very low computational expense on the other hand when the hydroelastic effects are significant other advanced analyses are necessary for the correction of the results fig 15 plots the maximum deflections at the middle point of the wedges with different impact velocities including the cases with simply supported and clamped clamped boundary conditions as seen in fig 15 a c and e the values in three curves are almost the same when the impact velocity is 1 m s and the values for the plates with b 8 m m and b 11 m m are very close when the impact velocity is 1 m s and 3 m s as the impact velocity increases the differences between them become larger these observations are agreement with the results of the hydroelasticity factors listed in table 2 it means that the increasing impact velocity raises the hydroelastic effects on the results of the simplified method and also causes the effects of the in plane fixation of the numerical models for the cases with clamped clamped ends as plotted in fig 15 b d and f the maximum deflections are much smaller than the values of the simply supported cases for the thinnest plate the differences between the simplified results and the numerical predictions are very small when the impact velocity is 1 m s and 3 m s the most clearly differentiates are observed in fig 15 b for the cases with v 1 m s and v 3 m s while the results of the simplified method are slightly lower than the numerical predictions for other cases it shows that the hydroelastic effects on the structural responses due to slamming loads are also related to the boundary conditions of the structure for wedges with the same material properties but different boundary conditions the simplified method gives more accurate results for the one with clamped clamped ends as to the two numerical models the one without in plane fixation always provide larger structural responses than the other one the difference between them becomes significantly large for a thin plate with a high impact velocity as seen in fig 15 a the maximum deflection of the model with ss is about five times of the value from the model with ss for the case with v 8 m s it is also observed that the effects of the in plane fixation of the numerical model on the structural responses are in line with the rule of the hydroelastic effects fig 16 plots the fluid evolutions and deformations of the simply supported wedge with β 30 º and b 5 m m at two time moments during the impact where a and b are for the case with in plane fixation while c and d are the case without in plane fixation t 1 0 01 s means one moment at the early stage before the flow passes the knuckle and t 2 0 02 s represents one moment at the late stage it can be seen that the fluid evolutions and structural deformations are very similar for the two models at the early stage at the later stage however the wedge without in plane fixation is deformed to a curved geometry for a curved section the hydrodynamic loading on the surface is significantly different from the one on a wedge shape section this is the reason that the two models agree well at the early stage but differ a lot at the late stage for the time histories of the middle deflection as seen in fig 9 a 3 3 comparison between the simplified methods through the comparisons of deflections on elastic wedge plates it can be seen that the approximation of the simplified method linear beam theory and mlm is satisfactory for predicting structural displacement of a wedge with small and moderate deadrise angle especially for the cases at low impact velocity the main inaccuracy is due to the assumption of hydrodynamic loading of a rigid plate with the same assumption the simplified methods which combine the linear beam theory with mlm gwm or the classical wagner theory could give different predictions of the hydroelastic deflections fig 17 compares the deflection at the middle point of a wedge from the three simplified solutions the plate with a length of 0 4 m is simply supported ss at the ends it can be seen for all three deadrise angle that the deflection estimated from the simplified method with the classical wagner solution is the biggest and the one with gwm is the smallest during the impact stage as shown in fig 4 the hydrodynamic pressures on the lower part of a wedge calculated from gwm are smaller and the values predicted from the classical wagner solution are larger it can be found that the maximum pressure does not affect the time history of the structural response as known the pressure distribution derived from the three models is self similar in time for a constant velocity impact it is noted that the differences of the deflection between the three models become larger as time goes on similarly the accumulative effects of the hydrodynamic loading can also be found in fig 18 which presents the deflection distribution along the plate at the early and middle stage it can be seen that the general trend of the evolution of deflection from the three models is the same though differences exist in magnitude it is observed that the location of the maximum deflection changes with time the results show that to predict accurately the dynamic response of an elastic wedge by using the present simplified method a proper model for the hydrodynamic loading is required 4 conclusions a simplified method is used to study the dynamic responses of elastic wedges impacting with calm water at a constant velocity the estimations of the structural dynamic responses induced by the impact loads are compared with the hydroelastic results from a fully coupled ale fem numerical method for the simplified method the a modal analysis is applied to represent the structural deflection which is treated s as euler beam model and an analytical model is employed for the prediction of hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid body the convergence study of the present simplified method shows that the first mode is dominant for the structural responses the model with 5 modes is applied in the work for the simply supported wedges with deadrise angles of 10 30 45 and 60 the results of maximum deflection and the time history of deflection on the middle point of a wedge with different deadrise angle and plate thickness are computed by these two methods and compared with other theoretical and numerical findings the agreements are quite satisfactory for moderate deadrise angles before the flow separates from the plate when the deadrise angle is 30 the agreement between the simplified method and the ale fem method is quite good while the results from them are slightly larger than the calculations of lu et al 2000 when the deadrise angle is 45 or 60 the results of the simplified method are higher than the calculations of the other two methods the differences between the results of present simplified method and other method s findings are mainly due to the assumption of hydrodynamic loadings on a rigid body combining the comparison of pressure distribution on rigid wedges it was found that the structural deflection is not affected by the maximum pressure different impact velocities and edge boundary conditions were also applied in the calculation of the maximum structural deflections on a wedge with three plate thicknesses the results showed that as the plate thickness increased or the impact velocity decreased the hydroelastic effect reduced enormously thus a good agreement between the simplified method and the fully coupled ale fem method was achieved for the fully coupled ale fem solver it could be found that the in plane fixation affected the deflection of a wedge with a small dearies angle a thin plate thickness and a high impact velocity the computational efficiency is improved by using the simplified method and the result is satisfying for thick plate with a low impact velocity calculations have been implemented in one pc with 2 4 ghz processor and 8 gigabytes of memory to obtain the structural responses of wedge subjected to slamming loads the computational time is reduced to about 5 min by using the simplified method instead of about 24 h by the ale fem simulation for the wedge with β 30 as an example to investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic loading on the hydroelastic deflection different models for a rigid wedge are used in the present simplified method it is observed that the location of the maximum deflection changes with time to predict accurately the dynamic response of an elastic wedge induced by the water impact loads using the present simplified method a proper model for the hydrodynamic loading is required summarily results show that the present simplified method gives satisfactory prediction of the deflection on an elastic wedge when the hydroelastic effect is not significant this method can be easily derived and solved and with proper model for the hydrodynamic loading on a rigid wedge it could be applicable for a wedge with arbitrary deadrise angle and a falling velocity different edge boundary conditions of a wedge can be analyzed as well the structural deflection is represented by a euler beam model so this solution is only applicable to a body which can be treated as a beam model the fully coupled numerical method can be used for hydroelastic water impact problems of an arbitrary geometry body though high computation effort is required moreover the boundary condition at the ends of plate affects the structural responses significantly so it should be noted in the fe modeling acknowledgements this work was performed within the strategic research plan of the center for marine technology and ocean engineering
