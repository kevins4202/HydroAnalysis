5 km2 in southern lower saxony germany the area has a mean annual precipitation of 650 mm and a mean annual temperature of 8 3 c the valley starts from a sandstone plateau in the west with a maximum altitude about 310 m a s l and runs eastward at the end of the valley in the east a minimum altitude of about 210 m a s l is reached opposing north and south facing hillslopes including both gentle and steep slopes are roughly symmetrically distributed the plateau and valley are mainly vegetated by beech fagus sylvatica forest while spruce picea abies is distributed in small patches the geological basement consists of lower triassic sedimentary rock predominantly sandstone the sandstone is covered by pleistocene periglacial slope deposits and holocene colluvial deposits yang et al 2021a both consist of sandy weathering products of the sandstone and various proportions of loess that have been mixed into the sandy weathering products by solifluction at the outlet of the valley east of the sandstone plateau flat lowlands covered by loess are used as arable fields and grasslands the loess component in the pleistocene slope deposits has no carbonates which were most likely already leached synsedimentarily long before the holocene soil formation started according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2014 the studied soils are either dystric or protospodic cambisols at sites with minor loess contents eutric cambisols at sites with higher loess contents and glossic retisols at sites where very loess rich layers are present 3 methods 3 1 field work and laboratory analysis forty seven soil horizons from 12 soil profiles were sampled including 12 topsoil horizons and 35 subsoil horizons the topsoil horizons were the pedogenic a horizons of each soil profile with 5 13 cm thickness while subsoil horizons included all b and c horizons of the 12 profiles occurring at depths between 5 cm and 160 cm depth ranges for each soil horizon are provided in table s1 bulk soil samples were taken according to soil horizon boundaries for the analysis of basic soil properties undisturbed samples were collected in steel cylinders with three replicates for measuring soil water retention parameters and three to five replicates for ksat measurements to calculate sat undisturbed samples in steel cylinders were saturated with water for 48 h during this process water level was gradually raised by adding water until the water level was 2 mm below the upper edge of the cylinders to avoid air entrapping inside the soil samples after weighing the saturated soil samples were transferred to a pressure device ecotech for the measurement of soil water retention at 6 kpa and 33 kpa fc successively after the measurements the samples were oven dried at 105 for 48 h and then weighted to calculate bulk density for the measurement of soil water retention at 1500 kpa pwp disturbed soil samples were used with pressure plates awc was calculated as the difference between the fc and pwp all soil water retention parameters were expressed as volume pwp was expressed as mass and was converted to volume with the following formula pwp by volume pwp by mass bulk density an eijkelkamp lp device was used to estimate ksat of undisturbed soil samples the samples were gradually saturated using an adjustable water level regulator inside the container of the lp then ksat of the samples was measured using the constant head method the measuring procedure using the lp method and the scheme of the lp are described in the operating instructions by eijkelkamp 2011 disturbed soil samples were air dried homogenized and passed through a 2 mm sieve total carbon contents were measured by a leco cn analyzer and were considered as soc contents since the samples contained no carbonates for psd measurements soil organic matter and iron oxides were removed and the sample solution was ultrasonicated for 30 s before measurement a beckmann coulter ls3320 laser particle size analyzer with polarized intensity differential scattering system pids was used for grain size measurement more details on the pretreatment and determination are given by yang et al 2020a 3 2 calculation of loess proportions all soils showed a bimodal particle size distribution with a silty mode at 37 μm representing the loess component and a sandy mode at 176 256 μm representing local sandstone weathering materials the two modes were distinctly different from each other with a breakpoint at 80 μm yang et al 2020a yang et al 2021a the proportions of loess in soils were calculated with a two endmembers unmixing model loess in soil sample i ui a b a 100 where ui is the proportion of the fraction finer than 80 μm of sample i a is the equivalent fraction of pure sandstone and b is the equivalent fraction of pure loess fig 1 the suitability of this model for our dataset has been reported in a previous methodological paper by yang et al 2020a 3 3 calculation of porosity parameters porosity parameters including total porosity macro porosity 50 μm and matrix porosity 50 μm were defined by water content at various matric potentials and were calculated as total porosity sat macro porosity 50 μm sat soil water content at 6kpa matrix porosity 50 μm soil water content at 6kpa whereby the indicated micrometers represent equivalent pore diameters 3 4 statistics all computations were carried out in the r environment for statistical computing r core team 2021 a standardized principal components analysis pca venables and ripley 2002 section 11 1 was conducted with the prcomp function to examine how basic soil properties and hydrological properties are inter related and to check if there is a separation between topsoils and subsoils biplots showing the relation between original variables and principal components were computed with the ggbiplot r package these also show the locations of the observations in pc space pearson bilinear correlation analysis was conducted with the cor function separately for topsoils and subsoils to provide an initial understanding of how soil hydrological properties respond to basic soil properties differently between topsoils and subsoils multivariate linear models were then conducted with the lm function to determine which variables are the most important for controlling soil hydrological properties to test the hypothesis that the binary pattern of soil hydrological properties was attributed to the differences in soc between topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons and to test if there was a horizon depth effect we built three multivariate linear models to predict each soil hydrological parameter ① a model with loess content as the only predictor ② a model with soc content and loess content as predictors and ③ a nested model considering horizon effect with a separate per horizon soc effect and separate slopes for loess effect in topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons the models were compared by their values of the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes aicc computed on the results of the linear models with r s aic function and then corrected for sample size and number of linear model parameters burnham and anderson 2004 the appropriateness of the linear models was evaluated with the regression diagnostics provided by the plot lm function 4 results 4 1 soil textural components as a function of loess proportion soil texture varied between loamy sand sandy loam loam and silt loam with the increase of loess proportions in soils fig 2 clay 2μm content was at a low level 3 1 9 7 in all soils and was mainly determined by loess proportion i e complementary to the silt content silt 2 50 μm content had a strong positive correlation with loess proportion r2 0 98 as silt was mostly derived from loess addition fig 1a correspondingly sand 50 2000 μm content was negatively correlated with loess proportion as sands mainly originated from sandstone while the loess contained only a small amount of sand 4 2 differences in soil properties between topsoil and subsoil horizons soil properties showed large variations between topsoil and subsoil horizons loess content varied from 14 to 51 in topsoil horizons a horizons and from 7 to 92 in subsoil horizons b and c horizons table 1 soc content ranged from 1 8 to 6 9 in topsoil horizons and from 0 15 to 0 97 in subsoil horizons the topsoil horizons had a lower bulk density 0 6 1 2 mg m 3 compared to the subsoil horizons 1 1 1 7 mg m 3 table 1 a standardized principal components analysis pca on the multivariate space of the soil properties showed that there was a clear separation between topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons fig 3 which was mainly due to higher soc content and lower bulk density in topsoil horizons moreover the strong negative relation between soc content and bulk density in the space spanned by the first two principal components pcs accounting for 84 of the total variance suggested that change in bulk density was primarily a function of differences in soc content soil porosity parameters including total porosity evaluated by sat macro porosity and matrix porosity had close positive correlations with soc in the pc1 2 space this underlines the necessity to consider the effect of horizon topsoil horizons vs subsoil horizons and soc in evaluating the relationships between loess content and soil hydrological properties the strong positive correlations between loess content and textural components fig 3 reflected that most silt and clay particles came from loess addition fig 1 fig 2 4 3 control factors of water retention and porosity in topsoil and subsoil horizons the large difference in basic soil properties between topsoil and subsoil horizons led to corresponding differences in soil hydrological properties as well as differences in the relative importance of the factors controlling soil hydrological properties table 2 summarizes the diverging importance of the factors controlling water retention characteristics and porosity parameters in topsoil and subsoil horizons loess content was significantly correlated with all measured soil water retention characteristics and porosity parameters for subsoil horizons yet showed no significant correlation with those parameters for topsoil horizons table 2 soc was significantly correlated with sat fc pwp and macro porosity for subsoil horizons but was significantly correlated with sat only for topsoil horizons table 2 bulk density had the strongest influence on sat and macro porosity for both topsoil and subsoil horizons table 2 in the hierarchy of nested linear models model ② best fit the actual values of all hydrological parameters except for pwp which was best fit with model ① table 3 results from model ② seemed to be contradictory with those from pairwise correlation table 2 where negative correlations were found between soc and fc pwp and awc this inconsistency can be explained by the suppressor effect i e the effect of loess proportions suppressed the effect of soc on soil hydrological variables in such a case the correct sign interpretations are those given by the multivariate regression coefficients falk and miller 1992 this suggests that soc had an enhancing effect on all measured soil hydrological properties except for pwp and that the effect of loess on soil hydrological properties was the same in topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons once the difference in soc concentrations and its relation with the hydrologic parameters was accounted for in the multivariate model after accounting for soc increasing loess content increased fc pwp awc matrix porosity and decreased sat and macro porosity table 3 that is the proportion of larger pores decreased by increasing loess content but once these pores were drained to fc loess increased water retention the success of the models in explaining the variance was variable for the properties sat was very well explained parameters including fc pwp matrix porosity and macro porosity were moderately well explained and awc was poorly explained table 3 fig 4 all relations showed a negative gain between actual and fitted i e the lowest actual were over predicted and the highest were under predicted fig 4 this is a typical smoothing effect of linear models in the absence of high leverage points 4 4 effects of loess content on saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat varied considerably between replicates for most soil horizons sometimes by two orders of magnitude table s2 this may be due to varying abundance of channels created by roots and soil fauna representing preferential flow pathways lu et al 2020 we grouped ksat based on loess content classes loess contents 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 and 60 and found that ksat showed an overall decrease with increasing loess content for subsoils fig 5 for topsoils however this relationship did not exist possible causes for this difference could be the enhancing effect of soc on macro porosity and biopores however such an enhancing effect may exist only for loess rich soils as for soils with loess content 40 the topsoils were not significantly different from subsoils in ksat with the same level of loess content fig 5 5 discussion the significant correlations between loess content and all measured soil hydrological properties found for subsoil horizons indicated that loess content has a major influence on soil hydrological properties when soc content is relatively low 1 mass for topsoils however correlation coefficients between loess content and soil hydrological properties showed no relationship this was probably because the effect of soc content overrides the influence of loess content on soil hydrological properties once the effect of soc is modelled separately for in each horizon the effect of loess on soil hydrological properties makes no difference between topsoil and subsoil horizons this may be explained by the strong mixing mainly by cryoturbation and bioturbation and relatively weak eluvial illuvial processes yang et al 2021a other studies also reported that soil hydrological properties is strongly controlled by texture in soils with low soc content e g schneider et al 2021 yang et al 2021b our results are in line with these conclusions the local sandstone weathering materials in our study area contained little silt and clay thus silt and clay contents depended primarily on loess proportions in the slope deposits yang et al 2020a the increase of fc with increasing loess content was stronger than that of pwp resulting in an increase in awc this phenomenon has also been observed in other regions with limited proportions of fine particles e g yost and hartemink 2019 yang et al 2021b the increase of fc and pwp by a loess component is primarily caused by the increase in medium and small pores razzaghi et al 2020 on the other hand macro porosity is gradually reduced as clay and silt sized particles fill increasing portions of macro pores naveed et al 2013 this mechanism also explains the decrease of ksat with increasing loess content since at saturated conditions larger pores conduct water much more efficiently than smaller pores hirmas et al 2018 the enhancing effect of soc on soil hydrological properties was reflected by the better performance of model ② with loess and soc as predictors compared with model ① loess as the only predictor for all parameters except for pwp where the coefficient of soc was always positive table 3 the increase in soil water retention with soc content was greatest for sat followed by fc there was barely any effect of soc content on pwp table 3 fig 4 these findings agree well with results from various studies and databases e g bauer and black 1992 minasny and mcbratney 2018 zhou et al 2020 our results moreover showed that soc also had an enhancing effect on awc fig 3 yet the low performance of the predictive model for awc may be because the effect of soc on awc depends largely on psd which varies significantly with loess content it has been reported that increasing soc content resulted in proportionately larger awc increases in medium to coarse textured soils compared to finer textured soils e g huntington 2006 minasny and mcbratney 2018 additionally soc greatly improved both macro porosity and matrix porosity the former may be attributed to enhanced soil structure formation induced by soil organic matter while the latter may be related to the high water adsorbing capacity of soil organic matter yang et al 2014 soc promotes the formation of soil aggregates which create large volumes of macro pores mesopores and micropores kay 1998 our findings agree with results from fu et al 2021 and fukumasu et al 2022 both of which showed that soc contributes to the increase in awc at the dry end equivalent to pore sizes 0 2 7 5 μm and 0 2 5 μm respectively fukumasu et al 2022 also found that soc contributes to larger pore size range 480 720 μm notably although the macro pores created by soc are theoretically able to enhance ksat in our study an increase in soc content did not lead to an increase in ksat for soils with loess content 40 fig 5 this can be explained by the enhancing effect of soc content on fc as more water is retained due to increased fc less water remains mobile and can drain freely nemes et al 2005 another possible explanation is that the increase of soc content modifies soil pore network geometry leading to more tortuous and thin pathways for water flow nemes et al 2005 fu et al 2021 given the limited data and high variability of ksat among the replicates our analysis did not clearly reveal the extent of these effects 6 implications for periglacial ecosystem functioning soils in our study area were derived from pleistocene periglacial slope deposits which are common in low mountains of central europe north america and other mid latitude regions kleber 1997 sauer and felix henningsen 2004 sauer and felix henningsen 2006 raab et al 2007 semmel and terhorst 2010 kleber and terhorst 2013 our results demonstrate that in regions where weathering of the local rock produces coarse textured soils loess admixture in slope deposits strongly controls soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity thus two parameters that further determine multiple eco hydrological functions of soils the same holds true for coarse textured soils exposed to present aeolian silt deposition e g high mountain soils forming in rock debris such soils with limited fine particles have low water holding capacity and high hydraulic conductivity thus providing rather dry habitats for plants the enhancement of soil water storage induced by the addition of aeolian dust allows for denser vegetation growth which enhances the accumulation of soc increasing soc content in turn further promotes soil water retention and soil productivity yang et al 2017 robinson et al 2019 thus a loess component in pleistocene periglacial slope deposits is a key factor for soil formation and ecosystem functioning moreover the pedogenetically and ecologically highly relevant interrelationships derived from our study can also be transferred to modern periglacial settings such as the arctic bullard and austin 2011 bullard et al 2016 müller et al 2016 and many high mountain regions all over the world muhs and benedict 2006 lawrence and neff 2009 munroe et al 2015 2020 yang et al 2020b it has been well documented that aeolian deposition of silt or fine sand is a common ongoing process in these settings and that the blown in aeolian sediments are usually finer in texture compared with the local rock debris or glacial tills that form the parent material for soil formation aciego et al 2017 rymer et al 2022 it is thus important to consider the beneficial effects of aeolian deposition of fine material on soil hydrological functions when evaluating soil formation and ecosystem functioning in these settings this is especially true under the ongoing global warming and glacier retreat which leads to progressive exposure of additional unvegetated areas from where dust can be released and incorporated into soils anderson et al 2017 an applied aspect of the observed effects relates to the practice of extracting silty glacial flour that is locally available in glaciofluvial channels for example in southern greenland and applying this material to coarser textured soils for agricultural production in this context our quantitative results may also be helpful to guide reasonable and economic usage of glacial flour that is very similar to loess in texture and composition caviezel et al 2017 sukstorf et al 2020 7 conclusions we successfully quantified the influence of loess and soc content on soil hydrological properties for soils of a sandstone landscape developed from slope deposits that were loess affected to varying degree the hierarchy of linear models and the standardized pca were able to reveal the controlling factors and the relative strength of the relations loess content has a controlling effect on most hydrological properties for subsoils while soc enhances sat fc awc macro porosity and matrix porosity although this study was in a specific context of formerly periglacial conditions its results have important general implications for understanding the evolution of soils and soil functions in loess and dust affected environments this is especially true for past and present periglacial settings where aeolian silt is often the main source of fine particles and thus a key factor in the development of soils and associated development of their ecological and hydrological functions credit

pedogenic a horizons of each soil profile with 5 13 cm thickness while subsoil horizons included all b and c horizons of the 12 profiles occurring at depths between 5 cm and 160 cm depth ranges for each soil horizon are provided in table s1 bulk soil samples were taken according to soil horizon boundaries for the analysis of basic soil properties undisturbed samples were collected in steel cylinders with three replicates for measuring soil water retention parameters and three to five replicates for ksat measurements to calculate sat undisturbed samples in steel cylinders were saturated with water for 48 h during this process water level was gradually raised by adding water until the water level was 2 mm below the upper edge of the cylinders to avoid air entrapping inside the soil samples after weighing the saturated soil samples were transferred to a pressure device ecotech for the measurement of soil water retention at 6 kpa and 33 kpa fc successively after the measurements the samples were oven dried at 105 for 48 h and then weighted to calculate bulk density for the measurement of soil water retention at 1500 kpa pwp disturbed soil samples were used with pressure plates awc was calculated as the difference between the fc and pwp all soil water retention parameters were expressed as volume pwp was expressed as mass and was converted to volume with the following formula pwp by volume pwp by mass bulk density an eijkelkamp lp device was used to estimate ksat of undisturbed soil samples the samples were gradually saturated using an adjustable water level regulator inside the container of the lp then ksat of the samples was measured using the constant head method the measuring procedure using the lp method and the scheme of the lp are described in the operating instructions by eijkelkamp 2011 disturbed soil samples were air dried homogenized and passed through a 2 mm sieve total carbon contents were measured by a leco cn analyzer and were considered as soc contents since the samples contained no carbonates for psd measurements soil organic matter and iron oxides were removed and the sample solution was ultrasonicated for 30 s before measurement a beckmann coulter ls3320 laser particle size analyzer with polarized intensity differential scattering system pids was used for grain size measurement more details on the pretreatment and determination are given by yang et al 2020a 3 2 calculation of loess proportions all soils showed a bimodal particle size distribution with a silty mode at 37 μm representing the loess component and a sandy mode at 176 256 μm representing local sandstone weathering materials the two modes were distinctly different from each other with a breakpoint at 80 μm yang et al 2020a yang et al 2021a the proportions of loess in soils were calculated with a two endmembers unmixing model loess in soil sample i ui a b a 100 where ui is the proportion of the fraction finer than 80 μm of sample i a is the equivalent fraction of pure sandstone and b is the equivalent fraction of pure loess fig 1 the suitability of this model for our dataset has been reported in a previous methodological paper by yang et al 2020a 3 3 calculation of porosity parameters porosity parameters including total porosity macro porosity 50 μm and matrix porosity 50 μm were defined by water content at various matric potentials and were calculated as total porosity sat macro porosity 50 μm sat soil water content at 6kpa matrix porosity 50 μm soil water content at 6kpa whereby the indicated micrometers represent equivalent pore diameters 3 4 statistics all computations were carried out in the r environment for statistical computing r core team 2021 a standardized principal components analysis pca venables and ripley 2002 section 11 1 was conducted with the prcomp function to examine how basic soil properties and hydrological properties are inter related and to check if there is a separation between topsoils and subsoils biplots showing the relation between original variables and principal components were computed with the ggbiplot r package these also show the locations of the observations in pc space pearson bilinear correlation analysis was conducted with the cor function separately for topsoils and subsoils to provide an initial understanding of how soil hydrological properties respond to basic soil properties differently between topsoils and subsoils multivariate linear models were then conducted with the lm function to determine which variables are the most important for controlling soil hydrological properties to test the hypothesis that the binary pattern of soil hydrological properties was attributed to the differences in soc between topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons and to test if there was a horizon depth effect we built three multivariate linear models to predict each soil hydrological parameter ① a model with loess content as the only predictor ② a model with soc content and loess content as predictors and ③ a nested model considering horizon effect with a separate per horizon soc effect and separate slopes for loess effect in topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons the models were compared by their values of the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes aicc computed on the results of the linear models with r s aic function and then corrected for sample size and number of linear model parameters burnham and anderson 2004 the appropriateness of the linear models was evaluated with the regression diagnostics provided by the plot lm function 4 results 4 1 soil textural components as a function of loess proportion soil texture varied between loamy sand sandy loam loam and silt loam with the increase of loess proportions in soils fig 2 clay 2μm content was at a low level 3 1 9 7 in all soils and was mainly determined by loess proportion i e complementary to the silt content silt 2 50 μm content had a strong positive correlation with loess proportion r2 0 98 as silt was mostly derived from loess addition fig 1a correspondingly sand 50 2000 μm content was negatively correlated with loess proportion as sands mainly originated from sandstone while the loess contained only a small amount of sand 4 2 differences in soil properties between topsoil and subsoil horizons soil properties showed large variations between topsoil and subsoil horizons loess content varied from 14 to 51 in topsoil horizons a horizons and from 7 to 92 in subsoil horizons b and c horizons table 1 soc content ranged from 1 8 to 6 9 in topsoil horizons and from 0 15 to 0 97 in subsoil horizons the topsoil horizons had a lower bulk density 0 6 1 2 mg m 3 compared to the subsoil horizons 1 1 1 7 mg m 3 table 1 a standardized principal components analysis pca on the multivariate space of the soil properties showed that there was a clear separation between topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons fig 3 which was mainly due to higher soc content and lower bulk density in topsoil horizons moreover the strong negative relation between soc content and bulk density in the space spanned by the first two principal components pcs accounting for 84 of the total variance suggested that change in bulk density was primarily a function of differences in soc content soil porosity parameters including total porosity evaluated by sat macro porosity and matrix porosity had close positive correlations with soc in the pc1 2 space this underlines the necessity to consider the effect of horizon topsoil horizons vs subsoil horizons and soc in evaluating the relationships between loess content and soil hydrological properties the strong positive correlations between loess content and textural components fig 3 reflected that most silt and clay particles came from loess addition fig 1 fig 2 4 3 control factors of water retention and porosity in topsoil and subsoil horizons the large difference in basic soil properties between topsoil and subsoil horizons led to corresponding differences in soil hydrological properties as well as differences in the relative importance of the factors controlling soil hydrological properties table 2 summarizes the diverging importance of the factors controlling water retention characteristics and porosity parameters in topsoil and subsoil horizons loess content was significantly correlated with all measured soil water retention characteristics and porosity parameters for subsoil horizons yet showed no significant correlation with those parameters for topsoil horizons table 2 soc was significantly correlated with sat fc pwp and macro porosity for subsoil horizons but was significantly correlated with sat only for topsoil horizons table 2 bulk density had the strongest influence on sat and macro porosity for both topsoil and subsoil horizons table 2 in the hierarchy of nested linear models model ② best fit the actual values of all hydrological parameters except for pwp which was best fit with model ① table 3 results from model ② seemed to be contradictory with those from pairwise correlation table 2 where negative correlations were found between soc and fc pwp and awc this inconsistency can be explained by the suppressor effect i e the effect of loess proportions suppressed the effect of soc on soil hydrological variables in such a case the correct sign interpretations are those given by the multivariate regression coefficients falk and miller 1992 this suggests that soc had an enhancing effect on all measured soil hydrological properties except for pwp and that the effect of loess on soil hydrological properties was the same in topsoil horizons and subsoil horizons once the difference in soc concentrations and its relation with the hydrologic parameters was accounted for in the multivariate model after accounting for soc increasing loess content increased fc pwp awc matrix porosity and decreased sat and macro porosity table 3 that is the proportion of larger pores decreased by increasing loess content but once these pores were drained to fc loess increased water retention the success of the models in explaining the variance was variable for the properties sat was very well explained parameters including fc pwp matrix porosity and macro porosity were moderately well explained and awc was poorly explained table 3 fig 4 all relations showed a negative gain between actual and fitted i e the lowest actual were over predicted and the highest were under predicted fig 4 this is a typical smoothing effect of linear models in the absence of high leverage points 4 4 effects of loess content on saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat varied considerably between replicates for most soil horizons sometimes by two orders of magnitude table s2 this may be due to varying abundance of channels created by roots and soil fauna representing preferential flow pathways lu et al 2020 we grouped ksat based on loess content classes loess contents 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 and 60 and found that ksat showed an overall decrease with increasing loess content for subsoils fig 5 for topsoils however this relationship did not exist possible causes for this difference could be the enhancing effect of soc on macro porosity and biopores however such an enhancing effect may exist only for loess rich soils as for soils with loess content 40 the topsoils were not significantly different from subsoils in ksat with the same level of loess content fig 5 5 discussion the significant correlations between loess content and all measured soil hydrological properties found for subsoil horizons indicated that loess content has a major influence on soil hydrological properties when soc content is relatively low 1 mass for topsoils however correlation coefficients between loess content and soil hydrological properties showed no relationship this was probably because the effect of soc content overrides the influence of loess content on soil hydrological properties once the effect of soc is modelled separately for in each horizon the effect of loess on soil hydrological properties makes no difference between topsoil and subsoil horizons this may be explained by the strong mixing mainly by cryoturbation and bioturbation and relatively weak eluvial illuvial processes yang et al 2021a other studies also reported that soil hydrological properties is strongly controlled by texture in soils with low soc content e g schneider et al 2021 yang et al 2021b our results are in line with these conclusions the local sandstone weathering materials in our study area contained little silt and clay thus silt and clay contents depended primarily on loess proportions in the slope deposits yang et al 2020a the increase of fc with increasing loess content was stronger than that of pwp resulting in an increase in awc this phenomenon has also been observed in other regions with limited proportions of fine particles e g yost and hartemink 2019 yang et al 2021b the increase of fc and pwp by a loess component is primarily caused by the increase in medium and small pores razzaghi et al 2020 on the other hand macro porosity is gradually reduced as clay and silt sized particles fill increasing portions of macro pores naveed et al 2013 this mechanism also explains the decrease of ksat with increasing loess content since at saturated conditions larger pores conduct water much more efficiently than smaller pores hirmas et al 2018 the enhancing effect of soc on soil hydrological properties was reflected by the better performance of model ② with loess and soc as predictors compared with model ① loess as the only predictor for all parameters except for pwp where the coefficient of soc was always positive table 3 the increase in soil water retention with soc content was greatest for sat followed by fc there was barely any effect of soc content on pwp table 3 fig 4 these findings agree well with results from various studies and databases e g bauer and black 1992 minasny and mcbratney 2018 zhou et al 2020 our results moreover showed that soc also had an enhancing effect on awc fig 3 yet the low performance of the predictive model for awc may be because the effect of soc on awc depends largely on psd which varies significantly with loess content it has been reported that increasing soc content resulted in proportionately larger awc increases in medium to coarse textured soils compared to finer textured soils e g huntington 2006 minasny and mcbratney 2018 additionally soc greatly improved both macro porosity and matrix porosity the former may be attributed to enhanced soil structure formation induced by soil organic matter while the latter may be related to the high water adsorbing capacity of soil organic matter yang et al 2014 soc promotes the formation of soil aggregates which create large volumes of macro pores mesopores and micropores kay 1998 our findings agree with results from fu et al 2021 and fukumasu et al 2022 both of which showed that soc contributes to the increase in awc at the dry end equivalent to pore sizes 0 2 7 5 μm and 0 2 5 μm respectively fukumasu et al 2022 also found that soc contributes to larger pore size range 480 720 μm notably although the macro pores created by soc are theoretically able to enhance ksat in our study an increase in soc content did not lead to an increase in ksat for soils with loess content 40 fig 5 this can be explained by the enhancing effect of soc content on fc as more water is retained due to increased fc less water remains mobile and can drain freely nemes et al 2005 another possible explanation is that the increase of soc content modifies soil pore network geometry leading to more tortuous and thin pathways for water flow nemes et al 2005 fu et al 2021 given the limited data and high variability of ksat among the replicates our analysis did not clearly reveal the extent of these effects 6 implications for periglacial ecosystem functioning soils in our study area were derived from pleistocene periglacial slope deposits which are common in low mountains of central europe north america and other mid latitude regions kleber 1997 sauer and felix henningsen 2004 sauer and felix henningsen 2006 raab et al 2007 semmel and terhorst 2010 kleber and terhorst 2013 our results demonstrate that in regions where weathering of the local rock produces coarse textured soils loess admixture in slope deposits strongly controls soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity thus two parameters that further determine multiple eco hydrological functions of soils the same holds true for coarse textured soils exposed to present aeolian silt deposition e g high mountain soils forming in rock debris such soils with limited fine particles have low water holding capacity and high hydraulic conductivity thus providing rather dry habitats for plants the enhancement of soil water storage induced by the addition of aeolian dust allows for denser vegetation growth which enhances the accumulation of soc increasing soc content in turn further promotes soil water retention and soil productivity yang et al 2017 robinson et al 2019 thus a loess component in pleistocene periglacial slope deposits is a key factor for soil formation and ecosystem functioning moreover the pedogenetically and ecologically highly relevant interrelationships derived from our study can also be transferred to modern periglacial settings such as the arctic bullard and austin 2011 bullard et al 2016 müller et al 2016 and many high mountain regions all over the world muhs and benedict 2006 lawrence and neff 2009 munroe et al 2015 2020 yang et al 2020b it has been well documented that aeolian deposition of silt or fine sand is a common ongoing process in these settings and that the blown in aeolian sediments are usually finer in texture compared with the local rock debris or glacial tills that form the parent material for soil formation aciego et al 2017 rymer et al 2022 it is thus important to consider the beneficial effects of aeolian deposition of fine material on soil hydrological functions when evaluating soil formation and ecosystem functioning in these settings this is especially true under the ongoing global warming and glacier retreat which leads to progressive exposure of additional unvegetated areas from where dust can be released and incorporated into soils anderson et al 2017 an applied aspect of the observed effects relates to the practice of extracting silty glacial flour that is locally available in glaciofluvial channels for example in southern greenland and applying this material to coarser textured soils for agricultural production in this context our quantitative results may also be helpful to guide reasonable and economic usage of glacial flour that is very similar to loess in texture and composition caviezel et al 2017 sukstorf et al 2020 7 conclusions we successfully quantified the influence of loess and soc content on soil hydrological properties for soils of a sandstone landscape developed from slope deposits that were loess affected to varying degree the hierarchy of linear models and the standardized pca were able to reveal the controlling factors and the relative strength of the relations loess content has a controlling effect on most hydrological properties for subsoils while soc enhances sat fc awc macro porosity and matrix porosity although this study was in a specific context of formerly periglacial conditions its results have important general implications for understanding the evolution of soils and soil functions in loess and dust affected environments this is especially true for past and present periglacial settings where aeolian silt is often the main source of fine particles and thus a key factor in the development of soils and associated development of their ecological and hydrological functions credit

3341,lack of national soil property maps limits the studies of soil moisture sm dynamics in norway one alternative is to apply the global soil data as input for macro scale hydrological modelling but the quality of these data is still unknown the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate two recent global soil databases wise30sec and soilgrids in comparison with data from local soil profiles 2 to evaluate which database supports better model performance in terms of river discharge and sm for three macro scale catchments in norway and 3 to suggest criteria for the selection of soil data for models with different complexity the global soil databases were evaluated in three steps 1 the global soil data are compared directly with the norwegian forest soil profiles 2 the simulated discharge based on the two global soil databases is compared with observations and 3 the simulated sm is compared with three global sm products two hydrological models were applied to simulate discharge and sm the soil and water integrated model swim and the variable infiltration capacity vic model the comparison with data from local soil profiles shows that soilgrids has smaller mean errors than wise30sec especially for upper soil layers but both soil databases have large root mean squared errors and poor correlations swim generally performs better in terms of discharge using soilgrids than using wise30sec and the simulated sm has higher correlations with the sm products in contrast the vic model is less sensitive to soil input data and the simulated sm using wise30sec is higher correlated with the sm products than using soilgrids based on the results we conclude that the global soil databases can provide reasonable soil property information at coarse resolutions and large areas the selection of soil input data should depend on the characteristics of both models and study areas keywords soil moisture norwegian forest soil profile soilgrids wise30sec esa cci sm era5 gleam 1 introduction soil moisture is a key mediator between atmosphere and hydrosphere which determines the amount of water available for evapotranspiration from land influencing precipitation and air temperature as feedback seneviratne et al 2010 in addition it affects streamflow and groundwater recharge via partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration in the hydrological cycle orth and seneviratne 2013 despite its importance soil moisture is rarely studied in norway especially for macro scale catchments one major obstacle is lack of national wide soil property information for hydrological or land surface models global soil databases are often considered as alternative soil property information for large scale modelling and for regions with poor local data for example the fao unesco soil map of the world fao 2003 and the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 are applied as standard inputs in soil and water assessment tool swat model abbaspour et al 2019 dai et al 2019 reviewed the global soil databases used by the land surface models within the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 the widely used databases were the fao unesco soil map of the world hwsd the data and information system of international geosphere biosphere programme igbp dis database global soil data task group 2000 the global soil dataset for earth system model gsde shangguan et al 2014 etc all global soil property databases are generated from soil surveys by one of two general methods dai et al 2019 the linkage method batjes 2003 linking soil profiles and soil mapping units in soil type maps and the digital soil mapping method mcbratney et al 2003 using state of art machine learning methods to map the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe the soil databases produced by the linkage methods are polygon based due to the shape of soil type maps while the soil databases derived by digital soil mapping provide gridded spatially continuous estimates thus the soil databases produced by these methods give distinctively different distribution of soil properties dai et al 2019 also compared four global soil databases with 94 441 soil profiles from the world soil information service wosis they found that the soilgrids system hengl et al 2017 one of the most recently developed databases using the digital soil mapping method had much better accuracy than hwsd igbp dis and gsde which were developed using the traditional linkage method tifafi et al 2018 compared the soil carbon stock estimates based on the global soil databases with field measurements they also found that soilgrids had smaller errors than the world inventory of soil emission potentials database at a resolution of 30 s wise30sec batjes 2016 which is an improved version of hwsd so far there are limited studies that compared the effects of different soil input data on hydrological or land surface modelling and evaluations of the new generation of global soil databases are rare several studies reported improved model performance in terms of specific hydrological processes such as soil moisture and river discharge with better soil information and at higher resolutions sheshukov et al 2011 guillod et al 2013 de lannoy et al 2014 livneh et al 2015 analysed the sensitivities of different soil input data in the mhm model for the mississippi catchment and concluded that the choice of soil textural properties for a single model can be an appreciable source of uncertainty in contrast ye et al 2011 and mukundan et al 2010 found that the improved high resolution data did not necessarily improve the streamflow simulation using swat model hence the effect of soil input data can be specific for different models soil data as well as study areas all the studies mentioned above mainly compared the simulated river discharge with observations and inter compared the simulated hydrological processes driven by different soil input data the simulated soil moisture was rarely validated against observations probably due to the lack of soil moisture measurements especially at catchment scales to fill this gap satellite derived soil moisture products have become one important source of surface soil moisture observations in recent years and they can be used to calibrate hydrological models for ungauged catchments choi et al 2021 or to validate model performance in terms of soil moisture kearney maino 2018 in addition the satellite derived soil moisture products are often assimilated in land surface or hydrological models to improve the root zone moisture simulations at large scales renzullo et al 2014 tian et al 2019 based on the advances in observation data kearney maino 2018 assessed the application of the new generation of global soil data in an infiltration and redistribution model and compared the model outputs with both in situ soil moisture measurements and satellite derived soil moisture product their results demonstrated the advantages of using the new global soil data for modelling soil moisture at fine spatial and temporal resolution for australia and encouraged the applications of the new databases for other regions in this study we evaluated two recent global soil property databases wise30sec and soilgrids generated by different mapping methods for macro scale hydrological modelling in norway to the best of our knowledge we are the first to compare these two databases with respect to their utility for hydrological modelling and it is the first study that focuses on macro scale soil properties and soil moisture simulations in norway different from the previous studies we applied two hydrological models to account for the uncertainties caused by different model structures modelling resolutions and descriptions of hydrological processes in addition we used a three step procedure to systematically evaluate the global soil databases the benchmark data is not only the observed discharge but also the norwegian forest soil database and three global soil moisture products thus the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate two recent global soil databases wise30sec and soilgrids in comparison with data from local soil profiles 2 to evaluate which database supports better model performance in terms of river discharge and soil moisture for three macro scale catchments in norway and 3 to suggest criteria for the selection of soil data for macro scale hydrological modelling 2 study area norway is located in northern europe and covers an area of about 325 000 km2 the mainland can be divided into 6 geographic regimes finnmark nordland trøndelag western norway eastern norway and southern norway fig 1 a about half of the land area is covered by bedrock and heather poor shrub vegetations in high mountains and about 38 of the area is covered by forest in this study we selected three macro scale catchments with the drainage areas larger than 10 000 km2 from the norwegian flood forecasting system ruan langsholt 2017 where human activities do not significantly influence the discharge at the outlet these catchments are the upper lågen river above the gauging station losna id 2 145 11 206 km2 the upper glomma river above the gauging station elverum id 2 604 15 450 km2 and the tana river above the gauging station polmak id 234 18 14 170 km2 fig 1 both the losna and elverum catchments are located in eastern norway and the polmak catchment is partly located in finnmark and partly in sweden the three catchments span a range of climatic hydrological and geographic conditions table 1 the losna catchment is located at the highest altitude among the three and it receives the largest annual precipitation amount about 90 of the precipitation in this catchment ends up as runoff due to the cold climate steep slopes and large area of bedrock the polmak catchment is located in the coldest and northernmost region and it receives the lowest amount of precipitation per year it is also flattest and at the lowest altitudes among the three catchments the elverum catchment is the largest catchment and it has the highest annual temperature above 0 c among the three in both the polmak and elverum catchments about 75 of the precipitation ends up as runoff these three catchments represent the dominant land cover types in norway in the losna catchment heather and bedrock are the dominant land covers ca 50 and forest covers about 25 of the land area in the elverum and polmak catchments more than 50 of the land area is covered by forest and more than 20 of the land is covered by heather in addition due to the large drainage area and distinct locations these catchments contain more than half of quaternary geological conditions in norway according to norway s geological survey 3 data and method in this study we evaluated wise30sec and soilgrids in three steps fig 2 the first step was to compare the global soil data with the norwegian forest soil database in the second and third steps we applied two hydrological models to simulate river discharge and soil moisture using information from the two soil databases separately the simulated discharge was compared with observed discharge step 2 and the simulated soil moisture was compared with three global soil moisture products step 3 in the next subsections the data and methods are described following the workflow shown in fig 2 3 1 evaluation 1 soil characteristics 3 1 1 global soil property databases the main characteristics of the two global soil databases are listed in table 2 wise30sec batjes 2016 is developed based on the traditional linkage method it is an improvement of hwsd as it uses the soil map from hwsd with minor corrections and it incorporates more soil profiles 21 000 profiles than hwsd and climate zone maps as categorical covariates for each soil type it has seven layers up to 200 cm depth 5 20 cm up to 100 cm depth and 2 50 cm up to 200 cm depth with uncertainty estimation the resolution of the data is about 1 km soilgrids hengl et al 2017 is developed using the digital soil mapping method the latest version released in 2020 was produced by fitting an ensemble of machine learning methods based on over 230 000 soil profile observations and a series of environmental covariates covariates were selected from a pool of over 400 environmental layers from earth observation derived products and other environmental information including climate land cover and terrain morphology the outputs of soilgrids are soil properties at six standard depth intervals 5 15 30 60 100 and 200 cm for each grid cell at a resolution of 250 m 3 1 2 norwegian forest soil database the norwegian forest soil database consists of 1040 sampling sites covering forested land on a 9 by 9 km regular grid i e sampling density follows the geographical distribution of forests in norway with fewer sites in the northernmost region central mountain areas and the coastal areas where forest is not the dominant land cover fig 3 profile descriptions soil sampling and lab analysis for each site were carried out in the period 1988 1992 following standardized procedures sveistrup 1984 in total 994 soil profiles provide sufficient data to be included in the analysis i e depth and fine earth fractions sand silt clay for each soil layer bulk density for mineral soil layers is estimated using a pedotransfer function from baritz et al 2010 the norwegian forest soil profiles have shallow soil depth in general fig 3a only about 20 of the soil profiles are deeper than 80 cm 50 are deeper than 50 cm and 80 of the soil profiles are deeper than 20 cm another major characteristic is that most forest soils belong to sand soils according to the classification by riley 1996 for norwegian soils fig 3b 3 1 3 comparison between the norwegian forest soil profiles and global soil data based on the characteristics of the soil profile depth we converted the global soil data and profile data into three layers layer 1 0 20 cm layer 2 20 50 cm and layer 3 50 80 cm to maximize the use of the profile information as a result there are about 80 50 and 20 of soil profiles available to compare with the global soil data for layer 1 2 and 3 respectively we extracted soil property information from the converted global soil data at the exact locations of the profiles and compared them pairwise four key properties sand clay silt content and bulk density g cm3 which are available for all profiles are included in the comparison three statistic criteria were used mean error me root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 these statistics were also used in the comparison between global soil data and global soil profiles dai et al 2019 3 2 hydrological modelling in this study we selected one process based eco hydrological model soil and water integrated model swim and one land surface model the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate river discharges and soil moisture these models were widely used in hydrological modelling for large scale catchments worldwide and were capable to reproduce river discharges satisfactorily huang et al 2017 in addition they differ substantially in model structure process description and spatial resolution of input data so that we can analyse whether the effects of soil input data differ between the models lumped conceptual models were not considered in this study because they often do not require detailed and spatially distributed soil information 3 2 1 swim swim krysanova et al 1998 is an ecohydrological semi distributed model of intermediate complexity it was developed based on swat 1993 arnold et al 1993 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 for meso and macro scale catchments it is driven by six meteorological parameters at daily timesteps mean maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation swim has a three level scheme of spatial disaggregation that is the basin sub basins and hydrotopes the hydrotopes are sets of elementary units in a sub basin with homogeneous soil and land use types to simulate water flows in this study we created regular grid sub basins at a size of 1 km2 based on the universal transverse mercator utm zone 33 n coordinate system corresponding to the meteorological forcing data at the same resolution there are up to five hydrotopes in each sub basin with a mean hydrotope area of 0 38 km2 lateral transport of water towards the river network is simulated on the basis of linear storage functions after reaching the river system water is routed along the river network to the outlet of the basin using the muskingum flow routing method maidment 1993 since the sub basin is gridded based and the sub basin size is small in this study the muskingum method can be unstable to rout the runoff from each sub basin to overcome this problem we superimposed the official river network map on the sub basins and rout the accumulated runoff from a set of sub basins which form larger sub basins based on the river network the simulated hydrological system consists of four control volumes the soil surface the root zone of soil the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer the soil root zone is subdivided into several layers in accordance with the soil database the water balance for the soil surface and soil column includes precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and percolation the water balance for the shallow aquifer includes groundwater recharge capillary rise to the soil profile lateral flow and percolation to the deep aquifer surface runoff is estimated as a non linear function of precipitation and a retention coefficient which depends on soil water content land use and soil type modification of the soil conservation service scs curve number method arnold et al 1990 lateral subsurface flow is calculated simultaneously with percolation and occurs when the storage in the soil layer exceeds field capacity after percolation potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated using the method of priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 actual evaporation from soil and actual transpiration by plants are calculated separately an extended degree day method is used to compute snowmelt huang et al 2013 the percolation from the soil profile to the shallow aquifer is corrected by the delay time function proposed by sangrey et al 1984 3 2 2 vic vic liang et al 1994 version 4 2 d is a semi distributed hydrological model for large scale applications solving both the surface energy balance and water balance equations in this study the model was run in so called water balance mode where the energy balance is solved only when snow is present the land surface processes are modelled at a grid of large cells 0 25 in this study to compare with the global soil moisture products which can be subdivided into several tiles based on land cover types and elevation classes the fluxes and storages from the tiles are averaged together based on the weights of area fraction to give grid cell average the routing of water flow is performed using the unit hydrograph principle the daily meteorological forcing data used in this study are maximum and minimum temperature precipitation longwave radiation shortwave radiation atmospheric pressure vapor pressure and wind speed pet is calculated using the penman monteith equation an energy balance approach is used to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 and the model contains an explicit canopy snow scheme there are typically 3 soil layers the top layer is usually 10 cm to ensure reasonable calculation of evaporation from the soil in this layer surface runoff and infiltration are controlled by variable infiltration capacity parameterization and soil evaporation is calculated by arno formulation francini and pacciani 1991 the middle layer mainly conveys water to the next layer and the last soil layer generates base flow using the arno baseflow formulation francini and pacciani 1991 all layers within the root zone can lose moisture due to evapotranspiration 3 2 3 model input data the digital elevation model dem soil type and land cover type maps with 1 km horizontal resolution are required to setup the hydrological models in this study the dem map is obtained from the norwegian mapping authority and the swedish national land survey the soil type maps are required for swim and are available from the wise30sec and soilgrids databases the soil type map of wise30sec shows that there are 72 soil types in norway while the soilgrids database estimates 11 most probable soil types in norway since the soil properties of each most probable soil type vary between grids we decided not to use the most probable soil types from the soilgrids database but reclassify the soils based on primary soil properties clay sand and silt content organic matter nitrogen content and bulk density for all grid cells in norway using the k mean clustering method hartigan and wong 1979 as a result we reclassified 70 soil types for the soilgrids data to have a comparable number of soil types as in wise30sec the mean values of soil properties for each new class represent the characteristics of the corresponding soil type besides the primary soil properties available in the soil database the hydrological models need information on soil parameters such as available water capacity hydraulic conductivity etc we estimated these parameters using the pedotransfer functions by woesten et al 1999 which were developed for european soils using clay silk content organic matter and bulk density as input these functions show the overall best performance among the parameter pedotransfer functions for norwegian soils kværno and haugen 2011 land use information was compiled from the national land resource map ahlstrøm et al 2014 and the remote sensing based forest resource map sat skog gjertsen and nilsen 2012 supplemented by corine land cover 2000 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2000 raster 4 for small upstream areas outside the norwegian borders the land cover classification distinguishes eight general land use types open area bog built up cropland heather bedrock lake permanent ice and snow and 12 structural forest types the forest types are based on a classification scheme developed by majasalmi et al 2018 for fennoscandian forests which consists of three species groups spruce pine and deciduous dominated with four structural subgroups each and are applied here to better reflect spatial variability in hydrologically relevant land surface properties within forested areas relevant parameters for each forest type are provided by majasalmi et al 2018 maximum leaf area index in growing seasons and vegetation height and bright et al 2018 shortwave albedo the

hysn2018v2005era5 https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5947547 is based on era5 and senorge2018 v20 05 the measured discharge data at the gauges elverum losna and polmak is used to calibrate and validate the hydrological models the daily discharge data has been quality checked by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve and it is continuously available for the period 1995 to 2019 3 2 4 model calibration ideally the hydrological models should be calibrated against in situ soil moisture measurements when the target variable is soil water however in situ soil moisture measurements in norway are sparse and the data quality is hardly controlled hence we calibrated the hydrological models against discharge at the outlet of the catchments in the period 1995 2004 the first year of simulation was used for model spin up the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 was applied to identify the parameterization for each catchment independently dds is a stochastic based global search algorithm and designed for calibration problems with many parameters in this study we calibrated 11 parameters in the swim model two parameters related to potential evaporation two related to groundwater flow two related to soil percolation and saturated conductivity three related to snow melt and two related to routing for the vic model there are in total nine calibration parameters four related to soil infiltration and base flow processes two related to soil depths and three related to snow melt detailed information about the calibration parameters is presented in the appendix we selected nash sutcliffe efficiency nse on daily streamflow and its logarithm lnse as the criteria to calibrate the models these two criteria can show the model performance in terms of both high and low flows and thus reflect soil functions such as the partitioning of precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration base flow and the control of water availability for evapotranspiration since dds tries to minimize the objective function θ we formulated θ as an equally weighted combination of the differences between the criteria results and their ideal values 1 for nse and lnse eq 1 1 θ 1 n s e 1 l n s e for each catchment the hydrological models were calibrated twice using the same meteorological forcing data the same calibration parameters and their ranges and the same objective function the only difference is the prescribed soil input data which is based on either soilgrids or wise30sec data 3 3 evaluation 2 discharge evaluation of discharge is mainly based on the statistic criteria nse lnse and the percent bias of water balance pbias on daily and monthly streamflow at the outlet gauges in the validation period 2005 2019 in addition visual inspection of monthly hydrographs helps to evaluate model performance in terms of seasonal dynamics 3 4 evaluation 3 soil moisture three global soil moisture products were compared to simulated soil moisture from the hydrological models they include one solely satellite based product the european space agency climate change initiative plus soil moisture esa cci sm gruber et al 2019 and two products from models with satellite data assimilation era5 hersbach et al 2020 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5b martens et al 2017 these products are publicly available and show comparable performance compared with more than 800 in situ soil moisture measurements worldwide beck et al 2021 3 4 1 esa cci sm product the most recent esa cci sm product is the esa cci sm v06 1 published in 2021 and it is the most accurate esa cci sm product at present the combined esa cci sm product is a merged data from various satellites including three active and ten passive satellites it provides long term global data from 1978 to 2020 at a regular grid of 0 25 in this study we only applied the data after 2015 because one of the newest satellites the soil moisture active passive smap satellite provides data from 2015 since the soil moisture measured by satellites only represents the condition of top 2 3 cm soil layer we calculated the soil wetness index swi eq 2 on the satellite time series using the exponential smoothing filter wagner et al 1999 to compare with the hydrological model outputs for the top 10 cm soil layer 2 s w i t n i n sm sat t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t where smsat m3 m3 is the soil moisture retrieval at day ti t represents the time lag constant and was set to 5 days following pellarin et al 2006 the swi at time tn was only calculated if 1 retrievals were available in the interval tn t tn and 3 retrievals were available in the interval tn 3 t tn t 3 4 2 era5 era5 is the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis compared to previous generation reanalysis era5 provides an enhanced number of output parameters at spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution from 1979 to present era5 includes an advanced land data assimilation system to analyse land surface prognostic variables it applies the soil texture data from the digital soil map of the world and derived soil properties fao 2003 and ascat soil moisture data for data assimilation the output of volume of water in soil layer 1 0 7 cm is used for comparison in this study 3 4 3 gleam gleam is a set of algorithms estimating terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from satellite data from 1980 to 2020 at 0 25⁰ resolution it uses the esa cci sm v5 3 for data assimilation the soil properties used in gleam come from the database of global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics generated by igbp dis global soil data task group 2000 the surface layer of gleam 0 10 cm is used for comparison 3 4 4 evaluation approach since satellite soil moisture products often do not provide any information when soil is frozen or snow covered we compared the data only in july and august when the ground is snow free in all catchments similar to previous studies e g beck et al 2021 we used the pearson correlation coefficient r to calculate the correlations between the original soil moisture products and the simulated soil moisture for the satellite product we only calculated the correlations if more than 200 soil moisture estimates were available the simulated soil moisture by swim was aggregated to the grid resolution of the vic model 0 25 and the soil moisture products to make the comparison consistent in addition we calculated r for the low and high frequency fluctuations of the soil moisture time series as suggested by gruber et al 2020 the low frequency fluctuations are the average soil moisture time series using a 30 day central moving window the moving average was calculated when more than 21 days with values were available in the 30 day window the high frequency fluctuations were calculated by subtracting the low frequency fluctuations from the original time series 4 results 4 1 evaluation 1 soil characteristics table 3 shows all statistical results for three soil layers between the norwegian forest soil profiles and the extracted soil properties at the profile locations from soilgrids and wise30sec in general both soil databases underestimate sand content and overestimate clay content in all layers soilgrids has better accuracy than wise30sec for layer 1 and layer 2 shown by me and rmse but wise30sec shows smaller me and rmse for layer 3 in terms of sand and silt content the mes are less than 10 for all particle size properties in both soil databases the mes of sand silt and clay content in soilgrids are less than 5 in the upper two layers and the mes of silt content are always less than 5 for all layers in both databases however the rmses of sand and silt content are larger than 10 in both soil databases for all layers indicating considerable errors at individual points in addition table 3 shows that there are poor correlations r2 less than 0 1 between the global soil data and the soil profiles for all studied soil properties the high rmses and poor correlations are attributed to poor representation of both spatial and magnitude variation in the global soil data fig 4 shows the errors of sand content in layer 1 and layer 3 as an example the random spatial distributions of the errors indicate no clear error pattern in both soil databases and layers because the measured soil properties can differ substantially between adjacent profiles and the global soil data cannot capture such high spatial variability in addition fig 5 shows that the measured soil properties are much more heterogeneous than the estimates from the global soil databases for example the measured sand content ranges from 5 to 100 while the estimates from the global soil databases spread mainly between 40 and 80 bulk density which represents the soil morphological properties and is an indicator of soil porosity also shows discrepancies between the global data and the estimates for the forest soil profiles both soil databases overestimate the bulk density for all layers except soilgrids for layer 1 table 3 the largest overestimation is found for layer 3 with me of 0 14 and 0 3 g cm3 for soilgrids and wise30sec respectively the rmse for both soil databases and all layers are larger than 0 5 g cm3 which equals to about 19 of the particle density normally assumed to be 2 65 g cm3 the high rmse and poor correlation results indicate that both global databases have significant biases compared with individual profiles hence the estimated soil water properties based on the global databases can be uncertain for hydrological modelling at small scales however the small me results indicate that the global soil databases may still be capable to provide reasonable aggregated estimates for large grid cells or large catchments especially for topsoil layers therefore evaluations 2 and 3 only focus on the results at catchment and large grid scales in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of model calibration results the swim and vic models were set up for each catchment separately for swim two soil property data were generated based on the global soil databases in addition there are two hydrotope input files for each catchment which include different soil type information corresponding to the soil property data for vic two soil input files were prepared for each catchment since soilgrids outperforms wise30sec mainly for topsoil we assumed that both databases had similar reliability as input for macro scale hydrological modelling and calibrated each model for each catchment using different soil input files separately the aim of the comparison is to investigate which soil database supports a better model performance in terms of discharge table 4 lists the calibration results in terms of nse lnse and pbias in general both models can reproduce the daily discharge well with nse lnse larger than 0 74 and absolute pbias less than 10 except vic using wise30sec for polmak catchment these results confirm that the global soil databases can be a good alternative for use in macro scale hydrological modelling in norway 4 3 evaluation 2 simulated discharge we mainly compared the effects of soil data input in the validation period table 4 for swim the absolute pbias are good less than5 for all catchments with both soil databases but the nse and lnse show different model performance depending on the characteristics of catchments and the choice of soil databases swim performs well with daily nse lnse greater than 0 8 for the losna catchment regardless which soil database is applied probably due to the large portion of bedrock in this catchment for the other two catchments swim performs generally better with soilgrids data than with wise30sec the daily nse and lnse using soilgrids are larger than the ones using wise30sec by 0 05 0 09 except the nse for polmak while the monthly nse and lnse using soilgrids are larger than the ones using wise30sec by up to 0 08 different from the swim results the simulated discharge by vic shows no significant difference in both daily and monthly nse and lnse 0 03 between the two soil input databases for the losna and elverum catchments however there are large negative pbias down to 13 for these catchments for the polmak catchment vic has better model performance using soilgrids than using wise30sec especially for low flows fig 6 illustrates the comparison between observed and simulated long term mean monthly discharge in the validation period similar to the results above there is almost no difference between simulations driven by the two soil databases for swim on long term mean monthly discharges at losna for the other two catchments there are mainly differences in the peaks in may vic reproduces similar hydrographs with both soil data for all three catchments except in late summer for polmak 4 4 evaluation 3 soil moisture the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for each grid cell between the simulated outputs and the soil moisture products from 2015 to 2019 fig 7 summarizes the results of r for all grid cells which have more than 80 of the cell area within the catchment boundaries it shows that both the swim and vic outputs have much better correlation with the era5 and gleam products than the esa cci sm data and the swim outputs have better agreements with the era5 products than the vic ones since the objective of this study is to evaluate the differences between the global soil databases rather than between the soil moisture products or hydrological models we only focus on the difference of r between soilgrids and wise30sec in the following results for swim the soil moisture outputs using soilgrids have generally higher correlations with all original soil moisture products and their low frequency fluctuations than the outputs using wise30sec the differences of median r for the original data are less than 0 03 while the differences of median r for the low frequency fluctuations range from 0 03 to 0 09 between soilgrids and wise30sec in contrast the median r for the high frequency fluctuations using wise30sec is higher than the median r using soilgrids by up to 0 04 when compared with era5 and gleam however the correlations for the high frequency fluctuations between the simulated and era5 gleam data are generally poorer than the correlations for the original data and low frequency fluctuations for vic the soil moisture outputs using wise30sec have higher correlations with all global soil moisture products than the outputs using soilgrids except for the gleam high frequency fluctuations the differences of median r between the two soil databases are most pronounced when the simulated results are compared with the esa cci sm data up to 0 05 the differences of median r between the soil databases are less than 0 03 when compared with the era5 and gleam outputs figs 8 and 9 illustrate the results of r between the swim vic outputs and the original soil moisture products for each grid cell to identify the regions with poor model performance interestingly there are no distinct spatial distribution of r between soilgrids and wise30sec except in the upper part of the polmak catchment for swim outputs in fig 8 the swim outputs show good correlation r greater than 0 7 with the era5 data for all grids poor correlations r less than 0 3 are mainly found in most part of the elverum catchment the upper part of the losna catchment and the lower part of the polmak catchment between the simulated soil moisture and the esa cci sm data the swim soil moisture data does not agree well with the gleam data r less than 0 5 in the upper part of the losna catchment the vic outputs have different correlations with the global soil moisture products in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude compared with the swim outputs fig 9 the outputs using wise30sec have higher correlations with era5 than the ones using soilgrids in the lower part of elverum and the upper part of polmak the correlations with the esa cci data are lower than 0 3 in most grids in eastern norway and the lower part of polmak especially using soilgrids as input the correlations with the gleam data are generally good in the polmak catchment using both soil input data but are poor in the upper part of the losna catchment using the soilgrids data 5 discussion 5 1 data quality this study used a three step evaluation on two global soil databases and their effects on discharge and soil moisture simulations such multiple step evaluation gives valuable information on soil data quality and serves as a basis for selecting input data for macro scale hydrological or land surface modelling in general the approach chosen in this study corresponds to the enhanced calibration validation strategies for hydrological modelling suggested by krysanova et al 2018 i e to evaluate the quality of input data and consider the uncertainty of input data before model calibration however it should be acknowledged that the benchmark data used in this study also contain several weaknesses and uncertainties one of the important benchmark datasets in this study is the norwegian forest soil database the profiles provide a good spatial distribution of soil properties because forest is one of the dominant land covers in norway however the forest soil profiles cannot represent the soil conditions for other land use types for example the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi weynants et al 2013 shows that there is more clay and silt content in norwegian agricultural soils than in forest soils and more than half of the agricultural soil profiles are deeper than 1 m the disadvantage of the eu hydi is lack of sufficient information on the norwegian profile locations and thus it cannot be applied for pairwise comparison as done in this study the global soil moisture products are another benchmark data in this study compared with the in situ soil moisture measurements they do not perform adequately for all climate vegetation cover and topographic conditions beck et al 2021 showed that all three products used in this study have weaker performance in cold climate than in temperate climate another global assessment of various satellite surface soil moisture products has also shown low correlations median r ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 with in situ soil moisture measurements in subarctic climate ma et al 2019 in addition it is challenging to correctly derive soil moisture data from satellites in dense vegetation areas and steep terrain beck et al 2021 blyverket et al 2019 these problems increase the uncertainty of satellite products for norway especially in forested and mountainous regions given the large uncertainties of the global soil moisture products we did not focus on the individual model performance in terms of soil moisture but aimed to compare the effects of different soil property data on hydrological modelling the results of this study show that the most updated global soil data still contain considerable discrepancies at point or small scales in norway in comparison with data from local soil profiles one probable reason is that the global soil data were derived based on a global database of soil profiles and the percentage of norwegian soil profiles is minor for example norwegian soil profiles account for only 0 2 in the most recent world soil profile database batjes et al 2020 hence the estimated soil properties in norway can be influenced by soil profiles from other parts of the world especially using the linkage method in addition there are fewer data for soil physical than soil chemical attributes and fewer measurements for deeper than for surficial horizons in most of the soil profile data worldwide batjes et al 2020 the estimation methods also play an important role for the underestimation of spatial variation in soil properties in the global databases the soil properties in soilgrids vary smoothly within small areas due to the grid based spatially continuous estimation while the soil properties in wise30sec are constant within each soil type polygon soil depth can also be a source of uncertainty in the swim simulations the soil depth in the global databases is always 2 m but we only applied the data in the top 1 m soil because of the shallow soil depths indicated by the norwegian forest soil profiles the prescribed soil depth of 1 m should be appropriate to simulate the three catchments in this study because the calibrated soil depths in vic range from 0 9 to 1 2 m however this prescribed soil depth may not be appropriate for other catchments and it can be improved in the future with variable soil depths based on the bedrock depth information pelletier et al 2016 finally we should keep in mind that lack of national soil property maps and in situ soil moisture measurements are major obstacles for soil moisture studies in norway we failed to bias correct the global soil data based on the forest profiles because the profiles contain much larger heterogeneity in space and magnitude than the global data in addition a soil moisture network and quality controlled data are expected to improve the understanding of soil water processes in norway 5 2 uncertainty of hydrological modelling in this study swim using soilgrids shows a better performance in terms of river discharge and soil moisture than using wise30sec for most cases vic using wise30sec tends to give better soil moisture estimations than using soilgrids but the effects of soil input data on vic are not as strong as on swim the different effects of soil input data on the hydrological models can be attributed to the prescribed vs calibrated soil parameters the land surface processes model resolution and catchment characteristics firstly there is less freedom for swim to change soil water processes than for vic during calibration for swim there are six layer prescribed soil information including depth clay sand silt bulk density porosity available water content field capacity and saturated conductivity among them only the saturated conductivity can be corrected globally during calibration in contrast there are only three soil layers in vic including the prescribed information such as bulk density saturated conductivity and soil moisture content at critical and wilting points there are four calibration parameters to adjust infiltration and base flow simulations due the different number of prescribed and calibrated parameters the prescribed soil data play a bigger role on swim than on vic for soil water secondly the simulated land surface fluxes such as evaporation and snow melt can dominate the simulation of soil moisture and discharge compared with soil parameters in some cases for example snow scheme parameters are probably more important than soil scheme parameters during the snow melt season because they directly control the amount of water above ground the degree day factor snow scheme in swim is calibrated to match snowmelt whereas the energy balance snow scheme in vic is not calibrated and hence it is more difficult to match snowmelt that infiltrates into soil thirdly the loss of topographic variability in the vic due to grid cell size 0 25 can also contribute to weaker model performance in terms of discharge vic accounts for subgrid scale variability in atmospheric forcings which reduces its sensitivity to spatial scale compared to using cell averaged forcings at coarse spatial resolutions haddeland et al 2002 boone et al 2004 however 0 25 spatial resolution is most likely too coarse to capture all relevant processes in these catchments magnusson et al 2019 found that there is an increasing error with spatial resolution for snow water equivalent simulations in norway using the flexible snow model especially between 1 km and other coarse resolutions in addition the aggregated soil information at large grid cells may also reduce the differences between the two global soil databases and thus diminish the effects of soil input data on hydrological modelling in contrast the sub basin size for swim is only 1 km2 so that the model can use the input data directly without a loss in spatial variability of the meteorological topographic and soil information fourthly the effects of soil input data are also dependent on the characteristics of the study areas for bedrock dominant regions such as the losna catchment the soil information is less important than for other catchments irrespective of the hydrological model used because a large share of rainfall and snowmelt will form surface runoff on impermeable surfaces hence the criteria for selecting soil input data should consider the characteristics of both models and study areas for the more physically based soil modules such as in swim it is highly recommended to evaluate the quality of the soil data to reduce the input data uncertainty lastly we should acknowledge that the calibration against only river discharge at the outlet of catchments may lead to equifinality problems for the calibrated parameters however the aim of this study is not to provide the best simulations for the three catchments but to compare the effects of different global soil data as input such global calibration at a single point allows us to detect the potential problems of the spatial distribution in the soil input data while calibration at several intermediate gauges might hide the problems of input data by tuning the calibration parameters for different regions separately 6 summary and conclusions in this study we evaluated two state of the art global soil databases soilgrids and wise30sec and their effects on macro scale hydrological modelling in norway in three steps firstly we compared soil texture and bulk density between the norwegian forest soil profiles and the global data at the same locations the results show that soilgrids has smaller mes than wise30sec for all soil properties in the upper soil layers and for bulk density and clay content in the deep soil layer however both soil databases have large rmse greater than 10 for sand and silt content and greater than 0 5 g cm3 for bulk density and poor correlations r2 less than 0 1 mainly because they cannot capture the high spatial and magnitude variability in physical soil properties found in the local soil profiles secondly we evaluated the effects of different soil input data on river discharge simulations for three macro scale catchments in norway using one process based hydrological model swim and one land surface model vic swim generally performs better using the soilgrids data as input than using the wise30sec data with higher nse and lnse by up to 0 09 in most cases the vic outputs are not sensitive to soil input data for the two catchments in eastern norway with marginal differences in nse and lnse 0 03 between the simulations based on two soil databases for the snowmelt dominated polmak catchment vic performs better using soilgrids than using wise30sec especially for low flows thirdly we compared simulated soil moisture with three global soil moisture products one from a merged satellite product esa cci sm v6 1 and two from global models with data assimilation era5 and gleam at grid cells of 0 25 for swim the soil moisture outputs based on soilgrids have generally higher correlations with original soil moisture data and their low frequency fluctuations than the outputs based on wise30sec the differences in median r are up to 0 09 between the simulations based on two soil databases in contrast vic simulated soil moisture using wise30sec has higher correlations with the era5 and gleam data than using soilgrids by up to 0 05 in terms of median r based on the three step evaluation we can conclude that 1 the global soil databases are capable to provide reasonable soil property information at coarse resolutions for macro scale hydrological modelling in norway but they can introduce considerable errors at point or small scales 2 soilgrids contains smaller mean errors when compared with the norwegian forest soil database and supports better model performance than wise30sec in terms of discharge and soil moisture in most cases simulated by swim 3 both global soil databases can be used for vic as input and the selection should be based on the study of interest and the characteristics of study area the results of this study can serve as a basis for other macro scale hydrological or land surface models to select the soil input data for norwegian studies the multi step evaluation can also be applied for other geographic regions and is highly recommended for soil process based models such as swim in the applications with poor local soil information in addition this study evokes the

3341,lack of national soil property maps limits the studies of soil moisture sm dynamics in norway one alternative is to apply the global soil data as input for macro scale hydrological modelling but the quality of these data is still unknown the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate two recent global soil databases wise30sec and soilgrids in comparison with data from local soil profiles 2 to evaluate which database supports better model performance in terms of river discharge and sm for three macro scale catchments in norway and 3 to suggest criteria for the selection of soil data for models with different complexity the global soil databases were evaluated in three steps 1 the global soil data are compared directly with the norwegian forest soil profiles 2 the simulated discharge based on the two global soil databases is compared with observations and 3 the simulated sm is compared with three global sm products two hydrological models were applied to simulate discharge and sm the soil and water integrated model swim and the variable infiltration capacity vic model the comparison with data from local soil profiles shows that soilgrids has smaller mean errors than wise30sec especially for upper soil layers but both soil databases have large root mean squared errors and poor correlations swim generally performs better in terms of discharge using soilgrids than using wise30sec and the simulated sm has higher correlations with the sm products in contrast the vic model is less sensitive to soil input data and the simulated sm using wise30sec is higher correlated with the sm products than using soilgrids based on the results we conclude that the global soil databases can provide reasonable soil property information at coarse resolutions and large areas the selection of soil input data should depend on the characteristics of both models and study areas keywords soil moisture norwegian forest soil profile soilgrids wise30sec esa cci sm era5 gleam 1 introduction soil moisture is a key mediator between atmosphere and hydrosphere which determines the amount of water available for evapotranspiration from land influencing precipitation and air temperature as feedback seneviratne et al 2010 in addition it affects streamflow and groundwater recharge via partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration in the hydrological cycle orth and seneviratne 2013 despite its importance soil moisture is rarely studied in norway especially for macro scale catchments one major obstacle is lack of national wide soil property information for hydrological or land surface models global soil databases are often considered as alternative soil property information for large scale modelling and for regions with poor local data for example the fao unesco soil map of the world fao 2003 and the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 are applied as standard inputs in soil and water assessment tool swat model abbaspour et al 2019 dai et al 2019 reviewed the global soil databases used by the land surface models within the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 the widely used databases were the fao unesco soil map of the world hwsd the data and information system of international geosphere biosphere programme igbp dis database global soil data task group 2000 the global soil dataset for earth system model gsde shangguan et al 2014 etc all global soil property databases are generated from soil surveys by one of two general methods dai et al 2019 the linkage method batjes 2003 linking soil profiles and soil mapping units in soil type maps and the digital soil mapping method mcbratney et al 2003 using state of art machine learning methods to map the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe the soil databases produced by the linkage methods are polygon based due to the shape of soil type maps while the soil databases derived by digital soil mapping provide gridded spatially continuous estimates thus the soil databases produced by these methods give distinctively different distribution of soil properties dai et al 2019 also compared four global soil databases with 94 441 soil profiles from the world soil information service wosis they found that the soilgrids system hengl et al 2017 one of the most recently developed databases using the digital soil mapping method had much better accuracy than hwsd igbp dis and gsde which were developed using the traditional linkage method tifafi et al 2018 compared the soil carbon stock estimates based on the global soil databases with field measurements they also found that soilgrids had smaller errors than the world inventory of soil emission potentials database at a resolution of 30 s wise30sec batjes 2016 which is an improved version of hwsd so far there are limited studies that compared the effects of different soil input data on hydrological or land surface modelling and evaluations of the new generation of global soil databases are rare several studies reported improved model performance in terms of specific hydrological processes such as soil moisture and river discharge with better soil information and at higher resolutions sheshukov et al 2011 guillod et al 2013 de lannoy et al 2014 livneh et al 2015 analysed the sensitivities of different soil input data in the mhm model for the mississippi catchment and concluded that the choice of soil textural properties for a single model can be an appreciable source of uncertainty in contrast ye et al 2011 and mukundan et al 2010 found that the improved high resolution data did not necessarily improve the streamflow simulation using swat model hence the effect of soil input data can be specific for different models soil data as well as study areas all the studies mentioned above mainly compared the simulated river discharge with observations and inter compared the simulated hydrological processes driven by different soil input data the simulated soil moisture was rarely validated against observations probably due to the lack of soil moisture measurements especially at catchment scales to fill this gap satellite derived soil moisture products have become one important source of surface soil moisture observations in recent years and they can be used to calibrate hydrological models for ungauged catchments choi et al 2021 or to validate model performance in terms of soil moisture kearney maino 2018 in addition the satellite derived soil moisture products are often assimilated in land surface or hydrological models to improve the root zone moisture simulations at large scales renzullo et al 2014 tian et al 2019 based on the advances in observation data kearney maino 2018 assessed the application of the new generation of global soil data in an infiltration and redistribution model and compared the model outputs with both in situ soil moisture measurements and satellite derived soil moisture product their results demonstrated the advantages of using the new global soil data for modelling soil moisture at fine spatial and temporal resolution for australia and encouraged the applications of the new databases for other regions in this study we evaluated two recent global soil property databases wise30sec and soilgrids generated by different mapping methods for macro scale hydrological modelling in norway to the best of our knowledge we are the first to compare these two databases with respect to their utility for hydrological modelling and it is the first study that focuses on macro scale soil properties and soil moisture simulations in norway different from the previous studies we applied two hydrological models to account for the uncertainties caused by different model structures modelling resolutions and descriptions of hydrological processes in addition we used a three step procedure to systematically evaluate the global soil databases the benchmark data is not only the observed discharge but also the norwegian forest soil database and three global soil moisture products thus the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate two recent global soil databases wise30sec and soilgrids in comparison with data from local soil profiles 2 to evaluate which database supports better model performance in terms of river discharge and soil moisture for three macro scale catchments in norway and 3 to suggest criteria for the selection of soil data for macro scale hydrological modelling 2 study area norway is located in northern europe and covers an area of about 325 000 km2 the mainland can be divided into 6 geographic regimes finnmark nordland trøndelag western norway eastern norway and southern norway fig 1 a about half of the land area is covered by bedrock and heather poor shrub vegetations in high mountains and about 38 of the area is covered by forest in this study we selected three macro scale catchments with the drainage areas larger than 10 000 km2 from the norwegian flood forecasting system ruan langsholt 2017 where human activities do not significantly influence the discharge at the outlet these catchments are the upper lågen river above the gauging station losna id 2 145 11 206 km2 the upper glomma river above the gauging station elverum id 2 604 15 450 km2 and the tana river above the gauging station polmak id 234 18 14 170 km2 fig 1 both the losna and elverum catchments are located in eastern norway and the polmak catchment is partly located in finnmark and partly in sweden the three catchments span a range of climatic hydrological and geographic conditions table 1 the losna catchment is located at the highest altitude among the three and it receives the largest annual precipitation amount about 90 of the precipitation in this catchment ends up as runoff due to the cold climate steep slopes and large area of bedrock the polmak catchment is located in the coldest and northernmost region and it receives the lowest amount of precipitation per year it is also flattest and at the lowest altitudes among the three catchments the elverum catchment is the largest catchment and it has the highest annual temperature above 0 c among the three in both the polmak and elverum catchments about 75 of the precipitation ends up as runoff these three catchments represent the dominant land cover types in norway in the losna catchment heather and bedrock are the dominant land covers ca 50 and forest covers about 25 of the land area in the elverum and polmak catchments more than 50 of the land area is covered by forest and more than 20 of the land is covered by heather in addition due to the large drainage area and distinct locations these catchments contain more than half of quaternary geological conditions in norway according to norway s geological survey 3 data and method in this study we evaluated wise30sec and soilgrids in three steps fig 2 the first step was to compare the global soil data with the norwegian forest soil database in the second and third steps we applied two hydrological models to simulate river discharge and soil moisture using information from the two soil databases separately the simulated discharge was compared with observed discharge step 2 and the simulated soil moisture was compared with three global soil moisture products step 3 in the next subsections the data and methods are described following the workflow shown in fig 2 3 1 evaluation 1 soil characteristics 3 1 1 global soil property databases the main characteristics of the two global soil databases are listed in table 2 wise30sec batjes 2016 is developed based on the traditional linkage method it is an improvement of hwsd as it uses the soil map from hwsd with minor corrections and it incorporates more soil profiles 21 000 profiles than hwsd and climate zone maps as categorical covariates for each soil type it has seven layers up to 200 cm depth 5 20 cm up to 100 cm depth and 2 50 cm up to 200 cm depth with uncertainty estimation the resolution of the data is about 1 km soilgrids hengl et al 2017 is developed using the digital soil mapping method the latest version released in 2020 was produced by fitting an ensemble of machine learning methods based on over 230 000 soil profile observations and a series of environmental covariates covariates were selected from a pool of over 400 environmental layers from earth observation derived products and other environmental information including climate land cover and terrain morphology the outputs of soilgrids are soil properties at six standard depth intervals 5 15 30 60 100 and 200 cm for each grid cell at a resolution of 250 m 3 1 2 norwegian forest soil database the norwegian forest soil database consists of 1040 sampling sites covering forested land on a 9 by 9 km regular grid i e sampling density follows the geographical distribution of forests in norway with fewer sites in the northernmost region central mountain areas and the coastal areas where forest is not the dominant land cover fig 3 profile descriptions soil sampling and lab analysis for each site were carried out in the period 1988 1992 following standardized procedures sveistrup 1984 in total 994 soil profiles provide sufficient data to be included in the analysis i e depth and fine earth fractions sand silt clay for each soil layer bulk density for mineral soil layers is estimated using a pedotransfer function from baritz et al 2010 the norwegian forest soil profiles have shallow soil depth in general fig 3a only about 20 of the soil profiles are deeper than 80 cm 50 are deeper than 50 cm and 80 of the soil profiles are deeper than 20 cm another major characteristic is that most forest soils belong to sand soils according to the classification by riley 1996 for norwegian soils fig 3b 3 1 3 comparison between the norwegian forest soil profiles and global soil data based on the characteristics of the soil profile depth we converted the global soil data and profile data into three layers layer 1 0 20 cm layer 2 20 50 cm and layer 3 50 80 cm to maximize the use of the profile information as a result there are about 80 50 and 20 of soil profiles available to compare with the global soil data for layer 1 2 and 3 respectively we extracted soil property information from the converted global soil data at the exact locations of the profiles and compared them pairwise four key properties sand clay silt content and bulk density g cm3 which are available for all profiles are included in the comparison three statistic criteria were used mean error me root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 these statistics were also used in the comparison between global soil data and global soil profiles dai et al 2019 3 2 hydrological modelling in this study we selected one process based eco hydrological model soil and water integrated model swim and one land surface model the variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate river discharges and soil moisture these models were widely used in hydrological modelling for large scale catchments worldwide and were capable to reproduce river discharges satisfactorily huang et al 2017 in addition they differ substantially in model structure process description and spatial resolution of input data so that we can analyse whether the effects of soil input data differ between the models lumped conceptual models were not considered in this study because they often do not require detailed and spatially distributed soil information 3 2 1 swim swim krysanova et al 1998 is an ecohydrological semi distributed model of intermediate complexity it was developed based on swat 1993 arnold et al 1993 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 for meso and macro scale catchments it is driven by six meteorological parameters at daily timesteps mean maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation swim has a three level scheme of spatial disaggregation that is the basin sub basins and hydrotopes the hydrotopes are sets of elementary units in a sub basin with homogeneous soil and land use types to simulate water flows in this study we created regular grid sub basins at a size of 1 km2 based on the universal transverse mercator utm zone 33 n coordinate system corresponding to the meteorological forcing data at the same resolution there are up to five hydrotopes in each sub basin with a mean hydrotope area of 0 38 km2 lateral transport of water towards the river network is simulated on the basis of linear storage functions after reaching the river system water is routed along the river network to the outlet of the basin using the muskingum flow routing method maidment 1993 since the sub basin is gridded based and the sub basin size is small in this study the muskingum method can be unstable to rout the runoff from each sub basin to overcome this problem we superimposed the official river network map on the sub basins and rout the accumulated runoff from a set of sub basins which form larger sub basins based on the river network the simulated hydrological system consists of four control volumes the soil surface the root zone of soil the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer the soil root zone is subdivided into several layers in accordance with the soil database the water balance for the soil surface and soil column includes precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and percolation the water balance for the shallow aquifer includes groundwater recharge capillary rise to the soil profile lateral flow and percolation to the deep aquifer surface runoff is estimated as a non linear function of precipitation and a retention coefficient which depends on soil water content land use and soil type modification of the soil conservation service scs curve number method arnold et al 1990 lateral subsurface flow is calculated simultaneously with percolation and occurs when the storage in the soil layer exceeds field capacity after percolation potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated using the method of priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 actual evaporation from soil and actual transpiration by plants are calculated separately an extended degree day method is used to compute snowmelt huang et al 2013 the percolation from the soil profile to the shallow aquifer is corrected by the delay time function proposed by sangrey et al 1984 3 2 2 vic vic liang et al 1994 version 4 2 d is a semi distributed hydrological model for large scale applications solving both the surface energy balance and water balance equations in this study the model was run in so called water balance mode where the energy balance is solved only when snow is present the land surface processes are modelled at a grid of large cells 0 25 in this study to compare with the global soil moisture products which can be subdivided into several tiles based on land cover types and elevation classes the fluxes and storages from the tiles are averaged together based on the weights of area fraction to give grid cell average the routing of water flow is performed using the unit hydrograph principle the daily meteorological forcing data used in this study are maximum and minimum temperature precipitation longwave radiation shortwave radiation atmospheric pressure vapor pressure and wind speed pet is calculated using the penman monteith equation an energy balance approach is used to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 and the model contains an explicit canopy snow scheme there are typically 3 soil layers the top layer is usually 10 cm to ensure reasonable calculation of evaporation from the soil in this layer surface runoff and infiltration are controlled by variable infiltration capacity parameterization and soil evaporation is calculated by arno formulation francini and pacciani 1991 the middle layer mainly conveys water to the next layer and the last soil layer generates base flow using the arno baseflow formulation francini and pacciani 1991 all layers within the root zone can lose moisture due to evapotranspiration 3 2 3 model input data the digital elevation model dem soil type and land cover type maps with 1 km horizontal resolution are required to setup the hydrological models in this study the dem map is obtained from the norwegian mapping authority and the swedish national land survey the soil type maps are required for swim and are available from the wise30sec and soilgrids databases the soil type map of wise30sec shows that there are 72 soil types in norway while the soilgrids database estimates 11 most probable soil types in norway since the soil properties of each most probable soil type vary between grids we decided not to use the most probable soil types from the soilgrids database but reclassify the soils based on primary soil properties clay sand and silt content organic matter nitrogen content and bulk density for all grid cells in norway using the k mean clustering method hartigan and wong 1979 as a result we reclassified 70 soil types for the soilgrids data to have a comparable number of soil types as in wise30sec the mean values of soil properties for each new class represent the characteristics of the corresponding soil type besides the primary soil properties available in the soil database the hydrological models need information on soil parameters such as available water capacity hydraulic conductivity etc we estimated these parameters using the pedotransfer functions by woesten et al 1999 which were developed for european soils using clay silk content organic matter and bulk density as input these functions show the overall best performance among the parameter pedotransfer functions for norwegian soils kværno and haugen 2011 land use information was compiled from the national land resource map ahlstrøm et al 2014 and the remote sensing based forest resource map sat skog gjertsen and nilsen 2012 supplemented by corine land cover 2000 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2000 raster 4 for small upstream areas outside the norwegian borders the land cover classification distinguishes eight general land use types open area bog built up cropland heather bedrock lake permanent ice and snow and 12 structural forest types the forest types are based on a classification scheme developed by majasalmi et al 2018 for fennoscandian forests which consists of three species groups spruce pine and deciduous dominated with four structural subgroups each and are applied here to better reflect spatial variability in hydrologically relevant land surface properties within forested areas relevant parameters for each forest type are provided by majasalmi et al 2018 maximum leaf area index in growing seasons and vegetation height and bright et al 2018 shortwave albedo the meteorological forcing data are available at daily time steps and 1 km spatial resolution for all of norway and areas in neighbouring countries draining to norway and cover the period 1960 2020 precipitation and temperature daily mean maximum and minimum are obtained from senorge2018 v20 05 lussana et al 2019 which is an observational gridded dataset wind speed is based on the norwegian reanalysis 10 km nora10 product reistad et al 2011 downward short and longwave radiation relative humidity and surface pressure are estimated using the same methods as when preparing the hysn erlandsen et al 2019 and hysn5 erlandsen et al 2021 datasets hysn is described and compared with surface observations and other data sets in erlandsen et al 2019 the dataset prepared for this study hysn2018v2005era5 https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5947547 is based on era5 and senorge2018 v20 05 the measured discharge data at the gauges elverum losna and polmak is used to calibrate and validate the hydrological models the daily discharge data has been quality checked by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve and it is continuously available for the period 1995 to 2019 3 2 4 model calibration ideally the hydrological models should be calibrated against in situ soil moisture measurements when the target variable is soil water however in situ soil moisture measurements in norway are sparse and the data quality is hardly controlled hence we calibrated the hydrological models against discharge at the outlet of the catchments in the period 1995 2004 the first year of simulation was used for model spin up the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 was applied to identify the parameterization for each catchment independently dds is a stochastic based global search algorithm and designed for calibration problems with many parameters in this study we calibrated 11 parameters in the swim model two parameters related to potential evaporation two related to groundwater flow two related to soil percolation and saturated conductivity three related to snow melt and two related to routing for the vic model there are in total nine calibration parameters four related to soil infiltration and base flow processes two related to soil depths and three related to snow melt detailed information about the calibration parameters is presented in the appendix we selected nash sutcliffe efficiency nse on daily streamflow and its logarithm lnse as the criteria to calibrate the models these two criteria can show the model performance in terms of both high and low flows and thus reflect soil functions such as the partitioning of precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration base flow and the control of water availability for evapotranspiration since dds tries to minimize the objective function θ we formulated θ as an equally weighted combination of the differences between the criteria results and their ideal values 1 for nse and lnse eq 1 1 θ 1 n s e 1 l n s e for each catchment the hydrological models were calibrated twice using the same meteorological forcing data the same calibration parameters and their ranges and the same objective function the only difference is the prescribed soil input data which is based on either soilgrids or wise30sec data 3 3 evaluation 2 discharge evaluation of discharge is mainly based on the statistic criteria nse lnse and the percent bias of water balance pbias on daily and monthly streamflow at the outlet gauges in the validation period 2005 2019 in addition visual inspection of monthly hydrographs helps to evaluate model performance in terms of seasonal dynamics 3 4 evaluation 3 soil moisture three global soil moisture products were compared to simulated soil moisture from the hydrological models they include one solely satellite based product the european space agency climate change initiative plus soil moisture esa cci sm gruber et al 2019 and two products from models with satellite data assimilation era5 hersbach et al 2020 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5b martens et al 2017 these products are publicly available and show comparable performance compared with more than 800 in situ soil moisture measurements worldwide beck et al 2021 3 4 1 esa cci sm product the most recent esa cci sm product is the esa cci sm v06 1 published in 2021 and it is the most accurate esa cci sm product at present the combined esa cci sm product is a merged data from various satellites including three active and ten passive satellites it provides long term global data from 1978 to 2020 at a regular grid of 0 25 in this study we only applied the data after 2015 because one of the newest satellites the soil moisture active passive smap satellite provides data from 2015 since the soil moisture measured by satellites only represents the condition of top 2 3 cm soil layer we calculated the soil wetness index swi eq 2 on the satellite time series using the exponential smoothing filter wagner et al 1999 to compare with the hydrological model outputs for the top 10 cm soil layer 2 s w i t n i n sm sat t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t where smsat m3 m3 is the soil moisture retrieval at day ti t represents the time lag constant and was set to 5 days following pellarin et al 2006 the swi at time tn was only calculated if 1 retrievals were available in the interval tn t tn and 3 retrievals were available in the interval tn 3 t tn t 3 4 2 era5 era5 is the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis compared to previous generation reanalysis era5 provides an enhanced number of output parameters at spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution from 1979 to present era5 includes an advanced land data assimilation system to analyse land surface prognostic variables it applies the soil texture data from the digital soil map of the world and derived soil properties fao 2003 and ascat soil moisture data for data assimilation the output of volume of water in soil layer 1 0 7 cm is used for comparison in this study 3 4 3 gleam gleam is a set of algorithms estimating terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from satellite data from 1980 to 2020 at 0 25⁰ resolution it uses the esa cci sm v5 3 for data assimilation the soil properties used in gleam come from the database of global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics generated by igbp dis global soil data task group 2000 the surface layer of gleam 0 10 cm is used for comparison 3 4 4 evaluation approach since satellite soil moisture products often do not provide any information when soil is frozen or snow covered we compared the data only in july and august when the ground is snow free in all catchments similar to previous studies e g beck et al 2021 we used the pearson correlation coefficient r to calculate the correlations between the original soil moisture products and the simulated soil moisture for the satellite product we only calculated the correlations if more than 200 soil moisture estimates were available the simulated soil moisture by swim was aggregated to the grid resolution of the vic model 0 25 and the soil moisture products to make the comparison consistent in addition we calculated r for the low and high frequency fluctuations of the soil moisture time series as suggested by gruber et al 2020 the low frequency fluctuations are the average soil moisture time series using a 30 day central moving window the moving average was calculated when more than 21 days with values were available in the 30 day window the high frequency fluctuations were calculated by subtracting the low frequency fluctuations from the original time series 4 results 4 1 evaluation 1 soil characteristics table 3 shows all statistical results for three soil layers between the norwegian forest soil profiles and the extracted soil properties at the profile locations from soilgrids and wise30sec in general both soil databases underestimate sand content and overestimate clay content in all layers soilgrids has better accuracy than wise30sec for layer 1 and layer 2 shown by me and rmse but wise30sec shows smaller me and rmse for layer 3 in terms of sand and silt content the mes are less than 10 for all particle size properties in both soil databases the mes of sand silt and clay content in soilgrids are less than 5 in the upper two layers and the mes of silt content are always less than 5 for all layers in both databases however the rmses of sand and silt content are larger than 10 in both soil databases for all layers indicating considerable errors at individual points in addition table 3 shows that there are poor correlations r2 less than 0 1 between the global soil data and the soil profiles for all studied soil properties the high rmses and poor correlations are attributed to poor representation of both spatial and magnitude variation in the global soil data fig 4 shows the errors of sand content in layer 1 and layer 3 as an example the random spatial distributions of the errors indicate no clear error pattern in both soil databases and layers because the measured soil properties can differ substantially between adjacent profiles and the global soil data cannot capture such high spatial variability in addition fig 5 shows that the measured soil properties are much more heterogeneous than the estimates from the global soil databases for example the measured sand content ranges from 5 to 100 while the estimates from the global soil databases spread mainly between 40 and 80 bulk density which represents the soil morphological properties and is an indicator of soil porosity also shows discrepancies between the global data and the estimates for the forest soil profiles both soil databases overestimate the bulk density for all layers except soilgrids for layer 1 table 3 the largest overestimation is found for layer 3 with me of 0 14 and 0 3 g cm3 for soilgrids and wise30sec respectively the rmse for both soil databases and all layers are larger than 0 5 g cm3 which equals to about 19 of the particle density normally assumed to be 2 65 g cm3 the high rmse and poor correlation results indicate that both global databases have significant biases compared with individual profiles hence the estimated soil water properties based on the global databases can be uncertain for hydrological modelling at small scales however the small me results indicate that the global soil databases may still be capable to provide reasonable aggregated estimates for large grid cells or large catchments especially for topsoil layers therefore evaluations 2 and 3 only focus on the results at catchment and large grid scales in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of model calibration results the swim and vic models were set up for each catchment separately for swim two soil property data were generated based on the global soil databases in addition there are two hydrotope input files for each catchment which include different soil type information corresponding to the soil property data for vic two soil input files were prepared for each catchment since soilgrids outperforms wise30sec mainly for topsoil we assumed that both databases had similar reliability as input for macro scale hydrological modelling and calibrated each model for each catchment using different soil input files separately the aim of the comparison is to investigate which soil database supports a better model performance in terms of discharge table 4 lists the calibration results in terms of nse lnse and pbias in general both models can reproduce the daily discharge well with nse lnse larger than 0 74 and absolute pbias less than 10 except vic using wise30sec for polmak catchment these results confirm that the global soil databases can be a good alternative for use in macro scale hydrological modelling in norway 4 3 evaluation 2 simulated discharge we mainly compared the effects of soil data input in the validation period table 4 for swim the absolute pbias are good less than5 for all catchments with both soil databases but the nse and lnse show different model performance depending on the characteristics of catchments and the choice of soil databases swim performs well with daily nse lnse greater than 0 8 for the losna catchment regardless which soil database is applied probably due to the large portion of bedrock in this catchment for the other two catchments swim performs generally better with soilgrids data than with wise30sec the daily nse and lnse using soilgrids are larger than the ones using wise30sec by 0 05 0 09 except the nse for polmak while the monthly nse and lnse using soilgrids are larger than the ones using wise30sec by up to 0 08 different from the swim results the simulated discharge by vic shows no significant difference in both daily and monthly nse and lnse 0 03 between the two soil input databases for the losna and elverum catchments however there are large negative pbias down to 13 for these catchments for the polmak catchment vic has better model performance using soilgrids than using wise30sec especially for low flows fig 6 illustrates the comparison between observed and simulated long term mean monthly discharge in the validation period similar to the results above there is almost no difference between simulations driven by the two soil databases for swim on long term mean monthly discharges at losna for the other two catchments there are mainly differences in the peaks in may vic reproduces similar hydrographs with both soil data for all three catchments except in late summer for polmak 4 4 evaluation 3 soil moisture the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for each grid cell between the simulated outputs and the soil moisture products from 2015 to 2019 fig 7 summarizes the results of r for all grid cells which have more than 80 of the cell area within the catchment boundaries it shows that both the swim and vic outputs have much better correlation with the era5 and gleam products than the esa cci sm data and the swim outputs have better agreements with the era5 products than the vic ones since the objective of this study is to evaluate the differences between the global soil databases rather than between the soil moisture products or hydrological models we only focus on the difference of r between soilgrids and wise30sec in the following results for swim the soil moisture outputs using soilgrids have generally higher correlations with all original soil moisture products and their low frequency fluctuations than the outputs using wise30sec the differences of median r for the original data are less than 0 03 while the differences of median r for the low frequency fluctuations range from 0 03 to 0 09 between soilgrids and wise30sec in contrast the median r for the high frequency fluctuations using wise30sec is higher than the median r using soilgrids by up to 0 04 when compared with era5 and gleam however the correlations for the high frequency fluctuations between the simulated and era5 gleam data are generally poorer than the correlations for the original data and low frequency fluctuations for vic the soil moisture outputs using wise30sec have higher correlations with all global soil moisture products than the outputs using soilgrids except for the gleam high frequency fluctuations the differences of median r between the two soil databases are most pronounced when the simulated results are compared with the esa cci sm data up to 0 05 the differences of median r between the soil databases are less than 0 03 when compared with the era5 and gleam outputs figs 8 and 9 illustrate the results of r between the swim vic outputs and the original soil moisture products for each grid cell to identify the regions with poor model performance interestingly there are no distinct spatial distribution of r between soilgrids and wise30sec except in the upper part of the polmak catchment for swim outputs in fig 8 the swim outputs show good correlation r greater than 0 7 with the era5 data for all grids poor correlations r less than 0 3 are mainly found in most part of the elverum catchment the upper part of the losna catchment and the lower part of the polmak catchment between the simulated soil moisture and the esa cci sm data the swim soil moisture data does not agree well with the gleam data r less than 0 5 in the upper part of the losna catchment the vic outputs have different correlations with the global soil moisture products in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude compared with the swim outputs fig 9 the outputs using wise30sec have higher correlations with era5 than the ones using soilgrids in the lower part of elverum and the upper part of polmak the correlations with the esa cci data are lower than 0 3 in most grids in eastern norway and the lower part of polmak especially using soilgrids as input the correlations with the gleam data are generally good in the polmak catchment using both soil input data but are poor in the upper part of the losna catchment using the soilgrids data 5 discussion 5 1 data quality this study used a three step evaluation on two global soil databases and their effects on discharge and soil moisture simulations such multiple step evaluation gives valuable information on soil data quality and serves as a basis for selecting input data for macro scale hydrological or land surface modelling in general the approach chosen in this study corresponds to the enhanced calibration validation strategies for hydrological modelling suggested by krysanova et al 2018 i e to evaluate the quality of input data and consider the uncertainty of input data before model calibration however it should be acknowledged that the benchmark data used in this study also contain several weaknesses and uncertainties one of the important benchmark datasets in this study is the norwegian forest soil database the profiles provide a good spatial distribution of soil properties because forest is one of the dominant land covers in norway however the forest soil profiles cannot represent the soil conditions for other land use types for example the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi weynants et al 2013 shows that there is more clay and silt content in norwegian agricultural soils than in forest soils and more than half of the agricultural soil profiles are deeper than 1 m the disadvantage of the eu hydi is lack of sufficient information on the norwegian profile locations and thus it cannot be applied for pairwise comparison as done in this study the global soil moisture products are another benchmark data in this study compared with the in situ soil moisture measurements they do not perform adequately for all climate vegetation cover and topographic conditions beck et al 2021 showed that all three products used in this study have weaker performance in cold climate than in temperate climate another global assessment of various satellite surface soil moisture products has also shown low correlations median r ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 with in situ soil moisture measurements in subarctic climate ma et al 2019 in addition it is challenging to correctly derive soil moisture data from satellites in dense vegetation areas and steep terrain beck et al 2021 blyverket et al 2019 these problems increase the uncertainty of satellite products for norway especially in forested and mountainous regions given the large uncertainties of the global soil moisture products we did not focus on the individual model performance in terms of soil moisture but aimed to compare the effects of different soil property data on hydrological modelling the results of this study show that the most updated global soil data still contain considerable discrepancies at point or small scales in norway in comparison with data from local soil profiles one probable reason is that the global soil data were derived based on a global database of soil profiles and the percentage of norwegian soil profiles is minor for example norwegian soil profiles account for only 0 2 in the most recent world soil profile database batjes et al 2020 hence the estimated soil properties in norway can be influenced by soil profiles from other parts of the world especially using the linkage method in addition there are fewer data for soil physical than soil chemical attributes and fewer measurements for deeper than for surficial horizons in most of the soil profile data worldwide batjes et al 2020 the estimation methods also play an important role for the underestimation of spatial variation in soil properties in the global databases the soil properties in soilgrids vary smoothly within small areas due to the grid based spatially continuous estimation while the soil properties in wise30sec are constant within each soil type polygon soil depth can also be a source of uncertainty in the swim simulations the soil depth in the global databases is always 2 m but we only applied the data in the top 1 m soil because of the shallow soil depths indicated by the norwegian forest soil profiles the prescribed soil depth of 1 m should be appropriate to simulate the three catchments in this study because the calibrated soil depths in vic range from 0 9 to 1 2 m however this prescribed soil depth may not be appropriate for other catchments and it can be improved in the future with variable soil depths based on the bedrock depth information pelletier et al 2016 finally we should keep in mind that lack of national soil property maps and in situ soil moisture measurements are major obstacles for soil moisture studies in norway we failed to bias correct the global soil data based on the forest profiles because the profiles contain much larger heterogeneity in space and magnitude than the global data in addition a soil moisture network and quality controlled data are expected to improve the understanding of soil water processes in norway 5 2 uncertainty of hydrological modelling in this study swim using soilgrids shows a better performance in terms of river discharge and soil moisture than using wise30sec for most cases vic using wise30sec tends to give better soil moisture estimations than using soilgrids but the effects of soil input data on vic are not as strong as on swim the different effects of soil input data on the hydrological models can be attributed to the prescribed vs calibrated soil parameters the land surface processes model resolution and catchment characteristics firstly there is less freedom for swim to change soil water processes than for vic during calibration for swim there are six layer prescribed soil information including depth clay sand silt bulk density porosity available water content field capacity and saturated conductivity among them only the saturated conductivity can be corrected globally during calibration in contrast there are only three soil layers in vic including the prescribed information such as bulk density saturated conductivity and soil moisture content at critical and wilting points there are four calibration parameters to adjust infiltration and base flow simulations due the different number of prescribed and calibrated parameters the prescribed soil data play a bigger role on swim than on vic for soil water secondly the simulated land surface fluxes such as evaporation and snow melt can dominate the simulation of soil moisture and discharge compared with soil parameters in some cases for example snow scheme parameters are probably more important than soil scheme parameters during the snow melt season because they directly control the amount of water above ground the degree day factor snow scheme in swim is calibrated to match snowmelt whereas the energy balance snow scheme in vic is not calibrated and hence it is more difficult to match snowmelt that infiltrates into soil thirdly the loss of topographic variability in the vic due to grid cell size 0 25 can also contribute to weaker model performance in terms of discharge vic accounts for subgrid scale variability in atmospheric forcings which reduces its sensitivity to spatial scale compared to using cell averaged forcings at coarse spatial resolutions haddeland et al 2002 boone et al 2004 however 0 25 spatial resolution is most likely too coarse to capture all relevant processes in these catchments magnusson et al 2019 found that there is an increasing error with spatial resolution for snow water equivalent simulations in norway using the flexible snow model especially between 1 km and other coarse resolutions in addition the aggregated soil information at large grid cells may also reduce the differences between the two global soil databases and thus diminish the effects of soil input data on hydrological modelling in contrast the sub basin size for swim is only 1 km2 so that the model can use the input data directly without a loss in spatial variability of the meteorological topographic and soil information fourthly the effects of soil input data are also dependent on the characteristics of the study areas for bedrock dominant regions such as the losna catchment the soil information is less important than for other catchments irrespective of the hydrological model used because a large share of rainfall and snowmelt will form surface runoff on impermeable surfaces hence the criteria for selecting soil input data should consider the characteristics of both models and study areas for the more physically based soil modules such as in swim it is highly recommended to evaluate the quality of the soil data to reduce the input data uncertainty lastly we should acknowledge that the calibration against only river discharge at the outlet of catchments may lead to equifinality problems for the calibrated parameters however the aim of this study is not to provide the best simulations for the three catchments but to compare the effects of different global soil data as input such global calibration at a single point allows us to detect the potential problems of the spatial distribution in the soil input data while calibration at several intermediate gauges might hide the problems of input data by tuning the calibration parameters for different regions separately 6 summary and conclusions in this study we evaluated two state of the art global soil databases soilgrids and wise30sec and their effects on macro scale hydrological modelling in norway in three steps firstly we compared soil texture and bulk density between the norwegian forest soil profiles and the global data at the same locations the results show that soilgrids has smaller mes than wise30sec for all soil properties in the upper soil layers and for bulk density and clay content in the deep soil layer however both soil databases have large rmse greater than 10 for sand and silt content and greater than 0 5 g cm3 for bulk density and poor correlations r2 less than 0 1 mainly because they cannot capture the high spatial and magnitude variability in physical soil properties found in the local soil profiles secondly we evaluated the effects of different soil input data on river discharge simulations for three macro scale catchments in norway using one process based hydrological model swim and one land surface model vic swim generally performs better using the soilgrids data as input than using the wise30sec data with higher nse and lnse by up to 0 09 in most cases the vic outputs are not sensitive to soil input data for the two catchments in eastern norway with marginal differences in nse and lnse 0 03 between the simulations based on two soil databases for the snowmelt dominated polmak catchment vic performs better using soilgrids than using wise30sec especially for low flows thirdly we compared simulated soil moisture with three global soil moisture products one from a merged satellite product esa cci sm v6 1 and two from global models with data assimilation era5 and gleam at grid cells of 0 25 for swim the soil moisture outputs based on soilgrids have generally higher correlations with original soil moisture data and their low frequency fluctuations than the outputs based on wise30sec the differences in median r are up to 0 09 between the simulations based on two soil databases in contrast vic simulated soil moisture using wise30sec has higher correlations with the era5 and gleam data than using soilgrids by up to 0 05 in terms of median r based on the three step evaluation we can conclude that 1 the global soil databases are capable to provide reasonable soil property information at coarse resolutions for macro scale hydrological modelling in norway but they can introduce considerable errors at point or small scales 2 soilgrids contains smaller mean errors when compared with the norwegian forest soil database and supports better model performance than wise30sec in terms of discharge and soil moisture in most cases simulated by swim 3 both global soil databases can be used for vic as input and the selection should be based on the study of interest and the characteristics of study area the results of this study can serve as a basis for other macro scale hydrological or land surface models to select the soil input data for norwegian studies the multi step evaluation can also be applied for other geographic regions and is highly recommended for soil process based models such as swim in the applications with poor local soil information in addition this study evokes the need of national soil property maps and in situ soil moisture measurements especially for small scale modelling studies credit authorship contribution statement shaochun huang conceptualization

3342,as a costliest natural hazard drought profoundly affects water resources agriculture and socio economic sectors in india in spite of large spatio temporal variability in droughts the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts is not examined at local scale over india in this study the meteorological and hydrological variables are obtained at a grid resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india to estimate the time of propagation here five different runoff datasets from era5 fldas gldas meera2 and ncep are collected the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardised runoff index sri are estimated under the influence of external global and regional drivers the drought propagation time is computed in 1170 grids blanketing the entire india based on differences between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe in addition the internal propagation of hydrological drought is estimated with the help of variable motion relationship of speed time process the large duration and more severe hydrological droughts are observed mostly over southern and northern parts of india the drought propagation time varies between 4 and 9 months 9 to 12 months and 15 to 20 months in the cases of δs δp and δe respectively the drought development and recovery duration are computed as 3 1 to 6 months over most of the areas it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of drought development period ddp are also having high value of drought recovery period drp the internal propagation of hydrological drought ranges between the magnitude of 0 4 and 0 6 per month over most of the area in india it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers the present study would provide important drought characteristics at local scale which can assist water managers and policy makers to devise sustainable management practices keywords drought development drought propagation hydrological drought india non stationary 1 introduction in the context of global warming recent years have witnessed the increasing frequency of extreme drought events these events have significant impact on agriculture gupta et al 2020 lobell et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2013 water resources aghakouchak et al 2015 ashraf et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 ecosystem feng et al 2021 fu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and economic sectors frame et al 2020 gao et al 2019 naumann et al 2021 moreover the occurrence of drought events can modulate the onset of another hazard and the compounding effects of such events can increase the risk of the associated impact e g concurrence of drought and heatwave increases the risk of wildfire events aghakouchak et al 2018 fischer et al 2007 a report by wmo 2014 revealed that droughts were accountable for one third of total casualties caused by all the natural hazards and economic losses of 200 billion dollars across the globe during 1970 2012 thus it is crucial to characterize the droughts in order to improve its monitoring management and prediction bevacqua et al 2021 in a broader sense drought can be defined as the below normal availability of water for a period of time that fails to fulfil the human and environmental needs wilhite and pulwarty 2017 in this sense the drought events are classified into four different categories such as i meteorological drought that is associated with the deficit in precipitation ii hydrological drought related to decline in the streamflow iii agricultural drought when there is a deficit in soil moisture iv socio economic drought when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply due to a weather related deficit in water supply in order to identify and characterize different drought events several drought indices have been developed with reference to different drought classifications the standardised precipitation index spi and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei indices are used to monitor meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 similarly for hydrological and agricultural drought classifications standardised runoff index sri and standardised soil moisture index ssi are recommended respectively shukla and wood 2008 xu et al 2018 the socio economic drought is analysed using the socioeconomic drought index sedi and water resources system resilience index wrsri liu et al 2020 shi et al 2018 in the context of causative mechanisms the deficit in the precipitation and increasing evaporative demand propagate through the hydrologic cycle and subsequently developing into a hydrological drought han et al 2019 hellwig et al 2020 van loon 2015 wu et al 2020 in other words from beginning to the end drought transition is encapsulated within the atmosphere hydrology soil vegetation system chen et al 2020 this transition from one form to another form of drought is known as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 haslinger et al 2014 the understanding of drought propagation provides valuable information to improve the accuracy of drought analysis and prediction due to the dual effect of climate change and population growth it is difficult to analyse the spatio temporal evolution of drought however under the limited or no anthropogenic interventions drought propagation is primarily controlled by the climatic factors and biophysical characteristics of the study area van lanen et al 2013 van loon 2015 in recent times studies have performed to analyse the drought propagation mechanisms and their controlling factors apurv and cai 2020 wu et al 2021 the study regarding the drought propagation began in early 2000 for instance stahl 2001 analysed the propagation of drought through the hydrological cycle peters 2003 examined the propagation of drought through groundwater systems by comparing the droughts in time series of groundwater recharge levels and discharge van loon et al 2012 studied the capability of large scale hydrological models to reproduce the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought by considering the ensemble of ten large scale models land surface and global hydrological models likewise propagation study has been carried out over iberian peninsula lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 over china ding et al 2021 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 over united kingdom barker et al 2016 over south korea jehanzaib and kim 2020 sattar et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 over contiguous united states tijdeman et al 2018 over brazil bevacqua et al 2021 over spain barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 over south africa botai et al 2019 over india bhardwaj et al 2020 among others it is found that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought varies with respect to the study area for instance bhardwaj et al 2020 found four to five months for the majority of locations in india and xu et al 2019 noticed that the time of propagation in grassland and forest dominated subbasins varies between 1 5 months and 4 7 months in northern china respectively in addition the factors e g temperature catchment characteristics climate type climate change influencing the drought propagation are studied globally gevaert et al 2018 jehanzaib et al 2020 peña gallardo et al 2019 van loon and laaha 2015 the above said studies did not include the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in developing the drought indices which would affect the drought propagation therefore there is a dearth in understanding the influence of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables in modulating the drought events and subsequently the propagation particularly india is vulnerable to droughts given that growing water demand for industry energy production domestic purposes and water intensive agriculture are significantly stressing india s limited water resources according to the drought early warning system dews and real time drought monitoring platform about 42 based on the data on march 2019 of india s land mass was under various degrees of drought conditions the southern india faced the most severe drought over the past 150 years during 2016 2018 due to the precipitation deficit in the north eastern monsoon mishra et al 2021 since 2015 about 600 million people in india struggle with widespread drought condition roy 2019 thus it has become imperative to analyse how meteorological droughts develop into hydrological droughts when the drought events are linked with the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables in order to develop a robust early warning system in this paper the propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought is examined at gridded scale with a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india the meteorological spei and hydrological sri indices are developed under the influence of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables respectively the large scale climate indices such as indian summer monsoon index ismi southern oscillation index soi sea surface temperature sst indian ocean dipole iod and sahel standardized rainfall ssr are used subsequently the drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological is examined by considering i the time interval between the initiation of meteorological and hydrological drought event ii the time interval between the peaks of those events iii time interval between the terminations of those events in addition a comparative analysis of five different runoff datasets namely ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 famine early warning systems network land data assimilation system fldas global land data assimilation system gldas modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 and national centers for environmental prediction ncep is carried out in order to analyse the variability in the drought propagation time previously propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought over india was performed by bhardwaj et al 2020 at river basin scale however in the present study the propagation analysis is performed at gridded scale under the influence of external factors which was not discussed in bhardwaj et al 2020 in addition bhardwaj et al 2020 considered the drought propagation with respect to the onset of drought events however the present analysis includes the time difference between drought peaks and drought termination of meteorological and hydrological drought event in addition to the drought onset to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is the first of its kind to be carried out over india 2 data used 2 1 meteorological data in the present study the grid wise analysis is carried out at a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india that includes 1170 grid points fig 1 the precipitation pr and temperature temp datasets are available at a grid resolution of 0 25 lat 0 25 lon pai et al 2014 and 1 lat 1 lon srivastava et al 2009 respectively and can be obtained from india meteorological department imd website https www imdpune gov in clim pred lrf new grided data download html the annual precipitation variability over different states in india ranges between 250 mm and 3000 mm similarly the average temperature during winter is around 10 25 c and during summer is around 32 40 c in order to compute potential evapotranspiration pet the meteorological datasets such as wind speed ws relative humidity rh and cloud cover are obtained from ncep reanalysis data kanamitsu et al 2002 and can be downloaded from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis2 html in addition the elevation dataset is obtained from digital elevation map dem obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm it should be noted that the pet is computed using the penman monteith s method allen et al 1994 it is worth mentioning that the pet is computed using the spei package in r environment begueria et al 2017 in order to simplify the analysis and interpretation of outcomes the meteorological datasets are regridded to a common resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon using the bilinear interpolation technique 2 2 runoff datasets it is well understood that the different datasets with different uncertainties would result in different outcomes therefore as discussed in the introduction section the runoff datasets are obtained from five different sources era5 fldas gldas merra 2 and ncep another important reason for choosing the datasets is due to inconsistencies in the continuous available observed streamflow data and difficulty in obtaining the streamflow data over the river basins that share the international boundary with neighbouring countries the above said runoff datasets are obtained at 0 25 lat 0 25 lon

2017 raziei et al 2010 spennemann et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 it should be noted that the runoff datasets from all the sources are extracted at a common resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon for the analysis 2 3 large scale climate indices the influence of large scale indices ismi soi sst and iod on the drought meteorological drought in the present study is examined through non stationary analysis it is inferred from the past studies that the large scale indices have significant role in modulating the precipitation over india at different time scales das et al 2020a b advocated that the ismi https apdrc soest hawaii edu projects monsoon ismidx ismidx jjas txt signifies the strength of the monsoon precipitation in india and can be used to understand the variability of drought events das et al 2021 the soi https psl noaa gov data 20thc rean timeseries monthly soi influences the precipitation variability across the globe and subsequently affect the changeability in the meteorological drought condition roy 2017 trenberth 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 similarly the sst anomaly https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long anom data is used to analyse the drought conditions over europe canada united states and india ionita et al 2012 mccabe et al 2008 niranjan kumar et al 2013 shabbar and skinner 2004 the study by ashok and saji 2007 and geethalakshmi et al 2009 revealed that iod https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data dmi had long data has significant contribution in influencing the southwest and northeast monsoon precipitation moreover the influence of iod on drought is examined around the globe forootan et al 2019 ummenhofer et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 it is found that the ssr is significantly correlated with the summer rains over asian countries like india pakistan afghanistan and iran li and zeng 2002 with this understanding the large scale climate indices such as ismi soi sst and ssr are considered as covariates to model the meteorological drought under the influence of those climatic indices the meteorological and runoff datasets are obtained during a common period between 1982 and 2015 3 methodology the proposed methodology in the present study is presented in the form of flow chart and depicted in fig 2 at first the spei and sri drought indices are computed using the hydro meteorological variables it should be noted that the spei is computed using the observed data obtained from imd however the sri index is evaluated using the five different datasets of runoff as discussed in section 2 2 then non stationary analysis is carried out for both the drought indices and compared with the values that obtained from the stationary analysis using akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 using the run theory different drought properties such as duration severity and peak are extracted for both the indices yevjevich 1967 subsequently the drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought with respect to the drought initiation δs peak δp and termination δe is evaluated in addition drought development and drought recovery period are also computed for meteorological and hydrological drought conditions the entire procedure is executed for all the grid points 3 1 computation of drought indices as the indicator of meteorological drought spei index is used that represents the simplified form of the water balance using pr minus pet value at each month vicente serrano et al 2010 the present study uses sri to represent the hydrological drought the parametric distribution namely log logistic is fitted to the pr minus pet to estimate spei at all the grid points however in case of runoff datasets different types of distributions gamma exponential logistic lognormal normal and weibull are examined and the best suitable distribution is considered according to aic value at each grid point to compute sri the cumulative distribution functions obtained by fitting the selected distributions are mapped onto the normal distribution using the inverse of cumulative standard normal gaussian function to develop dimensionless index mishra et al 2016 in this procedure the parameter of the selected distribution is not conditioned with external factors also known as covariate and can be called as stationary approach the spei and sri indices can be evaluated at multiple accumulation period in order to provide the drought condition at seasonal 1 3 month annual 12 month or longer time scales bhardwaj et al 2020 in the present study 1 month scale of spei and sri is considered to analyse the drought propagation in order to analyse the influence of large scale climatic indices on the meteorological drought non stationary analysis is carried out here the framework proposed by das et al 2020b das et al 2021 is used to perform the non stationary modelling of spei drought index initially the large scale climatic indices are arranged in a lagged fashion from no lag to 12 lag and the suitable lag is chosen based on the kendall correlation analysis kendall 1955 between pr minus pet series and arranged large scale climatic indices at a significance level of 5 next the climatic indices with selected lag are considered as covariates to develop the non stationary model this analysis is performed over all the grid points individually it should be noted that the non stationary modelling is performed by introducing the covariates in the location parameter of the selected distribution in case of spei and sri drought indices however in case of sri index only the meteorological variables precipitation pet relative humidity and wind speed are considered as covariates for non stationary modelling in this case fifteen different models are designed by considering the various combinations of meteorological variables and the optimum model is selected based on the lowest aic value among the fifteen models similarly the selection between stationary and non stationary models is performed using the aic value the entire analysis is carried out using the generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss package in r platform developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 it is advised to refer to das et al 2020b das et al 2021 jehanzaib et al 2021 for detailed methodology of gamlss analysis 3 2 propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought the propagation time is the period during which the deficit in the meteorological variable reflects as a deficit in the hydrological variable huang et al 2017 in the present study the propagation time from spei to sri is estimated based on the three different ways i e difference between the initiation to initiation peak to peak and termination to termination of hydrological and meteorological drought spell the threshold for considering an event as drought is set to below zero wu et al 2018a b which all the values are considered as drought condition in this study the drought spell is defined when the spei and sri values are below zero for more than and equal to three months consecutively in the same way the initiation of a meteorological hydrological drought event is defined if the 1 month spei sri is below the threshold for three or more consecutive months likewise the termination of meteorological hydrological drought event is considered when the 1 month spei sri is above the threshold for three or more consecutive months here an extended period of the meteorological drought that starts twelve months prior to the initiation of hydrological drought is considered in order to account the lag that might exist between meteorological and hydrological drought subsequently the difference between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe of hydrological and the nearest meteorological drought event for each drought spell is computed to identify the accumulation period of meteorological drought that translates to hydrological drought using the 1 month spei and sri lastly the mean of the propagation time at different drought spells is computed for three different conditions at each grid point due to high seasonality in the precipitation the correlation based analysis is not suitable over indian region in order to identify the drought propagation bhardwaj et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the drought propagation is computed for the sri values computed from different runoff data sources 3 3 hydrologic drought development and recovery in this section an important aspect of hydrological drought propagation is analysed that focuses on the time required for drought development and drought recovery fig 3 in other words it defines the internal processes of drought propagation that occurs between the development and recovery of hydrological drought bonsal et al 2011 thomas et al 2014 in this study the methodology proposed by wu et al 2018a b is used to evaluate the propagation speeds using the variable motion relationship which incorporates the non uniform rates of internal drought propagation the development phase dp of drought is defined as the time difference between the initiation and peak point δs p and the recovery phase rp is the time difference between the peak and termination point δp e the rate of change of sri from initiation peak to peak termination can be characterized by development speed recovery speed parry et al 2016b parry et al 2016a here rate of change of cumulative drought deficit for development and recovery phases are computed to evaluate the instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs respectively the total variability in development period tvdp and total variability in recovery period tvrp are computed as the cumulative of sri values during the development phase and recovery phase respectively for each identified drought spell in order to compute the ids and irs the development and recovery phases are divided into intervals i 1 2 n 1 n as presented in eqs 1 2 subsequently the average of ids and irs is estimated with the help of eqs 3 4 it should be noted that the temporary drought recovery events in the development phase and drought development in the recovery phase are not included therefore the ids or irs at t i using the δ tvdp i or δ t v r p i which is equal to tvdp i t v d p i 1 or tvrp i t v r p i 1 can be computed as follows 1 ids t i δ t v d p i δ t i i 1 2 n 2 irs t i δ t v r p i δ t i i 1 2 n the average of ids or irs for a certain period of drought event can be computed as follows 3 ids t i t 0 t n δ t v d p i t 0 t n δ t i i 1 2 n 4 irs t i t 0 t n δ t v r p i t 0 t n δ t i i 1 2 n 4 results 4 1 drought properties from the past study it is revealed that the rainfall series show increasing or decreasing trend over different parts of india jain and kumar 2012 however the temperature data exhibits a rising trend at most of the stations in addition praveen et al 2020 stated that decreasing trend of rainfall is observed in annual and seasonal scales over most of the meteorological divisions in india similarly nandi 2022 reported that the average temperatures across seasons have significantly increasing trend over india since 1991 in the case of runoff datasets it is noticed that about 63 of the total area is showing increasing or decreasing trend across india in addition one or more than one change points are observed over most of the grid points in case of runoff datasets with this evidence of trend and change point in the precipitation temperature and runoff series non stationary analysis is carried out for spei and sri drought indices in order to incorporate the influence of external drivers at each grid point from the analysis it is found that the non stationary analysis outperforms the stationary analysis at each grid point for instance in the case of spei the aic values for stationary and non stationary analysis at each grid point are presented in table s1 it is noticed that soi and sst have significant correlation over northern northeast and southern parts of india however ismi has significant correlation over all the grid points in india next different drought properties duration severity and no of drought events of meteorological and hydrological droughts are identified using the developed drought indices the duration severity and drought event of hydrological drought from different datasets are presented in the supplementary information i e figure s1 s2 and s3 respectively during 1982 2015 from figure s1 it can be noticed that maximum percentage of area i e 36 in era5 43 in fldas and 40 in ncep is observed for the drought duration ranging from 10 months to 15 months however in the case of gldas and merra2 the maximum percentage of area i e 79 and 68 respectively is noticed for 5 months to 10 months drought duration considering the sri values from all the models it is observed that more than 85 of the total area has come under the drought duration of 5 months to 20 months the high value of drought duration is observed over small parts in northern region for sri values from era5 fldas ncep and southern region from ncep in case of severity value ranging from 5 to 10 figure s2 the highest percentage of area is computed as 53 in era5 75 in gldas 71 in merra2 and 52 in ncep the regions under the high values of drought severity is similar as drought duration as compared to drought duration and severity the intermodal variability is high in case of no of drought events as presented in figure s3 it can be observed from the figure that more than 40 of the total area is under the influence of high no of drought event i e between 25 and 35 in the case of gldas and merra2 however the spatial distribution of the drought event is different between these models for instance the high drought events are zoned over most parts in india except some parts in northern northwest and southern regions in case of gldas conversely mostly the western parts of the country are affected by the high drought events as observed in merra2 the hydrological drought properties obtained from the ensemble average of all the runoff datasets fig 4 reveal that the higher value of duration and severity is observed mostly over the southern and northern parts of india conversely the lower value of duration and severity is noticed over the western and northeast parts of india the nos of drought events are between 20 and 25 during the study period over most of the regions in india in addition state wise drought properties are analysed over india and presented in fig 5 it can be noticed that drought duration and severity is high over himachal pradesh hp haryana hr punjab pb tamil nadu tn and uttar pradesh up the variability in the hydrological drought duration is very small over tripura tr and sikkim sk states however the variability in the hydrological drought severity is less over most of the states as compared to the drought duration over most of the states the average number of drought events is more than 20 similarly the meteorological drought properties are presented in fig 6 mostly the high values of drought duration and severity are observed over the southern parts of india e g karnataka ka kerala kl and tamil nadu tn the regions with high value of drought duration show high value of severity however the number of drought events are higher mostly over madhya pradesh mp in central india parts of maharashtra mh gujarat gj and rajasthan rj in western parts of india uttar pradesh up uttarakhand uk in northern parts and chhattisgarh cg and parts of odisha od in eastern parts of india about 94 of total area comes under the drought duration ranging between 6 and 20 months with the highest value of 57 in the case of drought duration between 6 and 10 months similarly the severity magnitude of 3 to 9 occupies about 91 of the total area with highest 72 in case of magnitude from 3 to 6 during the study period the no of drought events between 10 and 35 is noticed over 97 of the total area 4 2 drought development and recovery period the duration of dp and rp is known as drought development period ddp and drought recovery period drp respectively the ddp and drp of all the runoff datasets are presented in figure s4 and figure s5 respectively the intermodal variability of ddp and drp is significantly large among the models for instance meera2 indicates about 65 of the total area with ddp below 3 months whereas gldas shows about 64 of total area having ddp between 3 1 and 6 months similarly the percentage area varies from 40 to 71 for drp between 3 1 and 6 months among the models the spatial variability is similar in the cases of era5 fldas and ncep for the corresponding high values of ddp and drp likewise it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of ddp are also having high value of drp for meteorological drought index fig 7 these regions are mostly located over southern and northern parts of india it is computed that the highest areal coverage of ddp and drp of about 59 and 46 of the total area respectively for the time period of 3 1 to 6 months the high ddp and drp is noticed over some parts of karnataka ka tamilnadu tn kerala kl and ladakh la the ensemble mean of ddp and drp incorporating all runoff datasets is presented in fig 8 it can be noted from the figure that the ddp and drp of 3 1 to 6 months is observed over most of the areas i e about 78 in ddp and 67 in drp in addition only 1 of the area with ddp and drp more than 12 months is noticed during the study period the state wise variability of ddp and drp is shown in fig 9 the spatial variability of ddp and drp over tripura tr and tamil nadu tn is significantly lesser than the other states the average value of ddp and drp considering all the states varies from 3 5 months to 8 4 months and 3 5 months to 7 2 months respectively the highest average value of ddp and drp is noticed over punjab pb however the lowest value of ddp and drp is observed over gujarat gj and sikkim sk respectively 4 3 drought instantaneous development and recovery speed next the internal propagation meteorological and hydrological droughts is examined using the concept of ids and irs here the rate of internal drought propagation is characterised by the instantaneous propagation speed it is worth noting that high value of ids demands quick and efficient drought management practices similarly the low value of ids suggests that there is more time to prepare against a developing drought the understanding of development and recovery rate of internal drought propagation enables water managers in proposing efficient water management strategies the ids and irs of hydrological drought computed using the five different runoff datasets are depicted in figure s6 and figure s7 refer to supplementary material respectively from figure s6 the highest percentage of area observed with the ids values between 0 40 and 0 60 per month for era5 57 gldas 56 meera2 48 and ncep 49 and between 0 20 and 0 40 per month for fldas 42 however all the runoff datasets are in agreement with the highest percentage of area for the irs values from 0 40 to 0 60 per month figure s7 the spatial distribution of ids and irs values are quite similar in the case of meera2 and ncep runoff datasets the ensemble average of ids and irs for hydrological drought events is plotted in fig 10 it is clear from the figure that most of the area in india has the ids and irs values between 0 40 and 0 60 per month in particular about 82 of total area the ids and irs values varies between 0 40 and 0 60 per month interestingly the high values 0 60 to 0 80 per month of ids and irs are observed mostly of the eastern and southern parts of india conversely the low values 0 20 to 0 40 of ids and irs are noticed mostly over western and northern parts of india the state wise variability of ids and irs is presented in fig 11 the average ids and irs across all the states varies from 0 43 to 0 58 per month and from 0 45 to 0 66 per month respectively the highest average value of ids irs is recorded over odisha od tripura tr interestingly a pattern in the mean ids and irs is observed in most of the states in india which indicates that with increase in ids irs value has also increased and vice versa 4 4 drought propagation time in this section the important findings related to drought propagation meteorological to hydrological are presented the drought propagation is computed based on the difference between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe of hydrological and the nearest meteorological drought event the drought propagation with respect to initiation peak and termination using the five different runoff datasets are presented in figure s8 s9 and s10 in the supplementary material respectively in the case of δs the drought propagation is computed as 6 to 8 months over most of area 55 to 64 considering all the runoff datasets it is found that the drought propagation in δs varies between 4 and 8 months over more than 90 of the study area as observed in the cases of era5 fldas gldas and merra2 three out of five datasets are in line with the outcomes that the highest percentage of area with propagation time corresponding to δp is 9 to 12 months figure s9 whereas the time to propagation is computed as 6 to 9 months over 65 of area for merra2 dataset it is observed that the propagation time within the range of 6 to 15 months is observed over 81 to 97 of total area considering the outputs from all the datasets the propagation time of meteorological to hydrological drought using δe is more when compared with δs and δp figure s10 it is noticed that the range of the drought propagation time over 86 to 98 of total area varies from 10 to 25 months in the case of δe the ensemble mean of drought propagation time at three different cases are presented in fig 12 the propagation time in case of δs varies between 4 and 9 months with 62 of total area falls under 6 to 7 months followed by 20 of total area under 7 to 8 months the propagation time over southern parts of eastern parts of northeast and parts of northern regions is less as compared to the central parts of india in the case of δp the time of propagation varies from 9 to 12 months over 74 of the total area about 70 of total area the time of propagation in δe ranges from 15 to 20 months further the state wise variability of drought propagation fig 13 reveals that the mean propagation time under δs δp and δe is around 6 4 months 11 10 months and 17 07 months the maximum and minimum range of propagation time under δs is noticed over arunachal pradesh ar and tripura tr respectively similarly the maximum and minimum range of propagation time for δp and δe is computed over ladakh la and sikkim sk 4 5 influence of external drivers on characteristics of drought propagation in order to find out the influence of external drivers covariates on drought propagation a comparison between the drought propagation with and without external drivers is examined to do so the percentage changes in ids irs ddp drp δs δp and δe are computed with respect to the hydrological drought index computed without external covariates fig 14 presents the change in percentage of above said drought propagation characteristics it should be noted that the ensemble average of five different runoff datasets are considered for the analysis it can be noted from the figure that except for drought propagation time in δs the drought propagation characteristics are underestimated when computed neglecting the external covariates for instance over 75 of area in ids 87 of area in irs 73 of area in ddp 53 of area in drp 61 of area in δp and 66 of area in δe are underestimated when compared incorporating the influence of external covariates in the case of δs the percentage of change mostly varies between the ranges of 20 and 20 the magnitude of change in case of ids irs ddp and drp is higher than time to propagation in addition the state wise average percentage of change is computed in the case of ids it is observed that the highest and lowest value of percentage change absolute is observed over rajasthan rj and odisha od respectively similarly the highest and lowest absolute percentage is noticed over gujarat gj and ladakh la in case of irs over manipur mn and ladakh la in case of ddp over mizoram mz and himachal pradesh hp in case of drp over manipur mn and punjab pb in case of δs over punjab pb and odisha od in case of δp and over manipur mn and andhra pradesh ap in case of δe 5 discussion the prime motive of the present study is to investigate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought at gridded scale which is crucial for drought management and warning system huang et al 2017 moreover the grid wise evaluation of time to propagation enables to provide useful information for the local drought early warning and mitigation chen et al 2020 before analysing the propagation time the time and speed at which a drought event develops and recovers are examined at each grid point as entire india is considered for the study it is cumbersome to set up a hydrological model for the entire india due to the significant alterations in the streamflow as a result of anthropogenic activities e g influence of dam and inconsistencies in the continuous available observed streamflow data thus available gridded runoff datasets at a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon is considered five different gridded runoff datasets are considered to encompass the associated uncertainties with the datasets in addition the drought characteristics extracted from ensemble mean of all the datasets are analysed to provide a unified outcomes from all the runoff datasets the ensemble mean is considered in other words the average prediction performance of all contributing members in the ensemble is chosen to extract the important findings from the analysis combining the multiple datasets in order to solve one problem and focusing on their consistency may obtain the results closer to the truth chen et al 2020 in the changing environmental condition the lag structure of large scale climate indices provide vital information about meteorological drought management li et al 2015 similarly the regional climatological variability influences the hydrological drought characteristics the precipitation variability as a leading factor of meteorological drought is modulated by the large scale climate indices mishra and singh 2010 conversely the hydrological drought is linked with climate anomalies and human interventions zhang et al 2012 thus present study develops the non stationary meteorological and hydrological drought indices incorporating the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability respectively in line with the past studies cheng and aghakouchak 2014 das et al 2020b jehanzaib et al 2021 vasiliades et al 2015 it is observed that the non stationary analysis outperforms the stationary analysis the inclusion of non stationarity helps in capturing the evolution of drought events under the changing environment condition and provides valuable information about drought management li et al 2015 in the present study it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers this underestimation can significantly impact the assessment of risk associated with the drought events the variability in meteorological and hydrological components influence the drought properties núñez et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 it is observed that with increase in drought duration the drought severity has increased under both the indices the present findings are in line with the previous studies carried out over different parts of the world adhyani et al 2017 cavus and aksoy 2020 satish kumar et al 2021 spinoni et al 2014 in case of spei it is observed that the drought event with short duration and severity has high frequency while long duration and severity has low frequency characteristics the similar observations are noticed by ge et al 2016 while analysing the spatiotemporal pattern of droughts in the continental united states the southern parts of india experience the high magnitude of drought duration and severity in line with the present outcomes mallya et al 2015 and mishra et al 2021 also identified the severe drought conditions over south india mishra et al 2021 attributed to the deficit northeast monsoonal rainfall over consecutive years that contributes about 40 of total rainfall in southern india in addition jain et al 2019 advocated that the dryness during the monsoon period as a result of negative iod and warm sst bring the exceptional drought condition over south india in general the meteorological drought properties are more severe than hydrological drought properties the analysis of ddp and drp suggests that the grids where the period of drought meteorological and hydrological development is more less also have a high low recovery period the present finding is in line with the outcomes of bhardwaj et al 2020 and wu et al 2018a b where they considered hydrological drought events incorporating the variable motion relationship of speed time process hydrological drought propagation can be identified traditionally the propagation of drought is expressed as transformation of one drought type to another type however the same drought type experiences the internal propagation parry et al 2016b thomas et al 2014 the concept of ids and irs represents the internal variability of drought events and provides crucial feedback about requisite policy changes based on different phases of drought bandyopadhyay et al 2020 wilhite et al 2014 unfortunately the current policies do not consider the internal drought propagation in formulating the strategies moreover at local scale the combined information of ids and irs can strengthen the drought prediction and early warning system in the case of hydrological drought southern and eastern parts of india show high ids and irs values suggesting that the drought would develop rapidly and reach its peak and recover quickly to the normal condition therefore these shorter duration droughts need prompt and efficient drought management practices the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought is computed at each grid point across india the propagation time depends completely on method being used bevacqua et al 2021 and hence the present analysis includes three different approaches to examine the propagation time the propagation time with respect to δs is shorter than δp and δe in addition the δs is not sensitive as compared to others and provide lowest and most smoothed out values for propagation time bevacqua et al 2021 it is observed that the concurrent meteorological drought events during the phase of hydrological drought development and recovery periods increase the entire length of hydrological event for instance a hydrological drought event with duration of 45 months encompasses 3 concurrent meteorological drought events with duration varying from 8 to 10 months a comparative analysis in case of δs only of the present outcomes with bhardwaj et al 2020 reveals that there is a difference in the time range of drought propagation for instance the present study evaluates that the propagation period ranges between 4 and 9 months whereas bhardwaj et al 2020 computed that the propagation period varies between 0 and 5 months however it is noticed that the spatial distribution of low and high propagation period between two studies is similar the variability in the magnitude of propagation time may be resulted due to the inclusion of large scale climatic indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in the computation of drought indices the present analysis at regional scale would provide efficient water management strategies at local scale whereas the findings by bhardwaj et al 2020 help at the sub basin scale the drought propagation and its linkage to the catchment characteristics is vital for monitoring the drought and early warning systems a study by bhardwaj et al 2020 revealed that the catchment characteristics has no significant influence on drought characteristics like duration and severity over india in the present study the detailed analysis of catchment characteristics is not studied however the past analysis over india suggested that the effect of seasonality index and base flow index have significant influence on propagation time of meteorological to hydrological drought in the indian sub continent river basins bhardwaj et al 2020 further a study by huang et al 2017 indicated that along with the seasonality index the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is impacted by the large scale climate indices like el niño southern oscillation enso with respect to the different sustainable development goals proposed by united nations https sdgs un org goals the outcomes from the present study can be linked to the following goals i climate action ii clean water and sanitation iii life on land the goal climate action enables to take prompt action to combat climate change and its impact in the present analysis the changeability in the large scale climatic indices is incorporated in modeling the drought index the variability in the large scale climatic indices is modulated due to the change in the climate and their interaction with the ocean in this sense the newly developed drought index would help in devising the effective drought management strategies to combat climate change similarly the goal clean water and sanitation aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water in the present study the variability of available water at regional scale is characterised using the hydrological drought index in addition the variability in water availability due to the meteorological drought condition is assessed through its propagation phenomena which would help in formulating the sustainable management plans to ensure the water availability lastly the goal life on land ensures to protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems under this goal desertification land degradation and drought is considered as one of the topics to fulfil the motive the present study deals with the propagation of one drought to another under the influence of climate change that helps in developing the strategies to promote resilience and disaster risk management 6 conclusions to devise sustainable drought management practices it is inevitable to understand the propagation of drought from one form to another in addition the inclusion of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in understanding the propagation of drought enable to cope with the changing climate scenario therefore the present study examines the time to propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought at gridded scale in india using the drought indices developed using the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability based on the findings the following conclusions can be made 1 from the statistical analysis it is found that the drought index developed under the influence of external covariates outperforms the drought index which are computed without considering the external covariates 2 the variability in the outcomes is noticed while using the different runoff datasets over the study area the ensemble mean of all the runoff datasets are considered to summarise the findings 3 it is found that the meteorological drought properties drought events and duration are more severe as compared to the hydrological drought 4 the large duration and more severe hydrological droughts are observed mostly over southern and northern parts of india 5 over most parts in india the ddp and drp is 3 1 to 6 months it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of ddp are also having high value of drp the average highest lowest value of ddp and drp is noticed over punjab gujarat and sikkim respectively 6 most of the area in india has the ids and irs values between 0 40 and 0 60 the high values 0 60 to 0 80 of ids and irs are observed mostly of the eastern and southern parts of india conversely the low values 0 20 to 0 40 of ids and irs are noticed mostly over western and northern parts of india the highest average value of ids irs is recorded over odisha od tripura tr 7 the propagation time in case of δs varies between 4 and 9 months with 62 of total area falls under 6 to 7 months followed by 20 of total area under 7 to 8 months in the case of δp the time of propagation varies from 9 to 12 months over 74 of the total area about 70 of total area the time of propagation in δe ranges from 15 to 20 months 8 it is found that the influence of external drivers is significant of drought propagation characteristics it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers the future scope of the present analysis underlines the necessity to understand the relationship among ddp drp ids irs and drought propagation in addition identification of hotspots based on the internal propagation of drought and propagation from one form to another form facilitates sustainable development strategies examining the influence of drought propagation at one grid on another enables to understand the overall drought propagation characteristics over river basin scale further the computation of drought speed would help to improve the implementation of early drought warning system integrating the numerical climate forecasts from climate models and variety of distributed hydrological models lastly multi indicator approaches are essential to determine the mechanisms of drought development and propagation credit authorship contribution statement subhadarsini

3342,as a costliest natural hazard drought profoundly affects water resources agriculture and socio economic sectors in india in spite of large spatio temporal variability in droughts the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts is not examined at local scale over india in this study the meteorological and hydrological variables are obtained at a grid resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india to estimate the time of propagation here five different runoff datasets from era5 fldas gldas meera2 and ncep are collected the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardised runoff index sri are estimated under the influence of external global and regional drivers the drought propagation time is computed in 1170 grids blanketing the entire india based on differences between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe in addition the internal propagation of hydrological drought is estimated with the help of variable motion relationship of speed time process the large duration and more severe hydrological droughts are observed mostly over southern and northern parts of india the drought propagation time varies between 4 and 9 months 9 to 12 months and 15 to 20 months in the cases of δs δp and δe respectively the drought development and recovery duration are computed as 3 1 to 6 months over most of the areas it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of drought development period ddp are also having high value of drought recovery period drp the internal propagation of hydrological drought ranges between the magnitude of 0 4 and 0 6 per month over most of the area in india it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers the present study would provide important drought characteristics at local scale which can assist water managers and policy makers to devise sustainable management practices keywords drought development drought propagation hydrological drought india non stationary 1 introduction in the context of global warming recent years have witnessed the increasing frequency of extreme drought events these events have significant impact on agriculture gupta et al 2020 lobell et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2013 water resources aghakouchak et al 2015 ashraf et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 ecosystem feng et al 2021 fu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and economic sectors frame et al 2020 gao et al 2019 naumann et al 2021 moreover the occurrence of drought events can modulate the onset of another hazard and the compounding effects of such events can increase the risk of the associated impact e g concurrence of drought and heatwave increases the risk of wildfire events aghakouchak et al 2018 fischer et al 2007 a report by wmo 2014 revealed that droughts were accountable for one third of total casualties caused by all the natural hazards and economic losses of 200 billion dollars across the globe during 1970 2012 thus it is crucial to characterize the droughts in order to improve its monitoring management and prediction bevacqua et al 2021 in a broader sense drought can be defined as the below normal availability of water for a period of time that fails to fulfil the human and environmental needs wilhite and pulwarty 2017 in this sense the drought events are classified into four different categories such as i meteorological drought that is associated with the deficit in precipitation ii hydrological drought related to decline in the streamflow iii agricultural drought when there is a deficit in soil moisture iv socio economic drought when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply due to a weather related deficit in water supply in order to identify and characterize different drought events several drought indices have been developed with reference to different drought classifications the standardised precipitation index spi and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei indices are used to monitor meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 similarly for hydrological and agricultural drought classifications standardised runoff index sri and standardised soil moisture index ssi are recommended respectively shukla and wood 2008 xu et al 2018 the socio economic drought is analysed using the socioeconomic drought index sedi and water resources system resilience index wrsri liu et al 2020 shi et al 2018 in the context of causative mechanisms the deficit in the precipitation and increasing evaporative demand propagate through the hydrologic cycle and subsequently developing into a hydrological drought han et al 2019 hellwig et al 2020 van loon 2015 wu et al 2020 in other words from beginning to the end drought transition is encapsulated within the atmosphere hydrology soil vegetation system chen et al 2020 this transition from one form to another form of drought is known as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 haslinger et al 2014 the understanding of drought propagation provides valuable information to improve the accuracy of drought analysis and prediction due to the dual effect of climate change and population growth it is difficult to analyse the spatio temporal evolution of drought however under the limited or no anthropogenic interventions drought propagation is primarily controlled by the climatic factors and biophysical characteristics of the study area van lanen et al 2013 van loon 2015 in recent times studies have performed to analyse the drought propagation mechanisms and their controlling factors apurv and cai 2020 wu et al 2021 the study regarding the drought propagation began in early 2000 for instance stahl 2001 analysed the propagation of drought through the hydrological cycle peters 2003 examined the propagation of drought through groundwater systems by comparing the droughts in time series of groundwater recharge levels and discharge van loon et al 2012 studied the capability of large scale hydrological models to reproduce the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought by considering the ensemble of ten large scale models land surface and global hydrological models likewise propagation study has been carried out over iberian peninsula lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 over china ding et al 2021 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 over united kingdom barker et al 2016 over south korea jehanzaib and kim 2020 sattar et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 over contiguous united states tijdeman et al 2018 over brazil bevacqua et al 2021 over spain barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 over south africa botai et al 2019 over india bhardwaj et al 2020 among others it is found that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought varies with respect to the study area for instance bhardwaj et al 2020 found four to five months for the majority of locations in india and xu et al 2019 noticed that the time of propagation in grassland and forest dominated subbasins varies between 1 5 months and 4 7 months in northern china respectively in addition the factors e g temperature catchment characteristics climate type climate change influencing the drought propagation are studied globally gevaert et al 2018 jehanzaib et al 2020 peña gallardo et al 2019 van loon and laaha 2015 the above said studies did not include the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in developing the drought indices which would affect the drought propagation therefore there is a dearth in understanding the influence of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables in modulating the drought events and subsequently the propagation particularly india is vulnerable to droughts given that growing water demand for industry energy production domestic purposes and water intensive agriculture are significantly stressing india s limited water resources according to the drought early warning system dews and real time drought monitoring platform about 42 based on the data on march 2019 of india s land mass was under various degrees of drought conditions the southern india faced the most severe drought over the past 150 years during 2016 2018 due to the precipitation deficit in the north eastern monsoon mishra et al 2021 since 2015 about 600 million people in india struggle with widespread drought condition roy 2019 thus it has become imperative to analyse how meteorological droughts develop into hydrological droughts when the drought events are linked with the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables in order to develop a robust early warning system in this paper the propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought is examined at gridded scale with a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india the meteorological spei and hydrological sri indices are developed under the influence of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variables respectively the large scale climate indices such as indian summer monsoon index ismi southern oscillation index soi sea surface temperature sst indian ocean dipole iod and sahel standardized rainfall ssr are used subsequently the drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological is examined by considering i the time interval between the initiation of meteorological and hydrological drought event ii the time interval between the peaks of those events iii time interval between the terminations of those events in addition a comparative analysis of five different runoff datasets namely ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 famine early warning systems network land data assimilation system fldas global land data assimilation system gldas modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 and national centers for environmental prediction ncep is carried out in order to analyse the variability in the drought propagation time previously propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought over india was performed by bhardwaj et al 2020 at river basin scale however in the present study the propagation analysis is performed at gridded scale under the influence of external factors which was not discussed in bhardwaj et al 2020 in addition bhardwaj et al 2020 considered the drought propagation with respect to the onset of drought events however the present analysis includes the time difference between drought peaks and drought termination of meteorological and hydrological drought event in addition to the drought onset to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is the first of its kind to be carried out over india 2 data used 2 1 meteorological data in the present study the grid wise analysis is carried out at a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon over india that

noted that the pet is computed using the penman monteith s method allen et al 1994 it is worth mentioning that the pet is computed using the spei package in r environment begueria et al 2017 in order to simplify the analysis and interpretation of outcomes the meteorological datasets are regridded to a common resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon using the bilinear interpolation technique 2 2 runoff datasets it is well understood that the different datasets with different uncertainties would result in different outcomes therefore as discussed in the introduction section the runoff datasets are obtained from five different sources era5 fldas gldas merra 2 and ncep another important reason for choosing the datasets is due to inconsistencies in the continuous available observed streamflow data and difficulty in obtaining the streamflow data over the river basins that share the international boundary with neighbouring countries the above said runoff datasets are obtained at 0 25 lat 0 25 lon

reanalysis2 html past studies have verified the reliability of the selected datasets on drought parameters across the globe bai et al 2016 chen et al 2020 fan et al 2021 ho et al 2021 mcnally et al 2017 raziei et al 2010 spennemann et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 it should be noted that the runoff datasets from all the sources are extracted at a common resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon for the analysis 2 3 large scale climate indices the influence of large scale indices ismi soi sst and iod on the drought meteorological drought in the present study is examined through non stationary analysis it is inferred from the past studies that the large scale indices have significant role in modulating the precipitation over india at different time scales das et al 2020a b advocated that the ismi https apdrc soest hawaii edu projects monsoon ismidx ismidx jjas txt signifies the strength of the monsoon precipitation in india and can be used to understand the variability of drought events das et al 2021 the soi https psl noaa gov data 20thc rean timeseries monthly soi influences the precipitation variability across the globe and subsequently affect the changeability in the meteorological drought condition roy 2017 trenberth 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 similarly the sst anomaly https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data nino34 long anom data is used to analyse the drought conditions over europe canada united states and india ionita et al 2012 mccabe et al 2008 niranjan kumar et al 2013 shabbar and skinner 2004 the study by ashok and saji 2007 and geethalakshmi et al 2009 revealed that iod https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data dmi had long data has significant contribution in influencing the southwest and northeast monsoon precipitation moreover the influence of iod on drought is examined around the globe forootan et al 2019 ummenhofer et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 it is found that the ssr is significantly correlated with the summer rains over asian countries like india pakistan afghanistan and iran li and zeng 2002 with this understanding the large scale climate indices such as ismi soi sst and ssr are considered as covariates to model the meteorological drought under the influence of those climatic indices the meteorological and runoff datasets are obtained during a common period between 1982 and 2015 3 methodology the proposed methodology in the present study is presented in the form of flow chart and depicted in fig 2 at first the spei and sri drought indices are computed using the hydro meteorological variables it should be noted that the spei is computed using the observed data obtained from imd however the sri index is evaluated using the five different datasets of runoff as discussed in section 2 2 then non stationary analysis is carried out for both the drought indices and compared with the values that obtained from the stationary analysis using akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 using the run theory different drought properties such as duration severity and peak are extracted for both the indices yevjevich 1967 subsequently the drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought with respect to the drought initiation δs peak δp and termination δe is evaluated in addition drought development and drought recovery period are also computed for meteorological and hydrological drought conditions the entire procedure is executed for all the grid points 3 1 computation of drought indices as the indicator of meteorological drought spei index is used that represents the simplified form of the water balance using pr minus pet value at each month vicente serrano et al 2010 the present study uses sri to represent the hydrological drought the parametric distribution namely log logistic is fitted to the pr minus pet to estimate spei at all the grid points however in case of runoff datasets different types of distributions gamma exponential logistic lognormal normal and weibull are examined and the best suitable distribution is considered according to aic value at each grid point to compute sri the cumulative distribution functions obtained by fitting the selected distributions are mapped onto the normal distribution using the inverse of cumulative standard normal gaussian function to develop dimensionless index mishra et al 2016 in this procedure the parameter of the selected distribution is not conditioned with external factors also known as covariate and can be called as stationary approach the spei and sri indices can be evaluated at multiple accumulation period in order to provide the drought condition at seasonal 1 3 month annual 12 month or longer time scales bhardwaj et al 2020 in the present study 1 month scale of spei and sri is considered to analyse the drought propagation in order to analyse the influence of large scale climatic indices on the meteorological drought non stationary analysis is carried out here the framework proposed by das et al 2020b das et al 2021 is used to perform the non stationary modelling of spei drought index initially the large scale climatic indices are arranged in a lagged fashion from no lag to 12 lag and the suitable lag is chosen based on the kendall correlation analysis kendall 1955 between pr minus pet series and arranged large scale climatic indices at a significance level of 5 next the climatic indices with selected lag are considered as covariates to develop the non stationary model this analysis is performed over all the grid points individually it should be noted that the non stationary modelling is performed by introducing the covariates in the location parameter of the selected distribution in case of spei and sri drought indices however in case of sri index only the meteorological variables precipitation pet relative humidity and wind speed are considered as covariates for non stationary modelling in this case fifteen different models are designed by considering the various combinations of meteorological variables and the optimum model is selected based on the lowest aic value among the fifteen models similarly the selection between stationary and non stationary models is performed using the aic value the entire analysis is carried out using the generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss package in r platform developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 it is advised to refer to das et al 2020b das et al 2021 jehanzaib et al 2021 for detailed methodology of gamlss analysis 3 2 propagation of meteorological to hydrological drought the propagation time is the period during which the deficit in the meteorological variable reflects as a deficit in the hydrological variable huang et al 2017 in the present study the propagation time from spei to sri is estimated based on the three different ways i e difference between the initiation to initiation peak to peak and termination to termination of hydrological and meteorological drought spell the threshold for considering an event as drought is set to below zero wu et al 2018a b which all the values are considered as drought condition in this study the drought spell is defined when the spei and sri values are below zero for more than and equal to three months consecutively in the same way the initiation of a meteorological hydrological drought event is defined if the 1 month spei sri is below the threshold for three or more consecutive months likewise the termination of meteorological hydrological drought event is considered when the 1 month spei sri is above the threshold for three or more consecutive months here an extended period of the meteorological drought that starts twelve months prior to the initiation of hydrological drought is considered in order to account the lag that might exist between meteorological and hydrological drought subsequently the difference between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe of hydrological and the nearest meteorological drought event for each drought spell is computed to identify the accumulation period of meteorological drought that translates to hydrological drought using the 1 month spei and sri lastly the mean of the propagation time at different drought spells is computed for three different conditions at each grid point due to high seasonality in the precipitation the correlation based analysis is not suitable over indian region in order to identify the drought propagation bhardwaj et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the drought propagation is computed for the sri values computed from different runoff data sources 3 3 hydrologic drought development and recovery in this section an important aspect of hydrological drought propagation is analysed that focuses on the time required for drought development and drought recovery fig 3 in other words it defines the internal processes of drought propagation that occurs between the development and recovery of hydrological drought bonsal et al 2011 thomas et al 2014 in this study the methodology proposed by wu et al 2018a b is used to evaluate the propagation speeds using the variable motion relationship which incorporates the non uniform rates of internal drought propagation the development phase dp of drought is defined as the time difference between the initiation and peak point δs p and the recovery phase rp is the time difference between the peak and termination point δp e the rate of change of sri from initiation peak to peak termination can be characterized by development speed recovery speed parry et al 2016b parry et al 2016a here rate of change of cumulative drought deficit for development and recovery phases are computed to evaluate the instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs respectively the total variability in development period tvdp and total variability in recovery period tvrp are computed as the cumulative of sri values during the development phase and recovery phase respectively for each identified drought spell in order to compute the ids and irs the development and recovery phases are divided into intervals i 1 2 n 1 n as presented in eqs 1 2 subsequently the average of ids and irs is estimated with the help of eqs 3 4 it should be noted that the temporary drought recovery events in the development phase and drought development in the recovery phase are not included therefore the ids or irs at t i using the δ tvdp i or δ t v r p i which is equal to tvdp i t v d p i 1 or tvrp i t v r p i 1 can be computed as follows 1 ids t i δ t v d p i δ t i i 1 2 n 2 irs t i δ t v r p i δ t i i 1 2 n the average of ids or irs for a certain period of drought event can be computed as follows 3 ids t i t 0 t n δ t v d p i t 0 t n δ t i i 1 2 n 4 irs t i t 0 t n δ t v r p i t 0 t n δ t i i 1 2 n 4 results 4 1 drought properties from the past study it is revealed that the rainfall series show increasing or decreasing trend over different parts of india jain and kumar 2012 however the temperature data exhibits a rising trend at most of the stations in addition praveen et al 2020 stated that decreasing trend of rainfall is observed in annual and seasonal scales over most of the meteorological divisions in india similarly nandi 2022 reported that the average temperatures across seasons have significantly increasing trend over india since 1991 in the case of runoff datasets it is noticed that about 63 of the total area is showing increasing or decreasing trend across india in addition one or more than one change points are observed over most of the grid points in case of runoff datasets with this evidence of trend and change point in the precipitation temperature and runoff series non stationary analysis is carried out for spei and sri drought indices in order to incorporate the influence of external drivers at each grid point from the analysis it is found that the non stationary analysis outperforms the stationary analysis at each grid point for instance in the case of spei the aic values for stationary and non stationary analysis at each grid point are presented in table s1 it is noticed that soi and sst have significant correlation over northern northeast and southern parts of india however ismi has significant correlation over all the grid points in india next different drought properties duration severity and no of drought events of meteorological and hydrological droughts are identified using the developed drought indices the duration severity and drought event of hydrological drought from different datasets are presented in the supplementary information i e figure s1 s2 and s3 respectively during 1982 2015 from figure s1 it can be noticed that maximum percentage of area i e 36 in era5 43 in fldas and 40 in ncep is observed for the drought duration ranging from 10 months to 15 months however in the case of gldas and merra2 the maximum percentage of area i e 79 and 68 respectively is noticed for 5 months to 10 months drought duration considering the sri values from all the models it is observed that more than 85 of the total area has come under the drought duration of 5 months to 20 months the high value of drought duration is observed over small parts in northern region for sri values from era5 fldas ncep and southern region from ncep in case of severity value ranging from 5 to 10 figure s2 the highest percentage of area is computed as 53 in era5 75 in gldas 71 in merra2 and 52 in ncep the regions under the high values of drought severity is similar as drought duration as compared to drought duration and severity the intermodal variability is high in case of no of drought events as presented in figure s3 it can be observed from the figure that more than 40 of the total area is under the influence of high no of drought event i e between 25 and 35 in the case of gldas and merra2 however the spatial distribution of the drought event is different between these models for instance the high drought events are zoned over most parts in india except some parts in northern northwest and southern regions in case of gldas conversely mostly the western parts of the country are affected by the high drought events as observed in merra2 the hydrological drought properties obtained from the ensemble average of all the runoff datasets fig 4 reveal that the higher value of duration and severity is observed mostly over the southern and northern parts of india conversely the lower value of duration and severity is noticed over the western and northeast parts of india the nos of drought events are between 20 and 25 during the study period over most of the regions in india in addition state wise drought properties are analysed over india and presented in fig 5 it can be noticed that drought duration and severity is high over himachal pradesh hp haryana hr punjab pb tamil nadu tn and uttar pradesh up the variability in the hydrological drought duration is very small over tripura tr and sikkim sk states however the variability in the hydrological drought severity is less over most of the states as compared to the drought duration over most of the states the average number of drought events is more than 20 similarly the meteorological drought properties are presented in fig 6 mostly the high values of drought duration and severity are observed over the southern parts of india e g karnataka ka kerala kl and tamil nadu tn the regions with high value of drought duration show high value of severity however the number of drought events are higher mostly over madhya pradesh mp in central india parts of maharashtra mh gujarat gj and rajasthan rj in western parts of india uttar pradesh up uttarakhand uk in northern parts and chhattisgarh cg and parts of odisha od in eastern parts of india about 94 of total area comes under the drought duration ranging between 6 and 20 months with the highest value of 57 in the case of drought duration between 6 and 10 months similarly the severity magnitude of 3 to 9 occupies about 91 of the total area with highest 72 in case of magnitude from 3 to 6 during the study period the no of drought events between 10 and 35 is noticed over 97 of the total area 4 2 drought development and recovery period the duration of dp and rp is known as drought development period ddp and drought recovery period drp respectively the ddp and drp of all the runoff datasets are presented in figure s4 and figure s5 respectively the intermodal variability of ddp and drp is significantly large among the models for instance meera2 indicates about 65 of the total area with ddp below 3 months whereas gldas shows about 64 of total area having ddp between 3 1 and 6 months similarly the percentage area varies from 40 to 71 for drp between 3 1 and 6 months among the models the spatial variability is similar in the cases of era5 fldas and ncep for the corresponding high values of ddp and drp likewise it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of ddp are also having high value of drp for meteorological drought index fig 7 these regions are mostly located over southern and northern parts of india it is computed that the highest areal coverage of ddp and drp of about 59 and 46 of the total area respectively for the time period of 3 1 to 6 months the high ddp and drp is noticed over some parts of karnataka ka tamilnadu tn kerala kl and ladakh la the ensemble mean of ddp and drp incorporating all runoff datasets is presented in fig 8 it can be noted from the figure that the ddp and drp of 3 1 to 6 months is observed over most of the areas i e about 78 in ddp and 67 in drp in addition only 1 of the area with ddp and drp more than 12 months is noticed during the study period the state wise variability of ddp and drp is shown in fig 9 the spatial variability of ddp and drp over tripura tr and tamil nadu tn is significantly lesser than the other states the average value of ddp and drp considering all the states varies from 3 5 months to 8 4 months and 3 5 months to 7 2 months respectively the highest average value of ddp and drp is noticed over punjab pb however the lowest value of ddp and drp is observed over gujarat gj and sikkim sk respectively 4 3 drought instantaneous development and recovery speed next the internal propagation meteorological and hydrological droughts is examined using the concept of ids and irs here the rate of internal drought propagation is characterised by the instantaneous propagation speed it is worth noting that high value of ids demands quick and efficient drought management practices similarly the low value of ids suggests that there is more time to prepare against a developing drought the understanding of development and recovery rate of internal drought propagation enables water managers in proposing efficient water management strategies the ids and irs of hydrological drought computed using the five different runoff datasets are depicted in figure s6 and figure s7 refer to supplementary material respectively from figure s6 the highest percentage of area observed with the ids values between 0 40 and 0 60 per month for era5 57 gldas 56 meera2 48 and ncep 49 and between 0 20 and 0 40 per month for fldas 42 however all the runoff datasets are in agreement with the highest percentage of area for the irs values from 0 40 to 0 60 per month figure s7 the spatial distribution of ids and irs values are quite similar in the case of meera2 and ncep runoff datasets the ensemble average of ids and irs for hydrological drought events is plotted in fig 10 it is clear from the figure that most of the area in india has the ids and irs values between 0 40 and 0 60 per month in particular about 82 of total area the ids and irs values varies between 0 40 and 0 60 per month interestingly the high values 0 60 to 0 80 per month of ids and irs are observed mostly of the eastern and southern parts of india conversely the low values 0 20 to 0 40 of ids and irs are noticed mostly over western and northern parts of india the state wise variability of ids and irs is presented in fig 11 the average ids and irs across all the states varies from 0 43 to 0 58 per month and from 0 45 to 0 66 per month respectively the highest average value of ids irs is recorded over odisha od tripura tr interestingly a pattern in the mean ids and irs is observed in most of the states in india which indicates that with increase in ids irs value has also increased and vice versa 4 4 drought propagation time in this section the important findings related to drought propagation meteorological to hydrological are presented the drought propagation is computed based on the difference between the initiation to initiation δs peak to peak δp and termination to termination δe of hydrological and the nearest meteorological drought event the drought propagation with respect to initiation peak and termination using the five different runoff datasets are presented in figure s8 s9 and s10 in the supplementary material respectively in the case of δs the drought propagation is computed as 6 to 8 months over most of area 55 to 64 considering all the runoff datasets it is found that the drought propagation in δs varies between 4 and 8 months over more than 90 of the study area as observed in the cases of era5 fldas gldas and merra2 three out of five datasets are in line with the outcomes that the highest percentage of area with propagation time corresponding to δp is 9 to 12 months figure s9 whereas the time to propagation is computed as 6 to 9 months over 65 of area for merra2 dataset it is observed that the propagation time within the range of 6 to 15 months is observed over 81 to 97 of total area considering the outputs from all the datasets the propagation time of meteorological to hydrological drought using δe is more when compared with δs and δp figure s10 it is noticed that the range of the drought propagation time over 86 to 98 of total area varies from 10 to 25 months in the case of δe the ensemble mean of drought propagation time at three different cases are presented in fig 12 the propagation time in case of δs varies between 4 and 9 months with 62 of total area falls under 6 to 7 months followed by 20 of total area under 7 to 8 months the propagation time over southern parts of eastern parts of northeast and parts of northern regions is less as compared to the central parts of india in the case of δp the time of propagation varies from 9 to 12 months over 74 of the total area about 70 of total area the time of propagation in δe ranges from 15 to 20 months further the state wise variability of drought propagation fig 13 reveals that the mean propagation time under δs δp and δe is around 6 4 months 11 10 months and 17 07 months the maximum and minimum range of propagation time under δs is noticed over arunachal pradesh ar and tripura tr respectively similarly the maximum and minimum range of propagation time for δp and δe is computed over ladakh la and sikkim sk 4 5 influence of external drivers on characteristics of drought propagation in order to find out the influence of external drivers covariates on drought propagation a comparison between the drought propagation with and without external drivers is examined to do so the percentage changes in ids irs ddp drp δs δp and δe are computed with respect to the hydrological drought index computed without external covariates fig 14 presents the change in percentage of above said drought propagation characteristics it should be noted that the ensemble average of five different runoff datasets are considered for the analysis it can be noted from the figure that except for drought propagation time in δs the drought propagation characteristics are underestimated when computed neglecting the external covariates for instance over 75 of area in ids 87 of area in irs 73 of area in ddp 53 of area in drp 61 of area in δp and 66 of area in δe are underestimated when compared incorporating the influence of external covariates in the case of δs the percentage of change mostly varies between the ranges of 20 and 20 the magnitude of change in case of ids irs ddp and drp is higher than time to propagation in addition the state wise average percentage of change is computed in the case of ids it is observed that the highest and lowest value of percentage change absolute is observed over rajasthan rj and odisha od respectively similarly the highest and lowest absolute percentage is noticed over gujarat gj and ladakh la in case of irs over manipur mn and ladakh la in case of ddp over mizoram mz and himachal pradesh hp in case of drp over manipur mn and punjab pb in case of δs over punjab pb and odisha od in case of δp and over manipur mn and andhra pradesh ap in case of δe 5 discussion the prime motive of the present study is to investigate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought at gridded scale which is crucial for drought management and warning system huang et al 2017 moreover the grid wise evaluation of time to propagation enables to provide useful information for the local drought early warning and mitigation chen et al 2020 before analysing the propagation time the time and speed at which a drought event develops and recovers are examined at each grid point as entire india is considered for the study it is cumbersome to set up a hydrological model for the entire india due to the significant alterations in the streamflow as a result of anthropogenic activities e g influence of dam and inconsistencies in the continuous available observed streamflow data thus available gridded runoff datasets at a resolution of 0 5 lat 0 5 lon is considered five different gridded runoff datasets are considered to encompass the associated uncertainties with the datasets in addition the drought characteristics extracted from ensemble mean of all the datasets are analysed to provide a unified outcomes from all the runoff datasets the ensemble mean is considered in other words the average prediction performance of all contributing members in the ensemble is chosen to extract the important findings from the analysis combining the multiple datasets in order to solve one problem and focusing on their consistency may obtain the results closer to the truth chen et al 2020 in the changing environmental condition the lag structure of large scale climate indices provide vital information about meteorological drought management li et al 2015 similarly the regional climatological variability influences the hydrological drought characteristics the precipitation variability as a leading factor of meteorological drought is modulated by the large scale climate indices mishra and singh 2010 conversely the hydrological drought is linked with climate anomalies and human interventions zhang et al 2012 thus present study develops the non stationary meteorological and hydrological drought indices incorporating the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability respectively in line with the past studies cheng and aghakouchak 2014 das et al 2020b jehanzaib et al 2021 vasiliades et al 2015 it is observed that the non stationary analysis outperforms the stationary analysis the inclusion of non stationarity helps in capturing the evolution of drought events under the changing environment condition and provides valuable information about drought management li et al 2015 in the present study it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers this underestimation can significantly impact the assessment of risk associated with the drought events the variability in meteorological and hydrological components influence the drought properties núñez et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 it is observed that with increase in drought duration the drought severity has increased under both the indices the present findings are in line with the previous studies carried out over different parts of the world adhyani et al 2017 cavus and aksoy 2020 satish kumar et al 2021 spinoni et al 2014 in case of spei it is observed that the drought event with short duration and severity has high frequency while long duration and severity has low frequency characteristics the similar observations are noticed by ge et al 2016 while analysing the spatiotemporal pattern of droughts in the continental united states the southern parts of india experience the high magnitude of drought duration and severity in line with the present outcomes mallya et al 2015 and mishra et al 2021 also identified the severe drought conditions over south india mishra et al 2021 attributed to the deficit northeast monsoonal rainfall over consecutive years that contributes about 40 of total rainfall in southern india in addition jain et al 2019 advocated that the dryness during the monsoon period as a result of negative iod and warm sst bring the exceptional drought condition over south india in general the meteorological drought properties are more severe than hydrological drought properties the analysis of ddp and drp suggests that the grids where the period of drought meteorological and hydrological development is more less also have a high low recovery period the present finding is in line with the outcomes of bhardwaj et al 2020 and wu et al 2018a b where they considered hydrological drought events incorporating the variable motion relationship of speed time process hydrological drought propagation can be identified traditionally the propagation of drought is expressed as transformation of one drought type to another type however the same drought type experiences the internal propagation parry et al 2016b thomas et al 2014 the concept of ids and irs represents the internal variability of drought events and provides crucial feedback about requisite policy changes based on different phases of drought bandyopadhyay et al 2020 wilhite et al 2014 unfortunately the current policies do not consider the internal drought propagation in formulating the strategies moreover at local scale the combined information of ids and irs can strengthen the drought prediction and early warning system in the case of hydrological drought southern and eastern parts of india show high ids and irs values suggesting that the drought would develop rapidly and reach its peak and recover quickly to the normal condition therefore these shorter duration droughts need prompt and efficient drought management practices the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought is computed at each grid point across india the propagation time depends completely on method being used bevacqua et al 2021 and hence the present analysis includes three different approaches to examine the propagation time the propagation time with respect to δs is shorter than δp and δe in addition the δs is not sensitive as compared to others and provide lowest and most smoothed out values for propagation time bevacqua et al 2021 it is observed that the concurrent meteorological drought events during the phase of hydrological drought development and recovery periods increase the entire length of hydrological event for instance a hydrological drought event with duration of 45 months encompasses 3 concurrent meteorological drought events with duration varying from 8 to 10 months a comparative analysis in case of δs only of the present outcomes with bhardwaj et al 2020 reveals that there is a difference in the time range of drought propagation for instance the present study evaluates that the propagation period ranges between 4 and 9 months whereas bhardwaj et al 2020 computed that the propagation period varies between 0 and 5 months however it is noticed that the spatial distribution of low and high propagation period between two studies is similar the variability in the magnitude of propagation time may be resulted due to the inclusion of large scale climatic indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in the computation of drought indices the present analysis at regional scale would provide efficient water management strategies at local scale whereas the findings by bhardwaj et al 2020 help at the sub basin scale the drought propagation and its linkage to the catchment characteristics is vital for monitoring the drought and early warning systems a study by bhardwaj et al 2020 revealed that the catchment characteristics has no significant influence on drought characteristics like duration and severity over india in the present study the detailed analysis of catchment characteristics is not studied however the past analysis over india suggested that the effect of seasonality index and base flow index have significant influence on propagation time of meteorological to hydrological drought in the indian sub continent river basins bhardwaj et al 2020 further a study by huang et al 2017 indicated that along with the seasonality index the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is impacted by the large scale climate indices like el niño southern oscillation enso with respect to the different sustainable development goals proposed by united nations https sdgs un org goals the outcomes from the present study can be linked to the following goals i climate action ii clean water and sanitation iii life on land the goal climate action enables to take prompt action to combat climate change and its impact in the present analysis the changeability in the large scale climatic indices is incorporated in modeling the drought index the variability in the large scale climatic indices is modulated due to the change in the climate and their interaction with the ocean in this sense the newly developed drought index would help in devising the effective drought management strategies to combat climate change similarly the goal clean water and sanitation aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water in the present study the variability of available water at regional scale is characterised using the hydrological drought index in addition the variability in water availability due to the meteorological drought condition is assessed through its propagation phenomena which would help in formulating the sustainable management plans to ensure the water availability lastly the goal life on land ensures to protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems under this goal desertification land degradation and drought is considered as one of the topics to fulfil the motive the present study deals with the propagation of one drought to another under the influence of climate change that helps in developing the strategies to promote resilience and disaster risk management 6 conclusions to devise sustainable drought management practices it is inevitable to understand the propagation of drought from one form to another in addition the inclusion of large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability in understanding the propagation of drought enable to cope with the changing climate scenario therefore the present study examines the time to propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought at gridded scale in india using the drought indices developed using the large scale climate indices and regional hydro meteorological variability based on the findings the following conclusions can be made 1 from the statistical analysis it is found that the drought index developed under the influence of external covariates outperforms the drought index which are computed without considering the external covariates 2 the variability in the outcomes is noticed while using the different runoff datasets over the study area the ensemble mean of all the runoff datasets are considered to summarise the findings 3 it is found that the meteorological drought properties drought events and duration are more severe as compared to the hydrological drought 4 the large duration and more severe hydrological droughts are observed mostly over southern and northern parts of india 5 over most parts in india the ddp and drp is 3 1 to 6 months it is found that locations with the high value greater than 10 months of ddp are also having high value of drp the average highest lowest value of ddp and drp is noticed over punjab gujarat and sikkim respectively 6 most of the area in india has the ids and irs values between 0 40 and 0 60 the high values 0 60 to 0 80 of ids and irs are observed mostly of the eastern and southern parts of india conversely the low values 0 20 to 0 40 of ids and irs are noticed mostly over western and northern parts of india the highest average value of ids irs is recorded over odisha od tripura tr 7 the propagation time in case of δs varies between 4 and 9 months with 62 of total area falls under 6 to 7 months followed by 20 of total area under 7 to 8 months in the case of δp the time of propagation varies from 9 to 12 months over 74 of the total area about 70 of total area the time of propagation in δe ranges from 15 to 20 months 8 it is found that the influence of external drivers is significant of drought propagation characteristics it is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in india when computed without the external drivers the future scope of the present analysis underlines the necessity to understand the relationship among ddp drp ids irs and drought propagation in addition identification of hotspots based on the internal propagation of drought and propagation from one form to another form facilitates sustainable development strategies examining the influence of drought propagation at one grid on another enables to understand the overall drought propagation characteristics over river basin scale further the computation of drought speed would help to improve the implementation of early drought warning system integrating the numerical climate forecasts from climate models and variety of distributed hydrological models lastly multi indicator approaches are essential to determine the mechanisms of drought development and propagation credit authorship contribution statement subhadarsini

3343,understanding energy and water flux cycling and quantifying their components are essential steps to elucidate the hydrological process and sustainable water resources management in agricultural ecosystems the challenge of partitioning energy and evapotranspiration et components canopy transpiration tc and surface evaporation es was addressed by the combination of eddy covariance ec technique micro lysimeters and sap flow methods in a humid region kiwifruit orchard of southwest china the variations of energy and water flux and their controls were assessed then the measured et and its component were compared with the simulated values by priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl shuttleworth wallace s w and fao 56 dual crop coefficient models dual fao the results showed that latent heat flux le dominated the consumption of net radiation energy rn with the averaged ratio ef le rn above 0 70 during the growing seasons more radiation energy is released in the form of le with increased surface moisture and vegetation cover total leaf area index lait tc accounted for 41 46 et the increase of canopy leaf area index laic strongly affected et partitioning through the early growing seasons while atmospheric evaporation demand dominated the tc et and even caused the energy to be redistributed since high atmospheric evaporation demand caused a decrease of tc while an increase of es during the active growing seasons laic 2 5 m2 m 2 all the et models performed well in estimating et r2 0 84 0 92 and its components tc r2 0 70 0 74 es r2 0 63 0 69 allowing individual estimation of water interception by the canopy is one of the merits of the pt jpl model for et simulation in this humid site with r2 of 0 92 rmse of 0 55 mm d 1 while the s w model performed slightly better in et component simulations tc r2 0 74 rmse 0 35 mm d 1 es r2 0 69 rmse 0 38 mm d 1 the results of our study may have much referential significance for eco hydrological process analysis and water flux estimation in regions with similar environmental conditions keywords kiwifruit orchard energy and water flux evapotranspiration eddy covariance transpiration 1 introduction energy flux exchange and water flux transport between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere are essential components in hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles influencing local regional and even global environmental conditions fatichi and pappas 2017 talsma et al 2018 meanwhile energy flux and water vapor flux are closely related as latent flux le λet can be converted to evapotranspiration et by dividing the latent heat of vaporization λ accurate estimation of et is fundamental to making decisions on sustainable agricultural water resource management dar et al 2017 li et al 2016 et consists of transpiration t and evaporation e t is the process by which water moves from the soil through the organs or tissues into the atmosphere by the productive form of water use jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 e is the water loss in the form of unproductive through the soil or wet leaf surface partitioning water fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems can give valuable information on the productive use of water through t and e many studies have been conducted in direct quantifying et and its component across biomes iida et al 2020 shimizu et al 2015 for example fatichi and pappas 2017 investigate the variability of t et across biomes with a mechanistic ecohydrological model kumagai et al 2014 and shimizu et al 2015 systematically revealed the changes of et and its components in a coniferous plantation which is valuable for forest ecosystem water management et is affected by interactions among plant physiology canopy structure and environmental conditions li et al 2018 liu et al 2019a bao et al 2021a but e and t differed in their response to biotic and abiotic factors due to the different water consumption mechanisms jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 besides the controls of et and its components may vary in the various plant types across the different climate regions wang et al 2014 benyon et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2017 reported that available energy dominated et variation by affecting t in the wet regions while soil moisture dominated et dynamics by regulating e in the arid regions therefore there is an urgent need to investigate how et and its partition are mediated by abiotic and biotic pathways numerous methods have been introduced to measure et and its component e g sap flow and micro lysimeters mly zhang et al 2016 tie et al 2018 stable isotope technique ma and song 2019 williams et al 2004 and ec or large aperture scintillometers with bowen ratio system wilson et al 2001 lopez olivari et al 2016 which are common instruments for directly measuring et but direct measurements are always time consuming and costly the modeling approach has been more popular because of its broad applicability across time and space scales tie et al 2018 liu et al 2019b among the et models shuttleworth wallace s w model is a well known two layer et model widely used because of its suitable physical mechanisms to describe t and e processes separately shuttleworth and wallace 1985 bao et al 2021a bao et al 2021c in addition the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl empirically simulates et based on air temperature and solar radiation showing good agreement with observations in the humid region priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2008 besides the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dual fao model is an indirect method of calculating et from reference crop evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 based on two separate coefficients i e basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ks recommended by the fao the dual fao has been widely used in estimating crop et and its components anapalli et al 2020 ding et al 2013 liu et al 2020a however crop coefficients for kiwifruit in subtropical humid monsoon climate regions have not been provided by the fao thus although models for simulating et and its components have been developed their applicability for different ecosystems still requires extensive verification kiwifruit actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan is an increasingly important crop in southwest china occupying 13 of the global kiwifruit planted area 246 thousand ha up to 2017 zheng et al 2020 optimal kiwifruit production requires precise water management practices which can benefit from a deep understanding of water partitioning in the kiwifruit orchard therefore the ec measurements of et the sap flow of t tc and the micro lysimeter of e es in a typical kiwifruit field in chengdu plain china were conducted from 2018 to 2020 growing seasons the study aims to 1 investigate the energy partitioning and its relationship with biophysical factors 2 characterize the seasonal variations of et and its component i e tc es and analyze how et partitioning is mediated by vegetation and environmental factors and 3 evaluate the applicability of the three existing models pt jpl s w and dual fao in simulating et and its component in this humid orchard 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted during the kiwifruit growing seasons from march 2018 to october 2020 at the kiwifruit experimental base in pujiang county located in the chengdu plain china 30 3262n 103 4252e approximately 537 m a s l fig 1 this region is classified as am subtropical monsoon humid climate according to the köppen climate classification which is hot and rainy in the summer annual mean ta is 16 3 rainfall is 1301 mm sunshine hours is 1122 h year 1 and relative humidity is 84 during 1961 2019 observed by a nearby national meteorological station wenjiang station the main soil type is yellow brown loam with a bulk density of 1 28 1 45 g cm 3 consisting of approximately 76 80 silt 12 29 sand and 10 91 clay at 0 100 cm soil depth the saturated soil water content swc and field capacity in volumetric value are 47 and 34 respectively the orchard field was approximately 133 ha in size consisting of a 15 year old plantation dominated by kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan 95 the trees were equally spaced with a distance of 5 0 4 5 m along the kiwi fruit row direction the cement pillars were installed every 8 m with a height of 1 8 m on which 3 iron wires were pulled left and right for fixing the kiwi branches the canopy height of the trees ranged from 1 8 to 2 2 m and the diameter at breast height ranged from 8 to 12 cm understory weeds mainly include alternanthera philoxeroides mart griseb echinochloa crusgalli l besuv and malachium aquatieurn l fries and was maintained at low densities through the use of herbicides the orchard was irrigated with a sprinkler irrigation system and irrigation was mainly applied in march may during which the swc fell below 60 of the saturated swc adequate irrigation and natural precipitation ensured the trees were free of water deficit 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 flux data measurements processes and gap filling a closed path eddy covariance system was equipped with a fast response three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific inc ut usa to measure the fluctuation in wind velocity components and sonic temperature and a closed path co2 h2o gas analyzer ec155 campbell scientific inc usa to measure the water vapor and co2 density fluctuations the ec system was installed at the east central part of the kiwifruit orchard with the sensors installed at a height of 8 0 m the orchard provided a large and homogeneous fetch with a minimum fetch length of about 1 1 km raw high frequency 10 hz flux data was recorded by a data logger cr6 campbell scientific inc usa the data was processed using the eddypro software following the standard routines including double coordinate rotation time lags compensation low and high frequency corrections falge et al 2001 the data were then collected and averaged at half hour intervals using the datalogger support software 4 4 campbell scientific inc usa the half hour data were then carefully filtered according to the following criteria 1 incomplete half hourly measurements 2 the processed eddypro data carrying quality flags in value ranging from 1 higher quality to 9 lower quality and the fluxes with a quality flag of 7 9 were removed anapalli et al 2020 gao et al 2018 3 friction velocity u was used as the main criterion of turbulence intensity and only flux data with high turbulence conditions were regarded as reliable data u 0 15 m s 1 papale et al 2006 a total of 10 8 daytime and 39 5 nighttime le data were removed according to the above criteria for the gaps during the rainy conditions le was filled referring to the rainy data with high quality quality flag of 1 3 using the filter method ding et al 2010 specifically a function between le and saturated water vapor pressure deficit vpd was established using the rainy data with high quality then the function was used to fill the data gaps during the rainy time please see the supplemental information for the data gaps without rainfall shorter gaps 2h were filled with linear interpolation and larger gaps 2h were filled using mean diurnal variation mdv according to the methods proposed in reichstein et al 2005 the energy balance closure ebc statistics were used to check the quality of flux data the ebc values calculated by half hour data were 0 91 0 93 and 0 82 during the 2018 2020 growing seasons table 1 respectively the lower ebc appearing in the 2020 growing season may cause by a shorter observation period but with more rainfall events the degree of ebc of this site was comparable to the reported results in global fluxnet wilson et al 2002 and chinaflux zhu et al 2006 however as reported in many works of literature the energy fluxes were are not completely closed ascribed to the underestimation of le and h wilson et al 2002 liu et al 2020b in this study for daily ec based data the energy budget components were forced closed by redistributing the residual energy re calculated as rn g le h according to the evaporative fraction ef method gebler et al 2014 jiang et al 2021 the corrected le was described as le le re ef jiang et al 2021 where le is the latent heat fluxes after the energy balance closing then the le was used to estimate et 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological and soil sensors were installed to monitor environmental factors and the number and installation height of the sensors are described in table 2 the observed variables included global total radiation rg net radiation rn ta rh wind speed u soil heat flux g swc and precipitation p all the data were measured at 30 min intervals and recorded by an automatic weather station type trm zs2 manufacturer jinzhou sunshine meteorological technology co ltd jinzhou cn 2 2 3 leaf area index measurements eight sample plots were randomly selected every 1 2 weeks for measuring canopy leaf area index laic with a leaf meter lai 2000 li cor inc usa covering the double rows and the space between two adjacent double rows underlying total surface lai lait including canopy grass and other green vegetation was derived at eight day intervals with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 km modis reflectance product modis 15a2h https modis ornl gov data html spikes presented in the raw lait data were smoothed using the timesat software jonsson and eklundh 2004 finally the 8 day lait data and measured laic data were interpolated to a daily scale using a spline function 2 2 4 sap flow measurements plant sap flux was measured using the thermal dissipation method with granier type sensors granier 1987 in our study eight trees were selected as the experimental tree each sensor consists of a pair of probes the upper probe is a heater supplied with 0 2 w constant power and the lower probe is unheated as a reference the temperature difference between the paired heated and unheated probe δt was used to calculate fd according to the granier method granier 1987 each sensor was installed on the south facing side of the trees at 0 60 m above the ground and the part of the trunk where the sensors were inserted was fully isolated by the sunscreen film to prevent any direct radiation it is known that sap flow rate from sensors positioned on the sunlit side of tree crowns is often overestimated e g oren et al 1998 while in this artificial orchard the kiwi tree canopy does not differentiate the shaded side and sunlit side due to its horizontal canopy structural feature the sap flow difference between north or south facing side was ignored in this study 1 f d 118 99 10 6 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where fd is the plant sap flux density m3 m 2 s 1 δtmax is the maximal temperature difference when sap flux is 0 plant sap flux was then scaled to ground based transpiration using a survey see below before installing the sensors the characteristics of the trees sapwood thickness heartwood in the ec flux footprint were investigated to obtain the necessary scaling variables a total of 32 trees were selected randomly within a 600 600 m plot with the tower in the central position sapwood thickness of each experimental tree was measured on a core extracted with a 5 mm increment borer at 0 6 m above the ground the heartwood area depth was visually identified by its distinct color differences the entire trunk section below the bark of the tree was considered to be active in sap transportation except for a small area with a diameter of 0 5 cm at the center of the stem the conducting xylem section area was calculated as a circular area the ratio of ac ag ac is the average conducting xylem section area and ag is the ground area ag 5 0 m 4 5 m of each tree was further estimated tree sap flow was scaled to ecosystem scale transpiration tc mm d 1 using the following formula oren et al 1998 2 t c f d a c a g 86 4 10 6 where 86 4 106 is the unit conversion factor from m3 m 2 s 1 to mm d 1 2 2 5 soil surface evaporation measurement es was measured using eight micro lysimeters that were 10 cm in diameter and 18 cm in deep the soil in the micro lysimeters mly was replaced every 2 days or replaced after rains the mly was weighed at pre dawn and sun set every day using an electronic balance in order to ensure the original characteristics of the soil surface we did not remove the weeds growing on the soil surface the soil surface evaporation es mm d 1 was calculated as below 3 e s 10 δ w ρ w π d 2 2 where δ w is the difference in weight g ρ w is the density of water g cm 3 and d is the diameter of the micro lysimeter 2 3 surface parameters calculation in this study evaporative fraction ef le rn and bowen ratio β h le were used to quantify the account of le for rn and the conversion relationship between h and le respectively four biophysical parameters including lait surface conductance gs decoupling coefficient ω priestly taylor coefficient α were used to reveal the controls of surface properties on energy flux partitioning the detailed calculation and descriptions of the biophysical parameters can be found in table 3 and references chen et al 2009 odongo et al 2016 williams

according to the measured tc and es value at different stages of growth the division of growth stages of kiwifruit can be found in table 4 or zheng et al 2020 2 5 parameters calibration in this study αc in the pt jpl rs c and rs s in the s w model as well as kcb and ks in the dual fao were the parameters that need to be calibrated for the calibration of the αc in the pt jpl rs c and rs s in s w model when estimating et the parameters were determined by the non linear least squares fitting method with et measured by ec during the three growing seasons the parameters αc k1 k2 and k3 were determined to be 1 16 43 2 0 34 and 0 003 coefficients a and b were determined to be 195 6 and 5 1 respectively table 5 meanwhile tc measured by sap flow was used as a dependent variable to calibrate αc k1 k2 and k3 when only tc module was used in pt jpl and s w model and es measured by mly was used as a dependent variable to calibrate a and b when only es module was used in s w model by the non linear least squares fitting method kcb and ks in dual fao model were calibrated as introduced in section 2 4 3 the calibrated parameters were shown in table 5 2 6 statistics analysis path analysis elucidates the degree of the direct effect of independent variables on the dependent variables as well as the indirect effect of one independent variable on the dependent variables through other independent variables sarawgi et al 1997 khazaie et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 this method was applied to compare the relative influences of environmental rn vpd ta and swc and vegetation laic factors through et or tc es on tc et es et based on daily input data generalized linear model root mean square error rmse and r2 r is the correlation coefficient were used to validate the model performances 3 results and analysis 3 1 environmental factors and crop conditions the variations and mean of the environmental and vegetation factors during the 2018 2020 growing seasons were illustrated in fig 2 and table 6 respectively ta increased gradually from mid march but decreased gradually after reaching its maximum in july with an average of21 9 1 0 mean 1 standard deviation during the three growing seasons vpd did not exhibit apparent seasonal variations with an average of 0 53 0 9 kpa rn fluctuated largely during the growing season with an average of77 9 7 2 w m 2 daily u2 did fluctuate largely during the growing seasons with a daily average of1 12 0 02 m s 1 the total precipitation was 1429 0 1322 4 and 1257 7 mm the total irrigation amount was 147 7 134 3 and 107 4 mm during the 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively table 7 and concentrated primarily in march may the mean swc was generally above 35 except for several days at the start of the growing season with a daily average of41 1 1 9 both laic and lait presented single curves with respective daily averages for the three growing seasons of 2 2 0 2 m2 m 2 and 2 9 0 2 m2 m 2 lait was always larger than laic due to the presence of understory weed 3 2 energy partitioning and its controls the seasonal variations of midday rn and its component le h and g were illustrated in fig 3 a midday le presented a parabolic trend and peak in august with a daily average of 113 8 97 9 and 104 2 w m 2 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3d the trend of midday h was opposite to le changes during the growing season with a daily average of 39 3 39 6 and 33 5 w m 2 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively while g did not present noticeable seasonal variations seasonal ef presented a parabolic trend fig 3b ranging from 0 20 to 1 35 while h rn showed opposite seasonal patterns with ef the mean ef was 0 73 0 72 and 0 79 h rn was 0 23 0 26 and 0 23 in the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3e higher ef values indicated that le consumed most of rn over the growing seasons g rn values were low during the growing seasons indicating that g contributed little to the surface energy balance β showed opposite seasonal patterns with ef with the mean of 0 36 0 43 and 0 33 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3c f the lower β indicated most of the rn was converted to the le relationships of ef and β with the surface biophysical factors were portrayed in fig 4 ef was positively correlated with the increasing lait r2 0 67 0 86 p 0 05 or 0 01 fig 4a β showed an opposite relationship with increasing lait r2 0 52 0 95 p 0 05 or 0 001 fig 4e demonstrating that more rn was converted to le with the development of underlying vegetation both ef and β were closely related to gs ω and α but with an opposite trend e g ef increased linearly with gs while β decreased linearly with gs fig 4b f such adverse characteristics indicated that more radiation energy was released with the form of le with increasing gs ω and α 3 3 et partitioning and its controls the seasonal variations of measured et and its component tc es were illustrated in fig 5 a et fluctuated largely and reached its peak in august fig 5a with a daily average of 2 98 2 51 and 2 69 mm d 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons fig 5d respectively tc increased gradually and peaked during the active growing seasons then decreased gradually as the leaves wilt the mean tc was 1 21 1 02 and 0 92 mm d 1 mean es was 1 32 1 09 and 1 10 mm d 1 in the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively the sum of tc and es was usually lower than et tc es 0 71et r2 0 94 fig 5b e tc et increased and tended to be steady as the canopy fully developed however some anomalous tc et appeared during the late growing season fig 5c the daily mean tc et was 0 46 0 41 and 0 44 es et was 0 41 0 39 and 0 40 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 5f both tc et and es et strongly correlated with laic but with opposite trends fig 6 meanwhile tc et became higher while es et became lower when the data collected in september and october were excluded during which the leaves begin to senesce and fall off the fallen leaves covering the ground surface may suppress actual et by limiting water evaporation from the soil which may be the reason for the high tc et and low es et values during the late growing season fig 5c besides the variation of tc et was large during the active growing season tc appeared to be stable fig 5a and the large change in tc et may be caused by large fluctuations in et the effects of environmental factors on et partitioning were analyzed by path analysis during the active growing season 2 5 m2 m 2 laic fig 7 the results showed that et controlled the tc et confirmed by the higher standardized path coefficient of et 0 76 than tc 0 18 fig 7a among the abiotic factors rn ta and vpd were the dominant factors controlling tc et meanwhile the negative indirect effects of rn ta and vpd through et were more prominent than their positive effects through tc indicating that the considerable negative effects of rn ta and vpd on tc et were exerted through affecting et fig 7b showed that es controlled the es et with a higher standardized path coefficient of es 0 73 than et 0 22 the standardized path coefficients showed that the strong control of rn ta and vpd on es et was exerted through regulating es the standardized path coefficient of the swc on tc et and es et were insignificant indicating that et partitioning was insensitive to soil moisture in this humid site 3 4 comparison of model performance in simulating water flux seasonal variations and the relationships between simulated and measured daily et and its components tc and es were shown in figs 8 9 a significant relationship was found between the et simulated by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models and the measured et by ec p 0 01 with r2 of 0 92 0 84 and 0 89 rmse of 0 55 0 68 and 0 55 mm d 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively suggesting that all the methods yielded reliable estimates fig 9a c the mean values of the simulated et by the pt jpl model 2 59 mm d 1 s w model 2 41 mm d 1 and dual fao model 2 63 mm d 1 underestimated the actual et 2 73 mm d 1 during the growing seasons fig 9j results showed that the et simulated by the pt jpl model was the closest to the actual et followed by dual fao and s w model the simulated tc values by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models 0 96 1 08 mm d 1 were approximately equal to measured tc 1 05 mm d 1 fig 9k a significant relationship was found between the simulated tc by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models and actual tc p 0 01 with r2 of 0 71 0 74 and 0 70 rmse of 0 40 0 35 and 0 36 mm d 1 respectively fig 9d f however the simulated es was slightly worse than that of tc with r2 between simulations and measured values of 0 63 0 69 and 0 67 and rmse of 0 44 0 38 and 0 41 mm d 1 respectively fig 9g i the three models yielded similar results in estimating tc and es with the s w model performing slightly better than the pt jpl and dual fao model 4 discussion 4 1 effects of biophysical factors on energy allocation the close relationship between ef and lait suggested that vegetation development could regulate energy allocation during the growing season chen et al 2009 the positive relationship between the two indicated that more energy was released in the form of le with increasing vegetation cover because the plant canopy serving as a sink for rn indirectly influences surface heat fluxes through its impacts on the transpiration process during the period of higher lait g is low and rn is approximate to h le a change in le must result in an opposite change in h therefore a negative relationship between lait and β was found changes in energy allocation related to lai have also been found in previous studies chen et al 2009 williams and torn 2015 results of our study found that gc dominated the energy partition process gc is the weighted integral of an individual leaf s conductance wilson et al 2000 therefore gc is a comprehensive reflection of laic and stomatal conductance margonis et al 2018 wilson et al 2000 the increased ef and decreased β with the increasing α indicated that more rn was consumed in the form of le rather than h with the increasing surface moisture williams and torn 2015 ω was used to separate the atmospheric and vegetation influences on le the low ω indicated that le was strongly controlled by gc which was actually constrained by the soil water availability and vpd a lack of moisture in combination with vpd led to a significant decrease in stomatal conductance which limited the release of le so that a large proportion of the available energy flux was released in the form of h similar in low gc conditions however under non limiting moisture conditions le was decoupled from the atmosphere gc and vpd were non restrictive to le anymore energy allocation was controlled by available energy similar in high α conditions odongo et al 2016 4 2 the controls of et partitioning our results indicated that the effects of the factors controlling et partitioning varied with variations of canopy cover and atmospheric factors tc increased rapidly at low lai and was stable at high lai therefore an increasing tc et was driven by the increase of lai the results were consistent with a global synthesis of lai served as the dominant factor influencing tc et through influencing tc wang et al 2014 since water gas exchange between the atmosphere and vegetation canopy was regulated by leaf stomata the pores on plant leaves lian et al 2018 es usually accounted for a large proportion of et when vegetation coverage was low since light can easily reach the soil surface and raise soil temperature fatichi and pappas 2017 then es et declined as the canopy developed fig 5c therefore a negative correlation between es et and lai was due to increased shading caused by leaves limited es mendez barroso et al 2014 et and its components showed negligible correlation with swc but showed high correlations with atmospheric factors vpd par and ta during the active growing seasons laic 2 5 m2 m 2 such different responses implied relatively stronger atmospheric control over water use in this humid region because the soil water supply was ample from abundant rainfall or irrigation the negative effects of the rn ta and vpd on tc et represented a large difference between tc and et with the increased atmospheric evaporative demand high rn ta and vpd fig 10 a c under higher potential evaporation conditions high laic rn ta and vpd tc steadily contributed to the et during the active growing seasons at a high rate because the available energy was mostly intercepted by the canopy and the energy was transformed into le however tc was well exponentially related to et fig 10b average tc became almost constant with the increase of et when tc closed to 2 2 mm d 1 a possible explanation was that the strong rn in combination with high ta and vpd would reduce the stomatal conductance of the foliage chen et al 2020 hu et al 2009 which limited tc and caused a decline in tc et with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand in contrast the overall positive effect of the rn ta and vpd on es et indicated a more minor difference between es and et with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand fig 10c es was a physical process that was only affected by the atmospheric evaporation demand and soil moisture therefore regulating vegetation physiology may cause energy to be redistributed between tc and es decreased tc energy could be used to increase es therefore es is likely the main component of et at the high et values and can cause an increase in es et at our kiwi orchard site 4 3 model performances and uncertainties all the methods yielded reliable results in estimating et with calibrated parameters fig 9a c with the pt jpl model performing slightly better than s w and dual fao model numerous studies have proved that the pt jpl model is suitable for simulating et because the model is calculated based on input energy which is the main driving factor for et in humid regions fisher et al 2008 liu et al 2020a since all the three models contain rn g in their equation as one of the important factors the performances of the three models were satisfied both measured tc es and simulated et underestimated the actual et in this study fig 5e and fig 9a c the et components include evaporation from intercepted water on wet vegetation canopy ei es tc and non woody vegetation transpiration mainly grass tgrass however few studies attempt to quantify the role of interception as part of the et flux due to the lack of effective measurement of ei recent studies revealed that the global multi year average ratio of ei to et for the different remote sensing based models was between 0 08 and 0 17 lawrence et al 2007 chen et al 2022 however ei was not directly measured in this study xing et al 2021 found the average ei et value was 0 11 for open shrubland and 0 16 for crop sites but a higher value appeared in some areas in southern china often rainforests based on a modified pt jpl model for our kiwi site with sparse canopy the portion of ei can reach around 11 et according to the pt jpl model fig 11 b which is relatively reasonable compared with those of other similar studies gu et al 2018 talsma et al 2018 chen et al 2022 therefore ignoring the ei may be the reason for underestimating the actual et in the s w model fig 9b fatichi and pappas 2017 and shimizu et al 2015 also reported that ei was not negligible especially for the humid region ecosystem with high lai raz yaseef et al 2012 however the simulated tc of the pt jpl model was relatively poor the tc process was regulated by both physiological and environmental factors failure to consider the influence of stomatal regulation may explain the slightly poorer performance in simulating tc for the pt jpl model s w model has been widely applied because of its suitable physical mechanisms for separately describing water vapor from the soil surface and plant canopy li et al 2013 our study also proved that s w model was suitable in estimating et components in our kiwifruit site fig 9 e h however there are still many uncertain parameters in the s w model such as the minimum stomal resistance which is very empirical and still has many arguments chen et al 2020 liu et al 2020c bao et al 2021b the change of the orchard canopy did not always satisfy the dual source layered the soil layer and the vegetation layer assumptions of the s w model as the dropped leaves and grass cover would affect the energy absorption by the land surface and suppress the es in the late growing seasons ortega farias et al 2010 kiwifruit crop coefficient in humid climates is unavailable in existing literature the crop coefficient values derived in this study can fill this gap the dual fao model performed well in simulating et components tc and es since kcb and ke were calibrated by the measured value at different stages of growth numerous studies have proved the dual fao is suitable for daily et components evaluation with the calibrated coefficient zhang et al 2013 anapalli et al 2020 liu et al 2020b however the study demonstrated that the resulting crop coefficient kc where kc et eto for the mid and late kiwi growth season was 1 21 1 36 slightly higher than the corresponding values 1 05 suggested by allen et al 1998 the calibrated kc 0 98 at the initial growing season was also higher than the recommended value 0 40 such differences may arise from the large es irrigation was applied at the initial growing season and the precipitation in the mid and late kiwi growth season was frequent at our kiwi orchard site adequate irrigation and natural precipitation ensured the soil moisture was free of drought therefore ks may contribute a lot to the higher kc 4 4 implications and limitations as the primary region for kiwifruit plantation in china kiwifruit cultivation is increasing and has developed a pillar industry for rural economic development and industrial poverty alleviation in southwest china jiang et al 2022 zheng et al 2020 the increasing kiwifruit plantation will replace the common crop rice wheat rotation system rice is cultivated during summer jun and autumn oct or nov while winter wheat is grown from late autumn nov or dec to late spring may planted in this region qiu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the seasonal et was 691 4 587 3 and 559 5 mm the lower value in 2020 was due to lack of observations at the start of the 2020 growing season table 7 with the daily average of 2 51 2 98 mm d 1 during the three growing seasons however the total kiwi orchard et of the year was unclear due to the lack of et observations during the non growing season qiu et al 2019 found the total et of the rice wheat rotation system over the whole growing season was 765 841 mm in the humid region of south china using the bowen ratio energy balance with the et of rice was 561 3 and 527 1 mm for the 2017 and 2018 seasons and the et of winter wheat was 285 4 and 279 4 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively qiu et al 2019 besides a high average daily et rate of 4 76 5 05 mm d 1 for rice was observed using the water balance method shao et al 2014 a recent study indicated that the total et for winter wheat can reach 450 7 mm 2 58 mm d 1 using a large weighted lysimeter in the yangtze plain liu et al 2020a although the reported et of rice and wheat based on different measurement methods varied considerably the total et values were larger than that of the kiwifruit since the total et of only rice was nearly comparable to that of kiwifruit even the growth period of rice approx 150 days was shorter than kiwifruit approx 230 days qiu et al 2019 shao et al 2014 although the region crop water use can be expected to be reduced due to increasing kiwifruit planting replacing the common rice wheat rotation system a recent study demonstrated that southwest china is experiencing a warm and dry environment which will increase crop water demand jiang et al 2019 chengdu plain is not only one of the most developed agricultural regions but also a densely populated area in china the consumption of industrial water and domestic water has been increasing rapidly with the rapid growth of the economy and urban population in recent decades which will occupy more available water resources therefore more irrigation facilities and water management techniques are required to maintain crop production in the chengdu plain the measures of water saving irrigation in chengdu plain need to be considered through the aspects of engineering drip irrigation micro irrigation etc agronomy regulated deficit irrigation mulching summer pruning and or removing shaded leaves ect li et al 2013 xiloyannis et al 2000 zheng et al 2020 management water price government policy etc zhao et al 2021 and so on 5 conclusion through the integrated observations from the ec tower the sap flow technique and micro lysimeters the variations of energy and water fluxes were investigated and their influencing factors in a humid orchard during the 2018 2020 growing seasons were analyzed the applicability of the three models pt jpl s w and dual fao models in estimating et and its components were also estimated the main conclusions are as follows 1 le dominated the consumption of available energy and consumed 78 88 rn in this humid site energy partitioning and transfer were characterized by surface biophysical variables like gs ω α and vegetation cover lait 2 tc accounted for 41 46 et in the orchard tc et was well captured by canopy vegetation and phenology while atmospheric evaporative demand higher rn ta and vpd dominated tc et during the active growing season laic 2 5 m2 m 2 3 et and its component were well captured by the dual fao s w and pt jpl models pt jpl model was suitable to simulate et due to considering the water interception by the canopy in the humid site s w model

3343,understanding energy and water flux cycling and quantifying their components are essential steps to elucidate the hydrological process and sustainable water resources management in agricultural ecosystems the challenge of partitioning energy and evapotranspiration et components canopy transpiration tc and surface evaporation es was addressed by the combination of eddy covariance ec technique micro lysimeters and sap flow methods in a humid region kiwifruit orchard of southwest china the variations of energy and water flux and their controls were assessed then the measured et and its component were compared with the simulated values by priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl shuttleworth wallace s w and fao 56 dual crop coefficient models dual fao the results showed that latent heat flux le dominated the consumption of net radiation energy rn with the averaged ratio ef le rn above 0 70 during the growing seasons more radiation energy is released in the form of le with increased surface moisture and vegetation cover total leaf area index lait tc accounted for 41 46 et the increase of canopy leaf area index laic strongly affected et partitioning through the early growing seasons while atmospheric evaporation demand dominated the tc et and even caused the energy to be redistributed since high atmospheric evaporation demand caused a decrease of tc while an increase of es during the active growing seasons laic 2 5 m2 m 2 all the et models performed well in estimating et r2 0 84 0 92 and its components tc r2 0 70 0 74 es r2 0 63 0 69 allowing individual estimation of water interception by the canopy is one of the merits of the pt jpl model for et simulation in this humid site with r2 of 0 92 rmse of 0 55 mm d 1 while the s w model performed slightly better in et component simulations tc r2 0 74 rmse 0 35 mm d 1 es r2 0 69 rmse 0 38 mm d 1 the results of our study may have much referential significance for eco hydrological process analysis and water flux estimation in regions with similar environmental conditions keywords kiwifruit orchard energy and water flux evapotranspiration eddy covariance transpiration 1 introduction energy flux exchange and water flux transport between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere are essential components in hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles influencing local regional and even global environmental conditions fatichi and pappas 2017 talsma et al 2018 meanwhile energy flux and water vapor flux are closely related as latent flux le λet can be converted to evapotranspiration et by dividing the latent heat of vaporization λ accurate estimation of et is fundamental to making decisions on sustainable agricultural water resource management dar et al 2017 li et al 2016 et consists of transpiration t and evaporation e t is the process by which water moves from the soil through the organs or tissues into the atmosphere by the productive form of water use jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 e is the water loss in the form of unproductive through the soil or wet leaf surface partitioning water fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems can give valuable information on the productive use of water through t and e many studies have been conducted in direct quantifying et and its component across biomes iida et al 2020 shimizu et al 2015 for example fatichi and pappas 2017 investigate the variability of t et across biomes with a mechanistic ecohydrological model kumagai et al 2014 and shimizu et al 2015 systematically revealed the changes of et and its components in a coniferous plantation which is valuable for forest ecosystem water management et is affected by interactions among plant physiology canopy structure and environmental conditions li et al 2018 liu et al 2019a bao et al 2021a but e and t differed in their response to biotic and abiotic factors due to the different water consumption mechanisms jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 besides the controls of et and its components may vary in the various plant types across the different climate regions wang et al 2014 benyon et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2017 reported that available energy dominated et variation by affecting t in the wet regions while soil moisture dominated et dynamics by regulating e in the arid regions therefore there is an urgent need to investigate how et and its partition are mediated by abiotic and biotic pathways numerous methods have been introduced to measure et and its component e g sap flow and micro lysimeters mly zhang et al 2016 tie et al 2018 stable isotope technique ma and song 2019 williams et al 2004 and ec or large aperture scintillometers with bowen ratio system wilson et al 2001 lopez olivari et al 2016 which are common instruments for directly measuring et but direct measurements are always time consuming and costly the modeling approach has been more popular because of its broad applicability across time and space scales tie et al 2018 liu et al 2019b among the et models shuttleworth wallace s w model is a well known two layer et model widely used because of its suitable physical mechanisms to describe t and e processes separately shuttleworth and wallace 1985 bao et al 2021a bao et al 2021c in addition the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl empirically simulates et based on air temperature and solar radiation showing good agreement with observations in the humid region priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2008 besides the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dual fao model is an indirect method of calculating et from reference crop evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 based on two separate coefficients i e basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ks recommended by the fao the dual fao has been widely used in estimating crop et and its components anapalli et al 2020 ding et al 2013 liu et al 2020a however crop coefficients for kiwifruit in subtropical humid monsoon climate regions have not been provided by the fao thus although models for simulating et and its components have been developed their applicability for different ecosystems still requires extensive verification kiwifruit actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan is an increasingly important crop in southwest china occupying 13 of the global kiwifruit planted area 246 thousand ha up to 2017 zheng et al 2020 optimal kiwifruit production requires precise water management practices which can benefit from a deep understanding of water partitioning in the kiwifruit orchard therefore the ec measurements of et the sap flow of t tc and the micro lysimeter of e es in a typical kiwifruit field in chengdu plain china were conducted from 2018 to 2020 growing seasons the study aims to 1 investigate the energy partitioning and its relationship with biophysical factors 2 characterize the seasonal variations of et and its component i e tc es and analyze how et partitioning is mediated by vegetation and environmental factors and 3 evaluate the applicability of the three existing models pt jpl s w and dual fao in simulating et and its component in this humid orchard 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted during the kiwifruit growing seasons from march 2018 to october 2020 at the kiwifruit experimental base in pujiang county located in the chengdu plain china 30 3262n 103 4252e approximately 537 m a s l fig 1 this region is classified as am subtropical monsoon humid climate according to the köppen climate classification which is hot and rainy in the summer annual mean ta is 16 3 rainfall is 1301 mm sunshine hours is 1122 h year 1 and relative humidity is 84 during 1961 2019 observed by a nearby national meteorological station wenjiang station the main soil type is yellow brown loam with a bulk density of 1 28 1 45 g cm 3 consisting of approximately 76 80 silt 12 29 sand and 10 91 clay at 0 100 cm soil depth the saturated soil water content swc and field capacity in volumetric value are 47 and 34 respectively the orchard field was approximately 133 ha in size consisting of a 15 year old plantation dominated by kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan 95 the trees were equally spaced with a distance of 5 0 4 5 m along the kiwi fruit row direction the cement pillars were installed every 8 m with a height of 1 8 m on which 3 iron wires were pulled left and right for fixing the kiwi branches the canopy height of the trees ranged from 1 8 to 2 2 m and the diameter at breast height ranged from 8 to 12 cm understory weeds mainly include alternanthera philoxeroides mart griseb echinochloa crusgalli l besuv and malachium aquatieurn l fries and was maintained at low densities through the use of herbicides the orchard was irrigated with a sprinkler irrigation system and irrigation was mainly applied in march may during which the swc fell below 60 of the saturated swc adequate irrigation and natural precipitation ensured the trees were free of water deficit 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 flux data measurements processes and gap filling a closed path eddy covariance system was equipped with a fast response three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific inc ut usa to measure the fluctuation in wind velocity components and sonic temperature and a closed path co2 h2o gas analyzer ec155 campbell scientific inc usa to measure the water vapor and co2 density fluctuations the ec system was installed at the east central part of the kiwifruit orchard with the sensors installed at a height of 8 0 m the orchard provided a large and homogeneous fetch with a minimum fetch length of about 1 1 km raw high frequency 10 hz flux data was recorded by a data logger cr6 campbell scientific inc usa the data was processed using the eddypro software following the standard routines including double coordinate rotation time lags compensation low and high frequency corrections falge et al 2001 the data were then collected and averaged at half hour intervals using the datalogger support software 4 4 campbell scientific inc usa the half hour data were then carefully filtered according to the following criteria 1 incomplete half hourly measurements 2 the processed eddypro data carrying quality flags in value ranging from 1 higher quality to 9 lower quality and the fluxes with a quality flag of 7 9 were removed anapalli et al 2020 gao et al 2018 3 friction velocity u was used as the main criterion of turbulence intensity and only flux data with high turbulence conditions were regarded as reliable data u 0 15 m s 1 papale et al 2006 a total of 10 8 daytime and 39 5 nighttime le data were removed according to the above criteria for the gaps during the rainy conditions le was filled referring to the rainy data with high quality quality flag of 1 3 using the filter method ding et al 2010 specifically a function between le and saturated water vapor pressure deficit vpd was established using the rainy data with high quality then the function was used to fill the data gaps during the rainy time please see the supplemental information for the data gaps without rainfall shorter gaps 2h were filled with linear interpolation and larger gaps 2h were filled using mean diurnal variation mdv according to the methods proposed in reichstein et al 2005 the energy balance closure ebc statistics were used to check the quality of flux data the ebc values calculated by half hour data were 0 91 0 93 and 0 82 during the 2018 2020 growing seasons table 1 respectively the lower ebc appearing in the 2020 growing season may cause by a shorter observation period but with more rainfall events the degree of ebc of this site was comparable to the reported results in global fluxnet wilson et al 2002 and chinaflux zhu et al 2006 however as reported in many works of literature the energy fluxes were are not completely closed ascribed to the underestimation of le and h wilson et al 2002 liu et al 2020b in this study for daily ec based data the energy budget components were forced closed by redistributing the residual energy re calculated as rn g le h according to the evaporative fraction ef method gebler et al 2014 jiang et al 2021 the corrected le was described as le le re ef jiang et al 2021 where le is the latent heat fluxes after the energy balance closing then the le was used to estimate et 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological and soil sensors were installed to monitor environmental factors and the number and installation height of the sensors are described in table 2 the observed variables included global total radiation rg net radiation rn ta

meteorological technology co ltd jinzhou cn 2 2 3 leaf area index measurements eight sample plots were randomly selected every 1 2 weeks for measuring canopy leaf area index laic with a leaf meter lai 2000 li cor inc usa covering the double rows and the space between two adjacent double rows underlying total surface lai lait including canopy grass and other green vegetation was derived at eight day intervals with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 km modis reflectance product modis 15a2h https modis ornl gov data html spikes presented in the raw lait data were smoothed using the timesat software jonsson and eklundh 2004 finally the 8 day lait data and measured laic data were interpolated to a daily scale using a spline function 2 2 4 sap flow measurements plant sap flux was measured using the thermal dissipation method with granier type sensors granier 1987 in our study eight trees were selected as the experimental tree each sensor consists of a pair of probes the upper probe is a heater supplied with 0 2 w constant power and the lower probe is unheated as a reference the temperature difference between the paired heated and unheated probe δt was used to calculate fd according to the granier method granier 1987 each sensor was installed on the south facing side of the trees at 0 60 m above the ground and the part of the trunk where the sensors were inserted was fully isolated by the sunscreen film to prevent any direct radiation it is known that sap flow rate from sensors positioned on the sunlit side of tree crowns is often overestimated e g oren et al 1998 while in this artificial orchard the kiwi tree canopy does not differentiate the shaded side and sunlit side due to its horizontal canopy structural feature the sap flow difference between north or south facing side was ignored in this study 1 f d 118 99 10 6 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where fd is the plant sap flux density m3 m 2 s 1 δtmax is the maximal temperature difference when sap flux is 0 plant sap flux was then scaled to ground based transpiration using a survey see below before installing the sensors the characteristics of the trees sapwood thickness heartwood in the ec flux footprint were investigated to obtain the necessary scaling variables a total of 32 trees were selected randomly within a 600 600 m plot with the tower in the central position sapwood thickness of each experimental tree was measured on a core extracted with a 5 mm increment borer at 0 6 m above the ground the heartwood area depth was visually identified by its distinct color differences the entire trunk section below the bark of the tree was considered to be active in sap transportation except for a small area with a diameter of 0 5 cm at the center of the stem the conducting xylem section area was calculated as a circular area the ratio of ac ag ac is the average conducting xylem section area and ag is the ground area ag 5 0 m 4 5 m of each tree was further estimated tree sap flow was scaled to ecosystem scale transpiration tc mm d 1 using the following formula oren et al 1998 2 t c f d a c a g 86 4 10 6 where 86 4 106 is the unit conversion factor from m3 m 2 s 1 to mm d 1 2 2 5 soil surface evaporation measurement es was measured using eight micro lysimeters that were 10 cm in diameter and 18 cm in deep the soil in the micro lysimeters mly was replaced every 2 days or replaced after rains the mly was weighed at pre dawn and sun set every day using an electronic balance in order to ensure the original characteristics of the soil surface we did not remove the weeds growing on the soil surface the soil surface evaporation es mm d 1 was calculated as below 3 e s 10 δ w ρ w π d 2 2 where δ w is the difference in weight g ρ w is the density of water g cm 3 and d is the diameter of the micro lysimeter 2 3 surface parameters calculation in this study evaporative fraction ef le rn and bowen ratio β h le were used to quantify the account of le for rn and the conversion relationship between h and le respectively four biophysical parameters including lait surface conductance gs decoupling coefficient ω priestly taylor coefficient α were used to reveal the controls of surface properties on energy flux partitioning the detailed calculation and descriptions of the biophysical parameters can be found in table 3 and references chen et al 2009 odongo et al 2016 williams

according to the measured tc and es value at different stages of growth the division of growth stages of kiwifruit can be found in table 4 or zheng et al 2020 2 5 parameters calibration in this study αc in the pt jpl rs c and rs s in the s w model as well as kcb and ks in the dual fao were the parameters that need to be calibrated for the calibration of the αc in the pt jpl rs c and rs s in s w model when estimating et the parameters were determined by the non linear least squares fitting method with et measured by ec during the three growing seasons the parameters αc k1 k2 and k3 were determined to be 1 16 43 2 0 34 and 0 003 coefficients a and b were determined to be 195 6 and 5 1 respectively table 5 meanwhile tc measured by sap flow was used as a dependent variable to calibrate αc k1 k2 and k3 when only tc module was used in pt jpl and s w model and es measured by mly was used as a dependent variable to calibrate a and b when only es module was used in s w model by the non linear least squares fitting method kcb and ks in dual fao model were calibrated as introduced in section 2 4 3 the calibrated parameters were shown in table 5 2 6 statistics analysis path analysis elucidates the degree of the direct effect of independent variables on the dependent variables as well as the indirect effect of one independent variable on the dependent variables through other independent variables sarawgi et al 1997 khazaie et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 this method was applied to compare the relative influences of environmental rn vpd ta and swc and vegetation laic factors through et or tc es on tc et es et based on daily input data generalized linear model root mean square error rmse and r2 r is the correlation coefficient were used to validate the model performances 3 results and analysis 3 1 environmental factors and crop conditions the variations and mean of the environmental and vegetation factors during the 2018 2020 growing seasons were illustrated in fig 2 and table 6 respectively ta increased gradually from mid march but decreased gradually after reaching its maximum in july with an average of21 9 1 0 mean 1 standard deviation during the three growing seasons vpd did not exhibit apparent seasonal variations with an average of 0 53 0 9 kpa rn fluctuated largely during the growing season with an average of77 9 7 2 w m 2 daily u2 did fluctuate largely during the growing seasons with a daily average of1 12 0 02 m s 1 the total precipitation was 1429 0 1322 4 and 1257 7 mm the total irrigation amount was 147 7 134 3 and 107 4 mm during the 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively table 7 and concentrated primarily in march may the mean swc was generally above 35 except for several days at the start of the growing season with a daily average of41 1 1 9 both laic and lait presented single curves with respective daily averages for the three growing seasons of 2 2 0 2 m2 m 2 and 2 9 0 2 m2 m 2 lait was always larger than laic due to the presence of understory weed 3 2 energy partitioning and its controls the seasonal variations of midday rn and its component le h and g were illustrated in fig 3 a midday le presented a parabolic trend and peak in august with a daily average of 113 8 97 9 and 104 2 w m 2 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3d the trend of midday h was opposite to le changes during the growing season with a daily average of 39 3 39 6 and 33 5 w m 2 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively while g did not present noticeable seasonal variations seasonal ef presented a parabolic trend fig 3b ranging from 0 20 to 1 35 while h rn showed opposite seasonal patterns with ef the mean ef was 0 73 0 72 and 0 79 h rn was 0 23 0 26 and 0 23 in the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3e higher ef values indicated that le consumed most of rn over the growing seasons g rn values were low during the growing seasons indicating that g contributed little to the surface energy balance β showed opposite seasonal patterns with ef with the mean of 0 36 0 43 and 0 33 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 3c f the lower β indicated most of the rn was converted to the le relationships of ef and β with the surface biophysical factors were portrayed in fig 4 ef was positively correlated with the increasing lait r2 0 67 0 86 p 0 05 or 0 01 fig 4a β showed an opposite relationship with increasing lait r2 0 52 0 95 p 0 05 or 0 001 fig 4e demonstrating that more rn was converted to le with the development of underlying vegetation both ef and β were closely related to gs ω and α but with an opposite trend e g ef increased linearly with gs while β decreased linearly with gs fig 4b f such adverse characteristics indicated that more radiation energy was released with the form of le with increasing gs ω and α 3 3 et partitioning and its controls the seasonal variations of measured et and its component tc es were illustrated in fig 5 a et fluctuated largely and reached its peak in august fig 5a with a daily average of 2 98 2 51 and 2 69 mm d 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons fig 5d respectively tc increased gradually and peaked during the active growing seasons then decreased gradually as the leaves wilt the mean tc was 1 21 1 02 and 0 92 mm d 1 mean es was 1 32 1 09 and 1 10 mm d 1 in the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively the sum of tc and es was usually lower than et tc es 0 71et r2 0 94 fig 5b e tc et increased and tended to be steady as the canopy fully developed however some anomalous tc et appeared during the late growing season fig 5c the daily mean tc et was 0 46 0 41 and 0 44 es et was 0 41 0 39 and 0 40 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively fig 5f both tc et and es et strongly correlated with laic but with opposite trends fig 6 meanwhile tc et became higher while es et became lower when the data collected in september and october were excluded during which the leaves begin to senesce and fall off the fallen leaves covering the ground surface may suppress actual et by limiting water evaporation from the soil which may be the reason for the high tc et and low es et values during the late growing season fig 5c besides the variation of tc et was large during the active growing season tc appeared to be stable fig 5a and the large change in tc et may be caused by large fluctuations in et the effects of environmental factors on et partitioning were analyzed by path analysis during the active growing season 2 5 m2 m 2 laic fig 7 the results showed that et controlled the tc et confirmed by the higher standardized path coefficient of et 0 76 than tc 0 18 fig 7a among the abiotic factors rn ta and vpd were the dominant factors controlling tc et meanwhile the negative indirect effects of rn ta and vpd through et were more prominent than their positive effects through tc indicating that the considerable negative effects of rn ta and vpd on tc et were exerted through affecting et fig 7b showed that es controlled the es et with a higher standardized path coefficient of es 0 73 than et 0 22 the standardized path coefficients showed that the strong control of rn ta and vpd on es et was exerted through regulating es the standardized path coefficient of the swc on tc et and es et were insignificant indicating that et partitioning was insensitive to soil moisture in this humid site 3 4 comparison of model performance in simulating water flux seasonal variations and the relationships between simulated and measured daily et and its components tc and es were shown in figs 8 9 a significant relationship was found between the et simulated by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models and the measured et by ec p 0 01 with r2 of 0 92 0 84 and 0 89 rmse of 0 55 0 68 and 0 55 mm d 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively suggesting that all the methods yielded reliable estimates fig 9a c the mean values of the simulated et by the pt jpl model 2 59 mm d 1 s w model 2 41 mm d 1 and dual fao model 2 63 mm d 1 underestimated the actual et 2 73 mm d 1 during the growing seasons fig 9j results showed that the et simulated by the pt jpl model was the closest to the actual et followed by dual fao and s w model the simulated tc values by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models 0 96 1 08 mm d 1 were approximately equal to measured tc 1 05 mm d 1 fig 9k a significant relationship was found between the simulated tc by the pt jpl s w and dual fao models and actual tc p 0 01 with r2 of 0 71 0 74 and 0 70 rmse of 0 40 0 35 and 0 36 mm d 1 respectively fig 9d f however the simulated es was slightly worse than that of tc with r2 between simulations and measured values of 0 63 0 69 and 0 67 and rmse of 0 44 0 38 and 0 41 mm d 1 respectively fig 9g i the three models yielded similar results in estimating tc and es with the s w model performing slightly better than the pt jpl and dual fao model 4 discussion 4 1 effects of biophysical factors on energy allocation the close relationship between ef and lait suggested that vegetation development could regulate energy allocation during the growing season chen et al 2009 the positive relationship between the two indicated that more energy was released in the form of le with increasing vegetation cover because the plant canopy serving as a sink for rn indirectly influences surface heat fluxes through its impacts on the transpiration process during the period of higher lait g is low and rn is approximate to h le a change in le must result in an opposite change in h therefore a negative relationship between lait and β was found changes in energy allocation related to lai have also been found in previous studies chen et al 2009 williams and torn 2015 results of our study found that gc dominated the energy partition process gc is the weighted integral of an individual leaf s conductance wilson et al 2000 therefore gc is a comprehensive reflection of laic and stomatal conductance margonis et al 2018 wilson et al 2000 the increased ef and decreased β with the increasing α indicated that more rn was consumed in the form of le rather than h with the increasing surface moisture williams and torn 2015 ω was used to separate the atmospheric and vegetation influences on le the low ω indicated that le was strongly controlled by gc which was actually constrained by the soil water availability and vpd a lack of moisture in combination with vpd led to a significant decrease in stomatal conductance which limited the release of le so that a large proportion of the available energy flux was released in the form of h similar in low gc conditions however under non limiting moisture conditions le was decoupled from the atmosphere gc and vpd were non restrictive to le anymore energy allocation was controlled by available energy similar in high α conditions odongo et al 2016 4 2 the controls of et partitioning our results indicated that the effects of the factors controlling et partitioning varied with variations of canopy cover and atmospheric factors tc increased rapidly at low lai and was stable at high lai therefore an increasing tc et was driven by the increase of lai the results were consistent with a global synthesis of lai served as the dominant factor influencing tc et through influencing tc wang et al 2014 since water gas exchange between the atmosphere and vegetation canopy was regulated by leaf stomata the pores on plant leaves lian et al 2018 es usually accounted for a large proportion of et when vegetation coverage was low since light can easily reach the soil surface and raise soil temperature fatichi and pappas 2017 then es et declined as the canopy developed fig 5c therefore a negative correlation between es et and lai was due to increased shading caused by leaves limited es mendez barroso et al 2014 et and its components showed negligible correlation with swc but showed high correlations with atmospheric factors vpd par and ta during the active growing seasons laic 2 5 m2 m 2 such different responses implied relatively stronger atmospheric control over water use in this humid region because the soil water supply was ample from abundant rainfall or irrigation the negative effects of the rn ta and vpd on tc et represented a large difference between tc and et with the increased atmospheric evaporative demand high rn ta and vpd fig 10 a c under higher potential evaporation conditions high laic rn ta and vpd tc steadily contributed to the et during the active growing seasons at a high rate because the available energy was mostly intercepted by the canopy and the energy was transformed into le however tc was well exponentially related to et fig 10b average tc became almost constant with the increase of et when tc closed to 2 2 mm d 1 a possible explanation was that the strong rn in combination with high ta and vpd would reduce the stomatal conductance of the foliage chen et al 2020 hu et al 2009 which limited tc and caused a decline in tc et with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand in contrast the overall positive effect of the rn ta and vpd on es et indicated a more minor difference between es and et with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand fig 10c es was a physical process that was only affected by the atmospheric evaporation demand and soil moisture therefore regulating vegetation physiology may cause energy to be redistributed between tc and es decreased tc energy could be used to increase es therefore es is likely the main component of et at the high et values and can cause an increase in es et at our kiwi orchard site 4 3 model performances and uncertainties all the methods yielded reliable results in estimating et with calibrated parameters fig 9a c with the pt jpl model performing slightly better than s w and dual fao model numerous studies have proved that the pt jpl model is suitable for simulating et because the model is calculated based on input energy which is the main driving factor for et in humid regions fisher et al 2008 liu et al 2020a since all the three models contain rn g in their equation as one of the important factors the performances of the three models were satisfied both measured tc es and simulated et underestimated the actual et in this study fig 5e and fig 9a c the et components include evaporation from intercepted water on wet vegetation canopy ei es tc and non woody vegetation transpiration mainly grass tgrass however few studies attempt to quantify the role of interception as part of the et flux due to the lack of effective measurement of ei recent studies revealed that the global multi year average ratio of ei to et for the different remote sensing based models was between 0 08 and 0 17 lawrence et al 2007 chen et al 2022 however ei was not directly measured in this study xing et al 2021 found the average ei et value was 0 11 for open shrubland and 0 16 for crop sites but a higher value appeared in some areas in southern china often rainforests based on a modified pt jpl model for our kiwi site with sparse canopy the portion of ei can reach around 11 et according to the pt jpl model fig 11 b which is relatively reasonable compared with those of other similar studies gu et al 2018 talsma et al 2018 chen et al 2022 therefore ignoring the ei may be the reason for underestimating the actual et in the s w model fig 9b fatichi and pappas 2017 and shimizu et al 2015 also reported that ei was not negligible especially for the humid region ecosystem with high lai raz yaseef et al 2012 however the simulated tc of the pt jpl model was relatively poor the tc process was regulated by both physiological and environmental factors failure to consider the influence of stomatal regulation may explain the slightly poorer performance in simulating tc for the pt jpl model s w model has been widely applied because of its suitable physical mechanisms for separately describing water vapor from the soil surface and plant canopy li et al 2013 our study also proved that s w model was suitable in estimating et components in our kiwifruit site fig 9 e h however there are still many uncertain parameters in the s w model such as the minimum stomal resistance which is very empirical and still has many arguments chen et al 2020 liu et al 2020c bao et al 2021b the change of the orchard canopy did not always satisfy the dual source layered the soil layer and the vegetation layer assumptions of the s w model as the dropped leaves and grass cover would affect the energy absorption by the land surface and suppress the es in the late growing seasons ortega farias et al 2010 kiwifruit crop coefficient in humid climates is unavailable in existing literature the crop coefficient values derived in this study can fill this gap the dual fao model performed well in simulating et components tc and es since kcb and ke were calibrated by the measured value at different stages of growth numerous studies have proved the dual fao is suitable for daily et components evaluation with the calibrated coefficient zhang et al 2013 anapalli et al 2020 liu et al 2020b however the study demonstrated that the resulting crop coefficient kc where kc et eto for the mid and late kiwi growth season was 1 21 1 36 slightly higher than the corresponding values 1 05 suggested by allen et al 1998 the calibrated kc 0 98 at the initial growing season was also higher than the recommended value 0 40 such differences may arise from the large es irrigation was applied at the initial growing season and the precipitation in the mid and late kiwi growth season was frequent at our kiwi orchard site adequate irrigation and natural precipitation ensured the soil moisture was free of drought therefore ks may contribute a lot to the higher kc 4 4 implications and limitations as the primary region for kiwifruit plantation in china kiwifruit cultivation is increasing and has developed a pillar industry for rural economic development and industrial poverty alleviation in southwest china jiang et al 2022 zheng et al 2020 the increasing kiwifruit plantation will replace the common crop rice wheat rotation system rice is cultivated during summer jun and autumn oct or nov while winter wheat is grown from late autumn nov or dec to late spring may planted in this region qiu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the seasonal et was 691 4 587 3 and 559 5 mm the lower value in 2020 was due to lack of observations at the start of the 2020 growing season table 7 with the daily average of 2 51 2 98 mm d 1 during the three growing seasons however the total kiwi orchard et of the year was unclear due to the lack of et observations during the non growing season qiu et al 2019 found the total et of the rice wheat rotation system over the whole growing season was 765 841 mm in the humid region of south china using the bowen ratio energy balance with the et of rice was 561 3 and 527 1 mm for the 2017 and 2018 seasons and the et of winter wheat was 285 4 and 279 4 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively qiu et al 2019 besides a high average daily et rate of 4 76 5 05 mm d 1 for rice was observed using the water balance method shao et al 2014 a recent study indicated that the total et for winter wheat can reach 450 7 mm 2 58 mm d 1 using a large weighted lysimeter in the yangtze plain liu et al 2020a although the reported et of rice and wheat based on different measurement methods varied considerably the total et values were larger than that of the kiwifruit since the total et of only rice was nearly comparable to that of kiwifruit even the growth period of rice approx 150 days was shorter than kiwifruit approx 230 days qiu et al 2019 shao et al 2014 although the region crop water use can be expected to be reduced due to increasing kiwifruit planting replacing the common rice wheat rotation system a recent study demonstrated that southwest china is experiencing a warm and dry environment which will increase crop water demand jiang et al 2019 chengdu plain is not only one of the most developed agricultural regions but also a densely populated area in china the consumption of industrial water and domestic water has been increasing rapidly with the rapid growth of the economy and urban population in recent decades which will occupy more available water resources therefore more irrigation facilities and water management techniques are required to maintain crop production in the chengdu plain the measures of water saving irrigation in chengdu plain need to be considered through the aspects of engineering drip irrigation micro irrigation etc agronomy regulated deficit irrigation mulching summer pruning and or removing shaded leaves ect li et al 2013 xiloyannis et al 2000 zheng et al 2020 management water price government policy etc zhao et al 2021 and so on 5 conclusion through the integrated observations from the ec tower the sap flow technique and micro lysimeters the variations of energy and water fluxes were investigated and their influencing factors in a humid orchard during the 2018 2020 growing seasons were analyzed the applicability of the three models pt jpl s w and dual fao models in estimating et and its components were also estimated the main conclusions are as follows 1 le dominated the consumption of available energy and consumed 78 88 rn in this humid site energy partitioning and transfer were characterized by surface biophysical variables like gs ω α and vegetation cover lait 2 tc accounted for 41 46 et in the orchard tc et was well captured by canopy vegetation and phenology while atmospheric evaporative demand higher rn ta and vpd dominated tc et during the active growing season laic 2 5 m2 m 2 3 et and its component were well captured by the dual fao s w and pt jpl models pt jpl model was suitable to simulate et due to considering the water interception by the canopy in the humid site s w model performed slightly better in estimating et components with calibrated parameters credit authorship contribution statement shouzheng jiang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

3344,arsenic as pollution in groundwater is an extremely concerning issue all over the world because it has brought many negative health effects on people however the impact of anthropogenic activities on the formation of high as groundwater is poorly understood seventy nine groundwater samples and seven surface water samples were taken along two transects in the yinchuan basin china to trace effects of anthropogenic activities on distribution of high as groundwater by using artificial sweeteners the sampling campaign showed that in 47 of samples as concentrations exceeded the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l both acesulfame and sucralose were detected in the groundwater samples and concentrations in samples from the transect of the upper stream of regional groundwater were generally higher than those from the transect of the middle stream both acesulfame and sucralose in all studied groundwater samples had the detection rate dr 7 and the detection frequency df 90 indicating that they can be used as tracers to reflect anthropogenic activities higher as groundwater samples generally had lower concentrations of the artificial sweeteners and vice versa showing that the influence of anthropogenic activities on high as concentration was limited geological processes are the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater high as groundwaters were characterized by moderate reducing conditions and the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides led to the release of the adsorbed as into groundwater additionally as desorption was another process to mobilize as under the conditions of elevated ph and or high hco3 this study provides an insight into relative contribution of anthropogenic activities and hydrogeochemical conditions to as enrichment in groundwater and highlights the necessity in protecting low as groundwater highly vulnerable to human activities in high as groundwater areas keywords arsenic groundwater anthropogenic activity artificial sweeteners 1 introduction the geological origin of arsenic as in groundwater is a global problem which has a significant impact on human health podgorski and berg 2020 chronic intake of high as groundwater can lead to a variety of human diseases guo et al 2011 mladenov et al 2014 wang et al 2019 such as severe skin pigmentation skin cancer and visceral cancer naujokas et al 2013 in addition the use of high as groundwater for agricultural irrigation and animal husbandry may pollute food especially rice thereby expanding its negative health impact even beyond the source area sharma et al 2014 punshon et al 2017 the main hydrogeochemical mechanisms increasing as concentrations in groundwater include 1 weathering of as bearing pyrite or arsenopyrite under oxidation conditions 2 as desorption at elevated ph or concentrations of competitive ions 3 reductive dissolution of as containing iron oxides and hydroxides and 4 dissimilatory arsenate reduction smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b high concentrations of as are usually associated with high ph and or reducing conditions haugen et al 2021 due to agricultural recharge of oxygenated groundwater or groundwater pumping as concentration in groundwater generally decreased during irrigation season but concentrations of no3 and so4 2 increased haugen et al 2021 dissolved organic matter is the key factor controlling as mobilization the high abundance of refractory organic compounds in high as groundwater may promote as enrichment through electron shuttle outcompeting adsorption and methylation qiao et al 2021 the distribution of high as groundwater is also related to the existence of wetlands the longer the wetland exists the greater the possibility of high as groundwater gao et al 2022 this may be related to the introduction of biodegradable organic matter into the shallow aquifer after which the as is released below the wetland and transported to the shallow aquifer under continuous wetland water recharge gao et al 2022 the organic matter would be sourced either from natural organic matter in sediments or porewater neumann et al 2014 guo et al 2019 or from surface derived organic matter whaley martin et al 2017 however it is still unknown whether anthropogenic activities impact as mobilization in groundwater artificial sweeteners are widely used as sugar substitutes in food beverages and pharmaceuticals lange et al 2012 because they provide no or negligible energy kroger et al 2006 artificial sweeteners are recognized as effective sewage tracers in aqueous environment because they have high water solubility low adsorption capacity in soil and low biodegradability ishii et al 2021 for instance artificial sweeteners are detected in lakes and rivers with wastewater discharge spoelstra et al 2013 perkola and sainio 2014 oldfield et al 2020 and in groundwater where the septic tank systems discharge the treated wastewater underground van stempvoort et al 2011 robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 snider et al 2017 spoelstra et al 2017 yang et al 2017 artificial sweeteners in groundwater may come from the leakage of urban sewer infrastructure wolf et al 2012 tran et al 2014 lee et al 2015 and seepage of landfills roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 therefore the artificial sweeteners including acesulfame sucralose and saccharin are recently used to trace effects of anthropogenic activities on groundwater in canada japan and china robertson et al 2016a nitka et al 2019 ma et al 2021 li et al 2021 ishii et al 2021 high as groundwater has been found in the yinchuan basin china previous studies have shown that the high as groundwater mainly occurs in low lying topographically flat flood plains and alluvial lacustrine plains where the groundwater is mainly recharged by canal leakage and irrigation infiltration guo et al 2014b han et al 2013 groundwater as concentrations in the shallow unconfined aquifer han et al 2010 and alluvial lacustrine aquifers guo et al 2014b are mainly controlled by the redox potential and competitive adsorption which lead to high mobility of as guo et al 2014b sun et al 2021 with the increase in well depth as concentrations gradually decrease in groundwater han et al 2010 low as groundwater was mainly observed in piedmont proluvial inclining area and alluvial plain with high elevations and low agricultural activities guo et al 2014b han et al 2013 however it cannot yet be ruled out that anthropogenic activities affect the distribution of as in groundwater of the basin concentration and distribution of artificial sweeteners in groundwater in this area have therefore been analyzed to reveal the potential impact of anthropogenic activities on the distribution of high as groundwater therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 delineate distributions of artificial sweeteners in groundwater from two representative transects in the yinchuan basin 2 explore the potential of the sweeteners as tracers of anthropogenic activities and 3 assess whether how anthropogenic activities affect as concentration in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the yinchuan basin is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river with high terrain in the west and low terrain in the east the climate is a typical continental arid and semi arid climate with less rainfall and strong evaporation qian et al 2012 li et al 2019 the annual precipitation in the southeast is high about 201 mm and is low in the northeast about 177 mm the evaporation shows an increasing trend with the increase in elevation the water resources in the basin mainly come from the yellow river the yellow river is located in the east of the basin with a total length of about 191 km which has an important impact on the formation and evolution of the landform of the basin irrigation channels and drainage ditches are widely distributed in the basin with a large number of lakes and swamps li et al 2019 the quaternary sediments are widely distributed in the basin with a maximum thickness of over 1600 m which consist of proluvial alluvial and lacustrine deposits and aeolian sediments wu et al 2008 the single phreatic aquifer is mainly distributed in the western and southern parts of the basin which is mainly composed of proluvial sand and gravel in the western part alluvial fans of helan mountains and alluvial sand and coarse sand at the southern parts the qingtongxia gorge groundwater is abundant with good quality in the single phreatic aquifer the multi layer aquifer occurs in the flat plain which can be divided into the phreatic aquifer the first confined aquifer and the second confined aquifer from top to bottom up to the depth of about 250 m below ground level bgl the thickness of phreatic aquifer is generally from 10 to 50 m the buried depth of the first confined aquifer is generally from 35 to 110 m bgl with the thickness of 50 to 100 m the buried depth of the second confined aquifer is from 240 to 260 m bgl with thickness of 50 to 110 m there are relatively continuous aquitards between the phreatic aquifer and the first confined aquifer at depths of 25 to 60 m bgl but discontinuous aquitards between the first confined aquifer and the second confined aquifer at depths 90 to 160 m bgl han et al 2013 since the first confined aquifer is closely hydraulically related to the second confined aquifer they are assigned as confined aquifer in this study groundwater is mainly recharged by canal leakage and irrigation infiltration in the plain areas and from lateral flow near mountainous areas or hilly platforms in the west and south the areas near the yellow river are recharged by the yellow river water the phreatic water generally flows from southwest to northeast but in the alluvial fans of the basin the phreatic water flows from the periphery to the center of the plain with large hydraulic gradient and good runoff conditions in the middle east of the plain the groundwater flows to the northeast shaped by the topography of the basin and the yellow river with relatively low hydraulic gradient and poor runoff conditions the flow conditions of the confined groundwater are generally similar to those of phreatic groundwater in the huinong area of the northern margin of the basin the northward groundwater flow is blocked by the undulating terrain of the helan mountain and taole platform and groundwater flow is mostly sluggish the buried depths of phreatic water level were generally between 1 and 3 m bgl while the buried depths of confined water level were generally less than 6 m bgl near the piedmont area the confined water level was more than 1 m lower than the phreatic water level and within 1 m in the center of the plain in the piedmont alluvial proluvial fans of the helan mountain the hydraulic gradient of confined water in the aquifer was relatively large 1 5 to 3 8 groundwater is discharged by evaporation and artificial exploitation for phreatic water evaporation is the main discharge pathway accounting for more than 45 of the total discharge however confined water is mainly discharged by artificial exploitation in this study we selected two transects in the study area to collect groundwater samples transect 1 is located in the upstream of regional groundwater in the south where the hydraulic gradient is relatively high and the permeability coefficient is about 3 9 m d wu et al 2008 showing high groundwater flow rate transect 2 is located in the middle stream of regional groundwater in the middle north where the regional hydraulic gradient is low about 0 25 qian et al 2012 and the permeability coefficient is about 2 6 m d wu et al 2008 fig 1 groundwaters in transect 1 generally had lower as concentrations than those in transect 2 feng et al 2022 2 2 groundwater and surface water sampling

condition of repeatability did not exceed 15 of the arithmetic mean 2 4 data analysis ideally anthropogenic contaminants in surface and or groundwater are compounds that are specific to anthropogenic activities and have no natural sources or known analogues hagedorn and weisberg 2009 dickenson et al 2011 good indicator compounds related to human activities can be used to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic pollution in receiving water bodies such as surface water and groundwater tran et al 2014 sedlak et al 2006 proposed a detection ratio dr to identify potential indicator compounds in wastewater or treated wastewater according to eq 1 we can calculate the dr of the compound according to the median concentration and detection limit 1 d r c median m q l where cmedian is the median concentration of each compound mql is the detection limit of the compound in water samples detection frequency df the ratio of the number of samples with the compound above the detection limit to the number of all samples was also calculated according to eq 2 2 d f n i n where ni is the number of samples with the compound above the detection limit n is the number of all samples the spearman correlation coefficients and p values were calculated using the spss version 19 code the p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant the saturation index of pyrite was calculated by phreeqc interactive rc1 parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 results 3 1 major ions and redox sensitive solutes in groundwater the groundwater samples collected at transect 1 were of hydrochemical ca mg na hco3 so4 type which was greatly different from those at transect 2 na hco3 fig 2 while at transect 1 na ca2 mg2 and hco3 were the primary cations and anion respectively na and hco3 were generally the major ions in groundwater samples of transect 2 fig s1 the concentrations of major cations and anions in surface water were lower than those in the groundwater samples the tds values in groundwater samples of transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 table 1 and the median tds of the surface water 267 mg l was lower than that of groundwater fig s2 groundwater tds decreased with the increase in sampling depth at the transect 2 the eh values in groundwater ranged between 4 and 320 mv and 76 of groundwater samples had eh value 204 mv indicating that the groundwater in the study area was mainly anaerobic the eh values in transect 2 4 to 320 mv median 81 6 mv were significantly lower than those of transect 1 41 1 to 310 mv median 208 mv table 1 the eh values of the confined aquifer samples median 25 mv were lower than those of the phreatic aquifer median 84 mv fig 3 a groundwater was weakly alkaline table 1 and groundwater ph generally increased with the increase in sampling depth on both transects 1 and 2 fig 3b the ph values for samples from transect 2 median 7 77 were slightly higher than those of transect 1 median 7 44 for transect 2 the ph values of confined water median 8 59 were higher than those of phreatic water samples median 7 74 fig 3b the no3 concentrations varied largely from 0 01 to 203 mg l and 81 and 68 of samples from transect 1 and transect 2 had no3 concentrations greater than the detection limit 0 01 mg l respectively the no3 concentration in samples of transect 1 was on average 58 times higher than from transect 2 table 1 the no3 concentrations in surface water were between 2 11 and 15 5 mg l median 7 84 mg l the nh4 n concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 4 4 mg l and were higher in samples from transect 2 than those form transect 1 table 1 but 69 and 100 of samples from transect 1 and transect 2 had nh4 n concentrations greater than the detection limit 0 01 mg l respectively table 1 total dissolved as concentrations in groundwater had a wide range from 0 04 to 221 μg l fig 4 a but 47 of groundwater as concentrations exceeded the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l who 2017 generally total as concentrations in groundwater samples from transect 2 were higher than those of transect 1 table 1 where 15 and 62 of groundwater samples showed as concentrations greater than the who guideline respectively in comparison with phreatic water as concentrations in confined water were lower which is consistent with observations by guo et al 2014b and han et al 2013 in the confined aquifer of transect 2 one groundwater sample had abnormally high as concentrations 208 μg l 60 m bgl this might be due to the leakage of shallow high as groundwater caused by improper well casing installation han et al 2013 as iii was the dominant as species in groundwater samples in groundwater samples from transect 1 where as iii was detectable 2 0 μg l the proportions of as iii to total dissolved as ranged between 69 and 96 similar to those from transect 2 60 to 100 fig 4b as v was below the detection limit in groundwater samples from transect 1 and only three groundwater samples had detectable as v in samples from transect 2 which ranged from 15 to 42 μg l fig 4c dissolved fe concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 9 4 mg l concentrations of fe in groundwater samples from transect 2 were about 9 times higher than those from transect 1 fig 4d table 1 concentrations of dissolved fe in phreatic water varied from 0 01 to 9 4 mg l median 0 48 mg l which were double as high as those of confined water samples from transect 2 similar to total dissolved fe concentrations of dissolved fe ii in groundwater of transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 fig 4e table 1 concentrations of dissolved mn in samples of transect 1 were slightly lower than those of transect 2 fig 4f table 1 concentrations of doc in transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 table 1 the doc concentrations of samples in the phreatic aquifer 3 07 mg l median were comparable to the confined aquifer 2 92 mg l median from transect 2 concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in samples from transect 1 median 106 mg l were similar to those of transect 2 median 105 mg l the dic concentrations detected in the laboratory were closely related to hco3 concentrations monitored in the field r 0 979 p 0 001 3 2 artificial sweeteners results showed that 97 and 93 of studied samples had sucralose and acesulfame concentrations greater than detection limits 8 and 0 2 ng l respectively in the study area in these groundwater samples sucralose concentrations were in general the highest followed by acesulfame and saccharin the sucralose concentrations in groundwater samples from transect 1 were higher than those of transect 2 table 2 which is different from distribution of as concentrations concentrations of acesulfame in samples from transect 1 were about 5 times higher than those of transect 2 table 2 concentrations of sucralose and acesulfame in phreatic water were higher than those in confined water of the transect the acesulfame and sucralose concentrations of surface water were in general higher than those of groundwater fig 5 table 2 saccharin was detectable in all surface water samples fig 6 table 2 but in only one of the 60 groundwater samples 556 ng l the groundwater sample with detectable saccharin had quite high concentrations of acesulfame 2940 ng l and sucralose 305 ng l fig 6 which was taken from the shallow aquifer 15 m near a restaurant previous studies have shown that a substantial proportion of saccharin can be degraded by soil microorganisms biel maeso et al 2019 richards et al 2017 buerge et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 similar to this study saccharin was not detected in all 14 and 50 groundwater samples in sharma et al 2019 and wolf et al 2012 respectively 3 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the δ18o values in samples from transect 1 median 10 0 were generally higher than those of transect 2 median 11 7 the δd values in samples from transect 1 median 73 4 were also higher than of transect 2 median 81 3 the δ18o and δd values for phreatic water δ18o median 11 6 δd median 81 2 were higher than those of confined water δ18o median 12 3 δd median 96 2 at transect 2 the values of δ18o median 10 2 and δd median 72 2 of surface water were similar to those of groundwater of transect 1 fig 7 the sand lake surface water sample had the highest δ18o 1 71 and δd 28 8 values followed by xinghai lake sample δ18o 4 73 δd 45 5 the δ18o and δd values of yellow river sample δ18o 10 6 δd 73 9 were similar to those of ditch water samples δ18o median 10 4 δd median 72 9 the δ18o and δd of the yellow river water and ditch water were distributed near lmwl fig 7 which indicated that the atmospheric precipitation was the origin of these water the lake water samples were located below lmwl along the evaporation line fig 7 indicating that the lake water was affected by evaporation δ18o and δd of groundwater samples from transect 1 were similar to the yellow river and ditch water samples demonstrating that groundwater from transect 1 was recharged by precipitation and ditch water which is diverted from the yellow river water the δ18o and δd values for the transect 2 samples were located around the surface water line those phreatic waters with relatively high δ18o and δd values in the transect 2 were plotted below lmwl along the evaporation line indicating that those groundwaters at the transect were affected by evaporation 3 4 dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes the δ13cdic values of groundwater in the study area table 1 ranged from 13 1 to 3 91 median 10 2 which were slightly lower than those of northwest hetao basin with a range between 13 5 and 5 6 median 9 6 zhou et al 2018 the values of δ13cdic in groundwater from transect 1 were greater than those from transect 2 table 1 phreatic water had generally higher δ13cdic values than confined water samples from transect 2 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between concentration of sweeteners and anthropogenic activities detection ratio dr and detection frequency df have been used as two important criteria for identifying potential indicator compounds of anthropogenic pollution in receiving water dickenson et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 dickenson et al 2011 proposed that for point source pollution a compound with dr 5 and df 80 can be used as the potential indicator of receiving water contamination in this study both acesulfame and sucralose were detected in almost all groundwater samples with dr 7 and df 90 along the two transects suggesting that the two artificial sweeteners can be used as indicators of contamination through the investigation of the persistence and physicochemical properties of acesulfame it has been found to be the most useful sweetener species to label wastewater impact because it is resistant to degradation during its transport through soil and aquifer environments robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 cardenas et al 2016 sucralose has been proved to be persistent during wastewater treatment because its removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants is 50 yang et al 2017 in addition sucralose has good hydrophilicity logkow 1 and is not easily photodegraded in aqueous environments batchu et al 2013 thus acesulfame and sucralose could be good conservative indicators for tracing anthropogenic impact on groundwater aquifers in the yinchuan basin they have therefore been already considered as tracers of on site domestic wastewater sources tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 however the df of saccharin was only 2 2 in transect 2 and the dr was not applicable for both two transects showing that saccharin is not as suitable as an indicator for anthropogenic activities buerge et al 2011 observed that the biodegradability of saccharin was the highest among sweeteners in soil followed by acesulfame and sucralose many studies have found that substantial proportion of saccharin was degraded by soil microorganisms van stempvoort et al 2011 richards et al 2017 biel maeso et al 2019 and saccharin was observed below the detection limit in groundwater samples in india sharma et al 2019 and germany wolf et al 2012 for surface water all three artificial sweeteners were detected in all seven samples with dr 23 indicating that acesulfame sucralose and even saccharin can be used as indicators of wastewater contamination in the surface water the ratios of total inorganic nitrogen tin which is the sum of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n to acesulfame tin ace and sucralose tin suc concentrations and the ratios of cl to acesulfame cl ace and sucralose cl suc concentrations were used to prove a relationship between artificial sweeteners and anthropogenic activities fig 8 a and b generally there were positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace in transects 1 r 0 647 p 0 012 and 2 r 0 567 p 0 001 tin suc was also positively correlated with cl suc in transects 1 r 0 734 p 0 002 and 2 r 0 525 p 0 001 these correlations suggest that the artificial sweeteners were closely related to anthropogenic activities previous studies have shown that acesulfame was widespread in domestic sewage in canada and existed in the groundwater plume generated by septic tanks robertson et al 2016b by examining the ratio of acesulfame to other pollutants acesulfame can gain insight into the persistence of these pollutants in groundwater systems van stempvoort et al 2011 those positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace and between tin suc and cl suc can prove that the artificial sweeteners reflect effect of anthropogenic activities on groundwater however in the yinchuan basin higher as groundwater generally had lower concentrations of artificial sweeteners and vice versa fig s3 according to their as concentrations groundwater samples were divided into two groups 10 and 10 50 μg l in transect 1 and four groups 10 10 50 50 100 and 100 μg l in transect 2 fig 9 in those groups median values of as concentrations were negatively correlated with dr of acesulfame r 4 26 p 0 399 and sucralose r 4 05 p 0 426 which indicated that high as concentration generally had low concentrations of the artificial sweeteners i e low extent of anthropogenic activities 4 2 human impacts on groundwater chemistry the spatial distribution of the sum of concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose varied widely along the transects fig 10 fig 10 shows also that the population density along transect 1 was higher than that of transect 2 when the population density was larger acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were generally higher along transect 1 the sum of acesulfame and sucralose in groundwater was higher near the yellow river or villages with relatively larger population density in transect 2 samples distribution of acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were broadly similar to that in transect 1 however exceptionally high concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose were also observed in rural areas with low population density from both transects 1 and 2 this would be related to outhouses common in these rural areas in addition sewage treatment facilities are very limited resulting in the potential direct input of wastewater compounds into aqueous environment richards et al 2021 another reason for the higher concentrations of the artificial sweeteners along transect 1 may be related to hydrogeological conditions transect 1 in the south of yinchuan basin is characterized by aquifer sediments mainly composed of fine to medium sand and gravels however the lithology along transect 2 in the northern yinchuan basin is mainly composed of silty fine sand with enclosures of silty clay layers wu et al 2008 therefore surface water is more easily infiltrated into shallow groundwater of transect 1 where aquifers have a higher permeability than of transect 2 moreover finer aquifer sediments of transect 2 have higher surface areas and thus may have higher affinity for retention of human induced contaminants such as artificial sweeteners khan et al 2021 4 3 effects of anthropogenic activities on arsenic concentration groundwater with high as concentration was less affected by anthropogenic activities which is demonstrated by the lower concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose in the higher as groundwater thus geological processes must be the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater high as groundwaters mainly occurred in environments with eh values 164 mv under moderate reducing conditions fe iii hydroxides become reduced which might increase total dissolved fe concentrations 0 01 to 9 4 mg l in the studied groundwater dissolved fe concentrations were even higher than those in groundwater from the hetao basin 0 01 to 5 10 mg l guo et al 2017 the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides releases the adsorbed as into groundwater podgorski and berg 2020 although the reduction of fe iii hydroxides leads to the release of both dissolved fe and as in the aquifer dissolved as concentration in groundwater samples was found to be weakly correlated with total dissolved fe and fe ii concentrations fig s4 the reason may be the precipitation of pyrite in groundwater oversaturated with respect to pyrite which would preferentially sequestrate dissolved fe ii over dissolved as guo et al 2013 there was a significantly negative correlation between as concentration and milligram equivalent ratio of so4 2 to cl in transect 2 r 0 508 p 0 001 fig s5 which indicates that so4 2 reduction occurred in the process of as enrichment this is in line with observations in the hetao basin china jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016 oversaturation of pyrite in most of transect 2 groundwater with detectable sulfide sipyrite from 19 2 to 23 8 supported the explanation on the other hand unreduced residual fe iii hydroxides in aquifer sediments are known to readily adsorb dissolved fe ii and as appelo et al 2002 handler et al 2009 arsenic release and reduction of fe iii hydroxides were found to be coupled with microbial degradation of doc in the studied groundwater there was a positive correlation between 1 dic and δ13cdic r 0 550 p 0 004 in transect 1 and negative correlation between 1 doc and dic r 0 690 p 0 001 in transect 1 r 0 672 p 0 001 in transect 2 which suggests that dic was mainly derived from the degradation of bioavailable doc fig s6 the reason may be that 12corg is preferentially metabolized by the process of microbially mediated organic matter oxidation clark and fritz 1997 which theoretically leads to relatively lower δ13cdic and higher dic concentrations in groundwater therefore relatively low δ13cdic values indicated an active microbial process on the contrary relatively higher δ13cdic may reflect relatively lower contribution by microbial activity this is in line with the previous observation in the hetao basin aquifers zhou et al 2018 desorption may also play a role in mobilizing as in groundwater systems although there was no good correlation between as and ph in transect 1 a positive correlation was observed in groundwater from the transect 2 r 0 371 p 0 006 fig s7a this is in line with the common observation that high ph predominantly resulted in as desorption guo et al 2014a in addition competitive adsorption between as and hco3 at elevated concentrations might have resulted in the desorption of as in the study area feng et al 2022 although the correlation between as and hco3 was poor in the studied groundwater fig s7b there were two plausible reasons for the low as concentration in groundwater with intensive anthropogenic activities firstly anthropogenic activities commonly introduce no3 into groundwater as an alternative reducing agent inhibiting the reduction of fe iii hydroxides and thus as release mcarthur et al 2012 high no3 concentrations were often accompanied by high concentrations of artificial sweeteners in the studied groundwater along transect 1 when no3 concentrations in groundwater were higher than 20 mg l acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were positively correlated with no3 concentrations fig s8 high concentrations of no3 up to 203 mg l were observed in low as groundwater samples from transect 1 which indicated that as was retarded in sediments in the presence of abundant no3 guo et al 2014b acesulfame and sucralose were commonly found in household wells with high no3 concentrations nitka et al 2019 relatively lower concentrations of no3 and artificial sweeteners were found in high as groundwater of transect 2 than those of transect 1 suggesting that contribution by no3 reduction was higher in groundwater from transect 2 fig s9 similarly the concentration of as was low in groundwater from the datong basin and the north china plain with relatively high no3 concentrations zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhi et al 2019 secondly the aquifers being intensively affected by anthropogenic activities tended to have higher permeability due to the relatively higher permeability of transect 1 aquifer the infiltration of oxygenated surface water during groundwater recharge rendered the aquifer sub oxic which constrained the reduction of fe iii hydroxides as a result the as concentrations in groundwater of transect 1 were lower although both acesulfame and sucralose were introduced into the aquifer along with the infiltration of surface water the same phenomenon was also observed in the hetao basin and the southwest of the songnen basin where high permeability and high hydraulic gradients were observed in the alluvial fans and or in the upstream of groundwater resulting in the rapid recharge of oxygenated surface water into the aquifer which inhibited the fe iii hydroxide reduction and caused low concentrations of dissolved as in groundwater guo et al 2016 guo et al 2014c 5 conclusion this study outlines the limited effects of anthropogenic activities especially human sewage discharge on as mobilization in groundwater from the studied area total dissolved as concentrations in the studied groundwater ranged from 0 04 to 221 μg l with 47 of groundwater as concentrations exceeding the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l median concentration of acesulfame from transect 1 was about 5 times that of transect 2 the sucralose concentration in transect 1 was also higher than that of transect 2 however saccharin was only detected in one groundwater sample both acesulfame and sucralose sweeteners in groundwater samples had a detection ratio dr 7 and detection frequency df 90 indicating that acesulfame and sucralose can be used as tracers to reflect anthropogenic impact this is supported by the positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace and between tin suc and cl suc the influence of anthropogenic activities on distribution of high as groundwater was limited since high as groundwater generally had low concentrations of both acesulfame and sucralose geological processes were still the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater arsenic was released by the process of microbial degradation of doc and concomitant reduction of fe iii hydroxides in moderate reducing groundwater desorption via competitive adsorption between as and hco3 at high ph might also contribute to as mobility however in the areas with high permeability with high vulnerability to human contamination although acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were high in groundwater low as concentrations were observed due to the introduction of both no3 and dissolved oxygen into the shallow aquifers during the infiltration of surface water this study highlights that both geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities should be considered during

3344,arsenic as pollution in groundwater is an extremely concerning issue all over the world because it has brought many negative health effects on people however the impact of anthropogenic activities on the formation of high as groundwater is poorly understood seventy nine groundwater samples and seven surface water samples were taken along two transects in the yinchuan basin china to trace effects of anthropogenic activities on distribution of high as groundwater by using artificial sweeteners the sampling campaign showed that in 47 of samples as concentrations exceeded the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l both acesulfame and sucralose were detected in the groundwater samples and concentrations in samples from the transect of the upper stream of regional groundwater were generally higher than those from the transect of the middle stream both acesulfame and sucralose in all studied groundwater samples had the detection rate dr 7 and the detection frequency df 90 indicating that they can be used as tracers to reflect anthropogenic activities higher as groundwater samples generally had lower concentrations of the artificial sweeteners and vice versa showing that the influence of anthropogenic activities on high as concentration was limited geological processes are the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater high as groundwaters were characterized by moderate reducing conditions and the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides led to the release of the adsorbed as into groundwater additionally as desorption was another process to mobilize as under the conditions of elevated ph and or high hco3 this study provides an insight into relative contribution of anthropogenic activities and hydrogeochemical conditions to as enrichment in groundwater and highlights the necessity in protecting low as groundwater highly vulnerable to human activities in high as groundwater areas keywords arsenic groundwater anthropogenic activity artificial sweeteners 1 introduction the geological origin of arsenic as in groundwater is a global problem which has a significant impact on human health podgorski and berg 2020 chronic intake of high as groundwater can lead to a variety of human diseases guo et al 2011 mladenov et al 2014 wang et al 2019 such as severe skin pigmentation skin cancer and visceral cancer naujokas et al 2013 in addition the use of high as groundwater for agricultural irrigation and animal husbandry may pollute food especially rice thereby expanding its negative health impact even beyond the source area sharma et al 2014 punshon et al 2017 the main hydrogeochemical mechanisms increasing as concentrations in groundwater include 1 weathering of as bearing pyrite or arsenopyrite under oxidation conditions 2 as desorption at elevated ph or concentrations of competitive ions 3 reductive dissolution of as containing iron oxides and hydroxides and 4 dissimilatory arsenate reduction smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b high concentrations of as are usually associated with high ph and or reducing conditions haugen et al 2021 due to agricultural recharge of oxygenated groundwater or groundwater pumping as concentration in groundwater generally decreased during irrigation season but concentrations of no3 and so4 2 increased haugen et al 2021 dissolved organic matter is the key factor controlling as mobilization the high abundance of refractory organic compounds in high as groundwater may promote as enrichment through electron shuttle outcompeting adsorption and methylation qiao et al 2021 the distribution of high as groundwater is also related to the existence of wetlands the longer the wetland exists the greater the possibility of high as groundwater gao et al 2022 this may be related to the introduction of biodegradable organic matter into the shallow aquifer after which the as is released below the wetland and transported to the shallow aquifer under continuous wetland water recharge gao et al 2022 the organic matter would be sourced either from natural organic matter in sediments or porewater neumann et al 2014 guo et al 2019 or from surface derived organic matter whaley martin et al 2017 however it is still unknown whether anthropogenic activities impact as mobilization in groundwater artificial sweeteners are widely used as sugar substitutes in food beverages and pharmaceuticals lange et al 2012 because they provide no or negligible energy kroger et al 2006 artificial sweeteners are recognized as effective sewage tracers in aqueous environment because they have high water solubility low adsorption capacity in soil and low biodegradability ishii et al 2021 for instance artificial sweeteners are detected in lakes and rivers with wastewater discharge spoelstra et al 2013 perkola and sainio 2014 oldfield et al 2020 and in groundwater where the septic tank systems discharge the treated wastewater underground van stempvoort et al 2011 robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 snider et al 2017 spoelstra et al 2017 yang et al 2017 artificial sweeteners in groundwater may come from the leakage of urban sewer infrastructure wolf et al 2012 tran et al 2014 lee et al 2015 and seepage of landfills roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 therefore the artificial sweeteners including acesulfame sucralose and saccharin are recently used to trace effects of anthropogenic activities on groundwater in canada japan and china robertson et al 2016a nitka et al 2019 ma et al 2021 li et al 2021 ishii et al 2021 high as groundwater has been found in the yinchuan basin china previous studies have shown that the high as groundwater mainly occurs in low lying topographically flat flood plains and alluvial lacustrine plains where the groundwater is mainly recharged by canal leakage and irrigation infiltration guo et al 2014b han et al 2013 groundwater as concentrations in the shallow unconfined aquifer han et al 2010 and alluvial lacustrine aquifers guo et al 2014b are mainly controlled by the redox potential and competitive adsorption which lead to high mobility of as guo et al 2014b sun et al 2021 with the increase in well depth as concentrations gradually decrease in groundwater han et al 2010 low as groundwater was mainly observed in piedmont proluvial inclining area and alluvial plain with high elevations and low agricultural activities guo et al 2014b han et al 2013 however it cannot yet be ruled out that anthropogenic activities affect the distribution of as in groundwater of the basin concentration and distribution of artificial sweeteners in groundwater in this area have therefore been analyzed to reveal the potential impact of anthropogenic activities on the distribution of high as groundwater therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 delineate distributions of artificial sweeteners in groundwater from two representative transects in the yinchuan basin 2 explore the potential of the sweeteners as tracers of anthropogenic activities and 3 assess whether how anthropogenic activities affect as concentration in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the yinchuan basin is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river with high terrain in the west and low terrain in the east the climate is a typical continental arid and semi arid climate with less rainfall and strong evaporation qian et al 2012 li et al 2019 the annual precipitation in the southeast is high about 201 mm and is low in the northeast about 177 mm the evaporation shows an increasing trend with the increase in elevation the water resources in the basin mainly come from the yellow river the yellow river is located in the east of the basin with a total length of about 191 km which has an important impact on the formation and evolution of the landform of the basin irrigation channels and drainage ditches are widely distributed in the basin with a large number of lakes and swamps li et al 2019 the quaternary sediments are widely distributed in the basin with a maximum thickness of over 1600 m which consist of proluvial alluvial and lacustrine deposits and aeolian sediments wu et al 2008 the single phreatic aquifer is mainly distributed in the western and southern parts of the basin which is mainly composed of proluvial sand and gravel in the western part alluvial fans of helan mountains and alluvial sand and coarse sand at the southern parts the qingtongxia gorge groundwater is abundant with good quality in the single phreatic aquifer the multi layer aquifer occurs in the flat plain which can be divided into the phreatic aquifer the first confined aquifer and the second confined aquifer from top to bottom up to the depth of about 250 m below ground level bgl the thickness of phreatic aquifer is generally from 10 to 50 m the buried depth of the first confined aquifer is generally from 35 to 110 m bgl with the thickness of 50 to 100 m the buried depth of the second confined aquifer is from 240 to 260 m bgl with thickness of 50 to 110 m there are relatively continuous aquitards between the phreatic aquifer and the first confined aquifer at depths of 25 to 60 m bgl but discontinuous aquitards between the first confined aquifer and the second confined aquifer at depths 90 to 160 m bgl han et al 2013 since the first confined aquifer is closely hydraulically related to the second confined aquifer they are assigned as confined aquifer in this study groundwater is mainly recharged by canal leakage and irrigation infiltration in the plain areas and from lateral flow near mountainous areas or hilly platforms in the west and south the areas near the yellow river are recharged by the yellow river water the phreatic water generally flows from southwest to northeast but in the alluvial fans of the basin the phreatic water flows from the periphery to the center of the plain with large hydraulic gradient and good runoff conditions in the middle east of the plain the groundwater flows to the northeast shaped by the topography of the basin and the yellow river with relatively low hydraulic gradient and poor runoff conditions the flow conditions of the confined groundwater are generally similar to those of phreatic groundwater in the huinong area of the northern margin of the basin the northward groundwater flow is blocked by the undulating terrain of the helan mountain and taole platform and groundwater flow is mostly sluggish the buried depths of phreatic water level were generally between 1 and 3 m bgl while the buried depths of confined water level were generally less than 6 m bgl near the piedmont area the confined water level was more than 1 m lower than the phreatic water level and within 1 m in the center of the plain in the piedmont alluvial proluvial fans of the helan mountain the hydraulic gradient of confined water in the aquifer was relatively large 1 5 to 3 8 groundwater is discharged by evaporation and artificial exploitation for phreatic water evaporation is the main discharge pathway accounting for more than 45 of the total discharge however confined water is mainly discharged by artificial exploitation in this study we selected two transects in the study area to collect groundwater samples transect 1 is located in the upstream of regional groundwater in the south where the hydraulic gradient is relatively high and the permeability coefficient is about 3 9 m d wu et al 2008 showing high groundwater flow rate transect 2 is located in the middle stream of regional groundwater in the middle north where the regional hydraulic gradient is low about 0 25 qian et al 2012 and the permeability coefficient is about 2 6 m d wu et al 2008 fig 1 groundwaters in transect 1 generally had lower as concentrations than those in transect 2 feng et al 2022 2 2 groundwater and surface water sampling seventy nine groundwater and seven surface water samples were collected in november 2020 along the two transects fig 1 among the 79 groundwater samples 26 were sampled from transect 1 at depths from 6 to 40 m bgl phreatic water samples among them 15 samples for analysis of artificial sweeteners and 53 sampled from transect 2 at depths from 3 to 88 5 m bgl including 50 phreatic water samples and 3 confined groundwater samples among them 45 samples for analysis of artificial sweeteners there were four surface water samples collected from transect 1 and three from transect 2 fig 1 all surface water samples xhh stands for xinghai lake sample shh for sand lake sample hh for yellow river sample and shg hyq xgq and pq for ditch water samples were tested for artificial sweeteners after pumping for around 20 min when total dissolved solid tds temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and reduction potential eh reached stable values in an in line flow cell of a multiparameter probe meter hi 9828 hanna which was calibrated using standard solutions before use groundwater samples were taken and filtered by 0 22 μm membrane syringe filters in the field samples for testing cations and trace

artificial sweeteners are shown in table s1 the detection limits of acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were 0 2 1 and 8 ng l respectively the absolute difference between two replicates under the condition of repeatability did not exceed 15 of the arithmetic mean 2 4 data analysis ideally anthropogenic contaminants in surface and or groundwater are compounds that are specific to anthropogenic activities and have no natural sources or known analogues hagedorn and weisberg 2009 dickenson et al 2011 good indicator compounds related to human activities can be used to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic pollution in receiving water bodies such as surface water and groundwater tran et al 2014 sedlak et al 2006 proposed a detection ratio dr to identify potential indicator compounds in wastewater or treated wastewater according to eq 1 we can calculate the dr of the compound according to the median concentration and detection limit 1 d r c median m q l where cmedian is the median concentration of each compound mql is the detection limit of the compound in water samples detection frequency df the ratio of the number of samples with the compound above the detection limit to the number of all samples was also calculated according to eq 2 2 d f n i n where ni is the number of samples with the compound above the detection limit n is the number of all samples the spearman correlation coefficients and p values were calculated using the spss version 19 code the p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant the saturation index of pyrite was calculated by phreeqc interactive rc1 parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 results 3 1 major ions and redox sensitive solutes in groundwater the groundwater samples collected at transect 1 were of hydrochemical ca mg na hco3 so4 type which was greatly different from those at transect 2 na hco3 fig 2 while at transect 1 na ca2 mg2 and hco3 were the primary cations and anion respectively na and hco3 were generally the major ions in groundwater samples of transect 2 fig s1 the concentrations of major cations and anions in surface water were lower than those in the groundwater samples the tds values in groundwater samples of transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 table 1 and the median tds of the surface water 267 mg l was lower than that of groundwater fig s2 groundwater tds decreased with the increase in sampling depth at the transect 2 the eh values in groundwater ranged between 4 and 320 mv and 76 of groundwater samples had eh value 204 mv indicating that the groundwater in the study area was mainly anaerobic the eh values in transect 2 4 to 320 mv median 81 6 mv were significantly lower than those of transect 1 41 1 to 310 mv median 208 mv table 1 the eh values of the confined aquifer samples median 25 mv were lower than those of the phreatic aquifer median 84 mv fig 3 a groundwater was weakly alkaline table 1 and groundwater ph generally increased with the increase in sampling depth on both transects 1 and 2 fig 3b the ph values for samples from transect 2 median 7 77 were slightly higher than those of transect 1 median 7 44 for transect 2 the ph values of confined water median 8 59 were higher than those of phreatic water samples median 7 74 fig 3b the no3 concentrations varied largely from 0 01 to 203 mg l and 81 and 68 of samples from transect 1 and transect 2 had no3 concentrations greater than the detection limit 0 01 mg l respectively the no3 concentration in samples of transect 1 was on average 58 times higher than from transect 2 table 1 the no3 concentrations in surface water were between 2 11 and 15 5 mg l median 7 84 mg l the nh4 n concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 4 4 mg l and were higher in samples from transect 2 than those form transect 1 table 1 but 69 and 100 of samples from transect 1 and transect 2 had nh4 n concentrations greater than the detection limit 0 01 mg l respectively table 1 total dissolved as concentrations in groundwater had a wide range from 0 04 to 221 μg l fig 4 a but 47 of groundwater as concentrations exceeded the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l who 2017 generally total as concentrations in groundwater samples from transect 2 were higher than those of transect 1 table 1 where 15 and 62 of groundwater samples showed as concentrations greater than the who guideline respectively in comparison with phreatic water as concentrations in confined water were lower which is consistent with observations by guo et al 2014b and han et al 2013 in the confined aquifer of transect 2 one groundwater sample had abnormally high as concentrations 208 μg l 60 m bgl this might be due to the leakage of shallow high as groundwater caused by improper well casing installation han et al 2013 as iii was the dominant as species in groundwater samples in groundwater samples from transect 1 where as iii was detectable 2 0 μg l the proportions of as iii to total dissolved as ranged between 69 and 96 similar to those from transect 2 60 to 100 fig 4b as v was below the detection limit in groundwater samples from transect 1 and only three groundwater samples had detectable as v in samples from transect 2 which ranged from 15 to 42 μg l fig 4c dissolved fe concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 9 4 mg l concentrations of fe in groundwater samples from transect 2 were about 9 times higher than those from transect 1 fig 4d table 1 concentrations of dissolved fe in phreatic water varied from 0 01 to 9 4 mg l median 0 48 mg l which were double as high as those of confined water samples from transect 2 similar to total dissolved fe concentrations of dissolved fe ii in groundwater of transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 fig 4e table 1 concentrations of dissolved mn in samples of transect 1 were slightly lower than those of transect 2 fig 4f table 1 concentrations of doc in transect 1 were lower than those of transect 2 table 1 the doc concentrations of samples in the phreatic aquifer 3 07 mg l median were comparable to the confined aquifer 2 92 mg l median from transect 2 concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in samples from transect 1 median 106 mg l were similar to those of transect 2 median 105 mg l the dic concentrations detected in the laboratory were closely related to hco3 concentrations monitored in the field r 0 979 p 0 001 3 2 artificial sweeteners results showed that 97 and 93 of studied samples had sucralose and acesulfame concentrations greater than detection limits 8 and 0 2 ng l respectively in the study area in these groundwater samples sucralose concentrations were in general the highest followed by acesulfame and saccharin the sucralose concentrations in groundwater samples from transect 1 were higher than those of transect 2 table 2 which is different from distribution of as concentrations concentrations of acesulfame in samples from transect 1 were about 5 times higher than those of transect 2 table 2 concentrations of sucralose and acesulfame in phreatic water were higher than those in confined water of the transect the acesulfame and sucralose concentrations of surface water were in general higher than those of groundwater fig 5 table 2 saccharin was detectable in all surface water samples fig 6 table 2 but in only one of the 60 groundwater samples 556 ng l the groundwater sample with detectable saccharin had quite high concentrations of acesulfame 2940 ng l and sucralose 305 ng l fig 6 which was taken from the shallow aquifer 15 m near a restaurant previous studies have shown that a substantial proportion of saccharin can be degraded by soil microorganisms biel maeso et al 2019 richards et al 2017 buerge et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 similar to this study saccharin was not detected in all 14 and 50 groundwater samples in sharma et al 2019 and wolf et al 2012 respectively 3 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the δ18o values in samples from transect 1 median 10 0 were generally higher than those of transect 2 median 11 7 the δd values in samples from transect 1 median 73 4 were also higher than of transect 2 median 81 3 the δ18o and δd values for phreatic water δ18o median 11 6 δd median 81 2 were higher than those of confined water δ18o median 12 3 δd median 96 2 at transect 2 the values of δ18o median 10 2 and δd median 72 2 of surface water were similar to those of groundwater of transect 1 fig 7 the sand lake surface water sample had the highest δ18o 1 71 and δd 28 8 values followed by xinghai lake sample δ18o 4 73 δd 45 5 the δ18o and δd values of yellow river sample δ18o 10 6 δd 73 9 were similar to those of ditch water samples δ18o median 10 4 δd median 72 9 the δ18o and δd of the yellow river water and ditch water were distributed near lmwl fig 7 which indicated that the atmospheric precipitation was the origin of these water the lake water samples were located below lmwl along the evaporation line fig 7 indicating that the lake water was affected by evaporation δ18o and δd of groundwater samples from transect 1 were similar to the yellow river and ditch water samples demonstrating that groundwater from transect 1 was recharged by precipitation and ditch water which is diverted from the yellow river water the δ18o and δd values for the transect 2 samples were located around the surface water line those phreatic waters with relatively high δ18o and δd values in the transect 2 were plotted below lmwl along the evaporation line indicating that those groundwaters at the transect were affected by evaporation 3 4 dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes the δ13cdic values of groundwater in the study area table 1 ranged from 13 1 to 3 91 median 10 2 which were slightly lower than those of northwest hetao basin with a range between 13 5 and 5 6 median 9 6 zhou et al 2018 the values of δ13cdic in groundwater from transect 1 were greater than those from transect 2 table 1 phreatic water had generally higher δ13cdic values than confined water samples from transect 2 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between concentration of sweeteners and anthropogenic activities detection ratio dr and detection frequency df have been used as two important criteria for identifying potential indicator compounds of anthropogenic pollution in receiving water dickenson et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 dickenson et al 2011 proposed that for point source pollution a compound with dr 5 and df 80 can be used as the potential indicator of receiving water contamination in this study both acesulfame and sucralose were detected in almost all groundwater samples with dr 7 and df 90 along the two transects suggesting that the two artificial sweeteners can be used as indicators of contamination through the investigation of the persistence and physicochemical properties of acesulfame it has been found to be the most useful sweetener species to label wastewater impact because it is resistant to degradation during its transport through soil and aquifer environments robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 cardenas et al 2016 sucralose has been proved to be persistent during wastewater treatment because its removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants is 50 yang et al 2017 in addition sucralose has good hydrophilicity logkow 1 and is not easily photodegraded in aqueous environments batchu et al 2013 thus acesulfame and sucralose could be good conservative indicators for tracing anthropogenic impact on groundwater aquifers in the yinchuan basin they have therefore been already considered as tracers of on site domestic wastewater sources tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 however the df of saccharin was only 2 2 in transect 2 and the dr was not applicable for both two transects showing that saccharin is not as suitable as an indicator for anthropogenic activities buerge et al 2011 observed that the biodegradability of saccharin was the highest among sweeteners in soil followed by acesulfame and sucralose many studies have found that substantial proportion of saccharin was degraded by soil microorganisms van stempvoort et al 2011 richards et al 2017 biel maeso et al 2019 and saccharin was observed below the detection limit in groundwater samples in india sharma et al 2019 and germany wolf et al 2012 for surface water all three artificial sweeteners were detected in all seven samples with dr 23 indicating that acesulfame sucralose and even saccharin can be used as indicators of wastewater contamination in the surface water the ratios of total inorganic nitrogen tin which is the sum of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n to acesulfame tin ace and sucralose tin suc concentrations and the ratios of cl to acesulfame cl ace and sucralose cl suc concentrations were used to prove a relationship between artificial sweeteners and anthropogenic activities fig 8 a and b generally there were positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace in transects 1 r 0 647 p 0 012 and 2 r 0 567 p 0 001 tin suc was also positively correlated with cl suc in transects 1 r 0 734 p 0 002 and 2 r 0 525 p 0 001 these correlations suggest that the artificial sweeteners were closely related to anthropogenic activities previous studies have shown that acesulfame was widespread in domestic sewage in canada and existed in the groundwater plume generated by septic tanks robertson et al 2016b by examining the ratio of acesulfame to other pollutants acesulfame can gain insight into the persistence of these pollutants in groundwater systems van stempvoort et al 2011 those positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace and between tin suc and cl suc can prove that the artificial sweeteners reflect effect of anthropogenic activities on groundwater however in the yinchuan basin higher as groundwater generally had lower concentrations of artificial sweeteners and vice versa fig s3 according to their as concentrations groundwater samples were divided into two groups 10 and 10 50 μg l in transect 1 and four groups 10 10 50 50 100 and 100 μg l in transect 2 fig 9 in those groups median values of as concentrations were negatively correlated with dr of acesulfame r 4 26 p 0 399 and sucralose r 4 05 p 0 426 which indicated that high as concentration generally had low concentrations of the artificial sweeteners i e low extent of anthropogenic activities 4 2 human impacts on groundwater chemistry the spatial distribution of the sum of concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose varied widely along the transects fig 10 fig 10 shows also that the population density along transect 1 was higher than that of transect 2 when the population density was larger acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were generally higher along transect 1 the sum of acesulfame and sucralose in groundwater was higher near the yellow river or villages with relatively larger population density in transect 2 samples distribution of acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were broadly similar to that in transect 1 however exceptionally high concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose were also observed in rural areas with low population density from both transects 1 and 2 this would be related to outhouses common in these rural areas in addition sewage treatment facilities are very limited resulting in the potential direct input of wastewater compounds into aqueous environment richards et al 2021 another reason for the higher concentrations of the artificial sweeteners along transect 1 may be related to hydrogeological conditions transect 1 in the south of yinchuan basin is characterized by aquifer sediments mainly composed of fine to medium sand and gravels however the lithology along transect 2 in the northern yinchuan basin is mainly composed of silty fine sand with enclosures of silty clay layers wu et al 2008 therefore surface water is more easily infiltrated into shallow groundwater of transect 1 where aquifers have a higher permeability than of transect 2 moreover finer aquifer sediments of transect 2 have higher surface areas and thus may have higher affinity for retention of human induced contaminants such as artificial sweeteners khan et al 2021 4 3 effects of anthropogenic activities on arsenic concentration groundwater with high as concentration was less affected by anthropogenic activities which is demonstrated by the lower concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose in the higher as groundwater thus geological processes must be the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater high as groundwaters mainly occurred in environments with eh values 164 mv under moderate reducing conditions fe iii hydroxides become reduced which might increase total dissolved fe concentrations 0 01 to 9 4 mg l in the studied groundwater dissolved fe concentrations were even higher than those in groundwater from the hetao basin 0 01 to 5 10 mg l guo et al 2017 the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides releases the adsorbed as into groundwater podgorski and berg 2020 although the reduction of fe iii hydroxides leads to the release of both dissolved fe and as in the aquifer dissolved as concentration in groundwater samples was found to be weakly correlated with total dissolved fe and fe ii concentrations fig s4 the reason may be the precipitation of pyrite in groundwater oversaturated with respect to pyrite which would preferentially sequestrate dissolved fe ii over dissolved as guo et al 2013 there was a significantly negative correlation between as concentration and milligram equivalent ratio of so4 2 to cl in transect 2 r 0 508 p 0 001 fig s5 which indicates that so4 2 reduction occurred in the process of as enrichment this is in line with observations in the hetao basin china jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016 oversaturation of pyrite in most of transect 2 groundwater with detectable sulfide sipyrite from 19 2 to 23 8 supported the explanation on the other hand unreduced residual fe iii hydroxides in aquifer sediments are known to readily adsorb dissolved fe ii and as appelo et al 2002 handler et al 2009 arsenic release and reduction of fe iii hydroxides were found to be coupled with microbial degradation of doc in the studied groundwater there was a positive correlation between 1 dic and δ13cdic r 0 550 p 0 004 in transect 1 and negative correlation between 1 doc and dic r 0 690 p 0 001 in transect 1 r 0 672 p 0 001 in transect 2 which suggests that dic was mainly derived from the degradation of bioavailable doc fig s6 the reason may be that 12corg is preferentially metabolized by the process of microbially mediated organic matter oxidation clark and fritz 1997 which theoretically leads to relatively lower δ13cdic and higher dic concentrations in groundwater therefore relatively low δ13cdic values indicated an active microbial process on the contrary relatively higher δ13cdic may reflect relatively lower contribution by microbial activity this is in line with the previous observation in the hetao basin aquifers zhou et al 2018 desorption may also play a role in mobilizing as in groundwater systems although there was no good correlation between as and ph in transect 1 a positive correlation was observed in groundwater from the transect 2 r 0 371 p 0 006 fig s7a this is in line with the common observation that high ph predominantly resulted in as desorption guo et al 2014a in addition competitive adsorption between as and hco3 at elevated concentrations might have resulted in the desorption of as in the study area feng et al 2022 although the correlation between as and hco3 was poor in the studied groundwater fig s7b there were two plausible reasons for the low as concentration in groundwater with intensive anthropogenic activities firstly anthropogenic activities commonly introduce no3 into groundwater as an alternative reducing agent inhibiting the reduction of fe iii hydroxides and thus as release mcarthur et al 2012 high no3 concentrations were often accompanied by high concentrations of artificial sweeteners in the studied groundwater along transect 1 when no3 concentrations in groundwater were higher than 20 mg l acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were positively correlated with no3 concentrations fig s8 high concentrations of no3 up to 203 mg l were observed in low as groundwater samples from transect 1 which indicated that as was retarded in sediments in the presence of abundant no3 guo et al 2014b acesulfame and sucralose were commonly found in household wells with high no3 concentrations nitka et al 2019 relatively lower concentrations of no3 and artificial sweeteners were found in high as groundwater of transect 2 than those of transect 1 suggesting that contribution by no3 reduction was higher in groundwater from transect 2 fig s9 similarly the concentration of as was low in groundwater from the datong basin and the north china plain with relatively high no3 concentrations zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhi et al 2019 secondly the aquifers being intensively affected by anthropogenic activities tended to have higher permeability due to the relatively higher permeability of transect 1 aquifer the infiltration of oxygenated surface water during groundwater recharge rendered the aquifer sub oxic which constrained the reduction of fe iii hydroxides as a result the as concentrations in groundwater of transect 1 were lower although both acesulfame and sucralose were introduced into the aquifer along with the infiltration of surface water the same phenomenon was also observed in the hetao basin and the southwest of the songnen basin where high permeability and high hydraulic gradients were observed in the alluvial fans and or in the upstream of groundwater resulting in the rapid recharge of oxygenated surface water into the aquifer which inhibited the fe iii hydroxide reduction and caused low concentrations of dissolved as in groundwater guo et al 2016 guo et al 2014c 5 conclusion this study outlines the limited effects of anthropogenic activities especially human sewage discharge on as mobilization in groundwater from the studied area total dissolved as concentrations in the studied groundwater ranged from 0 04 to 221 μg l with 47 of groundwater as concentrations exceeding the who drinking water guideline 10 μg l median concentration of acesulfame from transect 1 was about 5 times that of transect 2 the sucralose concentration in transect 1 was also higher than that of transect 2 however saccharin was only detected in one groundwater sample both acesulfame and sucralose sweeteners in groundwater samples had a detection ratio dr 7 and detection frequency df 90 indicating that acesulfame and sucralose can be used as tracers to reflect anthropogenic impact this is supported by the positive correlations between tin ace and cl ace and between tin suc and cl suc the influence of anthropogenic activities on distribution of high as groundwater was limited since high as groundwater generally had low concentrations of both acesulfame and sucralose geological processes were still the main reason for the formation of high as groundwater arsenic was released by the process of microbial degradation of doc and concomitant reduction of fe iii hydroxides in moderate reducing groundwater desorption via competitive adsorption between as and hco3 at high ph might also contribute to as mobility however in the areas with high permeability with high vulnerability to human contamination although acesulfame and sucralose concentrations were high in groundwater low as concentrations were observed due to the introduction of both no3 and dissolved oxygen into the shallow aquifers during the infiltration of surface water this study highlights that both geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities should be considered during
