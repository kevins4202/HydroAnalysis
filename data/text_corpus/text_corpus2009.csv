10045,the ability to accurately simulate root density and its spatial distribution can enhance our understanding of plant adaption to the soil environment and agricultural water management ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh is a recently proposed management practice which utilizes a mulched ridge and furrowed soil to increase infiltration and conserve water within soil profiles however this management technique has not been extensively assessed for its effects on yield and water use two dimensional 2d root models are useful tools to assess crop yield and water use in rfrh systems as they can simulate root growth and water uptake maizsim is a comprehensive mechanistic model of maize zea mays l growth and yield which uses a 2d finite element representation for soil physical chemical processes and root growth however maizsim utilizes a simple recursive model based on carbon c allocation to simulate root distribution therefore the objectives of this study are to i develop and implement a finite element based diffusive root growth model in maizsim with evaluations on model performance and ii study the effects of rfrh management on maize yield water use and root development using maizsim with the new root model the root model was written into three modules which i allocates total c from plant photosynthesis for root growth based on soil water availability and transpiration demand ii assigns new allocated c for root growth to selected spatial locations in soil and iii calculates the spatial root distribution as c diffusion the root model was validated using observed root data from published studies under the influences of soil bulk density penetration resistance and soil water conditions normal irrigation and drought numerical simulations for rfrh management compared to a flat soil demonstrated that although soil evaporation was decreased the differences for yields shoot and root dry mass were small in conclusion i the newly develop diffusive root model provided an accurate way to simulate maize root growth ii despite the positive effects of rfrh management on soil water conservation its influence on maize yield is relatively small the diffusive model can be used to evaluate the root growth in response to climate changes or management practices and support integrated agricultural simulators that included soil crop and environmental components keywords maizsim 2dsoil diffusive root growth soil water management ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh 1 introduction root density and architecture are related to plant water use efficiency nutrient use efficiency and stress resistance caires et al 2016 white et al 2013 therefore plant response to soil water is highly dependent on its roots and root development is essential for crop growth and field water and nutrition management guo and york 2019 nichols et al 2019 for maize zea mays l plants relatively high final yield is usually associated with relatively extensive root systems mu et al 2015 shao et al 2018 thus one of the targets in modern maize breeding is to adjust the root architecture especially the averaged root angles or the vertical root distributions to achieve high plant density within a farm as well as high yields from individual plants hammer et al 2009 chen et al 2014 root growth is influenced by the soil environment such as soil mechanical resistance water content nutrition level temperature and aeration pearson 1966 research has been directed to quantify the effects from those environmental conditions identify limiting factors and design management techniques to mitigate those limiting effects for example laboski et al 1998 reported that a soil layer with relatively high bulk density 1 57 mg m 3 at 0 15 0 60 m could increase the subsoil penetration resistance and lead to maize root accumulation in shallow soil layers deep inversion tillage and biological drilling by cover crops were two approaches that can ameliorate soil penetration resistance cai et al 2014 chen and weil 2011 cresswell and kirkegaard 1995 li et al 2009 reported that relatively low spring temperature precipitation and soil water content could limit maize root mass and distribution in the northwest territory of china surface mulch with plastic or biodegradable film could warm topsoil while conserving soil water such that the root dry mass density and diameter were increased gao et al 2014 thidar et al 2020 niu et al 2020 field and laboratory experiments have been performed to study maize root growth and root soil interactions however root excavation and sampling are relatively difficult and results from field and laboratory studies are usually of highly variability which degrades data quality for example the coefficients of variation for morphology measurements such as root shoot ratio under specific ambient conditions can range 2 25 e g anderson 1988 hauck et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover for the experiments performed under field conditions root growth is likely influenced by the ambient weather or soil conditions changing from year to year making it difficult to replicate studies precisely for laboratory root experiments especially hydroponics roots are grown in controlled environments making them easy to sample but which do not fully represent field conditions therefore to date our studies of maize root development has been limited by our experimental approaches numerical simulations provide an efficient and reproducible way to study root growth under a variety of environmental conditions and agricultural managements additionally since the root serves as a bridge between crop and soil numerical root models could support the simulations including crop growth soil water movement and chemical transport reddy and pachepsky 2001 klepper and rickman 1990 recent developments of root models typically fall into two major categories i e architectural models vector based and diffusive spatially continuous models gerwitz and page 1974 pag√®s et al 1989 acock et al 1985 dupuy et al 2010 benes et al 2020 the architectural models provide explicit descriptions of root morphology and hierarchical structures via computer graphics techniques prusinkiewicz 2004 godin and sinoquet 2005 postma et al 2017 but may induce computational challenges for model implementations dunbabin 2007 diffusive models describe root growth as a diffusive movement of root carbon c and the geometric and topological characteristics of root architectures are omitted which greatly reduces the computational cost in diffusive models the root distribution is expressed as a continuous density where related functions such as water and nutrient uptake from bulk soil are also continuous with respect to root distributions the diffusive root growth models were demonstrated with root density measurements from chrysanthemum and potato acock and pachepsky 1996 dathe et al 2014 however such a model is not widely available for maize root development especially within integrated soil crop environment simulators for example maizsim is an integrated mechanistic simulator for maize growth and soil physical chemical processes kim et al 2012 timlin et al 1996 wang et al 2020 however maizsim currently utilizes a simple recursive procedure to simulate root development acock et al 1985 thus there exists a need to implement a diffusive root model and perform root growth simulations for maize it is also ideal to make such a diffusive root model compatible with integrated simulators e g maizsim such that the performance of the diffusive root model can be evaluated based on comprehensive weather crop soil simulations crop models with accurate root simulators are useful to simulate root growth and water use which also provide assessments for new agricultural management scenarios one example is ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh a newly proposed management to improve soil water conservation in northwest china wang et al 2015 in the rfrh management method alternative ridges and furrows are established in fields and the ridges are usually mulched with plastic films or fine textured soil for an entire growing season during precipitation any surface runoff that occurs along the ridges will infiltrate into the soil at ridge furrow boundaries therefore additional water would be supplied to the furrow and increase the soil water content due to soil hydraulic and thermal dynamics part of the infiltrated water would be stored under the ridges and part of the infiltrated water would stay at relatively deep soil layers wang et al 2015 describe the design of the rfrh placement with field measurements of surface runoff in gansu province china the effects of rfrh management on soil thermal and hydraulic processes such as water redistribution soil water infiltration surface water flow and soil temperature regimes have been studied numerically by zhao et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 with independent soil and weather datasets however the most direct evaluation of rfrh management should be how it influences maize root growth as well as the final yield such influences have not been fully explored therefore the overall benefits of rfrh management on soil water distribution and crop cultivation should also be evaluated thus the objectives of this study were to i develop and implement a diffusive model within maizsim to simulate maize root growth validate model accuracy with observed data from published studies and ii apply the maizsim with the diffusive root model to evaluate rfrh management effects on maize root growth and yield the use of maizsim with the diffusive root growth model will enhance our understanding of maize root growth in response to soil and climate conditions and assist in optimizing agricultural water nutrition management 2 root model description and numerical implementation in this section a diffusive root growth model for maize is established and its implementation in maizsim is presented as mentioned the diffusive root growth model treats maize root growth as c diffusion hence the model describes the moving path of c in a maize root system i e the total amount of c supplied for root growth and locations of c to grow new roots section 2 1 as well as the directions that the new roots grow to section 2 2 based on the establishment of the diffusive root model its implementation in maizsim is introduced in section 2 3 including the modularization of the diffusive root model and the data exchanges between the diffusive root model and other existing modules in maizsim 2 1 carbon allocation and assignment for maize root growth carbon input for root growth r kg m 3 da y 1 is allocated from plant shoots where co2 is assimilated to organic c via photosynthesis soil water content root water uptake based on the current root density and transpiration demand are the three factors for c allocation at emergence 60 of available c is partitioned to root growth this percentage decreases to 0 as the plant approaches its reproductive stages in well watered conditions the priority of c partitioning is for shoot growth and a pre specified fraction of c is assigned for root development when water stress occurs as defined by low leaf water turgor pressure 0 5 mpa shoot growth is decreased due to reduction in turgor pressure and additional c is partitioned to the root system to promote root growth and water uptake acock et al 1985 dathe et al 2014 up to 100 of the assimilated c can be partitioned to root growth under water stress conditions to determine r as a spatial function within a soil profile the soil domain is first discretized into a finite element grid and for each node spatial location in that grid potential non limited root growth rates are calculated the preference order is defined via favorability indices at each node which indicates the suitability of soil conditions for root growth acock et al 1985 roots are assumed to grow first in the most favorable locations four favorability indices are defined in eq 1 with respect to the penetration resistance water potential temperature aeration o2 and root density acock et al 1985 1 f 1 1 2 œà trd 5 4 œà 0 25 exp 10 58 1 7 œÅ b 1 4 œà rd œà f 2 t 18 1 66 0 t 18 1 18 t 33 t 33 1 66 t 33 f 3 o 2 0 02 7 14 f 4 1 min 1 m y 0 03 œà trd œà œà rd bar are

the four favorability indices vary between 0 and 1 in maizsim the potential c assigned for root growth r kg m 3 da y 1 is a product of i the root density which is a sum of mature root density m kg m 3 and young root density y kg m 3 ii the potential relative growth rate a da y 1 which is a proportion e g 0 55 of root c mass that will grow and iii the minima of the favorability indices i e 2 r m y a min f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 in numerical computations nodes in the given finite element grid are sorted based on the four favorability indices and c is assigned to each node sequentially based on r and the favorability sorted order until the total amount of c allocated for new roots is exhausted such an assignment process determines r in a soil profile which also implies r r for each node 2 2 governing equations for diffusive root growth the governing equations used in the diffusive root model can be written as 3a y t d y r t y m y 3b m t t y m y eq 3a simulates the diffusion of young roots where d d x x d x z d z x d z z is the tensor of root diffusion coefficients along the horizontal x axis and vertical directions z axis when isotropic diffusion is assumed d should be symmetric and positive definite x z t defines the gradient and in eq 3a denotes the inner product carbon input for root growth r is treated as a source term for new young roots while t y m da y 1 is a coefficient corresponding to the root maturity i e t y m y and acts as a sink term for the young roots but a source for the mature roots t day represents time eq 3b indicates the mature roots do not diffuse in the spatial domain in eqs 3a and 3b we follow the results from reddy and pachepsky 2001 and omit the geotropic factor dathe et al 2014 suggested to neglect root death one reason is that root death is also a linear relation with respect to root density and numerically the linear coefficient for root death and t y m will be combined therefore for simplicity we do not explicitly write root death into eqs 3a and 3b the diffusion tensor d in eqs 3a and 3b is considered as a function of soil water potential and temperature i e 4 d d 0 min f 1 œà f 2 t f 1 œà 1 2 sin œÄ œà s œà r œà œà s œà r 2 1 2 f

temperature parameters for the numerical solver a finite element method is applied to eq 3a while eq 3b can be solved explicitly since t y m y can be directly obtained after solving eq 3a a two dimensional 2d finite element solver is used in maizsim for soil water solute and heat movement calculations and eqs 3a and 3b can be solved on the same grid timlin et al 1996 maize roots are assumed to grow within the soil so if the soil profile is deep enough zero flux boundary condition i e y l 0 can be adopted for eq 3a 2 3 implementation of the root model in maizsim maizsim is an integrated modular based soil crop simulator including multiple soil processes and crop growth modules kim et al 2012 soil physical and chemical processes weather crop growth and field management such as irrigation and fertilizer application are coded in separate modules the data interface in maizsim facilitates efficient data exchanges among multiple modules while local variables and subroutines within each module are processed independently timlin et al 1996 therefore new modules in maizsim can be added to existing modules with only minor modification the modularized implementation of the diffusive root model is shown in fig 1 the root model was decomposed into three modules which i allocates total c for root growth from total plant carbon assimilation carbon allocation ii assigns c for root growth at selected soil nodes based on favorability indices carbon assignment and iii determines the spatial root distribution with governing equations eq 3a and 3b root diffusion those three modules are presented with black boxes existing modules in maizsim which have direct data exchanges with the diffusive root model are presented with white boxes the input data from the existing modules to the diffusive root growth model and the data exchanges among the three new root growth modules are labeled soil physical chemical processes such as water and solute flow are also affected by root water and nutrient uptake 3 model evaluation with observed root data we provide two testing examples that compare simulated root growth and measured results from literature dataset these two examples validate the accuracy of the diffusive root model as well as demonstrate the ability of the root model in simulating maize root growth under relatively high mechanical resistance section 3 1 and varying water conditions section 3 2 3 1 root growth and soil strength this testing simulation evaluates the root model s ability to simulate root growth in response to relatively high soil density and penetration resistance the observed root distributions were from a study by laboski et al 1998 who investigated soil strength effects on root growth and reported maize root measurements from 1993 to 1995 near princeton minnesota the soil was a zimmerman fine sand mixed frigid lamellic udipsamments with bulk density up to 1 58 mg m 3 at the depth of 0 15 0 6 m the soil texture bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity were reported in laboski et al 1998 van genuchten 1980 parameters for soil hydraulic properties were calculated from rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 1998 in the experiment of laboski et al 1998 before seeding the soil was ridge tilled with row spacing equal to 0 91 m maize was planted along the ridges which are 0 15 m higher than the soil surface at tasseling an auger of 0 045 m diameter was used to sample the roots at 0 m row measurement 0 2 m quarter row measurement and 0 4 m middle row measurement away from the planting row from the soil surface to 1 2 m depth the samples were sectioned into 0 15 m segments to estimate the vertical root distribution to implement the root growth model the cross sectional shape of ridge was assumed to be an isosceles triangle with 0 2 m base and 0 15 m height since the planting dates were not provided a commonly used planting date for maize in the midwest u s i e doy 140 in mid may was assumed luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 hourly temperature data and radiation data at cambridge minnesota 45 55 n 93 27 w 20 miles to the east of princeton were from the noaa public database https www ncei noaa gov data global hourly access and ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data nsrdb solar solar only and the daily persiann cdr precipitation ashouri et al 2015 available at https www ncei noaa gov data precipitation persiann access was evenly distributed into 24 hour periods such that the daily precipitation can be converted to hourly based data for the potential diffusivity of root c d 0 in eq 4 we adopted values from literature results heinen et al 2003 and made slight adjustments based on the observed root distribution in 1993 laboski et al 1998 the adjusted values i e d xx 0 50 cm 2 da y 1 d zz 0 3 cm 2 da y 1 d xz 0 d zx 0 0 cm 2 da y 1 were applied as a constant for root growth simulations from 1993 to 1995 for comparison instead of calculating the root length exactly at the sampling locations the simulated root length was averaged with 0 1 m horizontal windows centered at 0 m 0 2 m and 0 4 m from the planting row to ensure data stability while the vertical distributions of simulated maize roots were calculated based on the experiment description in laboski et al 1998 fig 2 presents the comparison between the observed and simulated root length for all the sampling locations and depths from 1993 to 1995 the regression line is y 0 91 x 0 05 which is close to the 1 to 1 line the simulated results for all the three years are similar to the observed data demonstrating the accuracy and generality of the new diffusive root growth model fig 3 compares the simulated and observed vertical root distributions for individual years although simulated and observed results shared similar patterns that root length decreased with respect to depth errors at some sampling locations were as large as 100 in addition to the potential errors from the root sampling and measurements the assumed cross sectional shape of the tilled ridge used in the simulations could contribute to the differences between the observed and simulated results this is likely because a relatively wide ridge has a large soil volume for root growth but roots in a relatively narrow ridge will tend to move horizontally into the interrow space or vertically into the deeper soil layers both observed and simulated results showed that more than 80 of maize roots concentrated within the ridge and in shallow soil layers below the ridge due to the increase of soil bulk density and the mechanical resistance at the depth of 0 15 m the effect of mechanical resistance was also illustrated in laboski et al 1998 by comparing the measured penetration resistance with the lower critical mechanical limit and higher critical mechanical limit of maize roots reported in boone et al 1986 however when maize roots reached the soil layer at the depth of 0 6 1 2 m the soil bulk density reduced from 1 58 mg m 3 to 1 50 mg m 3 hence the penetration resistance was also decreased in the simulations a small increase of root length near that soil layer was shown for 1994 and 1995 however in the measured results such an increasing pattern is not evident 3 2 root growth and soil water conditions in this testing simulation we present maize root development under a range of water availability shaanxi is an inland province of china located in the loess plateau within the continental climate zone the average annual precipitation is 550 mm as a result local agricultural production is water limited cao et al 2009 farmers implement a wheat maize intercropping system to enhance water use efficiency based on the phenological differences of the two crop species the root distribution in this system was studied by ma et al 2019 for demonstration proposes only the maize root data on jul 11 was simulated in this study refer to the maize root distributions under rf and ir conditions in fig 5c ma et al 2019 the row spacing was 0 5 m and the plant spacing along the rows was 0 3 m the plant density was 8 5 plant m 2 the planting date for maize was apr 15 2016 and the irrigation and fertilization schedules were provided in ma et al 2019 however soil properties were not reported in their measurements so the layered soil properties used in this simulation are listed in table 1 a synthetic data similar to the soil properties in zhao et al 2018 the weather data for 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration online dataset at weather stations in xianyang city and wugong county which are close to the experimental site the same soil properties and weather data will be used in sections 3 2 and 4 the root distribution was measured to the depth of 1 0 m in ma et al 2019 however in the simulation we extended the soil profile vertically to 1 5 m depth to include deeper maize roots fig 4 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed root length observed maize root data from ma et al 2019 was digitalized and summed for every 0 1 m layers from soil surface to 1 0 m depth to obtain a vertical root distribution the simulated root data were processed in the same way the regression line is y 0 92 x 1 22 close to the 1 to 1 line which indicates the simulated root distributions were like the observed ones along the vertical direction fig 5a and d show the simulated root growth and soil water content under the observed precipitation most of the root system is located between the depths of 0 0 0 5 m and under the plant relatively high root density marked by the 1 5 cm cm 2 root density contour extended to the depth of 0 7 0 75 m right above the upper boundary of soil layer 5 table 1 one reason for this result is that in soil layer 4 the soil bulk density was relatively low compared to soil layer 5 and the soil water content had the highest value relative to the remainder of the soil profile fig 4d which supported root growth the horizontal spread in the simulation was different compared to the observed results in ma et al 2019 the horizontal extension of the root system was 0 3 m from the plant in ma et al 2019 while in the simulation the 0 5 cm cm 2 root density contour was more than 0 5 m from the plant one possible reason for such differences was the horizontal variations of the soil properties were not considered in the simulation for the irrigation scenario fig 5b and e we applied 12 cm surface irrigations from 12 00 p m to 1 00 p m every 10 days from apr 20 to jul 30 2016 to approximate irrigation scheduled in ma et al 2019 the spatial extension of simulated root expansion was similar to the one under observed precipitation but the root density was reduced by 20 indicating that plants partitioned less c to the roots under relatively sufficient water supply the soil water content results shown in fig 4e were about 0 04 m 3 m 3 higher compared to fig 5d especially for shallow soil layers in order to investigate root growth under drought conditions we reduced the observed precipitation by 50 and no irrigation was applied fig 5c and f the drought treatment was not presented in ma et al 2019 or included in fig 4 but we used this scenario to provide a complete test for root growth in response to a range of soil water conditions under the water demand for transpiration and relatively low soil water availability the maximum root density under the plant achieved a value of 20 cm cm 2 which was 4 times of the root density in the same location under the observed precipitation fig 5a that is because the low soil water content in this treatment decreased the leaf water potential triggering increased partitioning of c to the roots the spatial extension of root growth was reduced in both the vertical and horizontal directions compared to the other two treatments fig 5a and b and most of the roots accumulated in the top 0 25 m soil layer because of the relatively high penetration resistance caused by the relatively low soil water content the simulated maize yield and evaporation transpiration results are summarized in table 2 the total dry mass for maize plants among the three treatments were similar the yield under observed precipitation was 9138 kg ha 1 in the irrigation treatment the yield was increased by 3070 kg ha 1 and the root shoot ratio was reduced from 0 85 to 0 5 despite the irrigation induced decrease of root mass and root shoot ratio the evaporation and transpiration were 20 30 more than the values under observed precipitation indicating a sufficient water supply from soil however the drought treatment reduced the yield by 27 compared to the observed precipitation treatment even though drought conditions promoted root growth the evaporation and transpiration still achieved the smallest values among the three treatments 4 maize root distribution under ridge furrow rainfall harvest management in this example we applied maizsim with the diffusive root growth model to evaluate the effects of rfrh management on maize root development and yield fig 6 presents a soil surface topography for the rfrh placement the shape for the ridge followed a cosine function with 0 6 m in width and 0 15 m in height the furrow was 0 6 m wide due to the symmetry only half of a ridge furrow configuration is presented as the spatial domain for the plant and root growth simulations leftward and rightward extensions were also given in fig 6 but with dashed lines for a typical rfrh management the ridge is mulched for an entire growing season to generate surface runoff in this example three types of surface mulch were considered no mulch control treatment plastic film mulch and fine textured soil mulch the plastic film was assumed to be impermeable to water while the fine textured soil had relatively low saturated hydraulic conductivity physical properties of the fine textured soil are listed in table 1 based on the observations and simulation results the runoff efficiency values i e the ratio between the quantity of surface runoff received in the furrow section and the total precipitation on the ridge for plastic film and fine textured soil were 0 93 and 0 27 respectively wang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 s in fig 6 shows the sowing positions note that in existing agricultural management sowing is normally in the ridge top however the surface mulch for rfrh management remains for an entire growing season to generate runoff hence the plant is seeded in the furrow rather than the ridge in this example the soil properties weather and planting dates were assumed to be the same as the example shown in section 3 2 only observed precipitation was considered in the simulation and no irrigation was applied the snapshots of root density and soil water content were taken on the same day as in section 3 2 such a simulation configuration will not only allow the comparisons of root distribution and plant growth in rfrh management among three mulch types but also enable the comparisons between rfrh management and the traditional management with a flat soil surface fig 5a and d fig 7 shows the simulation results for maize root growth and associated soil water content distribution for rfrh management with no mulch fig 7a the simulated roots mainly propagated along the vertical direction with the highest root density occurring right below the sowing position while the root density contours were asymmetric the 3 0 6 0 cm cm 2 contours were distorted toward the ridge due to the additional soil volume that formed the ridge compared to the flat surface for rfrh management with plastic film fig 7b the simulated roots grew leftwards further than in no mulch treatments fig 7a and achieved the largest root density about 25 cm below the ridge this is because the ridge not only provided additional soil volume but also preserved water for plant use under the plastic mulching zhao et al 2018 however the roots did not grow into the top of the ridge i e comparing with fig 7a the 3 0 6 0 cm cm 2 root contours in fig 7b moved downwards to 20 cm below the ridge that is because the plastic mulching could induce a 5 temperature increase for the top of the ridge refer to fig 9 zhao et al 2018 in rfrh management with fine textured soil mulch fig 7c the simulated root directly grew into the mulch portion because the mulch had relatively large water holding capacity comparing with the bulk soil the simulated soil water distribution corresponding to the three types of surface mulch are presented in fig 7d e and f comparing to the soil water regime in fig 5d relatively high water content is shown at depth 60 75 cm even for the no mulch treatment fig 7d two possible reasons for that are i the surface runoff infiltrated in the furrow promotes deep water percolation and ii the water stored in the ridge and shallow soil layers supplies most of the root water uptake such that water in deep layers is retained however because of the root water uptake no obvious water content increases can be observed in shallow soil layers the evaporation transpiration for rfrh management are summarized in table 3 the evaporation with the rfrh management was greatly reduced compared to the simulated value for the flat soil surface corresponding to the increase of water content at depth 60 75 cm in the rfrh management the transpiration did not present large differences among the three rfrh treatments and the transpiration of the flat soil surface treatment was only 10 more than the rfrh management the transpiration results together with the simulated root distributions indicated that the rfrh management provided water for plant use in shallow soil layers without rfrh managements maize roots tended to penetrate to deep soil layers for enough water uptake the evaporation and transpiration results also indicated that although the rfrh management conserved soil water those water were stored in soil rather than used by plant which was also implied by fig 7 where water stayed below the area of active roots due to such a spatial mismatch the rfrh management only presented small effects in improving the maize water use efficiency based on our simulation example the effects of rfrh management on the plant yield were also presented in table 3 yields among the three rfrh treatments were similar to or only slightly larger than the yield for the flat soil surface similar results can be shown for the dry root mass dry shoot mass and dry total mass values the root shoot ratios were reduced by the rfrh management implying an increasing fraction of the total organic c was partitioned to the above ground parts which contributed to the slightly higher yields fine textured soil mulch promoted root growth near soil surface and inhibited root exploration for water in deeper soil layers which could result in a decrease of maize water and nutrient use efficiency nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 5 summary in this study a diffusive root growth model was developed and implemented in maizsim in the root model potential root growth depended on soil water content transpiration demand carbon c allocation and spatial favorability indices while actual root expansion was treated as a diffusive process of c three modules were designed to simulate the processes of maize root growth the carbon allocation module evaluated the soil water content transpiration and the quantity of c allocated from the shoot for root growth the carbon assignment module calculated the potential distribution of c to a finite element grid based on the favorability indices and the root diffusion module determined the spatial distribution of root based on available c maizsim with the new diffusive root model was evaluated based on observed root density data from the literature we first used the model to estimate vertical root distributions in soil with relatively high bulk density and penetration resistance layers in minnesota u s the results indicated that the diffusive root model can simulate the maize root growth for a variety of soil penetration resistances in order to show the root s responses to a variety of water regimes we further simulated maize root distributions under observed and reduced precipitation with or without irrigation in the loess plateau region of china the simulated root distributions were similar to the observed ones ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh management is a newly proposed management technique for soil water conservation that uses alternating ridges and furrows of soil in a field ridges are usually mulched to receive precipitation and generate surface runoff that infiltrates into the furrows where plants are seeded numerical and experimental studies demonstrated positive rfrh management effects on soil water conservation in this study we applied maizsim with the new diffusive root model to simulate the influences of rfrh management on maize plant growth and root development the rfrh management actively affected the spatial distributions of maize roots but its effect on root mass was small soil evaporation was reduced by the rfrh management but the differences of transpiration values between rfrh management and traditional management with flat soil surface under observed precipitation were not large rfrh management slightly promoted plant yield and reduced root shoot ratio based on our simulations the benefits of rfrh management on maize water use root growth and yield were relatively small in conclusion the new root growth model in maizsim provides a realistic and reliable method for maize root simulations this model can be combined with other crop models to assess agricultural management practices e g suggesting seeding density or optimizing irrigation schedules future studies should include the calibrations of parameters related to the new root model and test the root model with a variety of experimental datasets or apply the root model to evaluate the effects of a variety of field managements on maize root growth declaration 1 the authors declare

10045,the ability to accurately simulate root density and its spatial distribution can enhance our understanding of plant adaption to the soil environment and agricultural water management ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh is a recently proposed management practice which utilizes a mulched ridge and furrowed soil to increase infiltration and conserve water within soil profiles however this management technique has not been extensively assessed for its effects on yield and water use two dimensional 2d root models are useful tools to assess crop yield and water use in rfrh systems as they can simulate root growth and water uptake maizsim is a comprehensive mechanistic model of maize zea mays l growth and yield which uses a 2d finite element representation for soil physical chemical processes and root growth however maizsim utilizes a simple recursive model based on carbon c allocation to simulate root distribution therefore the objectives of this study are to i develop and implement a finite element based diffusive root growth model in maizsim with evaluations on model performance and ii study the effects of rfrh management on maize yield water use and root development using maizsim with the new root model the root model was written into three modules which i allocates total c from plant photosynthesis for root growth based on soil water availability and transpiration demand ii assigns new allocated c for root growth to selected spatial locations in soil and iii calculates the spatial root distribution as c diffusion the root model was validated using observed root data from published studies under the influences of soil bulk density penetration resistance and soil water conditions normal irrigation and drought numerical simulations for rfrh management compared to a flat soil demonstrated that although soil evaporation was decreased the differences for yields shoot and root dry mass were small in conclusion i the newly develop diffusive root model provided an accurate way to simulate maize root growth ii despite the positive effects of rfrh management on soil water conservation its influence on maize yield is relatively small the diffusive model can be used to evaluate the root growth in response to climate changes or management practices and support integrated agricultural simulators that included soil crop and environmental components keywords maizsim 2dsoil diffusive root growth soil water management ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh 1 introduction root density and architecture are related to plant water use efficiency nutrient use efficiency and stress resistance caires et al 2016 white et al 2013 therefore plant response to soil water is highly dependent on its roots and root development is essential for crop growth and field water and nutrition management guo and york 2019 nichols et al 2019 for maize zea mays l plants relatively high final yield is usually associated with relatively extensive root systems mu et al 2015 shao et al 2018 thus one of the targets in modern maize breeding is to adjust the root architecture especially the averaged root angles or the vertical root distributions to achieve high plant density within a farm as well as high yields from individual plants hammer et al 2009 chen et al 2014 root growth is influenced by the soil environment such as soil mechanical resistance water content nutrition level temperature and aeration pearson 1966 research has been directed to quantify the effects from those environmental conditions identify limiting factors and design management techniques to mitigate those limiting effects for example laboski et al 1998 reported that a soil layer with relatively high bulk density 1 57 mg m 3 at 0 15 0 60 m could increase the subsoil penetration resistance and lead to maize root accumulation in shallow soil layers deep inversion tillage and biological drilling by cover crops were two approaches that can ameliorate soil penetration resistance cai et al 2014 chen and weil 2011 cresswell and kirkegaard 1995 li et al 2009 reported that relatively low spring temperature precipitation and soil water content could limit maize root mass and distribution in the northwest territory of china surface mulch with plastic or biodegradable film could warm topsoil while conserving soil water such that the root dry mass density and diameter were increased gao et al 2014 thidar et al 2020 niu et al 2020 field and laboratory experiments have been performed to study maize root growth and root soil interactions however root excavation and sampling are relatively difficult and results from field and laboratory studies are usually of highly variability which degrades data quality for example the coefficients of variation for morphology measurements such as root shoot ratio under specific ambient conditions can range 2 25 e g anderson 1988 hauck et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover for the experiments performed under field conditions root growth is likely influenced by the ambient weather or soil conditions changing from year to year making it difficult to replicate studies precisely for laboratory root experiments especially hydroponics roots are grown in controlled environments making them easy to sample but which do not fully represent field conditions therefore to date our studies of maize root development has been limited by our experimental approaches numerical simulations provide an efficient and reproducible way to study root growth under a variety of environmental conditions and agricultural managements additionally since the root serves as a bridge between crop and soil numerical root models could support the simulations including crop growth soil water movement and chemical transport reddy and pachepsky 2001 klepper and rickman 1990 recent developments of root models typically fall into two major categories i e architectural models vector based and diffusive spatially continuous models gerwitz and page 1974 pag√®s et al 1989 acock et al 1985 dupuy et al 2010 benes et al 2020 the architectural models provide explicit descriptions of root morphology and hierarchical structures via computer graphics techniques prusinkiewicz 2004 godin and sinoquet 2005 postma et al 2017 but may induce computational challenges for model implementations dunbabin 2007 diffusive models describe root growth as a diffusive movement of root carbon c and the geometric and topological characteristics of root architectures are omitted which greatly reduces the computational cost in diffusive models the root distribution is expressed as a continuous density where related functions such as water and nutrient uptake from bulk soil are also continuous with respect to root distributions the diffusive root growth models were demonstrated with root density measurements from chrysanthemum and potato acock and pachepsky 1996 dathe et al 2014 however such a model is not widely available for maize root development especially within integrated soil crop environment simulators for example maizsim is an integrated mechanistic simulator for maize growth and soil physical chemical processes kim et al 2012 timlin et al 1996 wang et al 2020 however maizsim currently utilizes a simple recursive procedure to simulate root development acock et al 1985 thus there exists a need to implement a diffusive root model and perform root growth simulations for maize it is also ideal to make such a diffusive root model compatible with integrated simulators e g maizsim such that the performance of the diffusive root model can be evaluated based on comprehensive weather crop soil simulations crop models with accurate root simulators are useful to simulate root growth and water use which also provide assessments for new agricultural management scenarios one example is ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh a newly proposed management to improve soil water conservation in northwest china wang et al 2015 in the rfrh management method alternative ridges and furrows are established in fields and the ridges are usually mulched with plastic films or fine textured soil for an entire growing season during precipitation any surface runoff that occurs along the ridges will infiltrate into the soil at ridge furrow boundaries therefore additional water would be supplied to the furrow and increase the soil water content due to soil hydraulic and thermal dynamics part of the infiltrated water would be stored under the ridges and part of the infiltrated water would stay at relatively deep soil layers wang et al 2015 describe the design of the rfrh placement with field measurements of surface runoff in gansu province china the effects of rfrh management on soil thermal and hydraulic processes such as water redistribution soil water infiltration surface water flow and soil temperature regimes have been studied numerically by zhao et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 with independent soil and weather datasets however the most direct evaluation of rfrh management should be how it influences maize root growth as well as the final yield such influences have not been fully explored therefore the overall benefits of rfrh management on soil water distribution and crop cultivation should also be evaluated thus the objectives of this study were to i develop and implement a diffusive model within maizsim to simulate maize root growth validate model accuracy with observed data from published studies and ii apply the maizsim with the diffusive root model to evaluate rfrh management effects on maize root growth and yield the use of maizsim with the diffusive root growth model will enhance our understanding of maize root growth in response to soil and climate conditions and assist in optimizing agricultural water nutrition management 2 root model description and numerical implementation in this section a diffusive root growth model for maize is established and its implementation in maizsim is presented as mentioned the diffusive root growth model treats maize root growth as c diffusion hence the model describes the moving path of c in a maize root system i e the total amount of c supplied for root growth and locations of c to grow new roots section 2 1 as well as the directions that the new roots grow to section 2 2 based on the establishment of the diffusive root model its implementation in maizsim is introduced in section 2 3 including the modularization of the diffusive root model and the data exchanges between the diffusive root model and other existing modules in maizsim 2 1 carbon allocation and assignment for maize root growth carbon input for root growth r kg m 3 da y 1 is allocated from plant shoots where co2 is assimilated to organic c via photosynthesis soil water content root water uptake based on the current root density and transpiration demand are the three factors for c allocation at emergence 60 of available c is partitioned to root growth this percentage decreases to 0 as the plant approaches its reproductive stages in well watered conditions the priority of c partitioning is for shoot growth and a pre specified fraction of c is assigned for root development when water stress occurs as defined by low leaf water turgor pressure 0 5 mpa shoot growth is decreased due to reduction in turgor pressure and additional c is partitioned to the root system to promote root growth and water uptake acock et al 1985 dathe et al 2014 up to 100 of the assimilated c can be partitioned to root growth under water stress conditions to determine r as a spatial function within a soil profile the soil domain is first discretized into a finite element grid and for each node spatial location in that grid potential non limited root growth rates are calculated the preference order is defined via favorability indices at each node which indicates the suitability of soil conditions for root growth acock et al 1985 roots are assumed to grow first in the most favorable locations four favorability indices are defined in eq 1 with respect to the penetration resistance water potential temperature aeration o2 and root density acock et al 1985 1 f 1 1 2 œà trd 5 4 œà 0 25 exp 10 58 1 7 œÅ b 1 4 œà rd œà f 2 t 18 1 66 0 t 18 1 18 t 33 t 33 1 66 t 33 f 3 o 2 0 02 7 14 f 4 1 min 1 m y 0 03 œà trd œà œà rd bar are

the four favorability indices vary between 0 and 1 in maizsim the potential c assigned for root growth r kg m 3 da y 1 is a product of i the root density which is a sum of mature root density m kg m 3 and young root density y kg m 3 ii the potential relative growth rate a da y 1 which is a proportion e g 0 55 of root c mass that will grow and iii the minima of the favorability indices i e 2 r m y a min f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 in numerical computations nodes in the given finite element grid are sorted based on the four favorability indices and c is assigned to each node sequentially based on r and the favorability sorted order until the total amount of c allocated for new roots is exhausted such an assignment process determines r in a soil profile which also implies r r for each node 2 2 governing equations for diffusive root growth the governing equations used in the diffusive root model can be written as 3a y t d y r t y m y 3b m t t y m y eq 3a simulates the diffusion of young roots where d d x x d x z d z x d z z is the tensor of root diffusion coefficients along the horizontal x axis and vertical directions z axis when isotropic diffusion is assumed d should be symmetric and positive definite x z t defines the gradient and in eq 3a denotes the inner product carbon input for root growth r is treated as a source term for new young roots while t y m da y 1 is a coefficient corresponding to the root maturity i e t y m y and acts as a sink term for the young roots but a source for the mature roots t day represents time eq 3b indicates the mature roots do not diffuse in the spatial domain in eqs 3a and 3b we follow the results from reddy and pachepsky 2001 and omit the geotropic factor dathe et al 2014 suggested to neglect root death one reason is that root death is also a linear relation with respect to root density and numerically the linear coefficient for root death and t y m will be combined therefore for simplicity we do not explicitly write root death into eqs 3a and 3b the diffusion tensor d in eqs 3a and 3b is considered as a function of soil water potential and temperature i e 4 d d 0 min f 1 œà f 2 t f 1 œà 1 2 sin œÄ œà s œà r œà œà s œà r 2 1 2 f

temperature parameters for the numerical solver a finite element method is applied to eq 3a while eq 3b can be solved explicitly since t y m y can be directly obtained after solving eq 3a a two dimensional 2d finite element solver is used in maizsim for soil water solute and heat movement calculations and eqs 3a and 3b can be solved on the same grid timlin et al 1996 maize roots are assumed to grow within the soil so if the soil profile is deep enough zero flux boundary condition i e y l 0 can be adopted for eq 3a 2 3 implementation of the root model in maizsim maizsim is an integrated modular based soil crop simulator including multiple soil processes and crop growth modules kim et al 2012 soil physical and chemical processes weather crop growth and field management such as irrigation and fertilizer application are coded in separate modules the data interface in maizsim facilitates efficient data exchanges among multiple modules while local variables and subroutines within each module are processed independently timlin et al 1996 therefore new modules in maizsim can be added to existing modules with only minor modification the modularized implementation of the diffusive root model is shown in fig 1 the root model was decomposed into three modules which i allocates total c for root growth from total plant carbon assimilation carbon allocation ii assigns c for root growth at selected soil nodes based on favorability indices carbon assignment and iii determines the spatial root distribution with governing equations eq 3a and 3b root diffusion those three modules are presented with black boxes existing modules in maizsim which have direct data exchanges with the diffusive root model are presented with white boxes the input data from the existing modules to the diffusive root growth model and the data exchanges among the three new root growth modules are labeled soil physical chemical processes such as water and solute flow are also affected by root water and nutrient uptake 3 model evaluation with observed root data we provide two testing examples that compare simulated root growth and measured results from literature dataset these two examples validate the accuracy of the diffusive root model as well as demonstrate the ability of the root model in simulating maize root growth under relatively high mechanical resistance section 3 1 and varying water conditions section 3 2 3 1 root growth and soil strength this testing simulation evaluates the root model s ability to simulate root growth in response to relatively high soil density and penetration resistance the observed root distributions were from a study by laboski et al 1998 who investigated soil strength effects on root growth and reported maize root measurements from 1993 to 1995 near princeton minnesota the soil was a zimmerman fine sand mixed frigid lamellic udipsamments with bulk density up to 1 58 mg m 3 at the depth of 0 15 0 6 m the soil texture bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity were reported in laboski et al 1998 van genuchten 1980 parameters for soil hydraulic properties were calculated from rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 1998 in the experiment of laboski et al 1998 before seeding the soil was ridge tilled with row spacing equal to 0 91 m maize was planted along the ridges which are 0 15 m higher than the soil surface at tasseling an auger of 0 045 m diameter was used to sample the roots at 0 m row measurement 0 2 m quarter row measurement and 0 4 m middle row measurement away from the planting row from the soil surface to 1 2 m depth the samples were sectioned into 0 15 m segments to estimate the vertical root distribution to implement the root growth model the cross sectional shape of ridge was assumed to be an isosceles triangle with 0 2 m base and 0 15 m height since the planting dates were not provided a commonly used planting date for maize in the midwest u s i e doy 140 in mid may was assumed luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 hourly temperature data and radiation data at cambridge minnesota 45 55 n 93 27 w 20 miles to the east of princeton were from the noaa public database https www ncei noaa gov data global hourly access and ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data nsrdb solar solar only and the daily persiann cdr precipitation ashouri et al 2015 available at https www ncei noaa gov data precipitation persiann access was evenly distributed into 24 hour periods such that the daily precipitation can be converted to hourly based data for the potential diffusivity of root c d 0 in eq 4 we adopted values from literature results heinen et al 2003 and made slight adjustments based on the observed root distribution in 1993 laboski et al 1998 the adjusted values i e d xx 0 50 cm 2 da y 1 d zz 0 3 cm 2 da y 1 d xz 0 d zx 0 0 cm 2 da y 1 were applied as a constant for root growth simulations from 1993 to 1995 for comparison instead of calculating the root length exactly at the sampling locations the simulated root length was averaged with 0 1 m horizontal windows centered at 0 m 0 2 m and 0 4 m from the planting row to ensure data stability while the vertical distributions of simulated maize roots were calculated based on the experiment description in laboski et al 1998 fig 2 presents the comparison between the observed and simulated root length for all the sampling locations and depths from 1993 to 1995 the regression line is y 0 91 x 0 05 which is close to the 1 to 1 line the simulated results for all the three years are similar to the observed data demonstrating the accuracy and generality of the new diffusive root growth model fig 3 compares the simulated and observed vertical root distributions for individual years although simulated and observed results shared similar patterns that root length decreased with respect to depth errors at some sampling locations were as large as 100 in addition to the potential errors from the root sampling and measurements the assumed cross sectional shape of the tilled ridge used in the simulations could contribute to the differences between the observed and simulated results this is likely because a relatively wide ridge has a large soil volume for root growth but roots in a relatively narrow ridge will tend to move horizontally into the interrow space or vertically into the deeper soil layers both observed and simulated results showed that more than 80 of maize roots concentrated within the ridge and in shallow soil layers below the ridge due to the increase of soil bulk density and the mechanical resistance at the depth of 0 15 m the effect of mechanical resistance was also illustrated in laboski et al 1998 by comparing the measured penetration resistance with the lower critical mechanical limit and higher critical mechanical limit of maize roots reported in boone et al 1986 however when maize roots reached the soil layer at the depth of 0 6 1 2 m the soil bulk density reduced from 1 58 mg m 3 to 1 50 mg m 3 hence the penetration resistance was also decreased in the simulations a small increase of root length near that soil layer was shown for 1994 and 1995 however in the measured results such an increasing pattern is not evident 3 2 root growth and soil water conditions in this testing simulation we present maize root development under a range of water availability shaanxi is an inland province of china located in the loess plateau within the continental climate zone the average annual precipitation is 550 mm as a result local agricultural production is water limited cao et al 2009 farmers implement a wheat maize intercropping system to enhance water use efficiency based on the phenological differences of the two crop species the root distribution in this system was studied by ma et al 2019 for demonstration proposes only the maize root data on jul 11 was simulated in this study refer to the maize root distributions under rf and ir conditions in fig 5c ma et al 2019 the row spacing was 0 5 m and the plant spacing along the rows was 0 3 m the plant density was 8 5 plant m 2 the planting date for maize was apr 15 2016 and the irrigation and fertilization schedules were provided in ma et al 2019 however soil properties were not reported in their measurements so the layered soil properties used in this simulation are listed in table 1 a synthetic data similar to the soil properties in zhao et al 2018 the weather data for 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration online dataset at weather stations in xianyang city and wugong county which are close to the experimental site the same soil properties and weather data will be used in sections 3 2 and 4 the root distribution was measured to the depth of 1 0 m in ma et al 2019 however in the simulation we extended the soil profile vertically to 1 5 m depth to include deeper maize roots fig 4 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed root length observed maize root data from ma et al 2019 was digitalized and summed for every 0 1 m layers from soil surface to 1 0 m depth to obtain a vertical root distribution the simulated root data were processed in the same way the regression line is y 0 92 x 1 22 close to the 1 to 1 line which indicates the simulated root distributions were like the observed ones along the vertical direction fig 5a and d show the simulated root growth and soil water content under the observed precipitation most of the root system is located between the depths of 0 0 0 5 m and under the plant relatively high root density marked by the 1 5 cm cm 2 root density contour extended to the depth of 0 7 0 75 m right above the upper boundary of soil layer 5 table 1 one reason for this result is that in soil layer 4 the soil bulk density was relatively low compared to soil layer 5 and the soil water content had the highest value relative to the remainder of the soil profile fig 4d which supported root growth the horizontal spread in the simulation was different compared to the observed results in ma et al 2019 the horizontal extension of the root system was 0 3 m from the plant in ma et al 2019 while in the simulation the 0 5 cm cm 2 root density contour was more than 0 5 m from the plant one possible reason for such differences was the horizontal variations of the soil properties were not considered in the simulation for the irrigation scenario fig 5b and e we applied 12 cm surface irrigations from 12 00 p m to 1 00 p m every 10 days from apr 20 to jul 30 2016 to approximate irrigation scheduled in ma et al 2019 the spatial extension of simulated root expansion was similar to the one under observed precipitation but the root density was reduced by 20 indicating that plants partitioned less c to the roots under relatively sufficient water supply the soil water content results shown in fig 4e were about 0 04 m 3 m 3 higher compared to fig 5d especially for shallow soil layers in order to investigate root growth under drought conditions we reduced the observed precipitation by 50 and no irrigation was applied fig 5c and f the drought treatment was not presented in ma et al 2019 or included in fig 4 but we used this scenario to provide a complete test for root growth in response to a range of soil water conditions under the water demand for transpiration and relatively low soil water availability the maximum root density under the plant achieved a value of 20 cm cm 2 which was 4 times of the root density in the same location under the observed precipitation fig 5a that is because the low soil water content in this treatment decreased the leaf water potential triggering increased partitioning of c to the roots the spatial extension of root growth was reduced in both the vertical and horizontal directions compared to the other two treatments fig 5a and b and most of the roots accumulated in the top 0 25 m soil layer because of the relatively high penetration resistance caused by the relatively low soil water content the simulated maize yield and evaporation transpiration results are summarized in table 2 the total dry mass for maize plants among the three treatments were similar the yield under observed precipitation was 9138 kg ha 1 in the irrigation treatment the yield was increased by 3070 kg ha 1 and the root shoot ratio was reduced from 0 85 to 0 5 despite the irrigation induced decrease of root mass and root shoot ratio the evaporation and transpiration were 20 30 more than the values under observed precipitation indicating a sufficient water supply from soil however the drought treatment reduced the yield by 27 compared to the observed precipitation treatment even though drought conditions promoted root growth the evaporation and transpiration still achieved the smallest values among the three treatments 4 maize root distribution under ridge furrow rainfall harvest management in this example we applied maizsim with the diffusive root growth model to evaluate the effects of rfrh management on maize root development and yield fig 6 presents a soil surface topography for the rfrh placement the shape for the ridge followed a cosine function with 0 6 m in width and 0 15 m in height the furrow was 0 6 m wide due to the symmetry only half of a ridge furrow configuration is presented as the spatial domain for the plant and root growth simulations leftward and rightward extensions were also given in fig 6 but with dashed lines for a typical rfrh management the ridge is mulched for an entire growing season to generate surface runoff in this example three types of surface mulch were considered no mulch control treatment plastic film mulch and fine textured soil mulch the plastic film was assumed to be impermeable to water while the fine textured soil had relatively low saturated hydraulic conductivity physical properties of the fine textured soil are listed in table 1 based on the observations and simulation results the runoff efficiency values i e the ratio between the quantity of surface runoff received in the furrow section and the total precipitation on the ridge for plastic film and fine textured soil were 0 93 and 0 27 respectively wang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 s in fig 6 shows the sowing positions note that in existing agricultural management sowing is normally in the ridge top however the surface mulch for rfrh management remains for an entire growing season to generate runoff hence the plant is seeded in the furrow rather than the ridge in this example the soil properties weather and planting dates were assumed to be the same as the example shown in section 3 2 only observed precipitation was considered in the simulation and no irrigation was applied the snapshots of root density and soil water content were taken on the same day as in section 3 2 such a simulation configuration will not only allow the comparisons of root distribution and plant growth in rfrh management among three mulch types but also enable the comparisons between rfrh management and the traditional management with a flat soil surface fig 5a and d fig 7 shows the simulation results for maize root growth and associated soil water content distribution for rfrh management with no mulch fig 7a the simulated roots mainly propagated along the vertical direction with the highest root density occurring right below the sowing position while the root density contours were asymmetric the 3 0 6 0 cm cm 2 contours were distorted toward the ridge due to the additional soil volume that formed the ridge compared to the flat surface for rfrh management with plastic film fig 7b the simulated roots grew leftwards further than in no mulch treatments fig 7a and achieved the largest root density about 25 cm below the ridge this is because the ridge not only provided additional soil volume but also preserved water for plant use under the plastic mulching zhao et al 2018 however the roots did not grow into the top of the ridge i e comparing with fig 7a the 3 0 6 0 cm cm 2 root contours in fig 7b moved downwards to 20 cm below the ridge that is because the plastic mulching could induce a 5 temperature increase for the top of the ridge refer to fig 9 zhao et al 2018 in rfrh management with fine textured soil mulch fig 7c the simulated root directly grew into the mulch portion because the mulch had relatively large water holding capacity comparing with the bulk soil the simulated soil water distribution corresponding to the three types of surface mulch are presented in fig 7d e and f comparing to the soil water regime in fig 5d relatively high water content is shown at depth 60 75 cm even for the no mulch treatment fig 7d two possible reasons for that are i the surface runoff infiltrated in the furrow promotes deep water percolation and ii the water stored in the ridge and shallow soil layers supplies most of the root water uptake such that water in deep layers is retained however because of the root water uptake no obvious water content increases can be observed in shallow soil layers the evaporation transpiration for rfrh management are summarized in table 3 the evaporation with the rfrh management was greatly reduced compared to the simulated value for the flat soil surface corresponding to the increase of water content at depth 60 75 cm in the rfrh management the transpiration did not present large differences among the three rfrh treatments and the transpiration of the flat soil surface treatment was only 10 more than the rfrh management the transpiration results together with the simulated root distributions indicated that the rfrh management provided water for plant use in shallow soil layers without rfrh managements maize roots tended to penetrate to deep soil layers for enough water uptake the evaporation and transpiration results also indicated that although the rfrh management conserved soil water those water were stored in soil rather than used by plant which was also implied by fig 7 where water stayed below the area of active roots due to such a spatial mismatch the rfrh management only presented small effects in improving the maize water use efficiency based on our simulation example the effects of rfrh management on the plant yield were also presented in table 3 yields among the three rfrh treatments were similar to or only slightly larger than the yield for the flat soil surface similar results can be shown for the dry root mass dry shoot mass and dry total mass values the root shoot ratios were reduced by the rfrh management implying an increasing fraction of the total organic c was partitioned to the above ground parts which contributed to the slightly higher yields fine textured soil mulch promoted root growth near soil surface and inhibited root exploration for water in deeper soil layers which could result in a decrease of maize water and nutrient use efficiency nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 5 summary in this study a diffusive root growth model was developed and implemented in maizsim in the root model potential root growth depended on soil water content transpiration demand carbon c allocation and spatial favorability indices while actual root expansion was treated as a diffusive process of c three modules were designed to simulate the processes of maize root growth the carbon allocation module evaluated the soil water content transpiration and the quantity of c allocated from the shoot for root growth the carbon assignment module calculated the potential distribution of c to a finite element grid based on the favorability indices and the root diffusion module determined the spatial distribution of root based on available c maizsim with the new diffusive root model was evaluated based on observed root density data from the literature we first used the model to estimate vertical root distributions in soil with relatively high bulk density and penetration resistance layers in minnesota u s the results indicated that the diffusive root model can simulate the maize root growth for a variety of soil penetration resistances in order to show the root s responses to a variety of water regimes we further simulated maize root distributions under observed and reduced precipitation with or without irrigation in the loess plateau region of china the simulated root distributions were similar to the observed ones ridge furrow rainfall harvest rfrh management is a newly proposed management technique for soil water conservation that uses alternating ridges and furrows of soil in a field ridges are usually mulched to receive precipitation and generate surface runoff that infiltrates into the furrows where plants are seeded numerical and experimental studies demonstrated positive rfrh management effects on soil water conservation in this study we applied maizsim with the new diffusive root model to simulate the influences of rfrh management on maize plant growth and root development the rfrh management actively affected the spatial distributions of maize roots but its effect on root mass was small soil evaporation was reduced by the rfrh management but the differences of transpiration values between rfrh management and traditional management with flat soil surface under observed precipitation were not large rfrh management slightly promoted plant yield and reduced root shoot ratio based on our simulations the benefits of rfrh management on maize water use root growth and yield were relatively small in conclusion the new root growth model in maizsim provides a realistic and reliable method for maize root simulations this model can be combined with other crop models to assess agricultural management practices e g suggesting seeding density or optimizing irrigation schedules future studies should include the calibrations of parameters related to the new root model and test the root model with a variety of experimental datasets or apply the root model to evaluate the effects of a variety of field managements on maize root growth declaration 1 the authors declare

10046,the hydrogenionic potential ph is one of the parameters that characterize the quality of water for irrigation and can influence soil microbiology and the cation exchange process between soil and plant however there are few studies related to the ph of irrigation water for hop culture according to this our work aimed to evaluate the irrigation effect with different water ph ranges on the agronomic development of hops grown in a greenhouse in botucatu state of s√£o paulo brazil it was used a completely randomized design crd with three treatments ph levels and ten replications the treatments consisted of three water ph levels t1 6 to 6 5 t2 6 5 to 7 and t3 7 to 7 5 to obtain the different ph ranges were used solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of sodium hydroxide naoh and phosphoric acid h3po4 gas exchanges nutritional content in plant leaf tissue yield and alpha and beta acids concentration were evaluated the results obtained allowed us to conclude that the ph range 6 5 to 7 promotes greater availability absorption and accumulation of k in plant leaf tissue as well as greater photosynthetic capacity in addition to greater yield between treatments the preliminary values of alpha and beta acids were higher in plants irrigated with the water ph of t1 indicating that possible stress may favor the production of these compounds keywords humulus lupulus l cascade water quality

2017 graf et al 2019 the quality of irrigation water is a factor that must be considered when irrigating crops tomaz et al 2020 one of the parameters involving water quality is the hydrogenionic potential ph which is characterized by the balance between the h and oh ions in the medium which will indicate the condition of acidity neutrality and alkalinity of the medium silva et al 2012

nitrogen 100 kg ha 1 of potassium chloride k2o with 60 potassium and 40 kg ha 1 of simple superphosphate p2o3 with 18 phosphorus for cover fertilization urea 45 nitrogen was used which was applied in installments at 25 50 75 100 and 125 days after transplanting dat each application was 42 5 kg ha 1 totaling 212 5 kg ha 1 applied during the culture cycle 2 6 experimental design and irrigation system it was used a completely randomized design crd with three treatments and ten replications per treatment with a total of 30 plants the irrigation system fig 1 had two sets of three drip irrigation lines each corresponding to a range of water hydrogen potential ph being treatment 1 t1 6 0 to 6 5 treatment 2 t2 6 5 to 7 0 and treatment 3 t3 7 0 to 7 5 fifteen plants were allocated to each set of lines being randomized as to their positions and treatments three water reservoirs with a volumetric capacity of 120 liters were used to supply the irrigation lines one for each treatment fig 1 in each emitter of the lines microtubes and rods were installed to conduct the water to the containers to obtain the treatments solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of sodium hydroxide naoh in microbeads were used to raise the ph and phosphoric acid h3po4 with 85 concentration and density of 1 6 g ml 1 to lower the ph the treatments started at 35 dat the ph measurements and adjustments performed with the aid of the akso portable phmeter model ak90 were made before irrigation and with the reservoirs filled with 80 liters of water 2 7 irrigation management based on soil water content soil water content was monitored based on its water retention curve for this nine puncture tensiometers were installed at a depth of 0 20 m three for each treatment the readings of the tensiometers were performed daily always at 8 am with the aid of a digital tensiometer to promote the plant s adaptations to the new environment in the first 34 days after transplantation the irrigation water depth was calculated based on the average of all installed tensiometers being applied an average irrigation water depth of 3 7 mm per day after the treatment starts the irrigation depths were calculated based on the mean values of the tensiometers measurements for each treatment the management aimed to keep the soil close to the field capacity tension of 10 kpa thus when the mean reading of the tensiometers was greater than 10 kpa irrigation was performed according to the demand for each treatment the water content at the field capacity Œ∏cc was 0 2337 cm3 cm 3 2 8 monitoring soil solution we used nine porous capsule extractors to obtain the soil solution three for each treatment installed in the depth of 0 20 m of the polyvinyl pots the soil solution sampling was performed every 15 days always after irrigation the vacuum was applied to the extractor using a plastic syringe and a three way valve the solution samples were stored in plastic containers with identification we used a phmeter to measure the ph solutions the ph of the solution was within the ranges established for the irrigation water ph 6 49 treatment 1 6 94 treatment 2 and 7 40 treatment 3 2 9 parameters after 153 days of plant transplanting the evaluation of the leaf vegetable nutritional content was carried out thus 20 g of leaves from each plant were randomly collected and a total of twenty four plants were evaluated eight per treatment the leaves were stored in paper bags and dried in a forced ventilation oven for 24 h after drying the leaves were ground and analyzed according to the methodology for determining the nutritional content malavolta et al 1997 the assessment of gas exchange was obtained at 94 days after plant transplanting in the morning between 8 and 11 am with the infrared gas analyzer irga li cor model li 6400 portable photosynthesis system eighteen plants were analyzed six from each treatment the light absorption curve was obtained to determine the maximum luminous absorption rate and thus the maximum photosynthetic rate of the plant the maximum luminous absorption rate established for the hops at the experimental conditions was 1600 ¬µmol m 2 s 1 to determine yield we use a precision balance to obtain the cone s mass g the total cones masses were calculated for each plant the hop plant yield obtained was expressed in grams of cones per plant g plant 1 three samples of 30 g of hop cones from each treatment were analyzed to determine the levels of alpha and beta acids the analyzes were performed according to the asbc hops 6 a 8 and 12 methods

statistical analysis the data were submitted to analysis of variance anova then residue analysis was performed considering the tests for the normality of shapiro wilk and homoscedasticity bartlett levene and brown forsythe tests in the case of data that did not meet the previous basic assumptions the box cox transformation was performed the analyzes were complemented by the tukey multiple comparison tests when necessary all analyzes were performed considering a 5 significance level software r version 3 6 1 core team 2016 was used for statistical analysis for the graphic elements sigmaplot software version 12 systat software inc 2010 was used 3 results 3 1 temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit fig 2 shows that the maximum air temperature ranged from 23 32 to 41 68 c and the minimum from 13 02 to 24 43 c with an average temperature of 24 58 c the maximum relative air humidity ranged from 59 43 to 99 10 and the minimum from 20 53 to 79 58 the average relative humidity was 71 50 the vapor pressure deficit vpd ranged from 0 18 to 276 with an average of 0 93kpa 3 2 leaf vegetable nutritional content table 1 presents the averages standard deviations and analysis of variance for the leaves nutritional contents of the hop plants related to the different irrigation water ph ranges there was a significant difference between treatments for macronutrients potassium k and calcium ca and for micronutrients boron b copper cu and manganese mn fig 3 shows the contents of macronutrients in the hop leaves the potassium k content tends to increase with the water ph range 6 to 7 hop plants irrigated with a ph range of 6 5 to 7 treatment 2 presented the highest leaf k contents the contents of calcium ca may have been decreased when the irrigation water ph increased however with irrigation water in the range of ph 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 the highest averages of calcium were obtained the highest levels obtained for calcium were from plants with the lowest k levels averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance the micronutrient levels present in the hop leaves fig 4 were influenced by the ph ranges of the irrigation water for boron b content the ph range 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 had the highest average b 57 1 mg kg 1 on the other hand with the increase in the ph range the average levels decreased significantly with no statistical difference between treatments 2 and 3 the plants of treatment 3 showed the highest levels of copper cu with an average of 26 4 mg kg 1 while in treatments 1 and 2 the average levels were 18 5 and 12 0 mg kg 1 respectively for manganese mn the average levels in the plant leaf tissue decreased with the increase of the ph ranges thus the plants submitted to treatment 1 had the highest average levels having an average of 81 4 mg kg 1 while those submitted to treatments 2 and 3 showed a reduction in the average levels of 9 and 22 respectively compared to treatment 1 averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance 3 3 gas exchange according to the means values standard deviations and analysis of variance presented in table 2 it is observed that there was a significant effect of water ph on the following physiological parameters photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration rate and carboxylation efficiency the physiological parameters evaluated are shown in fig 5 the plants of treatment 2 showed a higher photosynthetic rate followed by treatments 1 and 3 fig 5 a stomatal conductance fig 5b and sweating rate fig 5 c showed no significant difference for treatments 1 and 2 however they were superior to treatment 3 treatment 2 showed the best carboxylation efficiency when compared to treatments 1 and 3 which showed no significant difference fig 5d averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance 3 4 yield based on the results of the analysis of variance table 3 it is observed that there was a significant effect of the water ph ranges on yield per plant g plant 1 averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance fig 6a shows the highest yield was of plants submitted to treatment 2 with an average of 18 0 g plant 1 for treatments 3 and 1 there was no significant difference between their yield but there was a reduction in yield of 61 and 73 respectively when compared to treatment 2 the concentration of alpha acids for treatments 1 and 2 were similar and higher than the values obtained in treatment 3 for beta acids fig 6b the highest concentrations were observed in treatment 1 and for treatments 2 and 3 there was a reduction of 18 and 35 respectively when compared to treatment 1 4 discussion climatic conditions can influence the growth and development of hop plants as well as the yield of cones and the compounds present in the leaves and cones sp√≥sito et al 2019 affirm that air temperatures between 20 and 30 c are indicated for the growth and development of hop plants air temperatures above 32 c can interfere with the plant s physiology causing early flowering and low alpha and beta acid biosynthesis sreƒçec et al 2004 de keukeleire et al 2007 mozny et al 2009 pavlovic et al 2012 bauerle 2019 thus when observing the air temperature values it is possible to verify that the maximum was above 32 c during almost the entire conduction period which caused early flowering in the plants especially in the treatment 3 plants the air relative humidity showed an inverse behavior at air temperature which was predicted this behavior occurs because with the increase in temperature the air heats up and the atmosphere can retain more water in the form of steam costa leal carmo junior 2004 during the day when the air temperature is high the air relative humidity of the air tends to be lower while the night with the temperature decline the air relative humidity increases reaching 100 tubelis nascimento 1988 prados 2007 pavlovic et al 2012 carried out a study in slovenia with the aurora variety and found the air relative humidity has a low correlation with the levels of alpha acids however the highest levels were obtained when the air relative humidity was close to 71 the vapor pressure deficit vpd indicates a reduction in the water potential in the atmosphere mainly with an increase in air temperature the higher the ambient air temperature the greater the amount of water in the form of vapor retained by the atmosphere pimentel 2004 yuan et al 2019 the highest vpd values occurred with the increase in air temperature and the decrease in air relative humidity the increase in vpd affects plant growth and development which can cause mortality and reduced plant yield williams et al 2012 lobell et al 2014 restaino et al 2016 ding et al 2018 these effects are explained by the stomatal closure of plants causing the leaves photosynthetic rates to decrease significantly fletcher et al 2007 the water ph changed the ph of the soil solution during the research in general the main route of nutrient uptake by plant roots occurred through soil solution besides ion concentration availability and nutrient absorption by plants are directly related to ph taiz et al 2017 melo et al 2019 the nutritional content of leaf plant tissue in plants results from the availability of elements macro and micronutrients in the soil absorption by the roots through the soil solution and translocation to the aerial part ernani et al 2007 santos and rodrigues 2017 these elements are absorbed in the form of ions such as k potassium ca 2 calcium h3bo3 boron cu2 copper and mn2 manganese mitra 2015 taiz et al 2017 according to costa et al 2019 values close to neutral ph promote greater availability of nutrients macronutrients and facilitate their absorption by plant roots thus when irrigating the hop plants v cascade with the water ph range 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 and 6 5 to 7 treatment 2 the higher the ca and k levels in leaf plant tissue will be in these ranges there is no competition between the ca 2 and k ions with oh and or h and it is more available for absorption however using irrigation water with ph range 7 to 7 5 the leaf contents of ca and k are significantly reduced due to the competition between the ions marschner 1986 according to malavolta 2006 and chiodini et al 2013 high oh concentrations ph 7 to 7 5 inhibit the absorption of other ions resulting in the formation of insoluble hydroxides and consequently deficiency and reduced nutritional content in leaf plant tissue disproportionality was observed between ca and k concentrations the highest levels were observed in plants with the lowest k levels this phenomenon is called antagonism characterized by a negative interaction when a nutrient inhibits the other nutrient absorption ranade malvi 2011 concerning ca and k competitive inhibition may have occurred since ca 2 in greater concentration limited the passage of k through the membrane channel faquin 2005 malavolta 2006 bindraban et al 2015 for micronutrients the ph range that promoted the greatest availability is from 5 to 6 5 because the increase in ph causes the availability to decrease and may cause toxicity in plants meurer 2007 brady and weil 2012 cotta 2016 this was observed in the results obtained the highest levels of b and mn in the leaf plant tissue of hop plants v cascade were obtained in plants that received water from treatment 1 according to abreu et al 2007 and taiz et al 2017 they observed that the greater availability of these micronutrients is in acidic conditions it should be noted that for the conditions that tend to neutrality ph range 6 5 to 7 and alkalinity ph range 7 to 7 5 the concentration of b ions in the form of borate b oh 4 increases causing adsorption and also competition with oh ions in greater concentration that affect availability and absorption by plants hu brown 1997 malavolta 2006 herrera rodr√≠guez et al 2010 for mn mn2 ions become insoluble affecting their availability valadares et al 2014 cu showed a different behavior from other micronutrients since the highest levels in the leaf plant tissue of hops plants v cascade was in plants irrigated with water in the ph range of 7 to 7 5 this result differs from those described in the literature since the greatest availability and absorption of the soil solution is in acid condition more specifically in the range of 5 to 6 5 abreu et al 2007 the increase in ph negatively influences the availability solubility and absorption of cu2 ions dechen and nachtigall 2006 abreu et al 2007 however mitra 2015 states that the effects of ph on the absorption of cu2 differ between cultures michaud et al 2007 working with wheat triticum turgidum durum l var in soils contaminated by cu found that there was no correlation between ph and absorption of this element also the authors found that the concentration of cu in the root tends to increase with the increase in ph chaves et al 2010 affirm cu mobility in plant tissues can increase considering this information the levels of this element in the soil solution were probably high which resulted in translocation and the high accumulation in leaf tissues jarvis 1981 points out that there may be exceptions to cu availability under high ph conditions this may have occurred during the present study in the situation in which the presence of negative charges oh in the ph 7 to 7 5 range probably did not cause the adsorption of cu2 ions chaves et al 2009 affirm that the availability of cu for plants is directly related to adsorption the lower the adsorption the greater the availability of this micronutrient for plants this explained the high availability solubility absorption and assimilation of cu in the leaf plant tissue of hop plants in treatment 3 compared to these in treatment 1 and 2 the photosynthetic capacity of plants irrigated with water ph 6 to 6 5 treatment 2 was more efficient in this condition the available carbon was used more efficiently to perform photosynthesis the efficiency of carboxylation is the ratio between photosynthesis and internal co2 concentration aighewi and ekanayake 2004 affirm that gas exchange can be influenced by several factors among them the leaf position phenological phase humidity temperature water availability and nutritional content of plants mainly concerning the k content k is considered one of the most important macronutrients for plant development it is responsible for the main metabolic processes such as the mechanism that controls stomatal conductance gs which directly affects the photosynthetic capacity of plants assmann and shimazaki 1999 schroeder et al 2001 roelfsema and hedrich 2005 alquini et al 2013 andr√©s et al 2014 in the present study it was observed the increase of potassium content in plant leaf tissue which increases the photosynthetic capacity of the plants treatment 2 several studies have found that k has a very important role in the photosynthetic capacity of plants sangakkara et al 2001 cakmak 2005 prado 2008 jia et al 2008 jin et al 2011 catuchi et al 2012 however the reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of the plants submitted to treatments 1 and 3 are related to the lower k levels and the high cu levels high levels of cu negatively influence gas exchange causing a decrease in photosynthetic activity which directly affects plant development due to low carboxylation efficiency mateos naranjo et al 2008 cambroll√© et al 2013 2015 adrees et al 2015 mitra 2015 the yield of a crop including hops is the result of management irrigation harvesting and fertilization practices in this study it was observed that different ph ranges of irrigation water influenced the availability and absorption of some nutrients the photosynthetic capacity and the yield of cones according to fagherazzi et al 2018 the yield of cones in the first year of cultivation is less than 2 kg per plant which shows an increasing trend over the years due to the adaptation and growth of the rhizomes it is important to note that yield in the first year may be even lower depending on the variety as the cones vary in size and mass according to sp√≥sito et al 2019 the cascade variety can present a production of approximately 2500 kg ha 1 1225 g plant 1 however this production is directly proportional to the age of the plant and the growing conditions nakawuka et al 2017 found that in 2012 the yield of the varieties studied increased compared to the year 2011 the alpha and beta concentrations present in the cones of the cascade variety can be approximately 4 5 7 respectively sp√≥sito et al 2019 however information about the amount of alpha and beta acids present in the cones of the first year plants cones not only cascade variety but other cultivated varieties is still scarce in the literature for kuƒçera and krofta 2009 the concentration of alpha and beta acids can vary from one year to the next depending on the age of the plant nakawuka et al 2017 observed that in 2012 there was an increase in the concentrations of alpha and beta acids for the chinook variety compared to the year 2011 the authors also observed there was no significant difference between compounds for the levels of total water depth irrigation 60 80 and 100 it can be verified that the age of the plant is a factor that certainly influences the concentration of alpha and beta acids and maybe occurred stress conditions for example irrigation with water ph in the range 6 to 6 5 can favor the production of these compounds but on the other hand pedoclimatic conditions for example the absence of moisture in the soil during the development phase can negatively influence the production and accumulation of compounds de keukeleire et al 2007 sreƒçec et al 2008 fandi√±o et al 2015 5 conclusion the agronomic development of hops v cascade is influenced by the different ph ranges of the irrigation water being observed that the range of 6 5 to 7 promotes greater availability and absorption of k ions and greater k accumulation in plant leaf tissue photosynthetic capacity and cone yield the ph range 7 to 7 5 becomes harmful to the hop culture as it promoted greater availability absorption and accumulation of cu in the leaf plant tissue and consequently negatively influenced the photosynthetic capacity yield and alpha and beta concentrations acids the preliminary values of alpha and beta acids were higher in plants irrigated with water ph in the range 6 to 6 5 indicating that possible stress may favor the production of these compounds the preliminary results present strong indications that the agronomic behavior of the hop crop humulus lupulus l var cascade can be influenced by the ph ranges of the irrigation water furthermore the results obtained can be used as a basis for the development of new studies since

10046,the hydrogenionic potential ph is one of the parameters that characterize the quality of water for irrigation and can influence soil microbiology and the cation exchange process between soil and plant however there are few studies related to the ph of irrigation water for hop culture according to this our work aimed to evaluate the irrigation effect with different water ph ranges on the agronomic development of hops grown in a greenhouse in botucatu state of s√£o paulo brazil it was used a completely randomized design crd with three treatments ph levels and ten replications the treatments consisted of three water ph levels t1 6 to 6 5 t2 6 5 to 7 and t3 7 to 7 5 to obtain the different ph ranges were used solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of sodium hydroxide naoh and phosphoric acid h3po4 gas exchanges nutritional content in plant leaf tissue yield and alpha and beta acids concentration were evaluated the results obtained allowed us to conclude that the ph range 6 5 to 7 promotes greater availability absorption and accumulation of k in plant leaf tissue as well as greater photosynthetic capacity in addition to greater yield between treatments the preliminary values of alpha and beta acids were higher in plants irrigated with the water ph of t1 indicating that possible stress may favor the production of these compounds keywords humulus lupulus l cascade water quality

nitrogen 100 kg ha 1 of potassium chloride k2o with 60 potassium and 40 kg ha 1 of simple superphosphate p2o3 with 18 phosphorus for cover fertilization urea 45 nitrogen was used which was applied in installments at 25 50 75 100 and 125 days after transplanting dat each application was 42 5 kg ha 1 totaling 212 5 kg ha 1 applied during the culture cycle 2 6 experimental design and irrigation system it was used a completely randomized design crd with three treatments and ten replications per treatment with a total of 30 plants the irrigation system fig 1 had two sets of three drip irrigation lines each corresponding to a range of water hydrogen potential ph being treatment 1 t1 6 0 to 6 5 treatment 2 t2 6 5 to 7 0 and treatment 3 t3 7 0 to 7 5 fifteen plants were allocated to each set of lines being randomized as to their positions and treatments three water reservoirs with a volumetric capacity of 120 liters were used to supply the irrigation lines one for each treatment fig 1 in each emitter of the lines microtubes and rods were installed to conduct the water to the containers to obtain the treatments solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of sodium hydroxide naoh in microbeads were used to raise the ph and phosphoric acid h3po4 with 85 concentration and density of 1 6 g ml 1 to lower the ph the treatments started at 35 dat the ph measurements and adjustments performed with the aid of the akso portable phmeter model ak90 were made before irrigation and with the reservoirs filled with 80 liters of water 2 7 irrigation management based on soil water content soil water content was monitored based on its water retention curve for this nine puncture tensiometers were installed at a depth of 0 20 m three for each treatment the readings of the tensiometers were performed daily always at 8 am with the aid of a digital tensiometer to promote the plant s adaptations to the new environment in the first 34 days after transplantation the irrigation water depth was calculated based on the average of all installed tensiometers being applied an average irrigation water depth of 3 7 mm per day after the treatment starts the irrigation depths were calculated based on the mean values of the tensiometers measurements for each treatment the management aimed to keep the soil close to the field capacity tension of 10 kpa thus when the mean reading of the tensiometers was greater than 10 kpa irrigation was performed according to the demand for each treatment the water content at the field capacity Œ∏cc was 0 2337 cm3 cm 3 2 8 monitoring soil solution we used nine porous capsule extractors to obtain the soil solution three for each treatment installed in the depth of 0 20 m of the polyvinyl pots the soil solution sampling was performed every 15 days always after irrigation the vacuum was applied to the extractor using a plastic syringe and a three way valve the solution samples were stored in plastic containers with identification we used a phmeter to measure the ph solutions the ph of the solution was within the ranges established for the irrigation water ph 6 49 treatment 1 6 94 treatment 2 and 7 40 treatment 3 2 9 parameters after 153 days of plant transplanting the evaluation of the leaf vegetable nutritional content was carried out thus 20 g of leaves from each plant were randomly collected and a total of twenty four plants were evaluated eight per treatment the leaves were stored in paper bags and dried in a forced ventilation oven for 24 h after drying the leaves were ground and analyzed according to the methodology for determining the nutritional content malavolta et al 1997 the assessment of gas exchange was obtained at 94 days after plant transplanting in the morning between 8 and 11 am with the infrared gas analyzer irga li cor model li 6400 portable photosynthesis system eighteen plants were analyzed six from each treatment the light absorption curve was obtained to determine the maximum luminous absorption rate and thus the maximum photosynthetic rate of the plant the maximum luminous absorption rate established for the hops at the experimental conditions was 1600 ¬µmol m 2 s 1 to determine yield we use a precision balance to obtain the cone s mass g the total cones masses were calculated for each plant the hop plant yield obtained was expressed in grams of cones per plant g plant 1 three samples of 30 g of hop cones from each treatment were analyzed to determine the levels of alpha and beta acids the analyzes were performed according to the asbc hops 6 a 8 and 12 methods proposed by the american society of brewing chemist american society of brewing chemists 2011 carried out by the tecden technologic ltda epp laboratory porto alegre state of rio grande do sul 2 10 statistical analysis the data were submitted to analysis of variance anova then residue analysis was performed considering the tests for the normality of shapiro wilk and homoscedasticity bartlett levene and brown forsythe tests in the case of data that did not meet the previous basic assumptions the box cox transformation was performed the analyzes were complemented by the tukey multiple comparison tests when necessary all analyzes were performed considering a 5 significance level software r version 3 6 1 core team 2016 was used for statistical analysis for the graphic elements sigmaplot software version 12 systat software inc 2010 was used 3 results 3 1 temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit fig 2 shows that the maximum air temperature ranged from 23 32 to 41 68 c and the minimum from 13 02 to 24 43 c with an average temperature of 24 58 c the maximum relative air humidity ranged from 59 43 to 99 10 and the minimum from 20 53 to 79 58 the average relative humidity was 71 50 the vapor pressure deficit vpd ranged from 0 18 to 276 with an average of 0 93kpa 3 2 leaf vegetable nutritional content table 1 presents the averages standard deviations and analysis of variance for the leaves nutritional contents of the hop plants related to the different irrigation water ph ranges there was a significant difference between treatments for macronutrients potassium k and calcium ca and for micronutrients boron b copper cu and manganese mn fig 3 shows the contents of macronutrients in the hop leaves the potassium k content tends to increase with the water ph range 6 to 7 hop plants irrigated with a ph range of 6 5 to 7 treatment 2 presented the highest leaf k contents the contents of calcium ca may have been decreased when the irrigation water ph increased however with irrigation water in the range of ph 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 the highest averages of calcium were obtained the highest levels obtained for calcium were from plants with the lowest k levels averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance the micronutrient levels present in the hop leaves fig 4 were influenced by the ph ranges of the irrigation water for boron b content the ph range 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 had the highest average b 57 1 mg kg 1 on the other hand with the increase in the ph range the average levels decreased significantly with no statistical difference between treatments 2 and 3 the plants of treatment 3 showed the highest levels of copper cu with an average of 26 4 mg kg 1 while in treatments 1 and 2 the average levels were 18 5 and 12 0 mg kg 1 respectively for manganese mn the average levels in the plant leaf tissue decreased with the increase of the ph ranges thus the plants submitted to treatment 1 had the highest average levels having an average of 81 4 mg kg 1 while those submitted to treatments 2 and 3 showed a reduction in the average levels of 9 and 22 respectively compared to treatment 1 averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance 3 3 gas exchange according to the means values standard deviations and analysis of variance presented in table 2 it is observed that there was a significant effect of water ph on the following physiological parameters photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration rate and carboxylation efficiency the physiological parameters evaluated are shown in fig 5 the plants of treatment 2 showed a higher photosynthetic rate followed by treatments 1 and 3 fig 5 a stomatal conductance fig 5b and sweating rate fig 5 c showed no significant difference for treatments 1 and 2 however they were superior to treatment 3 treatment 2 showed the best carboxylation efficiency when compared to treatments 1 and 3 which showed no significant difference fig 5d averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance 3 4 yield based on the results of the analysis of variance table 3 it is observed that there was a significant effect of the water ph ranges on yield per plant g plant 1 averages followed by the same letter do not differ by tukey s test at 5 significance fig 6a shows the highest yield was of plants submitted to treatment 2 with an average of 18 0 g plant 1 for treatments 3 and 1 there was no significant difference between their yield but there was a reduction in yield of 61 and 73 respectively when compared to treatment 2 the concentration of alpha acids for treatments 1 and 2 were similar and higher than the values obtained in treatment 3 for beta acids fig 6b the highest concentrations were observed in treatment 1 and for treatments 2 and 3 there was a reduction of 18 and 35 respectively when compared to treatment 1 4 discussion climatic conditions can influence the growth and development of hop plants as well as the yield of cones and the compounds present in the leaves and cones sp√≥sito et al 2019 affirm that air temperatures between 20 and 30 c are indicated for the growth and development of hop plants air temperatures above 32 c can interfere with the plant s physiology causing early flowering and low alpha and beta acid biosynthesis sreƒçec et al 2004 de keukeleire et al 2007 mozny et al 2009 pavlovic et al 2012 bauerle 2019 thus when observing the air temperature values it is possible to verify that the maximum was above 32 c during almost the entire conduction period which caused early flowering in the plants especially in the treatment 3 plants the air relative humidity showed an inverse behavior at air temperature which was predicted this behavior occurs because with the increase in temperature the air heats up and the atmosphere can retain more water in the form of steam costa leal carmo junior 2004 during the day when the air temperature is high the air relative humidity of the air tends to be lower while the night with the temperature decline the air relative humidity increases reaching 100 tubelis nascimento 1988 prados 2007 pavlovic et al 2012 carried out a study in slovenia with the aurora variety and found the air relative humidity has a low correlation with the levels of alpha acids however the highest levels were obtained when the air relative humidity was close to 71 the vapor pressure deficit vpd indicates a reduction in the water potential in the atmosphere mainly with an increase in air temperature the higher the ambient air temperature the greater the amount of water in the form of vapor retained by the atmosphere pimentel 2004 yuan et al 2019 the highest vpd values occurred with the increase in air temperature and the decrease in air relative humidity the increase in vpd affects plant growth and development which can cause mortality and reduced plant yield williams et al 2012 lobell et al 2014 restaino et al 2016 ding et al 2018 these effects are explained by the stomatal closure of plants causing the leaves photosynthetic rates to decrease significantly fletcher et al 2007 the water ph changed the ph of the soil solution during the research in general the main route of nutrient uptake by plant roots occurred through soil solution besides ion concentration availability and nutrient absorption by plants are directly related to ph taiz et al 2017 melo et al 2019 the nutritional content of leaf plant tissue in plants results from the availability of elements macro and micronutrients in the soil absorption by the roots through the soil solution and translocation to the aerial part ernani et al 2007 santos and rodrigues 2017 these elements are absorbed in the form of ions such as k potassium ca 2 calcium h3bo3 boron cu2 copper and mn2 manganese mitra 2015 taiz et al 2017 according to costa et al 2019 values close to neutral ph promote greater availability of nutrients macronutrients and facilitate their absorption by plant roots thus when irrigating the hop plants v cascade with the water ph range 6 to 6 5 treatment 1 and 6 5 to 7 treatment 2 the higher the ca and k levels in leaf plant tissue will be in these ranges there is no competition between the ca 2 and k ions with oh and or h and it is more available for absorption however using irrigation water with ph range 7 to 7 5 the leaf contents of ca and k are significantly reduced due to the competition between the ions marschner 1986 according to malavolta 2006 and chiodini et al 2013 high oh concentrations ph 7 to 7 5 inhibit the absorption of other ions resulting in the formation of insoluble hydroxides and consequently deficiency and reduced nutritional content in leaf plant tissue disproportionality was observed between ca and k concentrations the highest levels were observed in plants with the lowest k levels this phenomenon is called antagonism characterized by a negative interaction when a nutrient inhibits the other nutrient absorption ranade malvi 2011 concerning ca and k competitive inhibition may have occurred since ca 2 in greater concentration limited the passage of k through the membrane channel faquin 2005 malavolta 2006 bindraban et al 2015 for micronutrients the ph range that promoted the greatest availability is from 5 to 6 5 because the increase in ph causes the availability to decrease and may cause toxicity in plants meurer 2007 brady and weil 2012 cotta 2016 this was observed in the results obtained the highest levels of b and mn in the leaf plant tissue of hop plants v cascade were obtained in plants that received water from treatment 1 according to abreu et al 2007 and taiz et al 2017 they observed that the greater availability of these micronutrients is in acidic conditions it should be noted that for the conditions that tend to neutrality ph range 6 5 to 7 and alkalinity ph range 7 to 7 5 the concentration of b ions in the form of borate b oh 4 increases causing adsorption and also competition with oh ions in greater concentration that affect availability and absorption by plants hu brown 1997 malavolta 2006 herrera rodr√≠guez et al 2010 for mn mn2 ions become insoluble affecting their availability valadares et al 2014 cu showed a different behavior from other micronutrients since the highest levels in the leaf plant tissue of hops plants v cascade was in plants irrigated with water in the ph range of 7 to 7 5 this result differs from those described in the literature since the greatest availability and absorption of the soil solution is in acid condition more specifically in the range of 5 to 6 5 abreu et al 2007 the increase in ph negatively influences the availability solubility and absorption of cu2 ions dechen and nachtigall 2006 abreu et al 2007 however mitra 2015 states that the effects of ph on the absorption of cu2 differ between cultures michaud et al 2007 working with wheat triticum turgidum durum l var in soils contaminated by cu found that there was no correlation between ph and absorption of this element also the authors found that the concentration of cu in the root tends to increase with the increase in ph chaves et al 2010 affirm cu mobility in plant tissues can increase considering this information the levels of this element in the soil solution were probably high which resulted in translocation and the high accumulation in leaf tissues jarvis 1981 points out that there may be exceptions to cu availability under high ph conditions this may have occurred during the present study in the situation in which the presence of negative charges oh in the ph 7 to 7 5 range probably did not cause the adsorption of cu2 ions chaves et al 2009 affirm that the availability of cu for plants is directly related to adsorption the lower the adsorption the greater the availability of this micronutrient for plants this explained the high availability solubility absorption and assimilation of cu in the leaf plant tissue of hop plants in treatment 3 compared to these in treatment 1 and 2 the photosynthetic capacity of plants irrigated with water ph 6 to 6 5 treatment 2 was more efficient in this condition the available carbon was used more efficiently to perform photosynthesis the efficiency of carboxylation is the ratio between photosynthesis and internal co2 concentration aighewi and ekanayake 2004 affirm that gas exchange can be influenced by several factors among them the leaf position phenological phase humidity temperature water availability and nutritional content of plants mainly concerning the k content k is considered one of the most important macronutrients for plant development it is responsible for the main metabolic processes such as the mechanism that controls stomatal conductance gs which directly affects the photosynthetic capacity of plants assmann and shimazaki 1999 schroeder et al 2001 roelfsema and hedrich 2005 alquini et al 2013 andr√©s et al 2014 in the present study it was observed the increase of potassium content in plant leaf tissue which increases the photosynthetic capacity of the plants treatment 2 several studies have found that k has a very important role in the photosynthetic capacity of plants sangakkara et al 2001 cakmak 2005 prado 2008 jia et al 2008 jin et al 2011 catuchi et al 2012 however the reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of the plants submitted to treatments 1 and 3 are related to the lower k levels and the high cu levels high levels of cu negatively influence gas exchange causing a decrease in photosynthetic activity which directly affects plant development due to low carboxylation efficiency mateos naranjo et al 2008 cambroll√© et al 2013 2015 adrees et al 2015 mitra 2015 the yield of a crop including hops is the result of management irrigation harvesting and fertilization practices in this study it was observed that different ph ranges of irrigation water influenced the availability and absorption of some nutrients the photosynthetic capacity and the yield of cones according to fagherazzi et al 2018 the yield of cones in the first year of cultivation is less than 2 kg per plant which shows an increasing trend over the years due to the adaptation and growth of the rhizomes it is important to note that yield in the first year may be even lower depending on the variety as the cones vary in size and mass according to sp√≥sito et al 2019 the cascade variety can present a production of approximately 2500 kg ha 1 1225 g plant 1 however this production is directly proportional to the age of the plant and the growing conditions nakawuka et al 2017 found that in 2012 the yield of the varieties studied increased compared to the year 2011 the alpha and beta concentrations present in the cones of the cascade variety can be approximately 4 5 7 respectively sp√≥sito et al 2019 however information about the amount of alpha and beta acids present in the cones of the first year plants cones not only cascade variety but other cultivated varieties is still scarce in the literature for kuƒçera and krofta 2009 the concentration of alpha and beta acids can vary from one year to the next depending on the age of the plant nakawuka et al 2017 observed that in 2012 there was an increase in the concentrations of alpha and beta acids for the chinook variety compared to the year 2011 the authors also observed there was no significant difference between compounds for the levels of total water depth irrigation 60 80 and 100 it can be verified that the age of the plant is a factor that certainly influences the concentration of alpha and beta acids and maybe occurred stress conditions for example irrigation with water ph in the range 6 to 6 5 can favor the production of these compounds but on the other hand pedoclimatic conditions for example the absence of moisture in the soil during the development phase can negatively influence the production and accumulation of compounds de keukeleire et al 2007 sreƒçec et al 2008 fandi√±o et al 2015 5 conclusion the agronomic development of hops v cascade is influenced by the different ph ranges of the irrigation water being observed that the range of 6 5 to 7 promotes greater availability and absorption of k ions and greater k accumulation in plant leaf tissue photosynthetic capacity and cone yield the ph range 7 to 7 5 becomes harmful to the hop culture as it promoted greater availability absorption and accumulation of cu in the leaf plant tissue and consequently negatively influenced the photosynthetic capacity yield and alpha and beta concentrations acids the preliminary values of alpha and beta acids were higher in plants irrigated with water ph in the range 6 to 6 5 indicating that possible stress may favor the production of these compounds the preliminary results present strong indications that the agronomic behavior of the hop crop humulus lupulus l var cascade can be influenced by the ph ranges of the irrigation water furthermore the results obtained can be used as a basis for the development of new studies since

10047,it is of great significance to study the variation in reference evapotranspiration eto and the factors that influence it to ensure the sustainable and efficient utilization of water resources in this study the spatio temporal changes in eto and rice areas as well as the relationship between them in heilongjiang province china from 1951 to 2018 were analysed by using trend correlation and contribution analyses the results showed that rice area expansion is an important factor affecting eto changes eto in heilongjiang province decreased during the study period the areas with high eto in the songnen and sanjiang plain showed a gradually shrinking trend climate change and rice area expansion both contributed to the decline in eto the decreases in sunshine duration and average wind speed in heilongjiang province were the main reasons for the decrease in eto rice area in heilongjiang province continued to increase at a rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 the expansion of rice area in sanjiang plain was the largest followed by songnen plain in response to the rice area expansion the rise in average temperature slowed down the average relative humidity was increased while wind speed was reduced which directly lead to the decrease in eto the effects of the transformation of different land types into rice fields on eto were different the cumulative effects of wetlands and dry fields conversion to rice fields on eto were 7 67 mm yr 1 and 20 15 mm yr 1 in sanjiang plain respectively keywords reference evapotranspiration spatio temporal change climate change rice area expansion 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important process in the water and energy cycles and it is also one of the key factors affecting crop growth dry biomass production and yield qiu et al 2019 a detailed understanding of the changes in reference evapotranspiration eto and the factors that influence it is essential for the scientific management of water resources and sustainable protection of agricultural production nam et al 2015 lv et al 2018 climate and land use changes have a strong impact on eto chen et al 2011 2019 dias et al 2015 li et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 however the impact of land use changes caused by agricultural practices such as irrigation on local hydrological conditions is still unclear ozdogan and salvucci 2004 furthermore scientific irrigation management is key to ensuring stable high yields and high water use efficiency of food crops tang et al 2018 analysing changes in eto with the synergy of climate and irrigation is very important for planning regional irrigation adjusting agricultural planting structures and protecting the ecological environment han et al 2010 jia et al 2016 in the context of climate change changes in all meteorological variables such as temperature wind speed rainfall and solar radiation have led to changes in eto scheÔ¨Ä and frierson 2014 nam et al 2016 luo et al 2018 for example a decrease in sunshine duration and wind speed have led to a decrease in evapotranspiration but the opposite is true for an increase in temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 gao et al 2006 xie et al 2008 nan et al 2012 pour et al 2020 and eto has also been significantly affected by relative humidity li et al 2015 kong et al 2018 chen and huo 2016 used a method of removing meteorological factors to assess the impact of climate change on eto temperature and wind speed were believed to be the main factors that influence eto in the heihe river basin jia et al 2016 yassen et al 2020 observed that eto in egypt was greatly affected by climate change in most regions with more profound impact in summer than winter the relationship between climate conditions and terrestrial surface processes in different geographic regions varies koster 2004 although similar studies have been conducted in northeast china climatic impacts on eto in cold rice growing areas especially in rice concentrated areas in heilongjiang province are still unclear irrigation is considered an important anthropogenic process affecting the climate and hydrology lobell et al 2009 in agricultural areas diversion and irrigation changes affect the regional microclimate for example the expansion of irrigation areas has led to among other changes a decrease in local temperature bonfils and lobell 2007 han and yang 2013 han et al 2018 a decrease in wind speed alpert and mandel 1986 jia et al 2016 an increase in humidity zhao et al 2016 and an increase in precipitation j√≥dar et al 2010 mao et al 2011 which affects potential evapotranspiration ozdogan and salvucci 2004 therefore crop and net irrigation water requirements will be significantly affected by these changes understanding how reference evapotranspiration changes with irrigation may have important implications for future agricultural water management han et al 2014 found that eto decreased with irrigation expansion in general there are few studies on the impacts of irrigation and other agricultural activities on evapotranspiration especially for the large scale expansion of rice areas it is necessary to systematically explore the impact of increased rice areas on eto rice is one of the three major food crops in china and its production has been increasing continuously china national bureau of statistics 2019 with agricultural development and the powerful support of the government rice areas in heilongjiang province expanded rapidly accounting for 13 05 of the total rice area of china liu et al 2013 gao et al 2020 the expansion of rice areas will inevitably cause a substantial increase in irrigation water use which will affect eto it is very important to explore the impact of climate change under natural conditions and the rice area expansion caused by human activities on regional eto changes the objectives of this work are therefore 1 to analyse the temporal and spatial changes in eto and rice areas in heilongjiang province 2 to analyse the effects of meteorological variables change on eto in heilongjiang province and 3 to explore the impact of increased rice areas on eto under the background of climate change in heilongjiang

a small calculation error it is the most widely used eto calculation method this study uses it to calculate eto and the formula is as follows allen et al 1998 1 eto 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s

is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 2 2 2 linear trend analysis and mann kendall test a linear regression equation was established to analyse the changing trends of eto and meteorological variables in heilongjiang province time t was taken as the independent variable and eto or meteorological variables x as the dependent variable the regression equation is as follows 2 x at b where x is the value of eto or meteorological variables a is the slope of the equation which is used to represent the linear trend of the time series t is the year and b is the regression constant the series has a positive trend when a is greater than 0 and it has a negative trend when a is less than 0 the larger the absolute value of a is the more significant the positive or negative trend of time series is the reliability test of the linear trend results adopts the mann kendall test this method is suitable for the non parametric test of time series trends yavuz 2018 the statistic

statistic was employed to identify the approximate starting point here year of change in time series of rice area 2 2 3 spatial data processing the kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 2 was used to interpolate eto and meteorological variables to a raster surface and wgs 1984 coordinates were used as the map coordinate system kriging interpolation based on the semivariogram model performs unbiased optimal estimation of regional variables in a limited region it extends discrete point information to continuous spatial information and obtains ideal prediction results lv et al 2019 oliver and webster 1990 in this study ordinary kriging ok which is the most popular type of kriging was used to interpolate eto and meteorological variables at different timescales moghbeli et al 2020 suppose there are altogether n measured points in the neighborhood of the estimated point x 0 i e x 1 x 2 x n the interpolation formula of ok is as follows 8 z x 0 i 1 n Œª i z x i where z x i are the observations selected in the x 0 neighborhood to perform the estimation of z x 0 z x 0 is the kriging estimate at location x 0 Œª i denotes the weight of the ith observation under the condition of unbiased and minimum variance the equation system of the weight coefficient Œª i is 9 i 1 n Œª i c x i x j Œº c x 0 x j j 1 2 n i 1 n Œª i 1 where c x i x j is the covariance function of a and b the most commonly used semivariogram models are the spherical exponential and gaussian models dalezios et al 2002 moghbeli et al 2020 spherical model is the most commonly used and has good accuracy in this study the kriging interpolation method with spherical model as semivariograms is used for spatial interpolation analysis the spherical model is expressed as follows 10 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 1 5 h a 0 5 h a 3 where h is the distance between the samples c 0 is the nugget c 1 is the part of sill c 0 c 1 is the sill a is the variation distance 2 2 4 correlation analysis pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient indicates the degree of correlation between two sets of data sun and qin 2016 it was used to analyse the relationship between eto and meteorological variables the following formula adapted from revadekar et al 2012 kang et al 2017 was used for this purpose 11 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the correlation coefficient between x and y while x i is the eto value in i year y is the meteorological variable value in i year x and y are the average values of x and y n is the number of samples x and y are positively related when r 0 x and y have a negative correlation when r 0 the greater the absolute value of the number the greater the strength of the correlation between the two variables spss software was used for statistical analysis the significance of correlation coefficient was tested by t test zhang et al 2011 the statistical significance in this study corresponded to a significance level of p 0 05 and p 0 01 2 2 5 contribution assessment han and hu 2012 and jia et al 2016 considered that climate change and irrigation were important causes of regional evapotranspiration change rice area expansion in heilongjiang province mainly occurred in the sanjiang and songnen plain lu et al 2017 that is the irrigation water consumption of the sanjiang and songnen plain increased significantly rice area expansion was the main land use change type in these two plains during the period of 1980 2015 chen et al 2018 thus it has been assumed that the changes in eto in the sanjiang and songnen plain were only affected by climate change and rice area expansion first order differential method was used to remove the trends of meteorological variables to effectively separate the trend component and the non trend component trend components include the trend caused by climate change and the trend caused by rice area expansion the first order difference is the difference between two consecutively adjacent items in the sequence after the original sequence x t is first order differentiated a new sequence y t without trend can be obtained zhang et al 2016 12 y t x t 1 x t 13 t t x t y t where x t is the original sequence y t is the detrended sequence t t is the trend component t is the sample number and t 1 2 n where n is the sequence length to quantify the contribution of climate change and rice area expansion to eto the following steps were carried out on the sanjiang and songnen plain first we assumed that if rice area in a region was unchanged during the period then any change in eto in that region was caused by climate change it means eto eto climate and eto rice 0 second we assumed that in case of change in the rice area the changes in eto were attributable to the combined effect of climate change and rice area expansion therefore the effects of rice area expansion on eto in a region can be quantitatively identified by removing the effects of climate change on eto in that region refer to eq 15 since the effects of climate change on eto in a region are the same the trend of each meteorological variable was removed by first order differential method and eto s was recalculated by using the detrended data series 14 eto eto eto s 15 eto eto climate eto rice where eto is the change in eto eto s is stationary eto sequence eto climate and eto rice are eto changes due to climate change and rice area expansion respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal changes in eto the spatial distribution of eto in each period is shown in fig 2 it is different in each period the areas with high eto were mainly in the songnen and sanjiang plain in 1951 1967 and 1968 1984 eto was higher in most areas of the songnen plain and the central part of the sanjiang plain fig 2a and b the areas with high eto in 1985 2001 and 2002 2018 were located in the southwestern songnen plain and the southern sanjiang plain fig 2c and d the comparison between fig 2a and b indicated an expansion in the areas with high eto in the songnen and sanjiang plain from the second period to the third period the high eto area decreased with more obvious decreasing trend in the sanjiang plain fig 2b and c from the third period to the fourth period the high eto area decreased more obviously and the area with higher eto in the sanjiang plain was only the southernmost area fig 2c and d the eto of heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 had an overall decreasing trend at the same time the high eto areas gradually decreased in the entire study period the average eto in heilongjiang province had a decreasing trend fig 3 the linear trend was 0 08 mm yr 1 and the mann kendall test was not significant the decreasing trend has been confirmed in other studies xie et al 2017 nie et al 2019 the maximum value appeared in 1982 at 786 53 mm yr 1 and the minimum value appeared in 2013 at 614 40 mm yr 1 the multi year average eto was 689 51 mm yr 1 the changes in eto in 13 cities in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 were different table 2 there were 3 cities with increasing trends they are daxinganling heihe and jixi ten cities had decreasing trends qiqihar shuangyashan and qitaihe had significant decreasing trends while trends in daqing and harbin were extremely significant eto in daqing changed at the fastest speed of 1 27 mm yr 1 the rate of change in eto in hegang was 0 13 mm yr 1 which was the slowest eto in daqing had the highest average value of 863 13 mm yr 1 the average annual eto in daxinganling was the lowest 3 2 changes of meteorological variables and their effects on eto the trends in meteorological variables and eto with time in each city in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 are shown in table 3 the average temperature in heilongjiang province increased at a rate of 0 031 yr 1 heihe had the most obvious temperature rise in the province the average change rate of the average relative humidity in heilongjiang province was 0 033 yr 1 the trends in hegang and qitaihe gradually increased and the trends in the other 11 cities gradually decreased the trends of sunshine duration in the 13 cities all declined with an average rate of 0 009 h d 1 yr 1 the trends of the average wind speed in the 13 cities also declined the average rate of the average wind speed was 0 016 m s 1 yr 1 the trends of precipitation gradually increased in 6 cities and decreased in 7 cities with an average rate of 0 134 mm yr 1 among the 13 cities in heilongjiang province 10 cities had a decreasing eto trend and 3 cities had an increasing trend with an average rate of 0 335 mm yr 1 over the past 68 years the average temperature has increased while the average relative humidity sunshine duration average wind speed precipitation and eto showed a decreasing tend in heilongjiang province the correlations between eto and meteorological variables in 13 cities in heilongjiang province are shown in table 4 from 1951 2018 eto in each city was positively correlated with average temperature the average relative humidity was negatively correlated with eto in each city sunshine duration was significantly positively correlated with eto in each city the correlation coefficients between the average wind speed and eto in daxinganling and heihe were negative but the correlations were positive in other cities precipitation and eto were significantly negatively correlated in each city in conclusion eto in heilongjiang province was positively correlated with average temperature sunshine duration and average wind speed and negatively correlated with average relative humidity and precipitation eto had a strong correlation with average relative humidity sunshine duration and precipitation and it had a weak correlation with average temperature and average wind speed the impact of changes in meteorological variables on eto was obtained through trend analysis and correlation analysis in each city the increase in average temperature and the decreases in average relative humidity and precipitation in heilongjiang province could result in the increase in eto and the decreases in sunshine duration and average wind speed could result in the decrease in eto eto in heilongjiang province had a decreasing trend so the effect of sunshine duration and average wind speed on eto was greater than that of average temperature average relative humidity and precipitation gao et al 2006 nan et al 2012 in addition the large increase in average temperature the decrease in average relative humidity and the decrease in precipitation were the main reasons for the large increase in eto in daxinganling and heihe 3 3 changes of rice area and their effects on meteorological variables and eto from the time series rice area in heilongjiang province continued to increase from 1951 to 2018 with a growth rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 which passed the mann kendall test with a 0 05 confidence level more obvious growth in rice area was evident since 1980 fig 4 since the beginning of 2004 the state has adopted a series of measures to increase grain output and encourage farmers to increase their income hou et al 2015 rice production in heilongjiang province entered a new stage of growth due to the policy of strengthening agriculture and benefiting farmers during 2004 2013 rice area expansion was the fastest with a rate of 2 67 105 ha yr 1 in 2013 rice area reached a maximum of 40 29 105 ha increased rice area during the study period accounted for 8 44 of the province s total area the expansion rate of rice area also accelerated gradually mann kendall test of rice area in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 was shown in fig 5 there was a significant upward trend from 1980 to 2018 uf 1 96 rice fields in heilongjiang province were mainly distributed in the cities located in the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain fig 6 the expansion of rice area was most obvious in sanjiang plain followed by songnen plain the proportions of rice area in 13 cities in heilongjiang province gradually increased and the increase varied from city to city the increases in jiamusi shuangyashan jixi hegang harbin suihua and qiqihar were higher than those in the other cities the growth of jiamusi in 2011 2018 was particularly prominent because the municipal party committee and municipal government implemented the jiamusi 10 million mu 10 billion kilo rice development plan in 2010 daqing yichun qitaihe and mudanjiang had a small increase in rice areas no increase in rice areas was observed in daxinganling and heihe rice is often grown in plain areas such as the songnen and sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province lu et al 2017 93 22 of the rice area expansion occurred in songnen and sanjiang plain sanjiang plain accounted for 61 74 and songnen plain for 31 48 fig 7 the significant stage of rice area expansion was selected to study the response of eto and meteorological variables to rice area expansion counties within the same plain have similar topography and climatic conditions the difference in trends of meteorological variables in the plains were attributed to the influence of the change in the rice area proportion average temperatures are increasing in all regions but at different rates in areas where the proportion of rice area is large the temperature increase is small fig 8 this result was found in both plains the average temperature increase in regions where the proportion of rice area changed more than 20 was greater than that in regions with 15 20 rice area change more swamps were converted into farmland in these regions which may lead to higher temperatures an increase in rice area inevitably leads to an increase in irrigation soil moisture increases with irrigation and then the surface albedo becomes larger the ground absorbs less solar radiation as the albedo increases this leads to a drop in the average temperature alpert and mandel 1986 from the perspective of energy balance the irrigation of rice fields increases the evapotranspiration of the farmland and changes the energy distribution on the ground less energy is used to heat the ground which will lower the surface temperature bonfils and lobell 2007 sacks et al 2009 these in turn affect the local climate rice area expansion has restrained the increase in regional average temperature in most areas thus rice development increases evaporative cooling and lowers the air temperature during the growing season bonfils and lobell 2007 han et al 2018 the average relative humidity in the songnen plain had an increasing trend in the areas where the proportion of rice areas increased more than 15 fig 9a the average relative humidity in all counties had an increasing trend in the sanjiang plain and the range increased with rice area expansion fig 9b in areas where rice expanded faster the average relative humidity had a faster increasing trend irrigation of rice fields increases soil moisture and forms water surface which in turn increases actual evapotranspiration this leads to an increase in water vapor in the air therefore the expansion of rice area may promote an increase in average relative humidity irrigation expansion in cropland regions exerts significant cooling and wetting effects on the near surface atmosphere puma and cook 2010 the sunshine duration in most counties of the songnen and sanjiang plains showed decreasing trends fig 10 the sunshine duration in the two plains varied with the proportion of rice areas and the effect of rice expansion on sunshine duration is not clear in order to remove the possible impact of increase in buildings surrounding the stations on wind speed weather stations with an added building area of more than 30 km2 were excluded from data average wind speed in all areas of the sanjiang plain had a decreasing trend fig 11b moreover the decreasing range of the average wind speed increased with the increase in the rice area proportion the average wind speed in the songnen plain decreased in all counties it decreased greatly in locations where rice areas increased greatly and the decreasing range was the largest when the rice area proportion was more than 20 fig 11a the expansion of rice areas tends to cause the regional average wind speed to decline which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by han et al 2009 and jia et al 2016 on the one hand rice area expansion in heilongjiang province may change the surface roughness and have a significant blocking effect on wind speed on the other hand the significant increase in irrigation caused a significant temperature and humidity difference with the surrounding area thus affecting the local wind circulation alpert and mandel 1986 ozdogan and salvucci 2004 precipitation in the counties of the songnen plain and sanjiang plain increased from 1980 to 2018 fig 12 the increasing range was the largest when the rice area proportion was more than 20 in sanjiang plain the impact of irrigation on precipitation is very complex there is no obvious relationship between the changes of precipitation in different regions and the proportion of rice area the impact of rice area expansion on regional precipitation is not clear eto in the counties of the two plains decreased fig 13 as the proportion of rice areas increased gradually the decline in eto in the songnen plain increased combined with the results of correlation analysis slowing down the rise in average temperature increasing the average relative humidity and slowing down the wind speed may lead to the decrease of eto the larger the proportion of irrigated area is the greater the influence on evapotranspiration han et al 2009 jia et al 2016 the trend may not be strict because the influence between adjacent areas cannot be ignored 3 4 contributions of climate change and rice area expansion to eto trends fig 14 shows that both rice area expansion and climate change in sanjiang and songnen plain can reduce eto the cumulative impact of rice area expansion and climate change on eto in sanjiang plain reached 12 49 mm yr 1 and 13 89 mm yr 1 respectively whereas the corresponding values in songnen plain were 13 93 and 27 30 mm yr 1 according to the impacts of rice area expansion and climate change on eto the contribution of rice area expansion in songnen plain to the decline of eto was 33 79 and that of climate change was 66 21 rice area expansion and climate change in the sanjiang plain contributed 47 33 and 52 67 to the decline in eto respectively the response of eto in sanjiang plain to rice area expansion was even smaller than that in songnen plain which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that larger rice area expansion has greater influence on evapotranspiration han et al 2009 about 25 80 of the rice fields in sanjiang plain converted from wetlands and 48 15 from dry fields fig 15 the impacts of these two land use and land cover changes on eto may be different the changes in eto in dry fields converted to rice fields and wetlands converted to rice fields were extracted and analysed respectively it was found that wetlands converted to rice fields can increase eto with a cumulative effect of 7 67 mm yr 1 the transformation from dry fields to rice fields can decrease eto with a cumulative reduction effect of 20 15 mm yr 1 fig 16 eto had a greater response to the transformation of dry fields into rice fields the impact of rice area expansion in sanjiang plain was still dominated by decline eto and the decline was small these findings are conducive to discussing the effect of rice area expansion on the ecological environment and strengthening the rational use of land resources the expansion of rice areas played a role in decreasing regional eto 4 conclusions this study analysed the spatio temporal dynamics of eto and rice areas in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 and evaluated the relationship among eto rice area and climate change the conclusions are as follows 1 eto in heilongjiang province decreased slightly and the linear trend was 0 08 mm yr 1 moreover the area of high eto gradually decreased rice areas in heilongjiang province continued to grow at a rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 rice area increased significantly from 1980 to 2018 2 eto in heilongjiang province was positively correlated with average temperature sunshine duration and average wind speed and negatively correlated with average relative humidity and precipitation during the study period eto was greatly affected by sunshine duration and average wind speed in heilongjiang province 3 rice area expansion and climate change in heilongjiang province reduced eto the contributions of rice area expansion and climate change to the reduction in eto were 47 33 and 52 67 on the sanjiang plain and 33 79 and 66 21 on the songnen plain respectively rice area expansion may slow the increase in temperature increase the average relative humidity and reduce the average wind speed these changes may be the direct causes of the decrease in eto wetlands conversion to rice fields had an increased effect on eto while dry fields conversion to rice fields had a decreased effect on eto with cumulative effects of 7 67 mm yr 1 and 20 15 mm yr 1 in sanjiang plain respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10047,it is of great significance to study the variation in reference evapotranspiration eto and the factors that influence it to ensure the sustainable and efficient utilization of water resources in this study the spatio temporal changes in eto and rice areas as well as the relationship between them in heilongjiang province china from 1951 to 2018 were analysed by using trend correlation and contribution analyses the results showed that rice area expansion is an important factor affecting eto changes eto in heilongjiang province decreased during the study period the areas with high eto in the songnen and sanjiang plain showed a gradually shrinking trend climate change and rice area expansion both contributed to the decline in eto the decreases in sunshine duration and average wind speed in heilongjiang province were the main reasons for the decrease in eto rice area in heilongjiang province continued to increase at a rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 the expansion of rice area in sanjiang plain was the largest followed by songnen plain in response to the rice area expansion the rise in average temperature slowed down the average relative humidity was increased while wind speed was reduced which directly lead to the decrease in eto the effects of the transformation of different land types into rice fields on eto were different the cumulative effects of wetlands and dry fields conversion to rice fields on eto were 7 67 mm yr 1 and 20 15 mm yr 1 in sanjiang plain respectively keywords reference evapotranspiration spatio temporal change climate change rice area expansion 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important process in the water and energy cycles and it is also one of the key factors affecting crop growth dry biomass production and yield qiu et al 2019 a detailed understanding of the changes in reference evapotranspiration eto and the factors that influence it is essential for the scientific management of water resources and sustainable protection of agricultural production nam et al 2015 lv et al 2018 climate and land use changes have a strong impact on eto chen et al 2011 2019 dias et al 2015 li et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 however the impact of land use changes caused by agricultural practices such as irrigation on local hydrological conditions is still unclear ozdogan and salvucci 2004 furthermore scientific irrigation management is key to ensuring stable high yields and high water use efficiency of food crops tang et al 2018 analysing changes in eto with the synergy of climate and irrigation is very important for planning regional irrigation adjusting agricultural planting structures and protecting the ecological environment han et al 2010 jia et al 2016 in the context of climate change changes in all meteorological variables such as temperature wind speed rainfall and solar radiation have led to changes in eto scheÔ¨Ä and frierson 2014 nam et al 2016 luo et al 2018 for example a decrease in sunshine duration and wind speed have led to a decrease in evapotranspiration but the opposite is true for an increase in temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 gao et al 2006 xie et al 2008 nan et al 2012 pour et al 2020 and eto has also been significantly affected by relative humidity li et al 2015 kong et al 2018 chen and huo 2016 used a method of removing meteorological factors to assess the impact of climate change on eto temperature and wind speed were believed to be the main factors that influence eto in the heihe river basin jia et al 2016 yassen et al 2020 observed that eto in egypt was greatly affected by climate change in most regions with more profound impact in summer than winter the relationship between climate conditions and terrestrial surface processes in different geographic regions varies koster 2004 although similar studies have been conducted in northeast china climatic impacts on eto in cold rice growing areas especially in rice concentrated areas in heilongjiang province are still unclear irrigation is considered an important anthropogenic process affecting the climate and hydrology lobell et al 2009 in agricultural areas diversion and irrigation changes affect the regional microclimate for example the expansion of irrigation areas has led to among other changes a decrease in local temperature bonfils and lobell 2007 han and yang 2013 han et al 2018 a decrease in wind speed alpert and mandel 1986 jia et al 2016 an increase in humidity zhao et al 2016 and an increase in precipitation j√≥dar et al 2010 mao et al 2011 which affects potential evapotranspiration ozdogan and salvucci 2004 therefore crop and net irrigation water requirements will be significantly affected by these changes understanding how reference evapotranspiration changes with irrigation may have important implications for future agricultural water management han et al 2014 found that eto decreased with irrigation expansion in general there are few studies on the impacts of irrigation and other agricultural activities on evapotranspiration especially for the large scale expansion of rice areas it is necessary to systematically explore the impact of increased rice areas on eto rice is one of the three major food crops in china and its production has been increasing continuously china national bureau of statistics 2019 with agricultural development and the powerful support of the government rice areas in heilongjiang province expanded rapidly accounting for 13 05 of the total rice area of china liu et al 2013 gao et al 2020 the expansion of rice areas will inevitably cause a substantial increase in irrigation water use which will affect eto it is very important to explore the impact of climate change under natural conditions and the rice area expansion caused by human activities on regional eto changes the objectives of this work are therefore 1 to analyse the temporal and spatial changes in eto and rice areas in heilongjiang province 2 to analyse the effects of meteorological variables change on eto in heilongjiang province and 3 to explore the impact of increased rice areas on eto under the background of climate change in heilongjiang province 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study area heilongjiang province is located in the northernmost part of northeast china between 43 26 n 53 33 n and 121 11 e 135 05 e fig 1 its total area is approximately 4 73 105 km2 which includes 12 prefecture level cities and the daxinganling heilongjiang province has higher elevations in the northwest and southeast and lower plains in the northeast and southwest it is in the cold temperate zone and has a temperate continental monsoon climate it is the province with the lowest temperature in china and the temperature difference between the northern and southern areas is large gao and liu 2011 summers are short and rainy here and winters are cold and long average temperature in heilongjiang is approximately 1 5 c and annual precipitation is 400 600 mm precipitation from june to september accounts for more than 65 of the annual precipitation with the development of agriculture heilongjiang province has become an important commercial grain production base in china su et al 2021 the western songnen plain and the eastern sanjiang plain are the two main grain production areas in heilongjiang province both of which mainly produce rice lu et al 2017 the statistical data of rice areas from 1951 to 2018 were obtained from the heilongjiang statistical yearbook heilongjiang bureau of statistics 1987 and the statistical yearbook of heilongjiang state farms bureau of statistics of heilongjiang state bureau of agriculture reclamation 1993 these yearbooks are annual statistical publications reflecting economic and social development and are published by the china statistics press the meteorological data used in this study including the daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature average temperature average relative humidity sunshine durations average wind speed and daily precipitation at 33 national meteorological observatory nmo stations from 1951 to 2018 were provided by the china meteorological data network a total of 5 72 million data were collected with an error rate of almost 0 and a missing rate of 0 06 the datasets are available and have been quality controlled by the national climate information center with a data loss rate of less than 0 1 zhao et al 2020 the few missing data were interpolated based on the data from adjacent stations lin et al 2018 these climate variables were used to calculate eto in heilongjiang province according to the fao 56 penman monteith method the location and distribution of meteorological stations within heilongjiang province are shown in fig 1 detailed information on these stations including the station code name location latitude longitude and altitude is presented in table 1 the land use information in 1980 and 2018 was obtained from the date center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn these data were generated by visual interpretation from landsat tm etm satellite images with a horizontal resolution of 1000 m the increase of construction land in heilongjiang province from 1960 to 2010 was concentrated in the south zhang et al 2017 in the analysis of the effects of rice area expansion the data of harbin hrb and other stations with an increase of construction more than 30 km2 were deleted to eliminate the interference of urbanization and industrialization 2 2 methods 2 2 1 calculation of reference evapotranspiration the penman monteith method recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations has a complete theoretical basis and a small calculation error it is the most widely used eto calculation method this study uses it to calculate eto and the formula is as follows allen et al 1998 1 eto 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s

statistic was employed to identify the approximate starting point here year of change in time series of rice area 2 2 3 spatial data processing the kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 2 was used to interpolate eto and meteorological variables to a raster surface and wgs 1984 coordinates were used as the map coordinate system kriging interpolation based on the semivariogram model performs unbiased optimal estimation of regional variables in a limited region it extends discrete point information to continuous spatial information and obtains ideal prediction results lv et al 2019 oliver and webster 1990 in this study ordinary kriging ok which is the most popular type of kriging was used to interpolate eto and meteorological variables at different timescales moghbeli et al 2020 suppose there are altogether n measured points in the neighborhood of the estimated point x 0 i e x 1 x 2 x n the interpolation formula of ok is as follows 8 z x 0 i 1 n Œª i z x i where z x i are the observations selected in the x 0 neighborhood to perform the estimation of z x 0 z x 0 is the kriging estimate at location x 0 Œª i denotes the weight of the ith observation under the condition of

most commonly used semivariogram models are the spherical exponential and gaussian models dalezios et al 2002 moghbeli et al 2020 spherical model is the most commonly used and has good accuracy in this study the kriging interpolation method with spherical model as semivariograms is used for spatial interpolation analysis the spherical model is expressed as follows 10 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 1 5 h a 0 5 h

indicates the degree of correlation between two sets of data sun and qin 2016 it was used to analyse the relationship between eto and meteorological variables the following formula adapted from revadekar et al 2012 kang et al 2017 was used for this purpose 11 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the correlation coefficient between x and y while x i is the eto value in i year y is the meteorological variable value in i year x and y are the average values of x and y n is the number of samples x and y are positively related when r 0 x and y have a negative correlation when r 0 the greater the absolute value of the number the greater the strength of the correlation between the two variables spss software was used for statistical analysis the significance of correlation coefficient was tested by t test zhang et al 2011 the statistical significance in this study corresponded to a significance level of p 0 05 and p 0 01 2 2 5 contribution assessment han and hu 2012 and jia et al 2016 considered that climate change and irrigation were important causes of regional evapotranspiration change rice area expansion in heilongjiang province mainly occurred in the sanjiang and songnen plain lu et al 2017 that is the irrigation water consumption of the sanjiang and songnen plain increased significantly rice area expansion was the main land use change type in these two plains during the period of 1980 2015 chen et al 2018 thus it has been assumed that the changes in eto in the sanjiang and songnen plain were only affected by climate change and rice area expansion first order differential method was used to remove the trends of meteorological variables to effectively separate the trend component and the non trend component trend components include the trend caused by climate change and the trend caused by rice area expansion the first order difference is the difference between two consecutively adjacent items in the sequence after the original sequence x t is first order differentiated a new sequence y t without trend can be obtained zhang et al 2016 12 y t x t 1 x t 13 t t x t y t where x t is the original sequence y t is the detrended sequence t t is the trend component t is the sample number and t 1 2 n where n is the sequence length to quantify the contribution of climate change and rice area expansion to eto the following steps were carried out on the sanjiang and songnen plain first we assumed that if rice area in a region was unchanged during the period then any change in eto in that region was caused by climate change it means eto eto climate and eto rice 0 second we assumed that in case of change in the rice area the changes in eto were attributable to the combined effect of climate change and rice area expansion therefore the effects of rice area expansion on eto in a region can be quantitatively identified by removing the effects of climate change on eto in that region refer to eq 15 since the effects of climate change on eto in a region are the same the trend of each meteorological variable was removed by first order differential method and eto s was recalculated by using the detrended data series 14 eto eto eto s 15 eto eto climate eto rice where eto is the change in eto eto s is stationary eto sequence eto climate and eto rice are eto changes due to climate change and rice area expansion respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal changes in eto the spatial distribution of eto in each period is shown in fig 2 it is different in each period the areas with high eto were mainly in the songnen and sanjiang plain in 1951 1967 and 1968 1984 eto was higher in most areas of the songnen plain and the central part of the sanjiang plain fig 2a and b the areas with high eto in 1985 2001 and 2002 2018 were located in the southwestern songnen plain and the southern sanjiang plain fig 2c and d the comparison between fig 2a and b indicated an expansion in the areas with high eto in the songnen and sanjiang plain from the second period to the third period the high eto area decreased with more obvious decreasing trend in the sanjiang plain fig 2b and c from the third period to the fourth period the high eto area decreased more obviously and the area with higher eto in the sanjiang plain was only the southernmost area fig 2c and d the eto of heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 had an overall decreasing trend at the same time the high eto areas gradually decreased in the entire study period the average eto in heilongjiang province had a decreasing trend fig 3 the linear trend was 0 08 mm yr 1 and the mann kendall test was not significant the decreasing trend has been confirmed in other studies xie et al 2017 nie et al 2019 the maximum value appeared in 1982 at 786 53 mm yr 1 and the minimum value appeared in 2013 at 614 40 mm yr 1 the multi year average eto was 689 51 mm yr 1 the changes in eto in 13 cities in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 were different table 2 there were 3 cities with increasing trends they are daxinganling heihe and jixi ten cities had decreasing trends qiqihar shuangyashan and qitaihe had significant decreasing trends while trends in daqing and harbin were extremely significant eto in daqing changed at the fastest speed of 1 27 mm yr 1 the rate of change in eto in hegang was 0 13 mm yr 1 which was the slowest eto in daqing had the highest average value of 863 13 mm yr 1 the average annual eto in daxinganling was the lowest 3 2 changes of meteorological variables and their effects on eto the trends in meteorological variables and eto with time in each city in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 are shown in table 3 the average temperature in heilongjiang province increased at a rate of 0 031 yr 1 heihe had the most obvious temperature rise in the province the average change rate of the average relative humidity in heilongjiang province was 0 033 yr 1 the trends in hegang and qitaihe gradually increased and the trends in the other 11 cities gradually decreased the trends of sunshine duration in the 13 cities all declined with an average rate of 0 009 h d 1 yr 1 the trends of the average wind speed in the 13 cities also declined the average rate of the average wind speed was 0 016 m s 1 yr 1 the trends of precipitation gradually increased in 6 cities and decreased in 7 cities with an average rate of 0 134 mm yr 1 among the 13 cities in heilongjiang province 10 cities had a decreasing eto trend and 3 cities had an increasing trend with an average rate of 0 335 mm yr 1 over the past 68 years the average temperature has increased while the average relative humidity sunshine duration average wind speed precipitation and eto showed a decreasing tend in heilongjiang province the correlations between eto and meteorological variables in 13 cities in heilongjiang province are shown in table 4 from 1951 2018 eto in each city was positively correlated with average temperature the average relative humidity was negatively correlated with eto in each city sunshine duration was significantly positively correlated with eto in each city the correlation coefficients between the average wind speed and eto in daxinganling and heihe were negative but the correlations were positive in other cities precipitation and eto were significantly negatively correlated in each city in conclusion eto in heilongjiang province was positively correlated with average temperature sunshine duration and average wind speed and negatively correlated with average relative humidity and precipitation eto had a strong correlation with average relative humidity sunshine duration and precipitation and it had a weak correlation with average temperature and average wind speed the impact of changes in meteorological variables on eto was obtained through trend analysis and correlation analysis in each city the increase in average temperature and the decreases in average relative humidity and precipitation in heilongjiang province could result in the increase in eto and the decreases in sunshine duration and average wind speed could result in the decrease in eto eto in heilongjiang province had a decreasing trend so the effect of sunshine duration and average wind speed on eto was greater than that of average temperature average relative humidity and precipitation gao et al 2006 nan et al 2012 in addition the large increase in average temperature the decrease in average relative humidity and the decrease in precipitation were the main reasons for the large increase in eto in daxinganling and heihe 3 3 changes of rice area and their effects on meteorological variables and eto from the time series rice area in heilongjiang province continued to increase from 1951 to 2018 with a growth rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 which passed the mann kendall test with a 0 05 confidence level more obvious growth in rice area was evident since 1980 fig 4 since the beginning of 2004 the state has adopted a series of measures to increase grain output and encourage farmers to increase their income hou et al 2015 rice production in heilongjiang province entered a new stage of growth due to the policy of strengthening agriculture and benefiting farmers during 2004 2013 rice area expansion was the fastest with a rate of 2 67 105 ha yr 1 in 2013 rice area reached a maximum of 40 29 105 ha increased rice area during the study period accounted for 8 44 of the province s total area the expansion rate of rice area also accelerated gradually mann kendall test of rice area in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 was shown in fig 5 there was a significant upward trend from 1980 to 2018 uf 1 96 rice fields in heilongjiang province were mainly distributed in the cities located in the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain fig 6 the expansion of rice area was most obvious in sanjiang plain followed by songnen plain the proportions of rice area in 13 cities in heilongjiang province gradually increased and the increase varied from city to city the increases in jiamusi shuangyashan jixi hegang harbin suihua and qiqihar were higher than those in the other cities the growth of jiamusi in 2011 2018 was particularly prominent because the municipal party committee and municipal government implemented the jiamusi 10 million mu 10 billion kilo rice development plan in 2010 daqing yichun qitaihe and mudanjiang had a small increase in rice areas no increase in rice areas was observed in daxinganling and heihe rice is often grown in plain areas such as the songnen and sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province lu et al 2017 93 22 of the rice area expansion occurred in songnen and sanjiang plain sanjiang plain accounted for 61 74 and songnen plain for 31 48 fig 7 the significant stage of rice area expansion was selected to study the response of eto and meteorological variables to rice area expansion counties within the same plain have similar topography and climatic conditions the difference in trends of meteorological variables in the plains were attributed to the influence of the change in the rice area proportion average temperatures are increasing in all regions but at different rates in areas where the proportion of rice area is large the temperature increase is small fig 8 this result was found in both plains the average temperature increase in regions where the proportion of rice area changed more than 20 was greater than that in regions with 15 20 rice area change more swamps were converted into farmland in these regions which may lead to higher temperatures an increase in rice area inevitably leads to an increase in irrigation soil moisture increases with irrigation and then the surface albedo becomes larger the ground absorbs less solar radiation as the albedo increases this leads to a drop in the average temperature alpert and mandel 1986 from the perspective of energy balance the irrigation of rice fields increases the evapotranspiration of the farmland and changes the energy distribution on the ground less energy is used to heat the ground which will lower the surface temperature bonfils and lobell 2007 sacks et al 2009 these in turn affect the local climate rice area expansion has restrained the increase in regional average temperature in most areas thus rice development increases evaporative cooling and lowers the air temperature during the growing season bonfils and lobell 2007 han et al 2018 the average relative humidity in the songnen plain had an increasing trend in the areas where the proportion of rice areas increased more than 15 fig 9a the average relative humidity in all counties had an increasing trend in the sanjiang plain and the range increased with rice area expansion fig 9b in areas where rice expanded faster the average relative humidity had a faster increasing trend irrigation of rice fields increases soil moisture and forms water surface which in turn increases actual evapotranspiration this leads to an increase in water vapor in the air therefore the expansion of rice area may promote an increase in average relative humidity irrigation expansion in cropland regions exerts significant cooling and wetting effects on the near surface atmosphere puma and cook 2010 the sunshine duration in most counties of the songnen and sanjiang plains showed decreasing trends fig 10 the sunshine duration in the two plains varied with the proportion of rice areas and the effect of rice expansion on sunshine duration is not clear in order to remove the possible impact of increase in buildings surrounding the stations on wind speed weather stations with an added building area of more than 30 km2 were excluded from data average wind speed in all areas of the sanjiang plain had a decreasing trend fig 11b moreover the decreasing range of the average wind speed increased with the increase in the rice area proportion the average wind speed in the songnen plain decreased in all counties it decreased greatly in locations where rice areas increased greatly and the decreasing range was the largest when the rice area proportion was more than 20 fig 11a the expansion of rice areas tends to cause the regional average wind speed to decline which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by han et al 2009 and jia et al 2016 on the one hand rice area expansion in heilongjiang province may change the surface roughness and have a significant blocking effect on wind speed on the other hand the significant increase in irrigation caused a significant temperature and humidity difference with the surrounding area thus affecting the local wind circulation alpert and mandel 1986 ozdogan and salvucci 2004 precipitation in the counties of the songnen plain and sanjiang plain increased from 1980 to 2018 fig 12 the increasing range was the largest when the rice area proportion was more than 20 in sanjiang plain the impact of irrigation on precipitation is very complex there is no obvious relationship between the changes of precipitation in different regions and the proportion of rice area the impact of rice area expansion on regional precipitation is not clear eto in the counties of the two plains decreased fig 13 as the proportion of rice areas increased gradually the decline in eto in the songnen plain increased combined with the results of correlation analysis slowing down the rise in average temperature increasing the average relative humidity and slowing down the wind speed may lead to the decrease of eto the larger the proportion of irrigated area is the greater the influence on evapotranspiration han et al 2009 jia et al 2016 the trend may not be strict because the influence between adjacent areas cannot be ignored 3 4 contributions of climate change and rice area expansion to eto trends fig 14 shows that both rice area expansion and climate change in sanjiang and songnen plain can reduce eto the cumulative impact of rice area expansion and climate change on eto in sanjiang plain reached 12 49 mm yr 1 and 13 89 mm yr 1 respectively whereas the corresponding values in songnen plain were 13 93 and 27 30 mm yr 1 according to the impacts of rice area expansion and climate change on eto the contribution of rice area expansion in songnen plain to the decline of eto was 33 79 and that of climate change was 66 21 rice area expansion and climate change in the sanjiang plain contributed 47 33 and 52 67 to the decline in eto respectively the response of eto in sanjiang plain to rice area expansion was even smaller than that in songnen plain which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that larger rice area expansion has greater influence on evapotranspiration han et al 2009 about 25 80 of the rice fields in sanjiang plain converted from wetlands and 48 15 from dry fields fig 15 the impacts of these two land use and land cover changes on eto may be different the changes in eto in dry fields converted to rice fields and wetlands converted to rice fields were extracted and analysed respectively it was found that wetlands converted to rice fields can increase eto with a cumulative effect of 7 67 mm yr 1 the transformation from dry fields to rice fields can decrease eto with a cumulative reduction effect of 20 15 mm yr 1 fig 16 eto had a greater response to the transformation of dry fields into rice fields the impact of rice area expansion in sanjiang plain was still dominated by decline eto and the decline was small these findings are conducive to discussing the effect of rice area expansion on the ecological environment and strengthening the rational use of land resources the expansion of rice areas played a role in decreasing regional eto 4 conclusions this study analysed the spatio temporal dynamics of eto and rice areas in heilongjiang province from 1951 to 2018 and evaluated the relationship among eto rice area and climate change the conclusions are as follows 1 eto in heilongjiang province decreased slightly and the linear trend was 0 08 mm yr 1 moreover the area of high eto gradually decreased rice areas in heilongjiang province continued to grow at a rate of 0 54 105 ha yr 1 rice area increased significantly from 1980 to 2018 2 eto in heilongjiang province was positively correlated with average temperature sunshine duration and average wind speed and negatively correlated with average relative humidity and precipitation during the study period eto was greatly affected by sunshine duration and average wind speed in heilongjiang province 3 rice area expansion and climate change in heilongjiang province reduced eto the contributions of rice area expansion and climate change to the reduction in eto were 47 33 and 52 67 on the sanjiang plain and 33 79 and 66 21 on the songnen plain respectively rice area expansion may slow the increase in temperature increase the average relative humidity and reduce the average wind speed these changes may be the direct causes of the decrease in eto wetlands conversion to rice fields had an increased effect on eto while dry fields conversion to rice fields had a decreased effect on eto with cumulative effects of 7 67 mm yr 1 and 20 15 mm yr 1 in sanjiang plain respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10048,vegetation filter strips vfs have been shown to effectively intercept water flow and remove nitrogen studies of the vegetation effects on water flow and nitrogen transport are typically studied based on qualitative analyses with species layouts growth stage seasonal changes and other vegetation conditions and did not considered quantification based on plant traits in this study the transport path and retention efficiency of nitrate nitrogen no3 n in vfss are investigated from the view of the plant specific trait effects by simulating runoff experiments using three grassed vfss centipede grass tall fescue and vetiver grass as well as a bare vfs under different slope gradients 2 7 and 12 slope gradients the primary grass traits stem spacing root depth root length density and nitrogen total uptake were measured and the responses of water flow and no3 n loss above and below ground to those were quantitatively assessed using the grey correlation analysis method results indicated that grasses and slope gradient significantly influenced the water flow and no3 n loss in general except the no3 n loss concentration of the surface flow in which the tall fescue vfs showed the highest no3 n total retention rates under each slope condition considering the impact of specific grass traits stem density and root length density has the greatest effects on the surface flow and the subsurface flow respectively while the effect of roots was lower than that of stems on no3 n loss below ground additionally the no3 n loss mass in the surface and subsurface flow were mostly related to the water flow volume and the no3 n loss concentration respectively this indicated that grass traits that reduce water flow should be considered more to control the no3 n loss mass above ground whereas the grass traits reducing no3 n loss concentration should be considered more to control the no3 n loss mass below ground keywords vegetation filter strip grass trait nitrate nitrogen transport quantitatively analysis 1 introduction non point source pollution especially agricultural non point source pollution has become the primary reason for the deterioration of water quality in rivers and lakes today xiang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 among them nitrate is one of the most common dissolved contaminants and causes a series of problems including eutrophication in surface water nitrate pollution of groundwater and destruction of aquatic ecosystems around rivers and lakes penuelas et al 2013 wu et al 2017 2019 therefore the issue of how to control non point source pollution especially nitrogen has become an essential and difficult problem that needs to be solved to alleviate the current water environmental problems vegetative Ô¨Ålter strips vfss located at the end of agricultural land as interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have the potential to effectively slow down surface runoff promote infiltration and then greatly increase the chances of dissolved pollutants being adsorbed by soil uptake by plants or transformed munoz carpena et al 1999 dorioz et al 2006 mayer et al 2007 howarth et al 2011 baniya et al 2020 due to the economy and ecology of vfss they are thought to be the best management practice to control non point source pollution into water bodies smith et al 2008 yuan et al 2009 the effects of vegetation on the pollutant reduction in vfs have been studied over the past decades but the studies have mainly focused on the qualitative analysis of vegetation conditions haan et al 1994 ludwig et al 2005 lambrechts et al 2014 mankin et al 2007 hao et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 found that different vegetation species and configuration methods had direct impacts on the pollutant removal meanwhile the pollutant removal efficiencies varied significantly due to the dynamic changes in vegetation traits with grow stages and seasonal changes zhao et al 2014 pan et al 2017 kavian et al 2018 satchithanantham et al 2019 valkama et al 2019 however due to the specificity of the study sites and the limitations in the experimental variables these results have not provided a consistent conclusion regarding the effects of vegetation on pollutants that can be applied to create a universal standard for vegetation vfs designs franklin et al 2019 he et al 2020 changes of the vegetation conditions such as vegetation types collocation methods growth stages and periods primarily cause the variations in vegetation characteristics as well as soil environment related to them clement et al 2002 weissteiner et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2016 therefore it would be an effective method that using the plant traits to uniformly characterize vegetation conditions and to quantitatively explain vegetation effects on ecosystem services and notably pollutant removal in vfss lavorel and garnier 2002 faucon et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 franklin et al 2019 some scholars have paid attention to the relationship between vegetation characteristics and the pollutant removal efficiency of vfss for example lambrechts et al 2014 and pan et al 2017 found that traits such as grass tillering number stem spacing and morphological structure had significant effects on the sediment retention efficiency in vfss according to lab experiments and model simulations franklin et al 2019 proposed a new framework by which plant species that are likely to maximize n remove in riparian vfss could be selected according to plant traits with respect to n cycling such as root forms growth rates and leaf characteristics in addition this study indicated that the vegetation effects on pollutant transport and reduction in vfss can be explained according to scattered studies that have examined the effects of individual plant traits in vfss or in other areas however it is still difficult to quantitatively compare the influences of vegetation specific traits and reveal advantageous traits for pollutant removal in a particular vfs system hou et al 2020 additionally the pollutant removal mechanism in vfss can be understood only if the water flow in vfss is roundly investigated as it is the driving force of pollutant transport and determines the mechanisms and time of pollutant contact with the soil or vegetation hoffmann et al 2009 munoz carpena et al 1999 o toole et al 2018 weissteiner et al 2013 yu et al 2019 duchemin and hogue 2009 and zhao et al 2016 reported that shallow subsurface flow was the primary pathway for no3 n loss in sloping land which reflects the importance of studying the subsurface flow when studying the no3 n retention in vfss some studies have tried to determine the mechanism of trait effects on water flow by studying the relationships between runoff and aboveground plant characteristics e g stem density diameter and stiffness and leaf area and density burylo et al 2012 lambrechts et al 2014 kervro√´dan et al 2018 or the relationship between the infiltration capacity and plant roots gyssels et al 2005 lambrechts et al 2014 wu et al 2017 though the results of these studies have revealed some relationships between plant traits and water flow such as plant coverage weakening the runoff flow velocity the mechanism of vegetation effects on the process of water flow above and below ground and their relative proportions have not yet been fully revealed the aim of this research is to investigate the plant trait effects on water flow and the nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal efficiency in vfss the objectives are 1 to examine the differences in the process of water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground between four vfss with a high variability in plant traits under three slope gradients and 2 to analyze the contribution of plant traits to those differences and define the most important trait for no3 n removal using the grey correlation analysis the results could improve the understanding of vegetation effects on water flow and no3 n transport in vfss and provide a valuable reference for the selection of candidate vegetation species based on traits to improve no3 n retention in vfss 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation experiment device materials and execution the experiments were conducted in the jiangxi eco science park of soil and water conservation located in the yangou watershed in jiangxi province china 29 16 n to 29 17 n 115 42 e to 115 43 e an experimental device was designed to test the no3 n retention efficiency and transport path of the vfss fig 1a that included a soil box to construct the simulated vfs and a pressure pump system under the soil box to turn the soil box to achieve different slope gradient conditions each soil box was 300 cm long 80 cm wide and 70 cm high of which the upper and lower flow outlet were used as sampling ports for surface and subsurface flow respectively fig 1b the experimental soil was collected from the forestland of the park belong to the quaternary red clay main soil properties are showed in table 1 the soil was sieved through a 1 cm sieve mixed well and layered above a coarse sand layer in the soil boxes according to the designed bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 fig 1b during soil filling porous ceramic cups were buried in corresponding positions 100 200 and 290 cm away from the top at depths of 20 and 40 cm to collect the soil pore water in later experiments fig 1b three grasses commonly used for slope protection in south china were chosen to build the simulated vfss fig 1c the grasses were centipede grass eremochloa ophiuroides tall fescue festuca elata and vetiver grass vetiveria zizanioides which represent stoloniferous grass erect flexible grass and erect rigid grass respectively three grasses were planted in three soil boxes after the boxes were filled with soil seeds were planted for tall fescue with a row spacing of 5 cm at a sowing rate of 20 g m 2 while shoots were transplanted for centipede grass and vetiver grass with a row spacing of 5 cm and a column spacing of 5 cm in addition a vfs with a bare surface was kept as the experimental control the four vfss were nurtured under greenhouse conditions for two months maintaining the same amount of irrigation and without fertilizer supplementation during the period during the experiments the four prepared vfss the control strip with bare surface s ck the strip with centipede grass s c the strip with tall fescue s t and the strip with vetiver grass s v were taken to the laboratory for simulating runoff events for each vfs three slope gradient conditions 2 7 and 12 were successively tested with three replications before each experiment tap water was poured into the vfss at a small flow rate until it flowed out of the lower flow outlet for 30 min to saturate the soil and then the vfss were allowed to stand for 24 h to reach the field moisture capacity when the experiments were conducted manual pollutant runoff prepared in a 500 l plastic bucket by mixing tap water and sodium nitrate to achieve a 10 mg l 1 no3 n concentration was pumped into the head of the vfs to produce uniform runoff at a discharge of 8 0 l min 1 for 30 min 2 2 sampling and measuring during each runoff event the water volumes of surface and subsurface flow that lasted 30 s were separately measured using a graduated cylinder every 3 min and all collected water was transferred into clean polyethylene bottles to serve as water samples for the surface and subsurface flow for subsurface flow the measurement operation was ended after 180 min of the inflow and the subsequent outflow was collected together to measure the total volume and mixed well and a sample of water was taken additionally after 25 min of the inflow surface runoff was extracted using needle tubing and soil solutions were collected using porous ceramic suction cups at the corresponding locations fig 1b when all the experiments with three slope gradients have been finished the stem and root main characteristics of the three grasses were measured by selecting a number of 10 cm 10 cm quadrats at random the numbers and mean heights of the stems were directly manually measured and all the stems and leaves in the quadrat were harvested by hand cutting after being harvested the soil was dug up layer by layer to determine the maximum depth of the root system and washed carefully to collect all the roots in the quadrat all the water samples i e surface or subsurface samples and soil solution samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 and the no3 n concentrations were analyzed using an automatic multi parameter water quality analyzer smartchem 200 alliance instructions france after being filtered through 0 45 ¬µm membranes within 48 h the roots underwent grayscale scanning using a scanner and the total root length was analyzed using winrhizo pro 0 2004c root analysis system the stems leaves and roots of every quadrat were oven dried at a temperature of 75 c for 72 h weighed milled into a powder state and sieved through a 1 mm sieve and the total n content was analyzed according to the indophenol blue method houba et al 1996 2 3 statistical analysis this project involved studying and comparing water flow no3 n retention efficiency and the transport path of the four vfss and their response to grass traits to observe the change process of the water flow during each runoff event the liner function was used to fit to the instantaneous flow rate per unit width cm2 min of the surface flow and the peak extreme function y y0 a exp exp z z 1 z2 x b c was for the subsurface flow to compare the total retention efficiency of the water flow and no3 n the total flow volume l out l and no3 n mass m out mg of the surface and subsurface flow for each experiment were calculated according to the instantaneous flow rate r i l min 1 and no3 n concentration c i mg l 1 measured directly during the experimental process 1 l out r i 1 r i 2 t i 1 t i l r 2 m out c i 1 r i

subsurface flow after 180 min no such value for surface flow the no3 n retention rate Œ∑ of vfss were quantified using the difference in the total mass between the inflow and outflow for each experiment 3 Œ∑ m in m out sur m out sub m in 100 where m in mg m out sur mg m out sub mg were the total no3 n mass of the inflow surface outflow and subsurface outflow during each runoff event respectively meanwhile five parameters of the grass traits were chosen for analysis stem spacing cm stem height cm root depth cm root length density cm cm 3 and nitrogen uptake mg among them the stem spacing was decided on the stem numbers lambrechts et al 2014 pan et al 2017 the root length density was calculated by dividing the measured total root length by the volume of the root sample quadrat li et al 2013 and nitrogen uptake was calculated by multiplying the average grass nitrogen content by its new biomass for each vfs a one way anova was performed to analyze the differences between different vfss and a two way anova was performed to analyze the effect of the vegetation type and slope gradient and their interaction effect by using originpro 9 0 additionally the grey correlation analysis was conducted to determine the optimum grass trait for water flow no3 n transport and no3 n retention of the vfss singh et al 2004 in which the distinguishing coefficient was set at 0 5 and the relation was significant when the relational coefficient was greater than 0 6 3 results 3 1 the grass traits of stems and roots table 2 shows the main stem and root traits as well as the total n content and uptake mass of the three grasses measured at the end of all the experiments in general the differences in all the characteristics between the three grasses were significant at the 0 05 level except root depth specifically the tall fescue vfs showed the lowest value of stem spacing 60 05 15 12 cm and root depth 6 20 1 30 cm but the highest value of the root length density 5 32 0 42 cm cm 3 the average content 31 41 0 49 mg g 1 and total absorption amount 17 668 mg of n however the vetiver grass vfs showed the tallest height stem 85 34 13 23 cm and strongest stiffness 3 2 water flow fig 2 shows the change process of the surface flow in a specific runoff event for the four vfss under different slope gradients on the whole the instantaneous flow rate of the surface flow increased with time in all the simulated runoff events except that in the event of the s c under a 12 slope with a slight downward trend meantime the initial outflow time shortened and the average flow rate of a runoff process increased with the slope gradient increase on the whole specifically the rank of the upward trend of the instantaneous flow rate with time the slope of this linear fitting equation between the four vfss was s t s v s c s ck under a 2 slope and that was changed to s v s ck s t s c under the steeper slopes 7 and 12 slopes additionally the upward trend was increased with the slope gradient increase in the bare vfs while it was higher under the 2 slope than that under the other two steeper slopes in the grassed vfss fig 3 shows the change process of the subsurface flow within 90 min for the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the four vfss when the slope gradient increased the time to reach the maximum flow rate the extreme point on the fitting curve was getting delayed while the instantaneous flow rate before reaching the maximum value was decreased however after reaching the maximum value the instantaneous flow rates under the different slope gradients were closer over time in each vfs under the same slope gradient the maximum flow rate of the s t was always the greatest 37 9 cm2 min 1 30 9 cm2 min 1 and 21 6 cm2 min 1 at 2 7 and 12 respectively with that of the s ck being the lowest 24 5 cm2 min 1 16 9 cm2 min 1 and 14 7 cm2 min 1 at 2 7 and 12 respectively fig 4 shows the total flow volume of surface flow and subsurface flow as well as the intercepted flow volume in the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the four vfss when the slope gradient increased the total surface flow volume increased and the subsurface flow volume decreased however the distribution of the surface and subsurface flow were different between the four vfss specifically the surface flow volume were higher than the subsurface flow volume in the s ck under the three slope gradients but that were contrary in the s t and the s v however in the s c the total surface flow volume were lower than the subsurface flow volume under the slopes of 2 and 7 and that became the opposite under the slope of 12 in addition compared to the s ck under a specific slope gradient the three grassed vfss had significantly lower surface flow volume p 0 05 with a rank of s t s v s c and higher subsurface flow volume p 0 05 with a rank of s t s v s c 3 3 no3 n transport and loss fig 5 shows the no3 n concentration of the surface and subsurface flow in the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the surface flow the average no3 n concentrations of the four vfss varied from 5 1 mg l 1 to 5 8 mg l 1 and had no significant difference under each slope gradient except that between s ck and s t under a 2 slope in the subsurface flow the average no3 n concentrations of the four vfss showed various declining trends from the 2 slope 16 6 mg l 1 11 8 mg l 1 9 9 mg l 1 and 14 8 mg l 1 for the s ck s c s t and s v respectively to the 7 slope 14 4 mg l 1 6 2 mg l 1 6 6 mg l 1 and 9 6 mg l 1 for s ck s c s t s v respectively and only showed slight changes from the 7 slope to the 12 slope 13 9 mg l 1 7 2 mg l 1 5 7 mg l 1 and 7 3 mg l 1 for the s ck s c s t and s v respectively compared to the s ck the average no3 n concentrations of the subsurface flow in the three grassed vfss were all significantly lower p 0 05 and maintained the same rank of s v s c s t in addition for each vfs the discrete degree of the no3 n concentration of the surface or subsurface flow in the runoff event under 2 slope was greater than that under the other two steeper slopes fig 6 shows the distributions of the relative no3 n concentrations at 25 min of runoff events in the four vfss under the different slope gradients without distinguishing the no3 n from the inflow to the soil the relative no3 n concentration in the surface flow changed from1 0 to 0 6 in the first third of the vfs and only changed from 0 6 to 0 45 in the back two third portion in all runoff events which meant that the reduction of no3 n in the surface flow primarily occurred in the front of the vfs comparatively the relative no3 n concentration in the subsurface flow increased in the horizontal direction but the concentration gradient was obviously influenced by grasses and slope gradients specifically under same slope the ranges of the concentration gradient in s t were the lowest in addition the ranges of the concentration gradient narrowed under higher slope gradients especially in the grassed vfss fig 7 shows the no3 n loss mass of the surface and subsurface flow and the no3 n total retention rate in the four vfss under the different slope gradients the no3 n loss mass in the surface flow of the four vfss all increased with the slope gradient increase but the value of the grassed vfss were lower than that of the bare vfs the same as the flow volume in the surface flow comparatively the laws of change with slope gradients on the no3 n loss mass in the subsurface flow varied between the four vfss this resulted in inconsistency in the advantages and disadvantages of grassed vfss under different slope gradient when compared to the bare vfs which was different from the results that the subsurface flow volume of the grassed vfss were all greater than the bare vfs under the three slope gradients for the total no3 n retention rate the bare vfs kept a consistently low value from the 2 slope to the 12 slope however the optimum vfs in the no3 n retention efficiency under different slopes were inconsistent in which the s c showed the best performance under the 7 slope while the s t showed the best performance under the 2 slope and the 12 slope 3 4 the grey correlation analysis table 3 shows the relational coefficients between the water flow or the no3 n transport absolute concentration and loss mass above and below ground with the selected plant traits and slope gradient and between water flow and no3 n transport excluding the no3 n concentration of surface flow due to no significant difference overall the slope gradient and vegetation traits significantly influenced the water flow or no3 n transport with the relational coefficients of vegetation characteristics especially the stem spacing always being higher than that of slope gradient these results confirmed that grassed vfss were able to change the water flow and no3 n transport and even mitigated the effects of the slope gradient changes additionally the no3 n concentration at different depths had different responses to the vegetation traits specifically the no3 n concentrations at 20 cm depth c 20 and at the outlet of the subsurface flow c out sub were significantly correlated to the stem spacing 0 820 and 0 761 and root depth 0 623 and 0 608 but the no3 n concentration at 40 cm depth c 40 were only significantly correlated to stem spacing 0 735 moreover the no3 n loss mass was significantly related to the water flow volume and the no3 n loss concentration above and below ground in which the relational coefficient with the former was larger than that with the latter above ground but it was contrary below ground 4 discussion the impact of grass traits on water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground was investigated using simulated runoff experiments with three grassed vfss and one bare vfs the grasses were nurtured under greenhouse conditions for two months until the vegetation coverage reached over 90 meanwhile there was obvious morphological difference between the grasses which have been shown to result in significant differences in runoff and sediment interception in vfss pan et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 hou et al 2020 for each vfs the simulated runoff events were successively conducted under three slope gradients 2 7 and 12 with three replications this approach successively conducting several runoff events under different experimental conditions e g inflow discharge and content slope gradient in the same plot or box has been used in previous studies qian et al 2011 sheng et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 and is an appropriate scientific approach because that the pollutants from several runoff events should not be enough to change the soil environment and notably nutrient content in a vfs sovik and syversen 2008 uusi kamppa and jauhiainen 2010 in this study the no3 n loss concentration in the three repeat runoff event under the same slope gradient slightly changed but without continuously rising or declining this also proved that the previous experiment had no significant effect on the latter one and ensured the feasibility of successively three slope tests in the same vfs the soil was adequately mixed before packing into the boxes to lessen the spatial variability of the specific soil box and the variability between the four vfss in the soil properties while the conditions e g temperature irrigation were consistent when the vfss were established these ensured that any different conditions that related to no3 n removal between the vfss such as the difference in the soil no3 n content caused by the mineralization grass uptake or denitrification were due to the difference in vegetation though the no3 n retention efficiency of a vfs was defined as the percent difference in the mass between the inflow and the outflow and did not consider the source of the lost no3 n from the vfs itself or from runoff the values were still helpful to evaluate the effectiveness of the vfs for controlling no3 n entering water bodies on the macro level mayer et al 2007 satchithanantham et al 2019 4 1 the impact of grass traits on water flow in vfss in this study the surface and subsurface flow were significantly different between the four vfss with high variability in vegetation traits fig 4 table 2 however the impacts of vegetation on the water flow varied in response to a specific trait on one hand the vegetation traits aboveground such as stem density and diameter leaf density and area coverage were shown to influence hydraulic roughness and change in the flow velocity pan et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 on the other hand the infiltration rate was found to be enhanced by an increase in the soil porosity caused by the vegetation root system with a positive correlation to the root biomass liu et al 2019 root length density and surface area density li et al 2013 average root channel diameter and channel area wu et al 2017 additionally the improvement in the soil infiltration rate had a great relationship with root diameter for example guo liang and guo bin 2009 and liu et al 2019 found that the impacts of fine roots were the most obvious li et al 2013 found that the improvement was mainly attributed to the roots with diameters of 0 5 5 mm moreover the infiltration rate could also be enhanced by the surface flow depth accumulated by the vegetation stem green and ampt 1911 munoz carpena et al 1999 these results provide good explanations for the results of this study in which the tall fescue vfs with the densest stems and the densest and finest roots showed the lowest surface flow volume but the highest subsurface flow volume table 2 fig 4 however the centipede grass vfs with a denser stem and root system showed larger surface flow and lower subsurface flow than the vetiver grass vfs with a sparser stem and root system table 2 fig 4 this may have been related to the flexibility of stems according to the studies of dosskey 2001 and lu and dai 2018 in which the flexibility of vegetation was found to have a significant relationship with water resistance based on its flow retarding structure with the greater flexibility of vegetation the greater degree of bending and the less water resistance additionally the weakening of the flow resistance by the flexible stem covered up the promoting effect of the root system on the flow infiltration eventually resulting in the increased loss of surface flow in the centipede grass vfs however was the impact of stems or roots on the water flow stronger in this study the grey correlation analysis showed that the surface flow volume was mostly influenced by stem density and the subsurface flow was mostly influenced by root length density while the relative proportion of them was still mostly influenced by stem density table 3 however this research was conducted after two months of growth for grasses and this may not be sufficient for root system development xiao et al 2011 li et al 2013 pan et al 2017 therefore more studies that combine a longer growth period and more types of plants need to be conducted to verify this result 4 2 the impact of grass traits on no3 n loss concentration in vfss the vegetation effects on the no3 n loss concentration had different performances above and below ground in the surface flow the no3 n loss concentrations in the four vfss were all lower than initial concentration of inflow and that in the grassed vfss were lower than that in the bare vfs however the deviations were not significant p 0 05 fig 4 in addition the reduction of no3 n in the surface flow mostly occurred in the first third of the vfs the same results regarding the vegetation effects were found in the study of mayer et al 2007 by analyzing data from 89 individual buffers from 45 published studies they found that there was no significant difference on no3 removal efficiency in runoff between buffers of various vegetation types additionally they also found that the no3 removal in runoff was not related to buffer width within the width categories 0 25 m 26 50 m and 50 m mayer et al 2007 suggesting that the increase of no3 removal efficiency per unit width was little after a certain position of the vfs comparatively the no3 n concentrations in the subsurface flow that combined lateral and vertical leaching were significantly influenced by vegetation p 0 05 with average no3 n concentrations in the grassed vfss lower than that in the bare vfs fig 5 this provided direct proof that the plants had the potential to influence n leaching in soils franklin et al 2015 franklin et al 2019 it is known to us that n is retained in soils through two main processes plant uptake incorporation into plant biomass hefting et al 2005 or removed by denitrification the microbially mediated transformation of nitrate to gaseous n gift et al 2010 most studies have focused on the impacts of plant characteristics through the two process such as root form growth character leaf production quantity quality and rate of return to the soil franklin et al 2018 for example root biomass has positive impacts on reduced short term nitrate leaching from soils by enhancing the root uptake and microbial n removal processes tufekcioglu et al 1998 franklin et al 2015 leaf biomass production has been positively associated with nitrate leaching reduction by assimilating more n tufekcioglu et al 2003 fortier et al 2010 yu et al 2014 however in this study when slope gradient increased the average no3 n concentrations in the subsurface flow were decreased fig 5 and the concentration gradient below ground were weaken fig 6 especially in the grassed vfs where there was greater fluctuation in the subsurface flow the results reflect that the no3 n transport below ground was not only influenced by plants and the soil environment associated with it but also influenced by the water flow and the latter one seems to have greater effects therefore the impacts of water flow and plant traits responsible for it mostly stem traits need to be considered more to improve no3 n removal in a specific runoff event this is also highlighted by the finding based on the grey correlation analysis that the no3 n concentrations of the subsurface flow were significantly correlated to the total flow volume and were more closely linked to stems than roots with no significant relation to n uptake table 3 4 3 the major process of no3 n loss mass and retention in vfss the total mass of pollutant entering water bodies is an important index to control water quality in rivers and lakes for governmental management the total loss mass is determined by water flow volume and pollutant loss concentration therefore the identification of the primary factors that play important roles in controlling the total mass of pollutant is important in this study the no3 n loss mass in the subsurface flow was higher than that in the surface flow fig 6 additionally the water flow volume was the largest determinant of the no3 n loss mass in the surface flow the relational coefficient of 0 863 while the no3 n loss concentration was in the subsurface flow the relational coefficient of 0 706 table 3 therefore in the control of no3 n loss in vfss the main grass traits should be considered according the major process of no3 n loss above and below ground respectively such as the grass traits that can reduce n concentration rather than reducing water flow should be considered more in the subsurface flow 5 conclusions in this study the responses of water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground to grass specific traits in vfss were investigated for the water flow stem density and root length density had the greatest positive correlations with the surface flow and the subsurface flow respectively while the flexibility of vegetation may weaken the positive effect for the no3 n loss concentration the effect of roots was lower than that of stems as a whole additionally to reduce no3 n loss mass the primary grass traits that can reduce water flow should be considered more in the surface flow and the grass traits that can reduce no3 n loss concentration should be considered more in the subsurface flow this study used a trait based approach to provide new insights for accurately assessing plant impacts on nitrogen transport and retention in vfss further studies with more plant types and longer growth that can cause greater differences in traits are needed for developing accurate methods of plant selection and collocation based on traits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10048,vegetation filter strips vfs have been shown to effectively intercept water flow and remove nitrogen studies of the vegetation effects on water flow and nitrogen transport are typically studied based on qualitative analyses with species layouts growth stage seasonal changes and other vegetation conditions and did not considered quantification based on plant traits in this study the transport path and retention efficiency of nitrate nitrogen no3 n in vfss are investigated from the view of the plant specific trait effects by simulating runoff experiments using three grassed vfss centipede grass tall fescue and vetiver grass as well as a bare vfs under different slope gradients 2 7 and 12 slope gradients the primary grass traits stem spacing root depth root length density and nitrogen total uptake were measured and the responses of water flow and no3 n loss above and below ground to those were quantitatively assessed using the grey correlation analysis method results indicated that grasses and slope gradient significantly influenced the water flow and no3 n loss in general except the no3 n loss concentration of the surface flow in which the tall fescue vfs showed the highest no3 n total retention rates under each slope condition considering the impact of specific grass traits stem density and root length density has the greatest effects on the surface flow and the subsurface flow respectively while the effect of roots was lower than that of stems on no3 n loss below ground additionally the no3 n loss mass in the surface and subsurface flow were mostly related to the water flow volume and the no3 n loss concentration respectively this indicated that grass traits that reduce water flow should be considered more to control the no3 n loss mass above ground whereas the grass traits reducing no3 n loss concentration should be considered more to control the no3 n loss mass below ground keywords vegetation filter strip grass trait nitrate nitrogen transport quantitatively analysis 1 introduction non point source pollution especially agricultural non point source pollution has become the primary reason for the deterioration of water quality in rivers and lakes today xiang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 among them nitrate is one of the most common dissolved contaminants and causes a series of problems including eutrophication in surface water nitrate pollution of groundwater and destruction of aquatic ecosystems around rivers and lakes penuelas et al 2013 wu et al 2017 2019 therefore the issue of how to control non point source pollution especially nitrogen has become an essential and difficult problem that needs to be solved to alleviate the current water environmental problems vegetative Ô¨Ålter strips vfss located at the end of agricultural land as interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have the potential to effectively slow down surface runoff promote infiltration and then greatly increase the chances of dissolved pollutants being adsorbed by soil uptake by plants or transformed munoz carpena et al 1999 dorioz et al 2006 mayer et al 2007 howarth et al 2011 baniya et al 2020 due to the economy and ecology of vfss they are thought to be the best management practice to control non point source pollution into water bodies smith et al 2008 yuan et al 2009 the effects of vegetation on the pollutant reduction in vfs have been studied over the past decades but the studies have mainly focused on the qualitative analysis of vegetation conditions haan et al 1994 ludwig et al 2005 lambrechts et al 2014 mankin et al 2007 hao et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 found that different vegetation species and configuration methods had direct impacts on the pollutant removal meanwhile the pollutant removal efficiencies varied significantly due to the dynamic changes in vegetation traits with grow stages and seasonal changes zhao et al 2014 pan et al 2017 kavian et al 2018 satchithanantham et al 2019 valkama et al 2019 however due to the specificity of the study sites and the limitations in the experimental variables these results have not provided a consistent conclusion regarding the effects of vegetation on pollutants that can be applied to create a universal standard for vegetation vfs designs franklin et al 2019 he et al 2020 changes of the vegetation conditions such as vegetation types collocation methods growth stages and periods primarily cause the variations in vegetation characteristics as well as soil environment related to them clement et al 2002 weissteiner et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2016 therefore it would be an effective method that using the plant traits to uniformly characterize vegetation conditions and to quantitatively explain vegetation effects on ecosystem services and notably pollutant removal in vfss lavorel and garnier 2002 faucon et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 franklin et al 2019 some scholars have paid attention to the relationship between vegetation characteristics and the pollutant removal efficiency of vfss for example lambrechts et al 2014 and pan et al 2017 found that traits such as grass tillering number stem spacing and morphological structure had significant effects on the sediment retention efficiency in vfss according to lab experiments and model simulations franklin et al 2019 proposed a new framework by which plant species that are likely to maximize n remove in riparian vfss could be selected according to plant traits with respect to n cycling such as root forms growth rates and leaf characteristics in addition this study indicated that the vegetation effects on pollutant transport and reduction in vfss can be explained according to scattered studies that have examined the effects of individual plant traits in vfss or in other areas however it is still difficult to quantitatively compare the influences of vegetation specific traits and reveal advantageous traits for pollutant removal in a particular vfs system hou et al 2020 additionally the pollutant removal mechanism in vfss can be understood only if the water flow in vfss is roundly investigated as it is the driving force of pollutant transport and determines the mechanisms and time of pollutant contact with the soil or vegetation hoffmann et al 2009 munoz carpena et al 1999 o toole et al 2018 weissteiner et al 2013 yu et al 2019 duchemin and hogue 2009 and zhao et al 2016 reported that shallow subsurface flow was the primary pathway for no3 n loss in sloping land which reflects the importance of studying the subsurface flow when studying the no3 n retention in vfss some studies have tried to determine the mechanism of trait effects on water flow by studying the relationships between runoff and aboveground plant characteristics e g stem density diameter and stiffness and leaf area and density burylo et al 2012 lambrechts et al 2014 kervro√´dan et al 2018 or the relationship between the infiltration capacity and plant roots gyssels et al 2005 lambrechts et al 2014 wu et al 2017 though the results of these studies have revealed some relationships between plant traits and water flow such as plant coverage weakening the runoff flow velocity the mechanism of vegetation effects on the process of water flow above and below ground and their relative proportions have not yet been fully revealed the aim of this research is to investigate the plant trait effects on water flow and the nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal efficiency in vfss the objectives are 1 to examine the differences in the process of water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground between four vfss with a high variability in plant traits under three slope gradients and 2 to analyze the contribution of plant traits to those differences and define the most important trait for no3 n removal using the grey correlation analysis the results could improve the understanding of vegetation effects on water flow and no3 n transport in vfss and provide a valuable reference for the selection of candidate vegetation species based on traits to improve no3 n retention in vfss 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation experiment device materials and execution the experiments were conducted in the jiangxi eco science park of soil and water conservation located in the yangou watershed in jiangxi province china 29 16 n to 29 17 n 115 42 e to 115 43 e an experimental device was designed to test the no3 n retention efficiency and transport path of the vfss fig 1a that included a soil box to construct the simulated vfs and a pressure pump system under the soil box to turn the soil box to achieve different slope gradient conditions each soil box was 300 cm long 80 cm wide and 70 cm high of which the upper and lower flow outlet were used as sampling ports for surface and subsurface flow respectively fig 1b the experimental soil was collected from the forestland of the park belong to the quaternary red clay main soil properties are showed in table 1 the soil was sieved through a 1 cm sieve mixed well and layered above a coarse sand layer in the soil boxes according to the designed bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 fig 1b during soil filling porous ceramic cups were buried in corresponding positions 100 200 and 290 cm away from the top at depths of 20 and 40 cm to collect the soil pore water in later experiments fig 1b three grasses commonly used for slope protection in south china were chosen to build the simulated vfss fig 1c the grasses were centipede grass eremochloa ophiuroides tall fescue festuca elata and vetiver grass vetiveria zizanioides which represent stoloniferous grass erect flexible grass and erect rigid grass respectively three grasses were planted in three soil boxes after the boxes were filled with soil seeds were planted for tall fescue with a row spacing of 5 cm at a sowing rate of 20 g m 2 while shoots were transplanted for centipede grass and vetiver grass with a row spacing of 5 cm and a column spacing of 5 cm in addition a vfs with a bare surface was kept as the experimental control the four vfss were nurtured under greenhouse conditions for two months maintaining the same amount of irrigation and without fertilizer supplementation during the period during the experiments the four prepared vfss the control strip with bare surface s ck the strip with centipede grass s c the strip with tall fescue s t and the strip with vetiver grass s v were taken to the laboratory for simulating runoff events for each vfs three slope gradient conditions 2 7 and 12 were successively tested with three replications before each experiment tap water was poured into the vfss at a small flow rate until it flowed out of the lower flow outlet for 30 min to saturate the soil and then the vfss were allowed to stand for 24 h to reach the field moisture capacity when the experiments were conducted manual pollutant runoff prepared in a 500 l plastic bucket by mixing tap water and sodium nitrate to achieve a 10 mg l 1 no3 n concentration was pumped into the head of the vfs to produce uniform runoff at a discharge of 8 0 l min 1 for 30 min 2 2 sampling and measuring during each runoff event the water volumes of surface and subsurface flow that lasted 30 s were separately measured using a graduated cylinder every 3 min and all collected water was transferred into clean polyethylene bottles to serve as water samples for the surface and subsurface flow for subsurface flow the measurement operation was ended after 180 min of the inflow and the subsequent outflow was collected together to measure the total volume and mixed well and a sample of water was taken additionally after 25 min of the inflow surface runoff was extracted using needle tubing and soil solutions were collected using porous ceramic suction cups at the corresponding locations fig 1b when all the experiments with three slope gradients have been finished the stem and root main characteristics of the three grasses were measured by selecting a number of 10 cm 10 cm quadrats at random the numbers and mean heights of the stems were directly manually measured and all the stems and leaves in the quadrat were harvested by hand cutting after being harvested the soil was dug up layer by layer to determine the maximum depth of the root system and washed carefully to collect all the roots in the quadrat all the water samples i e surface or subsurface samples and soil solution samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 and the no3 n concentrations were analyzed using an automatic multi parameter water quality analyzer smartchem 200 alliance instructions france after being filtered through 0 45 ¬µm membranes within 48 h the roots underwent grayscale scanning using a scanner and the total root length was analyzed using winrhizo pro 0 2004c root analysis system the stems leaves and roots of every quadrat were oven dried at a temperature of 75 c for 72 h weighed milled into a powder state and sieved through a 1 mm sieve and the total n content was analyzed according to the indophenol blue method houba et al 1996 2 3 statistical analysis this project involved studying and comparing water flow no3 n retention efficiency and the transport path of the four vfss and their response to grass traits to observe the change process of the water flow during each runoff event the liner function was used to fit to the instantaneous flow rate per unit width cm2 min of the surface flow and the peak extreme function y y0 a exp exp z z 1 z2 x b c was for the subsurface flow to compare the total retention efficiency of the water flow and no3 n the total flow volume l out l and no3 n mass m out mg of the surface and subsurface flow for each experiment were calculated according to the instantaneous flow rate r i l min 1 and no3 n concentration c i mg l 1 measured directly during the experimental process 1 l out r i 1 r i 2 t i 1 t i l r 2 m out c i 1 r i 1 c i r i 2 t i 1 t i c r l r where t i min is the time of the flow rate or no3 n concentration measurement and l r l c r mg l 1 is the residue flow volume and its no3 n concentration of the subsurface flow after 180 min no such value for surface flow the no3 n retention rate Œ∑ of vfss were quantified using the difference in the total mass between the inflow and outflow for each experiment 3 Œ∑ m in m out sur m out sub m in 100 where m in mg m out sur mg m out sub mg were the total no3 n mass of the inflow surface outflow and subsurface outflow during each runoff event respectively meanwhile five parameters of the grass traits were chosen for analysis stem spacing cm stem height cm root depth cm root length density cm cm 3 and nitrogen uptake mg among them the stem spacing was decided on the stem numbers lambrechts et al 2014 pan et al 2017 the root length density was calculated by dividing the measured total root length by the volume of the root sample quadrat li et al 2013 and nitrogen uptake was calculated by multiplying the average grass nitrogen content by its new biomass for each vfs a one way anova was performed to analyze the differences between different vfss and a two way anova was performed to analyze the effect of the vegetation type and slope gradient and their interaction effect by using originpro 9 0 additionally the grey correlation analysis was conducted to determine the optimum grass trait for water flow no3 n transport and no3 n retention of the vfss singh et al 2004 in which the distinguishing coefficient was set at 0 5 and the relation was significant when the relational coefficient was greater than 0 6 3 results 3 1 the grass traits of stems and roots table 2 shows the main stem and root traits as well as the total n content and uptake mass of the three grasses measured at the end of all the experiments in general the differences in all the characteristics between the three grasses were significant at the 0 05 level except root depth specifically the tall fescue vfs showed the lowest value of stem spacing 60 05 15 12 cm and root depth 6 20 1 30 cm but the highest value of the root length density 5 32 0 42 cm cm 3 the average content 31 41 0 49 mg g 1 and total absorption amount 17 668 mg of n however the vetiver grass vfs showed the tallest height stem 85 34 13 23 cm and strongest stiffness 3 2 water flow fig 2 shows the change process of the surface flow in a specific runoff event for the four vfss under different slope gradients on the whole the instantaneous flow rate of the surface flow increased with time in all the simulated runoff events except that in the event of the s c under a 12 slope with a slight downward trend meantime the initial outflow time shortened and the average flow rate of a runoff process increased with the slope gradient increase on the whole specifically the rank of the upward trend of the instantaneous flow rate with time the slope of this linear fitting equation between the four vfss was s t s v s c s ck under a 2 slope and that was changed to s v s ck s t s c under the steeper slopes 7 and 12 slopes additionally the upward trend was increased with the slope gradient increase in the bare vfs while it was higher under the 2 slope than that under the other two steeper slopes in the grassed vfss fig 3 shows the change process of the subsurface flow within 90 min for the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the four vfss when the slope gradient increased the time to reach the maximum flow rate the extreme point on the fitting curve was getting delayed while the instantaneous flow rate before reaching the maximum value was decreased however after reaching the maximum value the instantaneous flow rates under the different slope gradients were closer over time in each vfs under the same slope gradient the maximum flow rate of the s t was always the greatest 37 9 cm2 min 1 30 9 cm2 min 1 and 21 6 cm2 min 1 at 2 7 and 12 respectively with that of the s ck being the lowest 24 5 cm2 min 1 16 9 cm2 min 1 and 14 7 cm2 min 1 at 2 7 and 12 respectively fig 4 shows the total flow volume of surface flow and subsurface flow as well as the intercepted flow volume in the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the four vfss when the slope gradient increased the total surface flow volume increased and the subsurface flow volume decreased however the distribution of the surface and subsurface flow were different between the four vfss specifically the surface flow volume were higher than the subsurface flow volume in the s ck under the three slope gradients but that were contrary in the s t and the s v however in the s c the total surface flow volume were lower than the subsurface flow volume under the slopes of 2 and 7 and that became the opposite under the slope of 12 in addition compared to the s ck under a specific slope gradient the three grassed vfss had significantly lower surface flow volume p 0 05 with a rank of s t s v s c and higher subsurface flow volume p 0 05 with a rank of s t s v s c 3 3 no3 n transport and loss fig 5 shows the no3 n concentration of the surface and subsurface flow in the four vfss under the different slope gradients in the surface flow the average no3 n concentrations of the four vfss varied from 5 1 mg l 1 to 5 8 mg l 1 and had no significant difference under each slope gradient except that between s ck and s t under a 2 slope in the subsurface flow the average no3 n concentrations of the four vfss showed various declining trends from the 2 slope 16 6 mg l 1 11 8 mg l 1 9 9 mg l 1 and 14 8 mg l 1 for the s ck s c s t and s v respectively to the 7 slope 14 4 mg l 1 6 2 mg l 1 6 6 mg l 1 and 9 6 mg l 1 for s ck s c s t s v respectively and only showed slight changes from the 7 slope to the 12 slope 13 9 mg l 1 7 2 mg l 1 5 7 mg l 1 and 7 3 mg l 1 for the s ck s c s t and s v respectively compared to the s ck the average no3 n concentrations of the subsurface flow in the three grassed vfss were all significantly lower p 0 05 and maintained the same rank of s v s c s t in addition for each vfs the discrete degree of the no3 n concentration of the surface or subsurface flow in the runoff event under 2 slope was greater than that under the other two steeper slopes fig 6 shows the distributions of the relative no3 n concentrations at 25 min of runoff events in the four vfss under the different slope gradients without distinguishing the no3 n from the inflow to the soil the relative no3 n concentration in the surface flow changed from1 0 to 0 6 in the first third of the vfs and only changed from 0 6 to 0 45 in the back two third portion in all runoff events which meant that the reduction of no3 n in the surface flow primarily occurred in the front of the vfs comparatively the relative no3 n concentration in the subsurface flow increased in the horizontal direction but the concentration gradient was obviously influenced by grasses and slope gradients specifically under same slope the ranges of the concentration gradient in s t were the lowest in addition the ranges of the concentration gradient narrowed under higher slope gradients especially in the grassed vfss fig 7 shows the no3 n loss mass of the surface and subsurface flow and the no3 n total retention rate in the four vfss under the different slope gradients the no3 n loss mass in the surface flow of the four vfss all increased with the slope gradient increase but the value of the grassed vfss were lower than that of the bare vfs the same as the flow volume in the surface flow comparatively the laws of change with slope gradients on the no3 n loss mass in the subsurface flow varied between the four vfss this resulted in inconsistency in the advantages and disadvantages of grassed vfss under different slope gradient when compared to the bare vfs which was different from the results that the subsurface flow volume of the grassed vfss were all greater than the bare vfs under the three slope gradients for the total no3 n retention rate the bare vfs kept a consistently low value from the 2 slope to the 12 slope however the optimum vfs in the no3 n retention efficiency under different slopes were inconsistent in which the s c showed the best performance under the 7 slope while the s t showed the best performance under the 2 slope and the 12 slope 3 4 the grey correlation analysis table 3 shows the relational coefficients between the water flow or the no3 n transport absolute concentration and loss mass above and below ground with the selected plant traits and slope gradient and between water flow and no3 n transport excluding the no3 n concentration of surface flow due to no significant difference overall the slope gradient and vegetation traits significantly influenced the water flow or no3 n transport with the relational coefficients of vegetation characteristics especially the stem spacing always being higher than that of slope gradient these results confirmed that grassed vfss were able to change the water flow and no3 n transport and even mitigated the effects of the slope gradient changes additionally the no3 n concentration at different depths had different responses to the vegetation traits specifically the no3 n concentrations at 20 cm depth c 20 and at the outlet of the subsurface flow c out sub were significantly correlated to the stem spacing 0 820 and 0 761 and root depth 0 623 and 0 608 but the no3 n concentration at 40 cm depth c 40 were only significantly correlated to stem spacing 0 735 moreover the no3 n loss mass was significantly related to the water flow volume and the no3 n loss concentration above and below ground in which the relational coefficient with the former was larger than that with the latter above ground but it was contrary below ground 4 discussion the impact of grass traits on water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground was investigated using simulated runoff experiments with three grassed vfss and one bare vfs the grasses were nurtured under greenhouse conditions for two months until the vegetation coverage reached over 90 meanwhile there was obvious morphological difference between the grasses which have been shown to result in significant differences in runoff and sediment interception in vfss pan et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 hou et al 2020 for each vfs the simulated runoff events were successively conducted under three slope gradients 2 7 and 12 with three replications this approach successively conducting several runoff events under different experimental conditions e g inflow discharge and content slope gradient in the same plot or box has been used in previous studies qian et al 2011 sheng et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 and is an appropriate scientific approach because that the pollutants from several runoff events should not be enough to change the soil environment and notably nutrient content in a vfs sovik and syversen 2008 uusi kamppa and jauhiainen 2010 in this study the no3 n loss concentration in the three repeat runoff event under the same slope gradient slightly changed but without continuously rising or declining this also proved that the previous experiment had no significant effect on the latter one and ensured the feasibility of successively three slope tests in the same vfs the soil was adequately mixed before packing into the boxes to lessen the spatial variability of the specific soil box and the variability between the four vfss in the soil properties while the conditions e g temperature irrigation were consistent when the vfss were established these ensured that any different conditions that related to no3 n removal between the vfss such as the difference in the soil no3 n content caused by the mineralization grass uptake or denitrification were due to the difference in vegetation though the no3 n retention efficiency of a vfs was defined as the percent difference in the mass between the inflow and the outflow and did not consider the source of the lost no3 n from the vfs itself or from runoff the values were still helpful to evaluate the effectiveness of the vfs for controlling no3 n entering water bodies on the macro level mayer et al 2007 satchithanantham et al 2019 4 1 the impact of grass traits on water flow in vfss in this study the surface and subsurface flow were significantly different between the four vfss with high variability in vegetation traits fig 4 table 2 however the impacts of vegetation on the water flow varied in response to a specific trait on one hand the vegetation traits aboveground such as stem density and diameter leaf density and area coverage were shown to influence hydraulic roughness and change in the flow velocity pan et al 2017 kervro√´dan et al 2018 on the other hand the infiltration rate was found to be enhanced by an increase in the soil porosity caused by the vegetation root system with a positive correlation to the root biomass liu et al 2019 root length density and surface area density li et al 2013 average root channel diameter and channel area wu et al 2017 additionally the improvement in the soil infiltration rate had a great relationship with root diameter for example guo liang and guo bin 2009 and liu et al 2019 found that the impacts of fine roots were the most obvious li et al 2013 found that the improvement was mainly attributed to the roots with diameters of 0 5 5 mm moreover the infiltration rate could also be enhanced by the surface flow depth accumulated by the vegetation stem green and ampt 1911 munoz carpena et al 1999 these results provide good explanations for the results of this study in which the tall fescue vfs with the densest stems and the densest and finest roots showed the lowest surface flow volume but the highest subsurface flow volume table 2 fig 4 however the centipede grass vfs with a denser stem and root system showed larger surface flow and lower subsurface flow than the vetiver grass vfs with a sparser stem and root system table 2 fig 4 this may have been related to the flexibility of stems according to the studies of dosskey 2001 and lu and dai 2018 in which the flexibility of vegetation was found to have a significant relationship with water resistance based on its flow retarding structure with the greater flexibility of vegetation the greater degree of bending and the less water resistance additionally the weakening of the flow resistance by the flexible stem covered up the promoting effect of the root system on the flow infiltration eventually resulting in the increased loss of surface flow in the centipede grass vfs however was the impact of stems or roots on the water flow stronger in this study the grey correlation analysis showed that the surface flow volume was mostly influenced by stem density and the subsurface flow was mostly influenced by root length density while the relative proportion of them was still mostly influenced by stem density table 3 however this research was conducted after two months of growth for grasses and this may not be sufficient for root system development xiao et al 2011 li et al 2013 pan et al 2017 therefore more studies that combine a longer growth period and more types of plants need to be conducted to verify this result 4 2 the impact of grass traits on no3 n loss concentration in vfss the vegetation effects on the no3 n loss concentration had different performances above and below ground in the surface flow the no3 n loss concentrations in the four vfss were all lower than initial concentration of inflow and that in the grassed vfss were lower than that in the bare vfs however the deviations were not significant p 0 05 fig 4 in addition the reduction of no3 n in the surface flow mostly occurred in the first third of the vfs the same results regarding the vegetation effects were found in the study of mayer et al 2007 by analyzing data from 89 individual buffers from 45 published studies they found that there was no significant difference on no3 removal efficiency in runoff between buffers of various vegetation types additionally they also found that the no3 removal in runoff was not related to buffer width within the width categories 0 25 m 26 50 m and 50 m mayer et al 2007 suggesting that the increase of no3 removal efficiency per unit width was little after a certain position of the vfs comparatively the no3 n concentrations in the subsurface flow that combined lateral and vertical leaching were significantly influenced by vegetation p 0 05 with average no3 n concentrations in the grassed vfss lower than that in the bare vfs fig 5 this provided direct proof that the plants had the potential to influence n leaching in soils franklin et al 2015 franklin et al 2019 it is known to us that n is retained in soils through two main processes plant uptake incorporation into plant biomass hefting et al 2005 or removed by denitrification the microbially mediated transformation of nitrate to gaseous n gift et al 2010 most studies have focused on the impacts of plant characteristics through the two process such as root form growth character leaf production quantity quality and rate of return to the soil franklin et al 2018 for example root biomass has positive impacts on reduced short term nitrate leaching from soils by enhancing the root uptake and microbial n removal processes tufekcioglu et al 1998 franklin et al 2015 leaf biomass production has been positively associated with nitrate leaching reduction by assimilating more n tufekcioglu et al 2003 fortier et al 2010 yu et al 2014 however in this study when slope gradient increased the average no3 n concentrations in the subsurface flow were decreased fig 5 and the concentration gradient below ground were weaken fig 6 especially in the grassed vfs where there was greater fluctuation in the subsurface flow the results reflect that the no3 n transport below ground was not only influenced by plants and the soil environment associated with it but also influenced by the water flow and the latter one seems to have greater effects therefore the impacts of water flow and plant traits responsible for it mostly stem traits need to be considered more to improve no3 n removal in a specific runoff event this is also highlighted by the finding based on the grey correlation analysis that the no3 n concentrations of the subsurface flow were significantly correlated to the total flow volume and were more closely linked to stems than roots with no significant relation to n uptake table 3 4 3 the major process of no3 n loss mass and retention in vfss the total mass of pollutant entering water bodies is an important index to control water quality in rivers and lakes for governmental management the total loss mass is determined by water flow volume and pollutant loss concentration therefore the identification of the primary factors that play important roles in controlling the total mass of pollutant is important in this study the no3 n loss mass in the subsurface flow was higher than that in the surface flow fig 6 additionally the water flow volume was the largest determinant of the no3 n loss mass in the surface flow the relational coefficient of 0 863 while the no3 n loss concentration was in the subsurface flow the relational coefficient of 0 706 table 3 therefore in the control of no3 n loss in vfss the main grass traits should be considered according the major process of no3 n loss above and below ground respectively such as the grass traits that can reduce n concentration rather than reducing water flow should be considered more in the subsurface flow 5 conclusions in this study the responses of water flow and no3 n transport above and below ground to grass specific traits in vfss were investigated for the water flow stem density and root length density had the greatest positive correlations with the surface flow and the subsurface flow respectively while the flexibility of vegetation may weaken the positive effect for the no3 n loss concentration the effect of roots was lower than that of stems as a whole additionally to reduce no3 n loss mass the primary grass traits that can reduce water flow should be considered more in the surface flow and the grass traits that can reduce no3 n loss concentration should be considered more in the subsurface flow this study used a trait based approach to provide new insights for accurately assessing plant impacts on nitrogen transport and retention in vfss further studies with more plant types and longer growth that can cause greater differences in traits are needed for developing accurate methods of plant selection and collocation based on traits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10049,infiltration and evaporation are two important components of soil water balance in semiarid areas for local orchards using drip irrigation rainfall and irrigation events have a profound impact on soil infiltration and evaporation as an effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in semiarid areas the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mulching e g horticultural fabric mulching and corn straw mulching on soil infiltration and evaporation after irrigation and rainfall through field experiments we investigated soil infiltration and evaporation during three wet dry cycles and for a rainy month and studied the effects of mulching on soil physical properties and apple yields the results showed that both horticultural fabric mulching fm and straw mulching sm improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity and that sm had a better effect mulching increased infiltration after irrigation and heavy rain while sm reduced infiltration when light rain occurred regardless of whether the soil was in the energy limited stage or falling rate stage mulching can effectively reduce soil evaporation we determined that the threshold of soil water content swc between the energy limited stage and falling rate stage was 22 09 22 75 when swc is lower than the threshold there is a positive significant correlation between evaporation and swc while no significant correlation was found when it is above the threshold moreover mulching effectively increased apple yields and irrigation water use efficiency iwue for three consecutive years therefore both fm and sm have potential for application in orchards in semiarid areas to improve soil and moisture conditions in the root zone keywords mulching infiltration evaporation soil water orchards yield 1 introduction apple trees are one of the most important perennial fruit trees planted in the loess plateau of china however due to drought and serious soil erosion sustainable development of the apple industry in this region has been seriously affected zhong et al 2019 in recent years the apple industry in shaanxi province has expanded rapidly from semi humid areas to semi arid areas which further aggravates the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources yang et al 2020 therefore maintaining sufficient soil moisture storage is very important for this industry in local apple orchards rainfall is the main source of soil water supplements however due to the characteristics of scarce and uneven rainfall drip irrigation was introduced to supplement soil moisture evaporation and infiltration are two types of soil water movement for maintaining soil water balance in the context of climate change increasing infiltration from precipitation and irrigation and decreasing soil evaporation are therefore of great importance to the sustainability of agriculture in water limited regions li et al 2018 cao et al 2009 water infiltration is an important process of mutual transformation of rainwater irrigation water surface water soil water and groundwater water infiltration is affected by irrigation amounts precipitation characteristics canopy interception capacities and soil hydraulic characteristics khan et al 2016 in general when rainfall occurs due to the low initial soil water content swc a large amount of rainwater infiltrates into the soil and is converted into soil water if the rainfall amount is large as infiltration progresses soil water gradually becomes saturated and the infiltration rate gradually becomes lower than the rainfall intensity rainwater gathers on the soil surface to form surface water and runoff and is ultimately lost furthermore surface runoff causes severe soil degradation and loss of sustainable production through soil erosion and nutrient loss liu et al 2012 2018 prosdocimi et al 2016 under the influence of atmospheric radiant heat soil water evaporates at the soil atmosphere interface however this portion of soil water loss is often regarded as invalid water consumption because it does not participate in biomass formation or yields chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 some scholars have found that when evaporation decreases due to the controlling effect of mulching plant transpiration increases in some field crops singh et al 2011 li et al 2008 in field environments soil water evaporation can be divided into two stages when rainfall or irrigation have just ended swc is high and soil evaporation has nothing to do with swc and is only determined by meteorological factors e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed and air humidity this stage is called energy limited stage during this energy limited stage the soil evaporation rate is relatively constant and occurs at a maximum rate that is limited only by meteorological conditions zribi et al 2015 when swc drops to a certain threshold the energy limited stage ends due to the low swc the ability of soil to transport water upward is weakened which makes it difficult to meet the demand of atmospheric evaporation in the surface layer the evaporation rate depends on the demand for atmospheric evaporation and the ability of soil to transport water upward during this stage the evaporation rate is reduced in proportion to the water available at the soil surface and this stage is called falling rate stage allen et al 1998 as an effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in arid and semiarid areas chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 zribi et al 2015 mulch forms a physical isolation layer on the soil surface which slows down and hinders exchange of water and energy between the soil and atmosphere the effectiveness of mulching for soil evaporation control and increasing infiltration has been documented in some studies li et al 2018 khan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 in addition to the benefits of water conservation previous studies have shown that soil surface mulching was also reported to regulate soil temperature variations olasantan 1999 awe et al 2015 sarkar et al 2007 alter soil microbiology steinmetz et al 2016 carney and matson 2005 improve soil physical properties and soil fertility smets et al 2008 chen et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2013 jord√°n et al 2010 and affect crop growth physiology and ultimately yields and water use efficiency zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 abd el wahed and ali 2013 in our previous study liao et al 2021 we studied the effect of mulching on swc during the whole growth period from 2018 to 2019 and found that mulching effectively increased swc but the reason was not clear infiltration after rainfall and irrigation is the main water replenishment method in this area while evaporation is the main loss method of field soil water we hypothesize that given these processes mulching exerts a great impact on the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac and is different after irrigation and rainfall this is because water can enter the soil directly during irrigation while it must pass through the mulching layer first before reaching the soil during rainfall regardless of whether rain or irrigation has occurred mulching can significantly reduce evaporation because it hinders water and vapor exchange between the soil and atmosphere and reduces the amount of heat radiation reaching the ground however the effects of mulching on soil infiltration are different after irrigation and rainfall because mulching changes the structure of the underlying surface of the field and the mulching itself absorbs water which depends on the mulching material several field experiments were conducted on the control of soil evaporation and regulation of infiltration under mulching respectively however there is a lack of mechanistic research on the effects of mulching on soil evaporation and infiltration after rainfall and irrigation especially for orchards in semiarid areas during the fruit expansion stage late june to late august the swc changed dramatically in the early fruit expansion stage the swc was at the lowest level throughout the growth season due to higher evapotranspiration and less rainfall while in the late fruit expansion stage a large amount of rainfall infiltration will lead to the rapid increase of swc liao et al 2021 both soil evaporation and infiltration at this stage are representative therefore we chose the fruit expansion stage to study the effect of mulching on soil evaporation and infiltration the specific objectives were to 1 study the infiltration and evaporation processes after rainfall and irrigation and the effects of mulching on them 2 analyse the relationship between soil evaporation and soil water content and 3 investigate the effects of mulching on yields and irrigation water use efficiency iwue 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment location the study was carried out from 2018 to 2020 at a modern agriculture apple demonstration orchard located in qingshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m the experimental site is in a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a continental temperate climate with an annual average sunshine duration of over 2543 3 h the annual average temperature is 9 7 c and the annual average frost free period is 170 days the average annual rainfall is 453 mm and more than 60 occurs from july to september the test soil is classified as sandy loam with favourable hydraulic properties gao et al 2018 the mean ph and field capacity Œ∏ f of the one metre soil layer are 8 5 and 0 30 cm3 cm 3 respectively an automated weather station was installed in the orchard to monitor meteorological factors such as precipitation wind velocity wind direction solar radiation atmospheric pressure air temperature and relative air humidity 2 2 experimental design eight year old honeycrisp apple trees malus pumila mill with similar trunk diameters and bark depths were selected as the experimental trees the apple trees were planted in an east west orientation with a row spacing of 3 5 m and plant spacing of 2 m 1429 plants ha 1 each treatment included three rows of apple trees three apple trees in each treatment with similar growth vigour and canopy were selected as the experimental trees four treatments were employed horticultural fabric mulching with drip irrigation fm corn straw mulching with drip irrigation sm clear tillage with drip irrigation tl and clear tillage with rain feeding ck the randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement were adopted in the experiment each treatment was repeated three times fig 1 more specific details of the mulching treatments are provided in our other report liao et al 2021 in april every year tl and ck were cultivated to a tillage depth of 30 cm by a mechanical cultivator while no tillage was implemented for sm and fm other agronomic measures were consistent such as fertilization weeding pruning and insecticide spraying 2 3 irrigation and soil water monitoring according to local soil water consumption rates vertical swc profiles were monitored for an approximately 10 days interval with a trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de at 20 cm intervals over the 80 cm depth soil layer two trim tubes for each treatment were installed at horizontal distances of 40 and 80 cm from the tree row fig 1 the swc for each treatment was the average of the swcs that were measured by the two trim tubes different mulching treatments received the same irrigation amounts and the irrigation amount applied was defined based on the volumetric swc of tl when the swc of tl was lower than the lower irrigation limit 70 Œ∏f irrigation was carried out more specific details on irrigation systems and irrigation events are given in liao et al 2021 from june 27 to the end of august 2020 nearly daily continuous monitoring of swc was carried out to observe swc variations after rain and irrigation and to investigate their relationships with evaporation soil water storage sws is a key component of soil water balance and is defined by the formula 1 1 s w s Œ∏ h here Œ∏ is the mean volumetric soil water content of a specific soil layer it should be noted that in the rainy august some measurements of swc are not carried out on the day of rain or the next day due to the surface water and mud in the field table 4 h is the depth of a specific soil layer mm increased sws Œ¥sws after rain or irrigation can be used to assess infiltration efficiency song et al 2020 and was calculated using the following formula 2 2 Œ¥ sws s w s 1 s w s 0 here sws 1 is soil water storage after rain or irrigation and sws 0 is soil water storage before rain or irrigation 2 4 measurements of soil bulk density and porosity after the apple harvests in 2019 and 2020 soil bulk density porosity capillary porosity and non capillary porosity were measured at 20 cm intervals over the 60 cm depth soil layer using the cutting ring method bao 2007 the soil bulk density and porosity in 2018 were not measured because the orchard ground was just covered in april 2018 which may have little impact on the soil 2 5 monitoring of evaporation soil evaporation was measured by weighing microlysimeters mls at 8 00 every day during fruit expansion late june to late august in 2020 each microlysimeter consisted of an inner cylinder made of pvc pipe and an outer cylinder made of iron sheet the inner cylinder had a diameter of 10 5 cm and height of 19 5 cm and the outer cylinder had a slightly larger size to facilitate the tight installation of the inner cylinder into the outer cylinder a handle was attached to the inner cylinder to facilitate its periodic extraction from the outer cylinder two mls each treatment were installed on both sides of the tree row with a horizontal distance of 60 cm from the tree row of each subplot first on the day after a rain or irrigation event the inner cylinder was inserted into the soil to extract the undisturbed soil and this cylinder was then was packed with gauze at the bottom then it was weighed by a portable balance 0 01 g precision and was placed back into the outer cylinder after that the inner cylinder was weighed at 8 00 each day to measure the amount of evaporation of the previous day long et al 2010 found that if the soil was not replaced within 15 days the accuracy of soil evaporation was still high therefore the mls were renewed with undisturbed soil after the next rain greater than 10 mm or irrigation or use for more than 15 days moreover for the mulching treatments the mls were covered by the mulching layer in the sm treatment a 20 cm by 20 cm metal screen was placed on the top of the mls to prevent straw debris from falling into the mls this process was followed during three wet dry cycles 27 june irrigation 15 3 mm 7 july 9 july one day after rainfall 17 5 mm 19 july and 20 july one day after irrigation 17 2 mm to 29 july due to the high frequency high magnitude rainfall in august it was difficult to measure swc and soil evaporation when rainfall amounts were large therefore in august there were no long term continuous observations of soil moisture content and soil evaporation in order to eliminate the influence of climate conditions and canopy shading on soil evaporation we introduced the relative evaporation rate er under the trees which was calculated using the following formula 3 3 e r e e p a n here e is soil evaporation measured by mls and e pan is the water

soil bulk density and porosity in the second 2019 and third 2020 years of the experiment the soil bulk density of the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly reduced by mulching especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer and there were no significant differences between the two years fig 2 with increasing soil depth the soil bulk density first increased and then decreased with a minimum at 0 20 cm and maximum at 20 40 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm in the two years were 1 32 g cm3 and 1 28 g cm3 which were 3 1 and 6 4 lower than that of tl 1 36 g cm3 respectively in the 20 40 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm in the two years were 1 44 g cm3 and 1 45 g cm3 which were 2 7 and 2 5 lower than that of tl 1 48 g cm3 respectively the soil bulk density in the 0 40 cm layer of sm was significantly lower than that of fm except in the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2020 in the 0 40 cm soil layer capillary porosity non capillary porosity and total porosity were increased significantly by mulching in the two years fig 2 in contrast to soil bulk density with increasing soil depth the porosity first decreased and then increased with a minimum at 20 40 cm and maximum at 0 20 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean soil porosities of fm and sm in the two years were 43 17 and 45 83 respectively which were 4 5 and 10 9 higher than that of tl 41 33 in the 20 40 cm soil layer the mean soil porosities of fm and sm of the two years were 39 6 and 40 4 which were 5 0 and 7 0 higher than that of tl 37 72 respectively in the 0 20 cm soil layer sm soil porosity was significantly higher than fm soil porosity however there was no significant difference in the 20 40 cm soil layer regardless of the soil bulk density or porosity no significant difference was observed in the 40 60 cm soil layer under the different tillage practices there were no significant differences in porosity or soil bulk density under irrigation in the two years and no significant difference was observed between tl and ck 3 2 variations in soil water after irrigation and rain the meteorological factors in the three wet dry cycles were generally the same table 1 fig 3 shows the variations in swc of the three tillage practices at different soil depths after rain or irrigation after irrigation the swc of the 0 40 cm soil layer increased rapidly and then gradually returned to a lower level the increase in swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer was greater than that in the 20 40 cm soil layer which was related to water replenishment in the upper soil that occurred first after rainfall or irrigation in the sm and fm treatments the swc of the 40 60 cm soil layer also increased but there was no similar increase in the tl treatment the swc of the 60 80 cm soil layer did not change after irrigation and showed a gradually decreasing trend in july when irrigation occurred we found that the increase in soil water storage sws was higher than the irrigation amount table 2 which could be due to accumulation of water around the emitters after irrigation in the fm and sm treatments the increased sws was higher than that in the tl treatment table 3 the increase in sws was always lower than rainfall due to canopy interception surface runoff and soil evaporation after the rain on 8 july the tl treatment 15 04 mm exhibited the greatest increase in sws while the lowest increase occurred in the sm treatment 12 80 mm in addition some small rainfall amounts occurred during the three cycles when the rainfall was greater than 4 mm the swc of the 0 20 cm soil layers in tl and fm increased slightly while sm only increased when larger rainfall occurred 7 8 mm on 25 july during the three cycles fig 4 and fig 5 the high frequency high magnitude rainfall that occurred in august had a great impact on swc especially the continuous rainfall from august 4 to august 6 fig 6 and table 4 a total of 135 8 mm of rain fell from august 4 to august 6 which led to a sharp increase in swc and the increased sws of sm 91 1 mm was higher than those of tl 61 3 mm and fm 78 6 mm after another large continuous rainfall event rainfall of 41 4 mm from 16 aug to 18 aug the same trend was present and the increased sws exhibited a trend of sm 34 9 mm fm 31 9 mm tl 26 7 mm however when the rainfall amounts were small sm always exhibited the smallest sws increment table 4 after rainfall in august the swc of the 0 20 cm soil layer under the three tillage practices significantly improved and no significant differences appeared among them fig 6 however in the deeper soil layer 80 cm significantly more water recharge occurred in the two mulching treatments 3 3 variations of evaporation after irrigation or rain we analysed the relationship between soil evaporation and swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer the relative evaporation rate was introduced to eliminate the influence of meteorological factors and canopy shading on soil evaporation fig 5 shows the relationship between the relative soil evaporation rate and swc in the three wet dry cycles thresholds of swc between two evaporation stages were found in the process of soil evaporation the thresholds for tl fm and sm were 22 09 22 75 and 22 52 respectively when the swc was above the threshold the relative soil evaporation changed little with swc and there was no significant correlation between them at this time soil evaporation is in the energy limited stage however when the swc was below the threshold the relative soil evaporation rate decreased linearly with the decrease in swc and extremely significant correlations were found in both the bare soil and mulching treatments at this time soil evaporation is in the falling rate stage due to rainfall recharge the swc was above the threshold on the date we monitored in august and no significant correlation was found between the relative evaporation rate and swc fig 7 this was consistent with the results in the energy limited stage in the three wet dry cycles despite some differences the same soil evaporation pattern occurred in the three wet dry cycles in the early stage of the wet dry cycle under the same treatment the soil evaporation rate was basically the same and the cumulative soil evaporation increased steadily energy limited stage fig 4 in the later stage of the wet dry cycle evaporation gradually decreased as the soil inside the ml dried out and the cumulative soil evaporation levelled off falling rate stage several rainfall events more than 4 mm in the three wet dry cycles affected soil evaporation and even led to negative values which were manually adjusted to 0 in the calculations of cumulative evaporation these values were due to raindrops falling into the mls which resulted in increased ml weights in the energy limited stage mulching significantly reduced soil evaporation in the three wet dry cycles compared with bare soil the mean evaporation rates decreased by approximately 35 and 48 in the fm and sm treatments respectively table 3 in the rainy august compared with tl the mean evaporation rates decreased by approximately 40 and 77 in the fm and sm treatments respectively inserted table in fig 7 in the falling rate stage sm reduced evaporation rates by 34 relative to tl while no significant differences were found between tl and fm sm significantly reduced cumulative evaporation in all three wet dry cycles however fm significantly reduced cumulative evaporation only in the first cycle even if there were differences in the latter two cycles the mean cumulative evaporation amounts for fm and sm in the three wet dry cycles were 9 0 mm and 6 8 mm respectively which were 14 and 35 lower respectively than that of tl 10 5 mm 3 4 yield and iwue in 2018 2019 and 2020 116 4 mm 120 3 mm and 137 1 mm irrigation were applied respectively table 5 due to the impact of covid 19 irrigation was carried out from late april in 2020 instead of starting in early april the beginning of the growth season like the other two years yields varied significantly among different years table 6 the lowest yield was present in 2018 due to the occurrence of a severe frost which caused many flowers to be damaged yields under the irrigation treatments were significantly higher than those under rain feeding ck and mulching effectively increased yields compared with tl the three year average yields indicated that yields improved by 24 1 and 20 6 respectively in fm 34 7 t ha 1 and sm 33 7 t ha 1 compared with tl 27 9 t ha 1 simultaneously mulching significantly increased iwues compared with tl the three year average iwue improved by 111 3 and 96 3 in fm and sm respectively 4 discussion soil bulk density and soil porosity are two key factors for good soil structure these two factors directly affect the aeration and permeability of soil water retention and migration and the difficulty of root penetration capillary pores store capillary water which is easily absorbed by crop roots and is used for crop transpiration and growth soil detained water is stored within non capillary pores and has the potential to supplement capillary water when needed liu et al 2013 our study found that mulching effectively reduced soil bulk densities and increased soil porosities both capillary and non capillary in the 0 40 cm soil layer these results demonstrated that the soil structure of orchards can be substantially improved by mulching similar results were observed in kahlon et al 2013 and ≈ºelazny licznar ma≈Ça≈Ñczuk 2018 moreover soil bulk density presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with increasing soil depth while soil porosity showed the opposite trend the highest soil bulk density and lowest soil porosity occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer this may have been caused by the plough pan that was formed due to long term tillage which was consistent with the results of gao et al 2010 under the effects of tillage and raindrops aggregates with porous and permeable properties are easily broken le bissonnais et al 2005 reported that under intense rainfall both slaking and raindrop impacts will break down dry soil aggregates broken soil aggregates are easily eroded by wind and water on the soil surface and settle under the effect of gravity when rainfall occurs surface seals are often formed on the soil surface rahma et al 2017 which increase soil bulk density and reduce the hydraulic properties of soil this can be ascribed to compaction due to raindrop impact and washed in smaller soil particles plug partial pores in the surface formation of a surface seal significantly decreases the infiltrability of soil when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate surface ponds and runoff will be produced horticultural fabric and straw form a protective layer on the soil surface which can reduce the impact of raindrops and protect the soil from water and wind erosion in addition straw gradually decomposes into organic matter which aids the formation of soil aggregates these factors were conducive to the formation of a good soil structure and avoid formation of surface seal in this study when irrigation took place both fm and sm effectively increased soil infiltration relative to tl which can be attributed to two factors the first is that good soil structure increased the vertical infiltration of irrigation water another explanation is that mulching covered the wetted soil surface and reduced evaporation however some differences existed in infiltration after rain between fm and sm both fm and sm greatly increased soil infiltration relative to tl when heavy rain occurred and sm had a better effect when light rain occurred no significant differences were found between tl and fm while sm always reduced infiltration in comparison to tl horticultural fabric is a woven permeable polyethylene material straw itself forms a rainfall collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface liao et al 2021 therefore when light rain occurs 10 cm thick straw mulch absorbs part of the rainfall and loses it through evaporation even so when heavy rain occurs straw can promote soil infiltration by increasing the roughness and tortuosity of flow paths and thus reduce flow velocities rahma et al 2017 prosdocimi et al 2016 reported that the formation of surface ponds and runoff was effectively delayed and prevented by straw mulch similar results were observed in liu et al 2012 who reported that runoff and nutrient losses were effectively controlled by straw mulch when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the absorption capability of straw provides additional pathways for water infiltration li et al 2011 this water trapped in straw will gradually be released over several days and result in increased infiltration liu et al 2014 in our study very low or even negative soil evaporation under sm in august can also prove this point because this trapped water was released into the mls which resulted in increased water in the mls fig 7 rainfall is the most important soil water supply source for orchards on the loess plateau when it rains rainfall first infiltrates the surface soil and large gradients in the gravitational potential and matrix potential in the vertical direction are formed water will continue to penetrate downwards until the wetting front stops moving and the water compensation depth reaches a maximum value in our research irrigation increased swc in the 40 60 cm soil layer under fm and sm however no similar increase was found in tl based on this result we can infer that mulching can effectively promote water compensation in deeper soil layers this is also reflected during the high frequency high magnitude rainfall in august where significantly more water recharge occurred in deeper soil 60 80 cm in the two mulching treatments song et al 2020 also observed similar results this could be because i thick plough pans and low porosity under the tl treatment are not conducive to water infiltration ii the sm and fm treatments have higher swcs than tl in the upper soil so a larger water potential gradient between the upper soil and deeper soil will form after rainfall and irrigation which can promote downward transmission of water and iii more water evaporates in the tl treatment soil evaporation is affected by meteorological factors canopy shading and swc we measured the leaf area index in the three wet dry cycles and there were no significant differences among the three treatments table 2 when soil is wet the soil water at the soil atmosphere interface evaporates due to heat from solar radiation which leads to a decrease in soil water potential at the soil atmosphere interface under the action of capillary forces soil water moves from the underlying soil with higher water potential to the soil atmosphere interface liu et al 2008 mulching on the soil surface forms an insulating layer which can effectively slow down and hinder the exchange of water and energy by preventing solar radiation heat from directly reaching the soil surface in our study both fm and sm significantly reduced soil evaporation rates in the energy limited stage and sm had a better effect in the falling rate stage sm still reduced soil evaporation compared with tl even if the reduction was lower than that in the energy limited stage while fm did not it was speculated that this may be due to the higher swc of fm in the falling rate stage this finding contrasts with that of zribi et al 2015 who found that mulching did not significantly reduce soil evaporation in the falling rate stage this could be because their research monitored the wet dry cycle for a longer period 30 days so the soil evaporation rate was very low in the falling rate stage for all treatments at the same time the accuracy of evaporation measurements over a longer time without renewing undisturbed soil in the field experiments should also be considered we noticed that in the energy limited stage the soil evaporation rate under sm in august 0 32 mm d was significantly lower than that in the three wet dry cycles 1 11 mm d inserted table in fig 7 and table 3 this may be because high frequency high magnitude rainfall caused the straw to be soaked with water which greatly hindered the exchange of water and vapor between the soil and atmosphere simultaneously when water that soaks the straw evaporates it absorbs large amounts of heat and reduces surface soil temperatures in addition we analysed the relationship between the relative evaporation rate and surface swc and found the existence of a threshold of swc 22 09 22 75 between the energy limited stage and falling rate stage in a similar study sun et al 2012 reported that evaporation dropped to very low levels when the swc of the soil surface decreased zribi et al 2015 found that soil evaporation and swc were positively and linearly correlated because most observations pertain to the falling rate stage of soil evaporation yields are affected by many factors and soil water is a key limiting factor on the loess plateau combining mulching with irrigation can increase water inputs to compensate for water deficits caused by insufficient rainfall and on the other hand it can effectively maintain soil moisture by reducing evaporation and promoting infiltration in this study irrigation effectively increased yields for three consecutive years and mulching accentuated this trend moreover compared with tl mulching greatly improved iwue this finding was also reported by zhang et al 2014 due to the contradiction between water supply and consumption deficit irrigation has been widely studied for optimizing water application some scholars have studied applying a combination of mulching and deficit irrigation in semiarid areas and have reported improvements in yields and water use efficiency yang et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 sokalska et al 2009 reported that in the apple orchards with drip irrigation system more than 92 3 of the fine roots of mature apple trees are distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer and more than 76 7 of the fine roots are distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer however in our study after irrigation only 0 40 cm soil layer greatly increased sws while sws of 40 80 cm soil layer increased little in order to make irrigation water infiltration deeper and directly transport to the roots surge root irrigation was invented wu et al 2010 and some scholars reported its applicability in semi arid orchards dai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 the rainfall in july 2020 45 1 mm was much lower than the average rainfall 98 0 mm in july from 1971 to 2020 while the rainfall in august 271 2 mm was much higher than the average rainfall in august 101 4 mm however this rare rainfall distribution provides a good opportunity for our experiment to observe water infiltration and evaporation under different rainfall conditions on the other hand the two irrigation events we chose are representative because the irrigation amounts in each irrigation event were nearly the same 11 9 17 4 mm in the three years in this study corn straw and horticultural fabric were selected as mulching materials corn is widely planted in local areas so it is inexpensive and can be widely used however straw mulching is more dispersed and it can easily drift when it is windy or rainy so we added a nylon net to stabilize it it should be noted that in august soil evaporation was very low even negative this may mean that the soaked straw mulch reduce soil air permeability and is not conducive to crop root respiration rahma et al 2017 reported that in extreme rainfall events the use of straw mulching with high mulching rates on sloping land may more easily induce soil loss therefore we do not recommend the use of straw mulch with high mulching rates in farmland in rain rich areas especially on sloping land but it can be used to restore soil water storage for flat land compared with plastic film horticultural fabric has a longer service life with the same low price in our research in the three year test only the edges of the horticultural fabric were slightly damaged so it can also effectively minimise plastic pollution moreover application of straw mulching and horticultural fabric mulching does not have a high demand for labour taken together both fm and sm have potential for application in orchards in semiarid areas to improve soil and moisture conditions in the root zone in addition we agree with zribi et al 2015 that mulching would be more beneficial in high frequency irrigation systems with wet soil surfaces most of the time than in low frequency irrigation systems because mulching has a better evaporation control effect on wet soil surfaces on the loess plateau in the water cycle of fields infiltration after irrigation or rainfall is the most important method of water input and evaporation and transpiration are the main methods of water consumption through field experiments we studied infiltration and evaporation after irrigation and rainfall however further research on transpiration is needed to understand the complete water cycle of fields in addition mulching greatly changes the soil environment in root zones and roots are the main tissue for plants to absorb water and nutrients therefore to explain crop responses more research is required on roots 5 conclusion the results of this study show that mulching with no tillage effectively improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity in the 0 40 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm were 2 8 and 4 5 lower than tl and the mean porosity were 4 7 and 9 0 higher than tl by changing the structure of the underlying surface of the field mulching increased infiltration after irrigation and heavy rain due to water absorption by the straw layer straw mulching reduced infiltration when light rain occurred regardless of whether the soil is in the energy limited stage or falling rate stage mulching can effectively reduce soil evaporation and straw mulching has a better effect in the energy limited stage evaporation and soil moisture content showed a very significant linear relationship but in the falling rate stage there was no significant correlation between them in august because the straw was soaked with water soil evaporation was extremely low and even negative which may affect soil permeability therefore we do not recommend the use of straw mulch with a high mulching rate in farmlands in rain rich areas mulching has a better evaporation control effect on wet soil surfaces therefore mulching would be more beneficial in high frequency irrigation systems from the perspective of inhibiting evaporation in three consecutive years mulching effectively increased apple yields and iwue the three year average yields indicated that yields improved by 24 1 and 20 6 respectively in fm and sm compared with tl however to understand the complete water cycle of the fields further research is needed on transpiration in addition more research is required on roots to explain the response of crops to mulching declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10049,infiltration and evaporation are two important components of soil water balance in semiarid areas for local orchards using drip irrigation rainfall and irrigation events have a profound impact on soil infiltration and evaporation as an effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in semiarid areas the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mulching e g horticultural fabric mulching and corn straw mulching on soil infiltration and evaporation after irrigation and rainfall through field experiments we investigated soil infiltration and evaporation during three wet dry cycles and for a rainy month and studied the effects of mulching on soil physical properties and apple yields the results showed that both horticultural fabric mulching fm and straw mulching sm improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity and that sm had a better effect mulching increased infiltration after irrigation and heavy rain while sm reduced infiltration when light rain occurred regardless of whether the soil was in the energy limited stage or falling rate stage mulching can effectively reduce soil evaporation we determined that the threshold of soil water content swc between the energy limited stage and falling rate stage was 22 09 22 75 when swc is lower than the threshold there is a positive significant correlation between evaporation and swc while no significant correlation was found when it is above the threshold moreover mulching effectively increased apple yields and irrigation water use efficiency iwue for three consecutive years therefore both fm and sm have potential for application in orchards in semiarid areas to improve soil and moisture conditions in the root zone keywords mulching infiltration evaporation soil water orchards yield 1 introduction apple trees are one of the most important perennial fruit trees planted in the loess plateau of china however due to drought and serious soil erosion sustainable development of the apple industry in this region has been seriously affected zhong et al 2019 in recent years the apple industry in shaanxi province has expanded rapidly from semi humid areas to semi arid areas which further aggravates the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources yang et al 2020 therefore maintaining sufficient soil moisture storage is very important for this industry in local apple orchards rainfall is the main source of soil water supplements however due to the characteristics of scarce and uneven rainfall drip irrigation was introduced to supplement soil moisture evaporation and infiltration are two types of soil water movement for maintaining soil water balance in the context of climate change increasing infiltration from precipitation and irrigation and decreasing soil evaporation are therefore of great importance to the sustainability of agriculture in water limited regions li et al 2018 cao et al 2009 water infiltration is an important process of mutual transformation of rainwater irrigation water surface water soil water and groundwater water infiltration is affected by irrigation amounts precipitation characteristics canopy interception capacities and soil hydraulic characteristics khan et al 2016 in general when rainfall occurs due to the low initial soil water content swc a large amount of rainwater infiltrates into the soil and is converted into soil water if the rainfall amount is large as infiltration progresses soil water gradually becomes saturated and the infiltration rate gradually becomes lower than the rainfall intensity rainwater gathers on the soil surface to form surface water and runoff and is ultimately lost furthermore surface runoff causes severe soil degradation and loss of sustainable production through soil erosion and nutrient loss liu et al 2012 2018 prosdocimi et al 2016 under the influence of atmospheric radiant heat soil water evaporates at the soil atmosphere interface however this portion of soil water loss is often regarded as invalid water consumption because it does not participate in biomass formation or yields chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 some scholars have found that when evaporation decreases due to the controlling effect of mulching plant transpiration increases in some field crops singh et al 2011 li et al 2008 in field environments soil water evaporation can be divided into two stages when rainfall or irrigation have just ended swc is high and soil evaporation has nothing to do with swc and is only determined by meteorological factors e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed and air humidity this stage is called energy limited stage during this energy limited stage the soil evaporation rate is relatively constant and occurs at a maximum rate that is limited only by meteorological conditions zribi et al 2015 when swc drops to a certain threshold the energy limited stage ends due to the low swc the ability of soil to transport water upward is weakened which makes it difficult to meet the demand of atmospheric evaporation in the surface layer the evaporation rate depends on the demand for atmospheric evaporation and the ability of soil to transport water upward during this stage the evaporation rate is reduced in proportion to the water available at the soil surface and this stage is called falling rate stage allen et al 1998 as an effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in arid and semiarid areas chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 zribi et al 2015 mulch forms a physical isolation layer on the soil surface which slows down and hinders exchange of water and energy between the soil and atmosphere the effectiveness of mulching for soil evaporation control and increasing infiltration has been documented in some studies li et al 2018 khan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 in addition to the benefits of water conservation previous studies have shown that soil surface mulching was also reported to regulate soil temperature variations olasantan 1999 awe et al 2015 sarkar et al 2007 alter soil microbiology steinmetz et al 2016 carney and matson 2005 improve soil physical properties and soil fertility smets et al 2008 chen et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2013 jord√°n et al 2010 and affect crop growth physiology and ultimately yields and water use efficiency zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 abd el wahed and ali 2013 in our previous study liao et al 2021 we studied the effect of mulching on swc during the whole growth period from 2018 to 2019 and found that mulching effectively increased swc but the reason was not clear infiltration after rainfall and irrigation is the main water replenishment method in this area while evaporation is the main loss method of field soil water we hypothesize that given these processes mulching exerts a great impact on the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac and is different after irrigation and rainfall this is because water can enter the soil directly during irrigation while it must pass through the mulching layer first before reaching the soil during rainfall regardless of whether rain or irrigation has occurred mulching can significantly reduce evaporation because it hinders water and vapor exchange between the soil and atmosphere and reduces the amount of heat radiation reaching the ground however the effects of mulching on soil infiltration are different after irrigation and rainfall because mulching changes the structure of the underlying surface of the field and the mulching itself absorbs water which depends on the mulching material several field experiments were conducted on the control of soil evaporation and regulation of infiltration under mulching respectively however there is a lack of mechanistic research on the effects of mulching on soil evaporation and infiltration after rainfall and irrigation especially for orchards in semiarid areas during the fruit expansion stage late june to late august the swc changed dramatically in the early fruit expansion stage the swc was at the lowest level throughout the growth season due to higher evapotranspiration and less rainfall while in the late fruit expansion stage a large amount of rainfall infiltration will lead to the rapid increase of swc liao et al 2021 both soil evaporation and infiltration at this stage are representative therefore we chose the fruit expansion stage to study the effect of mulching on soil evaporation and infiltration the specific objectives were to 1 study the infiltration and evaporation processes after rainfall and irrigation and the effects of mulching on them 2 analyse the relationship between soil evaporation and soil water content and 3 investigate the effects of mulching on yields and irrigation water use efficiency iwue 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment location the study was carried out from 2018 to 2020 at a modern agriculture apple demonstration orchard located in qingshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m the experimental site is in a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a continental temperate climate with an annual average sunshine duration of over 2543 3 h the annual average temperature is 9 7 c and the annual average frost free period is 170 days the average annual rainfall is 453 mm and more than 60 occurs from july to september the test soil is classified as sandy loam with favourable hydraulic properties gao et

spacing of 2 m 1429 plants ha 1 each treatment included three rows of apple trees three apple trees in each treatment with similar growth vigour and canopy were selected as the experimental trees four treatments were employed horticultural fabric mulching with drip irrigation fm corn straw mulching with drip irrigation sm clear tillage with drip irrigation tl and clear tillage with rain feeding ck the randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement were adopted in the experiment each treatment was repeated three times fig 1 more specific details of the mulching treatments are provided in our other report liao et al 2021 in april every year tl and ck were cultivated to a tillage depth of 30 cm by a mechanical cultivator while no tillage was implemented for sm and fm other agronomic measures were consistent such as fertilization weeding pruning and insecticide spraying 2 3 irrigation and soil water monitoring according to local soil water consumption rates vertical swc profiles were monitored for an approximately 10 days interval with a trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de at 20 cm intervals over the 80 cm depth soil layer two trim tubes for each treatment were installed at horizontal distances of 40 and 80 cm from the tree row fig 1 the swc for each treatment was the average of the swcs that were measured by the two trim tubes different mulching treatments received the same irrigation amounts and the irrigation amount applied was defined based on the volumetric swc of tl when the swc of tl was lower than the lower irrigation limit 70 Œ∏f irrigation was carried out more specific details on irrigation systems and irrigation events are given in liao et al 2021 from june 27 to the end of august 2020 nearly daily continuous monitoring of swc was carried out to observe swc variations after rain and irrigation and to investigate their relationships with evaporation soil water storage sws is a key component of soil water balance and is defined by the formula 1 1 s w s Œ∏ h here Œ∏ is the mean volumetric soil water content of a specific soil layer it should be noted that in the rainy august some measurements of swc are not carried out on the day of

at 20 cm intervals over the 60 cm depth soil layer using the cutting ring method bao 2007 the soil bulk density and porosity in 2018 were not measured because the orchard ground was just covered in april 2018 which may have little impact on the soil 2 5 monitoring of evaporation soil evaporation was measured by weighing microlysimeters mls at 8 00 every day during fruit expansion late june to late august in 2020 each microlysimeter consisted of an inner cylinder made of pvc pipe and an outer cylinder made of iron sheet the inner cylinder had a diameter of 10 5 cm and height of 19 5 cm and the outer cylinder had a slightly larger size to facilitate the tight installation of the inner cylinder into the outer cylinder a handle was attached to the inner cylinder to facilitate its periodic extraction from the outer cylinder two mls each treatment were installed on both sides of the tree row with a horizontal distance of 60 cm from the tree row of each subplot first on the day after a rain or irrigation event the inner cylinder was inserted into the soil to extract the undisturbed soil and this cylinder was then was packed with gauze at the bottom then it was weighed by a portable balance 0 01 g precision and was placed back into the outer cylinder after that the inner cylinder was weighed at 8 00 each day to measure the amount of evaporation of the previous day long et al 2010 found that if the soil was not replaced within 15 days the accuracy of soil evaporation was still high therefore the mls were renewed with undisturbed soil after the next rain greater than 10 mm or irrigation or use for more than 15 days moreover for the mulching treatments the mls were covered by the mulching layer in the sm treatment a 20 cm by 20 cm metal screen was placed on the top of the mls to prevent straw debris from falling into the mls this process was followed during three wet dry cycles 27 june irrigation 15 3 mm 7 july 9 july one day after rainfall 17 5 mm 19 july and 20 july one day after irrigation 17 2 mm to 29 july due to the high frequency high magnitude rainfall in august it was difficult to measure swc and soil evaporation when rainfall amounts were large therefore in august there were no long term continuous observations of soil moisture content and soil evaporation in order to eliminate the influence of climate conditions and canopy shading on soil evaporation we introduced the relative evaporation rate er under the trees which was calculated using the following formula 3 3 e r e e p a n here e is soil evaporation measured by mls and e pan is the water surface evaporation measured by two standard 20 cm diameter evaporation pans that were installed on both sides of the tree row at 60 cm horizontal distances from the tree rows more details on

soil bulk density and porosity in the second 2019 and third 2020 years of the experiment the soil bulk density of the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly reduced by mulching especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer and there were no significant differences between the two years fig 2 with increasing soil depth the soil bulk density first increased and then decreased with a minimum at 0 20 cm and maximum at 20 40 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm in the two years were 1 32 g cm3 and 1 28 g cm3 which were 3 1 and 6 4 lower than that of tl 1 36 g cm3 respectively in the 20 40 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm in the two years were 1 44 g cm3 and 1 45 g cm3 which were 2 7 and 2 5 lower than that of tl 1 48 g cm3 respectively the soil bulk density in the 0 40 cm layer of sm was significantly lower than that of fm except in the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2020 in the 0 40 cm soil layer capillary porosity non capillary porosity and total porosity were increased significantly by mulching in the two years fig 2 in contrast to soil bulk density with increasing soil depth the porosity first decreased and then increased with a minimum at 20 40 cm and maximum at 0 20 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean soil porosities of fm and sm in the two years were 43 17 and 45 83 respectively which were 4 5 and 10 9 higher than that of tl 41 33 in the 20 40 cm soil layer the mean soil porosities of fm and sm of the two years were 39 6 and 40 4 which were 5 0 and 7 0 higher than that of tl 37 72 respectively in the 0 20 cm soil layer sm soil porosity was significantly higher than fm soil porosity however there was no significant difference in the 20 40 cm soil layer regardless of the soil bulk density or porosity no significant difference was observed in the 40 60 cm soil layer under the different tillage practices there were no significant differences in porosity or soil bulk density under irrigation in the two years and no significant difference was observed between tl and ck 3 2 variations in soil water after irrigation and rain the meteorological factors in the three wet dry cycles were generally the same table 1 fig 3 shows the variations in swc of the three tillage practices at different soil depths after rain or irrigation after irrigation the swc of the 0 40 cm soil layer increased rapidly and then gradually returned to a lower level the increase in swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer was greater than that in the 20 40 cm soil layer which was related to water replenishment in the upper soil that occurred first after rainfall or irrigation in the sm and fm treatments the swc of the 40 60 cm soil layer also increased but there was no similar increase in the tl treatment the swc of the 60 80 cm soil layer did not change after irrigation and showed a gradually decreasing trend in july when irrigation occurred we found that the increase in soil water storage sws was higher than the irrigation amount table 2 which could be due to accumulation of water around the emitters after irrigation in the fm and sm treatments the increased sws was higher than that in the tl treatment table 3 the increase in sws was always lower than rainfall due to canopy interception surface runoff and soil evaporation after the rain on 8 july the tl treatment 15 04 mm exhibited the greatest increase in sws while the lowest increase occurred in the sm treatment 12 80 mm in addition some small rainfall amounts occurred during the three cycles when the rainfall was greater than 4 mm the swc of the 0 20 cm soil layers in tl and fm increased slightly while sm only increased when larger rainfall occurred 7 8 mm on 25 july during the three cycles fig 4 and fig 5 the high frequency high magnitude rainfall that occurred in august had a great impact on swc especially the continuous rainfall from august 4 to august 6 fig 6 and table 4 a total of 135 8 mm of rain fell from august 4 to august 6 which led to a sharp increase in swc and the increased sws of sm 91 1 mm was higher than those of tl 61 3 mm and fm 78 6 mm after another large continuous rainfall event rainfall of 41 4 mm from 16 aug to 18 aug the same trend was present and the increased sws exhibited a trend of sm 34 9 mm fm 31 9 mm tl 26 7 mm however when the rainfall amounts were small sm always exhibited the smallest sws increment table 4 after rainfall in august the swc of the 0 20 cm soil layer under the three tillage practices significantly improved and no significant differences appeared among them fig 6 however in the deeper soil layer 80 cm significantly more water recharge occurred in the two mulching treatments 3 3 variations of evaporation after irrigation or rain we analysed the relationship between soil evaporation and swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer the relative evaporation rate was introduced to eliminate the influence of meteorological factors and canopy shading on soil evaporation fig 5 shows the relationship between the relative soil evaporation rate and swc in the three wet dry cycles thresholds of swc between two evaporation stages were found in the process of soil evaporation the thresholds for tl fm and sm were 22 09 22 75 and 22 52 respectively when the swc was above the threshold the relative soil evaporation changed little with swc and there was no significant correlation between them at this time soil evaporation is in the energy limited stage however when the swc was below the threshold the relative soil evaporation rate decreased linearly with the decrease in swc and extremely significant correlations were found in both the bare soil and mulching treatments at this time soil evaporation is in the falling rate stage due to rainfall recharge the swc was above the threshold on the date we monitored in august and no significant correlation was found between the relative evaporation rate and swc fig 7 this was consistent with the results in the energy limited stage in the three wet dry cycles despite some differences the same soil evaporation pattern occurred in the three wet dry cycles in the early stage of the wet dry cycle under the same treatment the soil evaporation rate was basically the same and the cumulative soil evaporation increased steadily energy limited stage fig 4 in the later stage of the wet dry cycle evaporation gradually decreased as the soil inside the ml dried out and the cumulative soil evaporation levelled off falling rate stage several rainfall events more than 4 mm in the three wet dry cycles affected soil evaporation and even led to negative values which were manually adjusted to 0 in the calculations of cumulative evaporation these values were due to raindrops falling into the mls which resulted in increased ml weights in the energy limited stage mulching significantly reduced soil evaporation in the three wet dry cycles compared with bare soil the mean evaporation rates decreased by approximately 35 and 48 in the fm and sm treatments respectively table 3 in the rainy august compared with tl the mean evaporation rates decreased by approximately 40 and 77 in the fm and sm treatments respectively inserted table in fig 7 in the falling rate stage sm reduced evaporation rates by 34 relative to tl while no significant differences were found between tl and fm sm significantly reduced cumulative evaporation in all three wet dry cycles however fm significantly reduced cumulative evaporation only in the first cycle even if there were differences in the latter two cycles the mean cumulative evaporation amounts for fm and sm in the three wet dry cycles were 9 0 mm and 6 8 mm respectively which were 14 and 35 lower respectively than that of tl 10 5 mm 3 4 yield and iwue in 2018 2019 and 2020 116 4 mm 120 3 mm and 137 1 mm irrigation were applied respectively table 5 due to the impact of covid 19 irrigation was carried out from late april in 2020 instead of starting in early april the beginning of the growth season like the other two years yields varied significantly among different years table 6 the lowest yield was present in 2018 due to the occurrence of a severe frost which caused many flowers to be damaged yields under the irrigation treatments were significantly higher than those under rain feeding ck and mulching effectively increased yields compared with tl the three year average yields indicated that yields improved by 24 1 and 20 6 respectively in fm 34 7 t ha 1 and sm 33 7 t ha 1 compared with tl 27 9 t ha 1 simultaneously mulching significantly increased iwues compared with tl the three year average iwue improved by 111 3 and 96 3 in fm and sm respectively 4 discussion soil bulk density and soil porosity are two key factors for good soil structure these two factors directly affect the aeration and permeability of soil water retention and migration and the difficulty of root penetration capillary pores store capillary water which is easily absorbed by crop roots and is used for crop transpiration and growth soil detained water is stored within non capillary pores and has the potential to supplement capillary water when needed liu et al 2013 our study found that mulching effectively reduced soil bulk densities and increased soil porosities both capillary and non capillary in the 0 40 cm soil layer these results demonstrated that the soil structure of orchards can be substantially improved by mulching similar results were observed in kahlon et al 2013 and ≈ºelazny licznar ma≈Ça≈Ñczuk 2018 moreover soil bulk density presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with increasing soil depth while soil porosity showed the opposite trend the highest soil bulk density and lowest soil porosity occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer this may have been caused by the plough pan that was formed due to long term tillage which was consistent with the results of gao et al 2010 under the effects of tillage and raindrops aggregates with porous and permeable properties are easily broken le bissonnais et al 2005 reported that under intense rainfall both slaking and raindrop impacts will break down dry soil aggregates broken soil aggregates are easily eroded by wind and water on the soil surface and settle under the effect of gravity when rainfall occurs surface seals are often formed on the soil surface rahma et al 2017 which increase soil bulk density and reduce the hydraulic properties of soil this can be ascribed to compaction due to raindrop impact and washed in smaller soil particles plug partial pores in the surface formation of a surface seal significantly decreases the infiltrability of soil when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate surface ponds and runoff will be produced horticultural fabric and straw form a protective layer on the soil surface which can reduce the impact of raindrops and protect the soil from water and wind erosion in addition straw gradually decomposes into organic matter which aids the formation of soil aggregates these factors were conducive to the formation of a good soil structure and avoid formation of surface seal in this study when irrigation took place both fm and sm effectively increased soil infiltration relative to tl which can be attributed to two factors the first is that good soil structure increased the vertical infiltration of irrigation water another explanation is that mulching covered the wetted soil surface and reduced evaporation however some differences existed in infiltration after rain between fm and sm both fm and sm greatly increased soil infiltration relative to tl when heavy rain occurred and sm had a better effect when light rain occurred no significant differences were found between tl and fm while sm always reduced infiltration in comparison to tl horticultural fabric is a woven permeable polyethylene material straw itself forms a rainfall collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface liao et al 2021 therefore when light rain occurs 10 cm thick straw mulch absorbs part of the rainfall and loses it through evaporation even so when heavy rain occurs straw can promote soil infiltration by increasing the roughness and tortuosity of flow paths and thus reduce flow velocities rahma et al 2017 prosdocimi et al 2016 reported that the formation of surface ponds and runoff was effectively delayed and prevented by straw mulch similar results were observed in liu et al 2012 who reported that runoff and nutrient losses were effectively controlled by straw mulch when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the absorption capability of straw provides additional pathways for water infiltration li et al 2011 this water trapped in straw will gradually be released over several days and result in increased infiltration liu et al 2014 in our study very low or even negative soil evaporation under sm in august can also prove this point because this trapped water was released into the mls which resulted in increased water in the mls fig 7 rainfall is the most important soil water supply source for orchards on the loess plateau when it rains rainfall first infiltrates the surface soil and large gradients in the gravitational potential and matrix potential in the vertical direction are formed water will continue to penetrate downwards until the wetting front stops moving and the water compensation depth reaches a maximum value in our research irrigation increased swc in the 40 60 cm soil layer under fm and sm however no similar increase was found in tl based on this result we can infer that mulching can effectively promote water compensation in deeper soil layers this is also reflected during the high frequency high magnitude rainfall in august where significantly more water recharge occurred in deeper soil 60 80 cm in the two mulching treatments song et al 2020 also observed similar results this could be because i thick plough pans and low porosity under the tl treatment are not conducive to water infiltration ii the sm and fm treatments have higher swcs than tl in the upper soil so a larger water potential gradient between the upper soil and deeper soil will form after rainfall and irrigation which can promote downward transmission of water and iii more water evaporates in the tl treatment soil evaporation is affected by meteorological factors canopy shading and swc we measured the leaf area index in the three wet dry cycles and there were no significant differences among the three treatments table 2 when soil is wet the soil water at the soil atmosphere interface evaporates due to heat from solar radiation which leads to a decrease in soil water potential at the soil atmosphere interface under the action of capillary forces soil water moves from the underlying soil with higher water potential to the soil atmosphere interface liu et al 2008 mulching on the soil surface forms an insulating layer which can effectively slow down and hinder the exchange of water and energy by preventing solar radiation heat from directly reaching the soil surface in our study both fm and sm significantly reduced soil evaporation rates in the energy limited stage and sm had a better effect in the falling rate stage sm still reduced soil evaporation compared with tl even if the reduction was lower than that in the energy limited stage while fm did not it was speculated that this may be due to the higher swc of fm in the falling rate stage this finding contrasts with that of zribi et al 2015 who found that mulching did not significantly reduce soil evaporation in the falling rate stage this could be because their research monitored the wet dry cycle for a longer period 30 days so the soil evaporation rate was very low in the falling rate stage for all treatments at the same time the accuracy of evaporation measurements over a longer time without renewing undisturbed soil in the field experiments should also be considered we noticed that in the energy limited stage the soil evaporation rate under sm in august 0 32 mm d was significantly lower than that in the three wet dry cycles 1 11 mm d inserted table in fig 7 and table 3 this may be because high frequency high magnitude rainfall caused the straw to be soaked with water which greatly hindered the exchange of water and vapor between the soil and atmosphere simultaneously when water that soaks the straw evaporates it absorbs large amounts of heat and reduces surface soil temperatures in addition we analysed the relationship between the relative evaporation rate and surface swc and found the existence of a threshold of swc 22 09 22 75 between the energy limited stage and falling rate stage in a similar study sun et al 2012 reported that evaporation dropped to very low levels when the swc of the soil surface decreased zribi et al 2015 found that soil evaporation and swc were positively and linearly correlated because most observations pertain to the falling rate stage of soil evaporation yields are affected by many factors and soil water is a key limiting factor on the loess plateau combining mulching with irrigation can increase water inputs to compensate for water deficits caused by insufficient rainfall and on the other hand it can effectively maintain soil moisture by reducing evaporation and promoting infiltration in this study irrigation effectively increased yields for three consecutive years and mulching accentuated this trend moreover compared with tl mulching greatly improved iwue this finding was also reported by zhang et al 2014 due to the contradiction between water supply and consumption deficit irrigation has been widely studied for optimizing water application some scholars have studied applying a combination of mulching and deficit irrigation in semiarid areas and have reported improvements in yields and water use efficiency yang et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 sokalska et al 2009 reported that in the apple orchards with drip irrigation system more than 92 3 of the fine roots of mature apple trees are distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer and more than 76 7 of the fine roots are distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer however in our study after irrigation only 0 40 cm soil layer greatly increased sws while sws of 40 80 cm soil layer increased little in order to make irrigation water infiltration deeper and directly transport to the roots surge root irrigation was invented wu et al 2010 and some scholars reported its applicability in semi arid orchards dai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 the rainfall in july 2020 45 1 mm was much lower than the average rainfall 98 0 mm in july from 1971 to 2020 while the rainfall in august 271 2 mm was much higher than the average rainfall in august 101 4 mm however this rare rainfall distribution provides a good opportunity for our experiment to observe water infiltration and evaporation under different rainfall conditions on the other hand the two irrigation events we chose are representative because the irrigation amounts in each irrigation event were nearly the same 11 9 17 4 mm in the three years in this study corn straw and horticultural fabric were selected as mulching materials corn is widely planted in local areas so it is inexpensive and can be widely used however straw mulching is more dispersed and it can easily drift when it is windy or rainy so we added a nylon net to stabilize it it should be noted that in august soil evaporation was very low even negative this may mean that the soaked straw mulch reduce soil air permeability and is not conducive to crop root respiration rahma et al 2017 reported that in extreme rainfall events the use of straw mulching with high mulching rates on sloping land may more easily induce soil loss therefore we do not recommend the use of straw mulch with high mulching rates in farmland in rain rich areas especially on sloping land but it can be used to restore soil water storage for flat land compared with plastic film horticultural fabric has a longer service life with the same low price in our research in the three year test only the edges of the horticultural fabric were slightly damaged so it can also effectively minimise plastic pollution moreover application of straw mulching and horticultural fabric mulching does not have a high demand for labour taken together both fm and sm have potential for application in orchards in semiarid areas to improve soil and moisture conditions in the root zone in addition we agree with zribi et al 2015 that mulching would be more beneficial in high frequency irrigation systems with wet soil surfaces most of the time than in low frequency irrigation systems because mulching has a better evaporation control effect on wet soil surfaces on the loess plateau in the water cycle of fields infiltration after irrigation or rainfall is the most important method of water input and evaporation and transpiration are the main methods of water consumption through field experiments we studied infiltration and evaporation after irrigation and rainfall however further research on transpiration is needed to understand the complete water cycle of fields in addition mulching greatly changes the soil environment in root zones and roots are the main tissue for plants to absorb water and nutrients therefore to explain crop responses more research is required on roots 5 conclusion the results of this study show that mulching with no tillage effectively improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity in the 0 40 cm soil layer the mean soil bulk densities of fm and sm were 2 8 and 4 5 lower than tl and the mean porosity were 4 7 and 9 0 higher than tl by changing the structure of the underlying surface of the field mulching increased infiltration after irrigation and heavy rain due to water absorption by the straw layer straw mulching reduced infiltration when light rain occurred regardless of whether the soil is in the energy limited stage or falling rate stage mulching can effectively reduce soil evaporation and straw mulching has a better effect in the energy limited stage evaporation and soil moisture content showed a very significant linear relationship but in the falling rate stage there was no significant correlation between them in august because the straw was soaked with water soil evaporation was extremely low and even negative which may affect soil permeability therefore we do not recommend the use of straw mulch with a high mulching rate in farmlands in rain rich areas mulching has a better evaporation control effect on wet soil surfaces therefore mulching would be more beneficial in high frequency irrigation systems from the perspective of inhibiting evaporation in three consecutive years mulching effectively increased apple yields and iwue the three year average yields indicated that yields improved by 24 1 and 20 6 respectively in fm and sm compared with tl however to understand the complete water cycle of the fields further research is needed on transpiration in addition more research is required on roots to explain the response of crops to mulching declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
