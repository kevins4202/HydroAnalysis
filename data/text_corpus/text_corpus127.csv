635,floodings and landslides are amongst the most devastating damage processes worldwide associated risk levels are particularly high in topographically complex terrain along with the increase in climate change induced extreme events research devoted to the identification of so called climate indices cis describing weather phenomena triggering hazard occurrences and intensities gains rising emphasis in this study we accomplish the first time unification of the three most comprehensive cadastres on weather induced hazard processes compiled and maintained by federal authorities the therefrom resulting event spaceˮ stretches seven decades from 1950 onwards and contains more than 20 000 hazard occurrences classified into different process categories event data are analyzed together with a high quality daily based dataset providing temperatures and precipitation totals on a 1 km grid across the austrian part of the european alps on the resulting unprecedented extent of extreme weather triggered hazard processes and gridded weather observations we are able to examine the hypothesis that daily sequences of precipitation totals preceding damage events allow for the detection of temporal weather sequences uniquely allocatable to various hazard categories in three orographically distinct regions in the european alps we pursue this research aim by analyzing for each hazard category its quadratic form representing the physics contained in the observations resulting eigen directions invariant under its inherent second order tensor are the sought for total sequences cis and hence reject the alternative hypothesis therefore precipitation total sequences can be uniquely assigned to hazard categories within each region it is important to note that findings based on this novel objective approach do not contradict but rather add to attained research achievements by introducing this new perspective on the subject obtained cis have substantial potential in research and applications in civil defense safeguarding critical infrastructure early warning systems and the development of sustainable protection strategies findings are in implementation by responsible decision makers and in intense discussion with the european freight and logistics leaders forum keywords precipitation totals weather sequences hazard processes objectively determined climate indices event space austria 1 introduction extreme weather induced hazards have always been substantial threats and will in the wake of climate change pose major challenges to societies particularly in complex terrain having remained constant on high levels for about a decade global mean temperatures are again on the rise since some years by now unlike global temperatures that increased about 1 celsius over the past 150 years those in european alps rose twice as much auer et al 2007 natural hazards processes accompanying this rapid change present significant challenges to those responsible for civil protection albeit averages are important the focus of this paper is on changes in extreme events as their impact on society ecosystems and socio economic structures is far more significant katz and brown 1992 schlögl and laaha 2017 this endeavor is challenging because extreme events are rare and hence data should be of high spatial temporal density and quality as well as stretch many decades back in time temporal extent is of outstanding importance because three decades e g are already required for determining climate mean variance i e lowest moments wmo 2017 hence describing rare events far off the averages requires substantially more observations unfortunately both prerequisites to be concerned in case of weather observations as well as hazard occurrences meaning when and wherever hazards occur weather observations should be on hand are nearly ever met therefore it is important to establish a solid data basis allowing for further development as it was carried out e g in portugal pereira et al 2018 and italy guzzetti et al 1994 2007 2008 e g searched the technical and scientific literature to establish a first and further developed catalog containing rainfall events mostly in italy that partly resulted in landslides on that basis the authors compiled a collection of information on rainfall induced landslides in italy comprising 753 precipitation events causing landslides concerning landslides brunetti et al 2010 managed to add detailed or rough location as well as time or period of occurrence regarding associated precipitation events the authors provided information on averaged intensity and duration too by using two statistical methods and various further subsidiary information e g class within the köppen scheme main rock types they were able to identify thresholds indicating potential precipitation caused landslides for a region in central italy and italy as a whole melillo et al 2015 pointed out inconsistencies corresponding to rainfall reconstruction methods used and proposed a procedure estimating precipitation conditions potentially triggering landslides in an objective and reproducible way therefore they utilized 229 landslide observations and rain gauge data in sicily between 2002 and 2012 based on these studies peruccacci et al 2017 investigated mainly shallow landslides and defined new precipitation thresholds for italy and 26 regions mostbauer et al 2018 analysed the temporally varying roles of rainfall snowmelt and soil moisture on debris flow initiation by combining a rainfall runoff model with documented debris flow events in a recent effort prenner et al 2019 investigated trigger characteristics of torrential flows in alpine regions based on 360 observed debris flow and fluvial flood events these studies show that despite the lack of actual observation making it appear almost impossible to establish precipitation landslide relationships exploitation of subsidiary information e g topography köppen classes rainfall reconstructions and known sum intensity relations can be used to derive rainfall thresholds indicating degrees of landslide risk important for public protection all this research serves a good example for the success of continued efforts in the current study however we approach the subject from the different perspective focusing on landslides and floodings we examine the hypothesis whether it is possible to derive characteristic local scale precipitation total sequences for various hazard processes prior threat occurrences in different regions in the european alps from an orographical and climatological point of view austria can be separated into three distinct provinces northern parts extending from the foothills of the alpine ridge across the river danube northwards henceforth summarized as northern lowlands nl are geomorphologically characterized by lowlands interspersed by flat hills geologically nl can be further separated into the bohemian mass in its north mainly consisting of granite and migmatite and its south dominated by classic sediments gravel sand clay of the molasse zone climatologically nl is generally influenced by northern and north western air flows the southeastern basins southern basin chain sb comprising for instance the styrian basin and the klagenfurt basin are defined by flat topography and low altitude mountains sb mainly consists of classic sediments partly of mica slate and volcanic rocks weather conditions are mainly controlled by air masses advected from the south and southeast as well as occasionally by vb pattern induced through genua cyclogenesis the remaining area summarized here as alpine territory at is signified by large differences in elevation ranging from low altitude basins of only somewhat more than hundred metres above mean sea level and deep valleys to high mountains of over 3500 m aside from its geomorphologcal appearance it is marked by diversity in terms of geology as well at exhibits different types of rocks represented by flysch zone and limestone alps northwards and a mixture of volcanites as well as various slate and gneiss groups in its southern parts the alpine crest acts as a meteorological divide whereby northern and central alps form a barrier for northwestern airflows therefore mean annual precipitation totals reach more than 3000 mm inner alpine valleys such as the inntal the ötztal and the mölltal are shielded by their surroundings and therefore particularly dry matulla 2005 schwarb et al 2001 our research is devoted to crucial subject areas in public protection and safeguarding critical infrastructure against damaging events caused by weather driven threats we aim at supporting decision makers as well as european freight and logistic industries establishing sustainable adaption strategies thus fostering society s ability to cope with future risk potentials this is pursued by objectively determining cis applying findings to downscaled future climate change projections forced by different pathways of mankind rcps van vuuren et al 2011 and using decision theory for decisions under risk in meteorology extreme events are often defined as states exceeding high percentiles of atmospheric quantities in case hazards damages fatalities and public protection are concerned extreme events are associated with atmospheric pattern jeopardizing citizens ecosystems and infrastructure assets descriptions related to the latter are called climate indices cis see e g matulla et al 2017a schlögl and matulla 2018 across europe s complex structured alpine terrain floodings landslides heat and drought bear the largest share of losses totaling up to one billion euro per year in austria alone steininger et al 2016 therefore changes in threat intensities and frequencies are a subject of growing concern consequently gaining knowledge on weather processes triggering hazards i e deriving cis is the key for establishing successful and sustainable protection strategies for every hazard triggering process described by a ci pertaining future evolutions can be derived from downscaled climate change projections corresponding to different pathways of mankind once these future spatial temporal ci appearances in terms of occurrence frequency and intensity are on hand they are the cornerstone for developing sustainable protection programs suitably adapted to each pathway cis are of outstanding importance for their central role in studies on natural hazards too whose validity directly depends on the quality of utilized cis the more accurately cis represent hazard inducing processes the more reliable results obtained with them are we deduce cis from meteorological observations pertaining in space and time to hazard occurrences on record this approach has not been explored yet for its high demand on observations generally datasets on extreme events are short unchecked and of small extent and thus under circumstances to date this approach would have been unsuitable however the composition of our consortium consisting of federal officials responsible for public protection i e decision makers climate researchers from the weather service and young researchers from universities enabled the first time unification of austria s three most comprehensive cadastres on hazards and the utilization of high quality datasets this setup permitted the establishment of an event space providing an unprecedented scope of threat occurrences enabling the derivation of cis from observations the present paper is dedicated to the objective determination of cis related to several hazard categories of landslides and floodings in topographically distinct regions stretching across austria s complex territory section 2 data and methods presents the three in terms of spatial temporal extent and the amount of hazard observations on record most comprehensive austrian cadastres as well as the meteorological data base utilized besides that we present a concise review of the methods which just serves to recall their analysis techniques applied here section 3 results and discussion briefly describes the creation of the event space and discusses the identified canonical total sequences triggering different hazard categories in three distinct regions the paper is closed by an outlook given in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data data used in this study are of two kind on one hand there are long term records of damage processes collected by federal agencies in compliance with their legal mandate most other poolings of such kind developed much later when damages induced by extreme weather increasingly raised public attention and political awareness in the early 2000s on the other hand we have high quality daily weather observations processed on grids provided by the austrian national weather service below presented governmental cadastres follow grown labels oriented to the agencies obligations but chosen in such way that they can be grouped into internationally common categories however since the number of pertaining observations is of outstanding significance allowing to objectively identify extreme weather processes driving hazards to the public we will start therefrom the austrian service for torrent and avalanche control wildbach und lawinenverbauung wlv founded in 1884 is a subordinate agency of the austrian federal ministry of sustainability and tourism bmnt wlv traditionally deals with torrents and avalanches which mainly occur within the alpine territory at see fig 1 amongst wlv s tasks are declaration of danger zones potentially yielding settlement prohibitions civil protection management and providing advisory capacity towards climate change adaption these and many more responsibilities require diligently collected long term records of hazard processes that are compiled in the wlv cadastre wlv 2017 it covers fluvial sediment transport processes see table 1 which are floods containing amounts of solids up to one fifth their volume 3603 events on record debris flow like processes as before but with a fraction of solid material exceeding one fifth 766 mud flows carrying solid contents exceeding 50 1927 flooding 1976 and surface water 16 landslides are distinguished into rotational slides which are movements exhibiting a rotation about an axis parallel the slopes 202 translational slides i e slides with negligible rotation 100 earth and debris flows where the material sliding down is subjected to strong deformation 31 shallow landslides 162 individual blocks with block sizes up to 1 m 58 large blocks with sizes exceeding one meter 239 as well as rock creeps 2 founded in 1849 the geological survey of austria geologische bundesanstalt gba is a subordinate agency of austrian federal ministry for education science and research bmbwf fields of activity encompass geological mapping process monitoring and issuing of maps featuring high risk areas for planning purposes whereby emphasis is on the foothills of the alps on lowlands northern lowlands nl and basins southern basin chain sb see fig 1 just as in case of wlv the accomplishment of gba s governmental obligations requires a highly dependable comprehensive and statistically robust data basis such sound conscientiously collected long term records of damage events are compiled in the gba cadastre geologische bundesanstalt 2017 therefore various observation systems are employed amongst these are for example remote sensing field surveys geographical photographs systematic expert inventories of indexed areas reports from the population and the digitization of historical archives from e g monasteries to avoid inhomogeneities which may result from different formats quality criteria and degrees of information content gba devotes a substantial fraction of its resources to maintain an extensive quality assurance program ensuring just that gba records used in this study start in 1950 and cover see table 1 the following gravitational processes slides 2201 flows 104 falls 898 general mass movements 52 mass movements in loose rock 28 and complex large scale movements 37 the austrian national weather and geophysical service zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg was founded in 1851 and is a subordinate agency of bmbwf its legal duties cover the operation of the meteorological observation network the warning of citizens in case of hazardous weather supporting disaster management and advancing current states of knowledge in the realm of meteorology and climate through independently carried out research amongst its various weather datasets zamg has maintained since 1948 an archive of media reports on weather driven damage processes according to given procedures viola violent weather assessment matulla et al 2017b contains a digitized version of this archive organized in line with legal duties its group definitions are transnationally compatible and allow by simple aggregation conformity with internationally used categories here we use continuous rain 337 heavy precipitation events 2351 thunderstorms 2290 surface water 1761 slides 665 flows 656 falls 180 and heat and drought 528 weather data are taken from spartacus the spatiotemporal reanalysis dataset for climate in austria hiebl and frei 2015 2017 it provides high quality daily temperatures and precipitation totals from 1961 onwards on a 1 km grid across austria spartacus has been generated in an international collaboration from irregularly distributed weather stations maintained by zamg has already found application in several studies duethmann and blöschl 2018 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 and is operationally kept up to date at zamg precipitation totals throughout the decade prior spartacus from 1951 to 1960 are taken from the so called gpard6 dataset hofstätter et al 2015 which provides daily totals at a less highly resolved grid of 6 km spacing 2 2 methods descriptions of weather phenomena triggering hazard processes are as mentioned already called climate indices cis cis are of mulitfarious use they indicate hazardous weather and thereby help alert inhabitants of affected areas they serve as benchmarks for climate proof construction work and they permit the assessment of future vulnerability of e g infrastructure settlements and traffic routes under climate change matulla et al 2017a schlögl and matulla 2018 precipitation periods of five or more days for instance with overall totals larger than 37 3 mm and at least one daily sum above 25 6 mm have been defined by guzzetti et al 2008 as a ci for landslides in the european alps so far cis are based on expert opinion practical experience physical reasoning e g various threshold models experiments and model considerations but cis have not been objectively derived from records by now this is for two reasons i detailed knowledge on hazard events and triggering weather conditions have to be on hand let s call that kind of observation hazard weather observation ii many decades of hazard weather observations are required please note having a large number of these hazard weather observations available is not sufficient unless these stretch many decades this is because as already elaborated already three decades are required for deriving the lowest moments of meteorological elements distributions thus much more time is needed to properly assess extremes far off the means e g alexandersson et al 2000 bärring and von storch 2004 matulla et al 2008a generally detailed information on neither hazard occurrences nor triggering weather conditions are available and its only due to substantial efforts that by reviewing scientific literature blogs reports by fire fighters etc on one hand as well as continued research endeavours in terms of e g weather reconstructions on the other hand catalogues on damage occurrences and knowledge on related weather conditions are usable for proposing cis brunetti et al 2010 gariano et al 2015 guzzetti et al 1994 2007 in the following we set out to investigate whether our event space and spartacus allow for the objective determination of extreme weather sequences triggering damage processes i e objectively derived cis on top of that we claim that it is possible to objectively identify definite sequences of daily weather observations that are distinguishable amongst various categories of floodings and landslides as well as in between the three above introduced regions please note that this statement is extraordinary we do not only set out to i objectively identify cis regarding floodings and landslides which has not been done yet we aim at doing so for ii various landslide and flooding categories and we claim them to iii exhibit characteristic sequences of daily precipitation totals which are iv distinguishable amongst hazard categories as well as v in between regions this is in fact by no means likely or expectable because the event space generated here is based on cadastres assembled by different authorities and spartacus results from an international collaboration hence the data available to us are from various independent sources everybody who has worked already with datasets from different sources knows how large differences can be even if they describe the same e g weather element here spartacus is a meteorological dataset and the event space contains hazard occurrences now they are linked at different points in time and space whenever there is a damage occurrence apart from that the assumption iii concerning particular successions is not suggested by anything cis derived in other studies contain conditions that may or may not be matched landslides in the european alps for instance are triggered by weather phenomena exceeding two thresholds in whatever order see above so there is no need for any order and hence claims iv and v are obviously even less reasonable as such let us claim there is no detectable difference between successions of daily precipitation totals inducing different flooding and landslide processes within and in between the alpine regions considered since date and location of each event space element is known we assign to it corresponding precipitation totals at its occurrence day or target day td as well as during the preceding week concerning continental europe this complies with a rather common rule of thumb resulting from studies reaching back into the 1930s baur 1936 and singled out periods of 5 8 days adequately characterizing changes in predominant weather conditions cadez 1957 observed weather developments over five years in slovenia and found three day periods to predominate hess and brezowsky 1969 investigated a range of large scale weather patterns from 1881 to 1998 they confirmed three day cycles as well as periods extending from five to seven days to carry much significance ehrendorfer 1987 identifies 3 to 7 days signifying duration and change of large scale weather characteristics over central europe since we are not only interested in currently dominating weather but also in conditions preceding their arrival periods of 8 days are considered here the considered 8 day sequence length covers the mean climate weather s retention time and well enough the threat process development history e g matulla et al 2008b in our analyses we regard for every hazard occurrence 8 day total sequences averaged over the closest spartacus grid point and its four neighbors that means we have hazard weather observations see above over seven decades available for all event space elements of one category n events we set up a 8 n matrix o of observations the central question now arising is are there characteristic patterns to the sequences towards target day or are the totals arbitrarily distributed the answer depends on the symmetric tensor oo i e o times o transpose since its eigen directions resulting from the secular equation are the sought total sequences cis hence we can address the above hypothesis by analyzing and depicting them see figs 2 7 the theory of second order symmetric tensors is identical to those of quadratic forms duschek and hochrainer 1946 which in physics generally represent energy expressions e g potential and kinetic energy in mechanics deformation work in statics magnetic and electric energy in electrotechnology zurmühl 1950 the second order symmetric tensor oo and its mathematically inherent form contains all weather observations in terms of total sequences preceding considered hazard events hazard weather observations and thereby all physics recorded at this linkage now form tensor and eigen directions are canonically linked on one hand eigen directions are invariant under tensor operations and on the other hand taken as basis they display form and tensor in their main axis and diagonal representation the eigen directions are in our context the canonical total sequences it is worth noting that the canonical total sequences shown in figs 2 7 result from an analysis in meteorology and several other applied fields called empirical orthogonal function analysis eof e g von storch and zwiers 1999 a multivariate statistical analysis tool of great use in applications especially when dealing with incomplete inaccurate data amongst the most prominent eof applications is perhaps that of successively observed surface level air pressure slp across the north atlantic and europe there the analysis yields pattern eofs which together with their temporal coefficients aka pcs e g preisendorfer et al 1988 represent the atmosphere s dynamic north atlantic oszillation trenberth and paolino 1981 the first eof of slp over the northern hemisphere the arctic oscillation and its dynamics is perhaps even better known hurrell 1995 kutzbach 1970 with an eof analysis one achieves two important goals at once i the physics observed through eofs and their time coefficients pcs as well as ii avoidance of erroneous information by disregarding small eigenvalues evs for these features the eof analysis is popular both of them result from the eofs orthogonality in textbooks eofs are usually introduced by explicit construction because it only requires very basic skills in mathematics that way e g peixoto and oort 1992 von storch and navarra 1999 zorita and von storch 1999 that is perfectly all right but makes some readers believe eofs orthogonality which is used in this construction is arbitrary and that is wrong in fact the pattern s orthogonality is mathematically inherent since oo is a symmetric second order tensor identical theory to euclidean geometry which we obviously use to observe to measure objects duschek 1963 duschek and hochrainer 1950 3 results and discussion 3 1 compilation of the event space in this section we follow the steps carried out towards the compilation of the event space and shortly point out its main features that are on the one hand inherited from the authorities cadastres introduced above and generated on the other hand by means of their aggregation amongst the significant features taken over from the cadastres three stand out the period covered i e about seven decades from 1950 onwards the regions and their spatial extent that are to be supervised by the authorities for their legal obligations and the equivalence of the hazards processes to be monitored to acquire their targets ultimately it is the combination of these traits allowing all results presented here and these in turn are of importance for decision makers realizing sustainable civil protection strategies geared to climate driven challenges induced by changing hazard frequencies and intensities throughout the decades to come until 2100 all findings achieved here depend on their comprehensive content extending over seven decades these results could not have been derived from data that only began in the 2000s when climate change was already known and altered extreme events became popular these data are too short the technical challenges of compiling the event space have not been any different than they are in general known to all involved in the merging of information from different sources data formats arrangement of information etc the only general lesson is the indispensability of patience continuous inquiring accuracy and dedication however it is worth mentioning that the classification processes in table 1 used by the authorities to accomplish their legal tasks have been introduced thoughtfully such that they split internationally common categories c f heiser et al 2015 or allow for their straightforward assignment to these hence there was no complication to be experienced in this regard table 2 shows internationally common categories and how pertaining events are distributed over the above introduced orographical distinct provinces fig 1 floodings to begin with are made up by wlv s fluviatile sediment transport debris flow like transport floods and viola s continuous rain flash floods combines viola s surface water heavy precipitation events and thunderstorms with wlv s surface water slides aggregates wlv s sub categories rotational slides and translational slides as well as gba s and viola s correspondences i e slides flows contains gba s and viola s equivalents i e flows as well as wlv s mud flows shallow landslides and earth and debris flows reflecting just a further distinction falls consists of gba s and viola s falls as well as wlv s individual blocks and large blocks while finally category others acts as a reservoir for sparsely occupied and undifferentiated processes the above described integration of the three most extensive national damage process databases wlv gba viola which is accomplished here for the first time results in an event space made up of internationally used categories e g hungr et al 2001 2013 varnes 1978 this event space provides an unprecedented scope of hazard processes i e about 20 000 occurrences in terms of floodings flash floods slides flows and falls covering a significant part of the european alps the captured outstanding extent of events does not only allow for the examination of weather sequences driving floodings and landslides but to do so in their various appearances mentioned above as well as in the three regions see fig 1 3 2 derivation of cis throughout the past seven decades several thousand hazard events have been recorded within each region and every category based on this statistically robust setup we investigate temporal total sequences extending over eight days including the target day preceding hazard occurrences figs 2 through 7 below refer to floodings slides and flash floods for different regions these are presented in a standardized layout their upper rows depict from left to right 1 share of variances explained displayed in a scree plot compagnucci and salles 1997 horn 1965 2 the fraction of hazard occurrences recorded in this region and finally 3 the distribution of totals accumulating over the 8 day sequences the figures bottom line illustrates from left to right the three leading eofs temporal pattern i e the canonical transformation s temporal total sequences triggering damage processes the color of the figures frames correspond to the region investigated as can be seen in fig 1 note that the scree plot refers to the fraction of physics contained in all observed precipitation processes represented by their eof pattern a gap between the values corresponding to eofs of increasing number or a change in the course indicates the appropriate number of eofs to retain in the subsequent analyses while there are in fact a number of criteria for deciding the number of eofs used to capture the signal from the rest containing noise we decided by scree plots to retain three eofs in each shown case the results for floodings in the northern lowlands 666 events fig 2 and in the alpine territory 4884 events fig 3 display a clearly visible difference between the most frequently attained sequence total first row rightmost panel between the alpine topography and the northern plains while this value reaches 35 mm in nl the corresponding amount in at is 30 mm this seems to match with expectations related to the regions distinct orography and thus pertaining catchment area sizes concerning the explained variances of the leading eofs there is no significant difference between the regions 40 and 43 however the patterns themselves differ obviously floodings in nl are triggered by sequences exhibiting a steep increase in daily totals from td 2 until process occurrence in contrast at s leading precipitation totals are starting a continuous rise from td 4 until td 1 followed by a slight decrease at the target day the course of the second leading patterns 23 and 30 for the corresponding explained variances respectively somehow reverses that of the first and come with clearly larger daily sums from the sequences beginning up to td 3 the explained variances 14 and 10 pertaining to the third canonical total sequences triggering floodings make up already only a quarter of those associated with the first and hence carry accordingly less importance however unlike above discussed eofs their runs highlight the first half of the sequences towards td whereby nl s has its maximum sum on td 5 and at s on td 3 this may be related to rather different sizes of the regions catchment areas the captured behavior of floodings in the southern basin chain sb not shown is much alike with the one obtained for nl figs 4 and 5 depict findings for slides in the southern basin chain 650 events and across the alpine territory 1965 events slides generally happen in open terrain and tear off particularly along edges like those brought by forest roads favoring infiltration processes the explained variances of the leading sequences are rather different showing values of 32 and 53 their courses of daily sums on the other hand share some similarities in terms of overall appearances these are reaching their maximum sums at td 1 and generally rising totals towards them as well as decline afterwards this indicates a one day time lag between weather development and the thereby initiated hazard process that is related to the soil moisture this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a delayed reaction as opposed to an instantly triggered slide directly caused by high rainfall intensity second eofs exhibit explained variances of 18 and 21 in sb and at respectively developments of totals are in both cases different from those just mentioned here precipitation sums take on their minima one and two days prior the event in sb and at while both attain their maxima at td itself i e instant trigger in experts terms the difference between instant and delayed hazard initiation may arise from geological conditions as well as differences in the water saturation of the soil in this context instant and delayed slides ought to be anticipated with flysch and calcareous substrate large totals reached from td 3 backwards may highlight the importance of infiltration and saturation processes acting as prerequisites of slides this characteristic also stands out in case of the third patterns featuring explained variances of 15 and 9 respectively sufficient moisture penetration slowly propagates towards sliding layers in all sliding processes generally slides occur delayed when penetration has reached so called critical depths which depend on the actual slide mightiness total sequences in the northern lowlands share obvious similarity with those of sb just mentioned figs 6 and 7 refer to results of category flash floods within the northern lowlands 1816 events and the alpine territory 2965 events the first patterns having sudden and pronounced maxima on td mirror the definition of flash floods merz and blöschl nied et al 2014 in at however the explained variance is considerably larger than that of nl 58 versus 40 second eofs 2 for nl and 13 in at again reverse the temporal order of minimum and maximum totals compared to the leading sequences apart from that at s pattern attains the largest daily sum on td 1 whereas in nl on td 2 this was already the case for floodings such as the fact that they come with larger daily sums until td 1 unlike in all other cases shown third total sequences show reflected behaviour in between the regions sums in nl show an overall increase up to td 1 whereas at s pattern features rather large totals from the beginning until td 2 followed by its minimum and somewhat more precipitation on td the relative gap between the explained variances stays approximately the same as that before results for flash flood in the southern basin chain show close resemblance to those in the alpine territory the main statement of the whole study standing out from all examinations and analyses is the significance and uniqueness of total sequences tied to each single hazard category region pairing totaling up to 18 cis three regions with four and two categories for landslides and floodings respectively as such our hypothesis related to the question whether it is possible or not to derive characteristic total sequences cis for various hazard categories prior threat occurrence may therefore be decided the claim that there is no detectable difference between successions of daily total sequences either inducing the same hazard floodings and landslides in various categories in topographically distinct regions or triggering different hazards within the same region has to be rejected so the event space generated and the eigen directions of our quadratic form comprising the physics through all observations allow to objectively determine canonical cis total sequences triggering damage processes the validity of the region specific cis despite their inner variability due to their geological physiographical and geomorphological conditions land cover and soil types etc reveals its subsidiary status the validity of the hazard sensitive cis in between regions on the other hand illustrates their statistical robustness it is perhaps worth mentioning that none of our findings here contradict or render obsolete already established cis the current outcomes only add to the research achievements of those for instance discussed throughout this paper as well as by caine 1980 and martelloni et al 2012 who managed to continuously improve landslide threshold levels in various regions across italy by enlarging the body of rainfall landslides information and enhancing analysis techniques these endeavors are highly relevant in terms of public protection for instance because landslides perpetrate substantial economic losses and high numbers of fatalities in terms of floodings which are addressed here too the accurate estimation of extreme precipitation totals and the proper simulation of their effects are decisively contributing to civil protection as well papaioannou et al 2018 scofield and kuligowski 2003 results derived in this study are to be used by responsible decision makers for the purpose of public protection as well as safeguarding critical infrastructure together with ensembles of downscaled climate change projections driven by different pathways of mankind they serve as cornerstone for sustainable strategies assembling bundles of protection measures that are to be effective modularly extendable combinable with structures already in effect and cheap to maintain aside from their importance for establishing sustainable protection strategies they are subject to close collaboration with european freight and logistics leaders forum s members in order to secure their business 4 outlook future work will focus on the application of cis to empirically statistically as well as dynamically downscaled ensembles of climate change projections driven by various pathways of mankind this shall enable decision makers in charge to develop sustainable strategies for e g public protection and safeguarding critical infrastructure geared to future climate conditions expected throughout the decades to come other goals worth to attain refer to case studies focusing on subsidiary effects to differentiate between seasons and to investigate whether the actual extent of landslides reveals geomorphological fingerprints and can be allocated to rapid or delayed initiation aside from these aims we set out together with those in charge to integrate findings into early warning systems as cis derived in this study exhibit daily resolution stretch a period of 8 days and are characteristic for combinations of hazard process and region at nl sb thus operationally observed weather developments may be continuously compared to cis without any additional effort in case evolutions match them after e g 5 days enhanced alertness and appropriate preparation protocols may be brought into effect such precautions can buy time when time is most critical 
635,floodings and landslides are amongst the most devastating damage processes worldwide associated risk levels are particularly high in topographically complex terrain along with the increase in climate change induced extreme events research devoted to the identification of so called climate indices cis describing weather phenomena triggering hazard occurrences and intensities gains rising emphasis in this study we accomplish the first time unification of the three most comprehensive cadastres on weather induced hazard processes compiled and maintained by federal authorities the therefrom resulting event spaceˮ stretches seven decades from 1950 onwards and contains more than 20 000 hazard occurrences classified into different process categories event data are analyzed together with a high quality daily based dataset providing temperatures and precipitation totals on a 1 km grid across the austrian part of the european alps on the resulting unprecedented extent of extreme weather triggered hazard processes and gridded weather observations we are able to examine the hypothesis that daily sequences of precipitation totals preceding damage events allow for the detection of temporal weather sequences uniquely allocatable to various hazard categories in three orographically distinct regions in the european alps we pursue this research aim by analyzing for each hazard category its quadratic form representing the physics contained in the observations resulting eigen directions invariant under its inherent second order tensor are the sought for total sequences cis and hence reject the alternative hypothesis therefore precipitation total sequences can be uniquely assigned to hazard categories within each region it is important to note that findings based on this novel objective approach do not contradict but rather add to attained research achievements by introducing this new perspective on the subject obtained cis have substantial potential in research and applications in civil defense safeguarding critical infrastructure early warning systems and the development of sustainable protection strategies findings are in implementation by responsible decision makers and in intense discussion with the european freight and logistics leaders forum keywords precipitation totals weather sequences hazard processes objectively determined climate indices event space austria 1 introduction extreme weather induced hazards have always been substantial threats and will in the wake of climate change pose major challenges to societies particularly in complex terrain having remained constant on high levels for about a decade global mean temperatures are again on the rise since some years by now unlike global temperatures that increased about 1 celsius over the past 150 years those in european alps rose twice as much auer et al 2007 natural hazards processes accompanying this rapid change present significant challenges to those responsible for civil protection albeit averages are important the focus of this paper is on changes in extreme events as their impact on society ecosystems and socio economic structures is far more significant katz and brown 1992 schlögl and laaha 2017 this endeavor is challenging because extreme events are rare and hence data should be of high spatial temporal density and quality as well as stretch many decades back in time temporal extent is of outstanding importance because three decades e g are already required for determining climate mean variance i e lowest moments wmo 2017 hence describing rare events far off the averages requires substantially more observations unfortunately both prerequisites to be concerned in case of weather observations as well as hazard occurrences meaning when and wherever hazards occur weather observations should be on hand are nearly ever met therefore it is important to establish a solid data basis allowing for further development as it was carried out e g in portugal pereira et al 2018 and italy guzzetti et al 1994 2007 2008 e g searched the technical and scientific literature to establish a first and further developed catalog containing rainfall events mostly in italy that partly resulted in landslides on that basis the authors compiled a collection of information on rainfall induced landslides in italy comprising 753 precipitation events causing landslides concerning landslides brunetti et al 2010 managed to add detailed or rough location as well as time or period of occurrence regarding associated precipitation events the authors provided information on averaged intensity and duration too by using two statistical methods and various further subsidiary information e g class within the köppen scheme main rock types they were able to identify thresholds indicating potential precipitation caused landslides for a region in central italy and italy as a whole melillo et al 2015 pointed out inconsistencies corresponding to rainfall reconstruction methods used and proposed a procedure estimating precipitation conditions potentially triggering landslides in an objective and reproducible way therefore they utilized 229 landslide observations and rain gauge data in sicily between 2002 and 2012 based on these studies peruccacci et al 2017 investigated mainly shallow landslides and defined new precipitation thresholds for italy and 26 regions mostbauer et al 2018 analysed the temporally varying roles of rainfall snowmelt and soil moisture on debris flow initiation by combining a rainfall runoff model with documented debris flow events in a recent effort prenner et al 2019 investigated trigger characteristics of torrential flows in alpine regions based on 360 observed debris flow and fluvial flood events these studies show that despite the lack of actual observation making it appear almost impossible to establish precipitation landslide relationships exploitation of subsidiary information e g topography köppen classes rainfall reconstructions and known sum intensity relations can be used to derive rainfall thresholds indicating degrees of landslide risk important for public protection all this research serves a good example for the success of continued efforts in the current study however we approach the subject from the different perspective focusing on landslides and floodings we examine the hypothesis whether it is possible to derive characteristic local scale precipitation total sequences for various hazard processes prior threat occurrences in different regions in the european alps from an orographical and climatological point of view austria can be separated into three distinct provinces northern parts extending from the foothills of the alpine ridge across the river danube northwards henceforth summarized as northern lowlands nl are geomorphologically characterized by lowlands interspersed by flat hills geologically nl can be further separated into the bohemian mass in its north mainly consisting of granite and migmatite and its south dominated by classic sediments gravel sand clay of the molasse zone climatologically nl is generally influenced by northern and north western air flows the southeastern basins southern basin chain sb comprising for instance the styrian basin and the klagenfurt basin are defined by flat topography and low altitude mountains sb mainly consists of classic sediments partly of mica slate and volcanic rocks weather conditions are mainly controlled by air masses advected from the south and southeast as well as occasionally by vb pattern induced through genua cyclogenesis the remaining area summarized here as alpine territory at is signified by large differences in elevation ranging from low altitude basins of only somewhat more than hundred metres above mean sea level and deep valleys to high mountains of over 3500 m aside from its geomorphologcal appearance it is marked by diversity in terms of geology as well at exhibits different types of rocks represented by flysch zone and limestone alps northwards and a mixture of volcanites as well as various slate and gneiss groups in its southern parts the alpine crest acts as a meteorological divide whereby northern and central alps form a barrier for northwestern airflows therefore mean annual precipitation totals reach more than 3000 mm inner alpine valleys such as the inntal the ötztal and the mölltal are shielded by their surroundings and therefore particularly dry matulla 2005 schwarb et al 2001 our research is devoted to crucial subject areas in public protection and safeguarding critical infrastructure against damaging events caused by weather driven threats we aim at supporting decision makers as well as european freight and logistic industries establishing sustainable adaption strategies thus fostering society s ability to cope with future risk potentials this is pursued by objectively determining cis applying findings to downscaled future climate change projections forced by different pathways of mankind rcps van vuuren et al 2011 and using decision theory for decisions under risk in meteorology extreme events are often defined as states exceeding high percentiles of atmospheric quantities in case hazards damages fatalities and public protection are concerned extreme events are associated with atmospheric pattern jeopardizing citizens ecosystems and infrastructure assets descriptions related to the latter are called climate indices cis see e g matulla et al 2017a schlögl and matulla 2018 across europe s complex structured alpine terrain floodings landslides heat and drought bear the largest share of losses totaling up to one billion euro per year in austria alone steininger et al 2016 therefore changes in threat intensities and frequencies are a subject of growing concern consequently gaining knowledge on weather processes triggering hazards i e deriving cis is the key for establishing successful and sustainable protection strategies for every hazard triggering process described by a ci pertaining future evolutions can be derived from downscaled climate change projections corresponding to different pathways of mankind once these future spatial temporal ci appearances in terms of occurrence frequency and intensity are on hand they are the cornerstone for developing sustainable protection programs suitably adapted to each pathway cis are of outstanding importance for their central role in studies on natural hazards too whose validity directly depends on the quality of utilized cis the more accurately cis represent hazard inducing processes the more reliable results obtained with them are we deduce cis from meteorological observations pertaining in space and time to hazard occurrences on record this approach has not been explored yet for its high demand on observations generally datasets on extreme events are short unchecked and of small extent and thus under circumstances to date this approach would have been unsuitable however the composition of our consortium consisting of federal officials responsible for public protection i e decision makers climate researchers from the weather service and young researchers from universities enabled the first time unification of austria s three most comprehensive cadastres on hazards and the utilization of high quality datasets this setup permitted the establishment of an event space providing an unprecedented scope of threat occurrences enabling the derivation of cis from observations the present paper is dedicated to the objective determination of cis related to several hazard categories of landslides and floodings in topographically distinct regions stretching across austria s complex territory section 2 data and methods presents the three in terms of spatial temporal extent and the amount of hazard observations on record most comprehensive austrian cadastres as well as the meteorological data base utilized besides that we present a concise review of the methods which just serves to recall their analysis techniques applied here section 3 results and discussion briefly describes the creation of the event space and discusses the identified canonical total sequences triggering different hazard categories in three distinct regions the paper is closed by an outlook given in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 data data used in this study are of two kind on one hand there are long term records of damage processes collected by federal agencies in compliance with their legal mandate most other poolings of such kind developed much later when damages induced by extreme weather increasingly raised public attention and political awareness in the early 2000s on the other hand we have high quality daily weather observations processed on grids provided by the austrian national weather service below presented governmental cadastres follow grown labels oriented to the agencies obligations but chosen in such way that they can be grouped into internationally common categories however since the number of pertaining observations is of outstanding significance allowing to objectively identify extreme weather processes driving hazards to the public we will start therefrom the austrian service for torrent and avalanche control wildbach und lawinenverbauung wlv founded in 1884 is a subordinate agency of the austrian federal ministry of sustainability and tourism bmnt wlv traditionally deals with torrents and avalanches which mainly occur within the alpine territory at see fig 1 amongst wlv s tasks are declaration of danger zones potentially yielding settlement prohibitions civil protection management and providing advisory capacity towards climate change adaption these and many more responsibilities require diligently collected long term records of hazard processes that are compiled in the wlv cadastre wlv 2017 it covers fluvial sediment transport processes see table 1 which are floods containing amounts of solids up to one fifth their volume 3603 events on record debris flow like processes as before but with a fraction of solid material exceeding one fifth 766 mud flows carrying solid contents exceeding 50 1927 flooding 1976 and surface water 16 landslides are distinguished into rotational slides which are movements exhibiting a rotation about an axis parallel the slopes 202 translational slides i e slides with negligible rotation 100 earth and debris flows where the material sliding down is subjected to strong deformation 31 shallow landslides 162 individual blocks with block sizes up to 1 m 58 large blocks with sizes exceeding one meter 239 as well as rock creeps 2 founded in 1849 the geological survey of austria geologische bundesanstalt gba is a subordinate agency of austrian federal ministry for education science and research bmbwf fields of activity encompass geological mapping process monitoring and issuing of maps featuring high risk areas for planning purposes whereby emphasis is on the foothills of the alps on lowlands northern lowlands nl and basins southern basin chain sb see fig 1 just as in case of wlv the accomplishment of gba s governmental obligations requires a highly dependable comprehensive and statistically robust data basis such sound conscientiously collected long term records of damage events are compiled in the gba cadastre geologische bundesanstalt 2017 therefore various observation systems are employed amongst these are for example remote sensing field surveys geographical photographs systematic expert inventories of indexed areas reports from the population and the digitization of historical archives from e g monasteries to avoid inhomogeneities which may result from different formats quality criteria and degrees of information content gba devotes a substantial fraction of its resources to maintain an extensive quality assurance program ensuring just that gba records used in this study start in 1950 and cover see table 1 the following gravitational processes slides 2201 flows 104 falls 898 general mass movements 52 mass movements in loose rock 28 and complex large scale movements 37 the austrian national weather and geophysical service zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg was founded in 1851 and is a subordinate agency of bmbwf its legal duties cover the operation of the meteorological observation network the warning of citizens in case of hazardous weather supporting disaster management and advancing current states of knowledge in the realm of meteorology and climate through independently carried out research amongst its various weather datasets zamg has maintained since 1948 an archive of media reports on weather driven damage processes according to given procedures viola violent weather assessment matulla et al 2017b contains a digitized version of this archive organized in line with legal duties its group definitions are transnationally compatible and allow by simple aggregation conformity with internationally used categories here we use continuous rain 337 heavy precipitation events 2351 thunderstorms 2290 surface water 1761 slides 665 flows 656 falls 180 and heat and drought 528 weather data are taken from spartacus the spatiotemporal reanalysis dataset for climate in austria hiebl and frei 2015 2017 it provides high quality daily temperatures and precipitation totals from 1961 onwards on a 1 km grid across austria spartacus has been generated in an international collaboration from irregularly distributed weather stations maintained by zamg has already found application in several studies duethmann and blöschl 2018 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 and is operationally kept up to date at zamg precipitation totals throughout the decade prior spartacus from 1951 to 1960 are taken from the so called gpard6 dataset hofstätter et al 2015 which provides daily totals at a less highly resolved grid of 6 km spacing 2 2 methods descriptions of weather phenomena triggering hazard processes are as mentioned already called climate indices cis cis are of mulitfarious use they indicate hazardous weather and thereby help alert inhabitants of affected areas they serve as benchmarks for climate proof construction work and they permit the assessment of future vulnerability of e g infrastructure settlements and traffic routes under climate change matulla et al 2017a schlögl and matulla 2018 precipitation periods of five or more days for instance with overall totals larger than 37 3 mm and at least one daily sum above 25 6 mm have been defined by guzzetti et al 2008 as a ci for landslides in the european alps so far cis are based on expert opinion practical experience physical reasoning e g various threshold models experiments and model considerations but cis have not been objectively derived from records by now this is for two reasons i detailed knowledge on hazard events and triggering weather conditions have to be on hand let s call that kind of observation hazard weather observation ii many decades of hazard weather observations are required please note having a large number of these hazard weather observations available is not sufficient unless these stretch many decades this is because as already elaborated already three decades are required for deriving the lowest moments of meteorological elements distributions thus much more time is needed to properly assess extremes far off the means e g alexandersson et al 2000 bärring and von storch 2004 matulla et al 2008a generally detailed information on neither hazard occurrences nor triggering weather conditions are available and its only due to substantial efforts that by reviewing scientific literature blogs reports by fire fighters etc on one hand as well as continued research endeavours in terms of e g weather reconstructions on the other hand catalogues on damage occurrences and knowledge on related weather conditions are usable for proposing cis brunetti et al 2010 gariano et al 2015 guzzetti et al 1994 2007 in the following we set out to investigate whether our event space and spartacus allow for the objective determination of extreme weather sequences triggering damage processes i e objectively derived cis on top of that we claim that it is possible to objectively identify definite sequences of daily weather observations that are distinguishable amongst various categories of floodings and landslides as well as in between the three above introduced regions please note that this statement is extraordinary we do not only set out to i objectively identify cis regarding floodings and landslides which has not been done yet we aim at doing so for ii various landslide and flooding categories and we claim them to iii exhibit characteristic sequences of daily precipitation totals which are iv distinguishable amongst hazard categories as well as v in between regions this is in fact by no means likely or expectable because the event space generated here is based on cadastres assembled by different authorities and spartacus results from an international collaboration hence the data available to us are from various independent sources everybody who has worked already with datasets from different sources knows how large differences can be even if they describe the same e g weather element here spartacus is a meteorological dataset and the event space contains hazard occurrences now they are linked at different points in time and space whenever there is a damage occurrence apart from that the assumption iii concerning particular successions is not suggested by anything cis derived in other studies contain conditions that may or may not be matched landslides in the european alps for instance are triggered by weather phenomena exceeding two thresholds in whatever order see above so there is no need for any order and hence claims iv and v are obviously even less reasonable as such let us claim there is no detectable difference between successions of daily precipitation totals inducing different flooding and landslide processes within and in between the alpine regions considered since date and location of each event space element is known we assign to it corresponding precipitation totals at its occurrence day or target day td as well as during the preceding week concerning continental europe this complies with a rather common rule of thumb resulting from studies reaching back into the 1930s baur 1936 and singled out periods of 5 8 days adequately characterizing changes in predominant weather conditions cadez 1957 observed weather developments over five years in slovenia and found three day periods to predominate hess and brezowsky 1969 investigated a range of large scale weather patterns from 1881 to 1998 they confirmed three day cycles as well as periods extending from five to seven days to carry much significance ehrendorfer 1987 identifies 3 to 7 days signifying duration and change of large scale weather characteristics over central europe since we are not only interested in currently dominating weather but also in conditions preceding their arrival periods of 8 days are considered here the considered 8 day sequence length covers the mean climate weather s retention time and well enough the threat process development history e g matulla et al 2008b in our analyses we regard for every hazard occurrence 8 day total sequences averaged over the closest spartacus grid point and its four neighbors that means we have hazard weather observations see above over seven decades available for all event space elements of one category n events we set up a 8 n matrix o of observations the central question now arising is are there characteristic patterns to the sequences towards target day or are the totals arbitrarily distributed the answer depends on the symmetric tensor oo i e o times o transpose since its eigen directions resulting from the secular equation are the sought total sequences cis hence we can address the above hypothesis by analyzing and depicting them see figs 2 7 the theory of second order symmetric tensors is identical to those of quadratic forms duschek and hochrainer 1946 which in physics generally represent energy expressions e g potential and kinetic energy in mechanics deformation work in statics magnetic and electric energy in electrotechnology zurmühl 1950 the second order symmetric tensor oo and its mathematically inherent form contains all weather observations in terms of total sequences preceding considered hazard events hazard weather observations and thereby all physics recorded at this linkage now form tensor and eigen directions are canonically linked on one hand eigen directions are invariant under tensor operations and on the other hand taken as basis they display form and tensor in their main axis and diagonal representation the eigen directions are in our context the canonical total sequences it is worth noting that the canonical total sequences shown in figs 2 7 result from an analysis in meteorology and several other applied fields called empirical orthogonal function analysis eof e g von storch and zwiers 1999 a multivariate statistical analysis tool of great use in applications especially when dealing with incomplete inaccurate data amongst the most prominent eof applications is perhaps that of successively observed surface level air pressure slp across the north atlantic and europe there the analysis yields pattern eofs which together with their temporal coefficients aka pcs e g preisendorfer et al 1988 represent the atmosphere s dynamic north atlantic oszillation trenberth and paolino 1981 the first eof of slp over the northern hemisphere the arctic oscillation and its dynamics is perhaps even better known hurrell 1995 kutzbach 1970 with an eof analysis one achieves two important goals at once i the physics observed through eofs and their time coefficients pcs as well as ii avoidance of erroneous information by disregarding small eigenvalues evs for these features the eof analysis is popular both of them result from the eofs orthogonality in textbooks eofs are usually introduced by explicit construction because it only requires very basic skills in mathematics that way e g peixoto and oort 1992 von storch and navarra 1999 zorita and von storch 1999 that is perfectly all right but makes some readers believe eofs orthogonality which is used in this construction is arbitrary and that is wrong in fact the pattern s orthogonality is mathematically inherent since oo is a symmetric second order tensor identical theory to euclidean geometry which we obviously use to observe to measure objects duschek 1963 duschek and hochrainer 1950 3 results and discussion 3 1 compilation of the event space in this section we follow the steps carried out towards the compilation of the event space and shortly point out its main features that are on the one hand inherited from the authorities cadastres introduced above and generated on the other hand by means of their aggregation amongst the significant features taken over from the cadastres three stand out the period covered i e about seven decades from 1950 onwards the regions and their spatial extent that are to be supervised by the authorities for their legal obligations and the equivalence of the hazards processes to be monitored to acquire their targets ultimately it is the combination of these traits allowing all results presented here and these in turn are of importance for decision makers realizing sustainable civil protection strategies geared to climate driven challenges induced by changing hazard frequencies and intensities throughout the decades to come until 2100 all findings achieved here depend on their comprehensive content extending over seven decades these results could not have been derived from data that only began in the 2000s when climate change was already known and altered extreme events became popular these data are too short the technical challenges of compiling the event space have not been any different than they are in general known to all involved in the merging of information from different sources data formats arrangement of information etc the only general lesson is the indispensability of patience continuous inquiring accuracy and dedication however it is worth mentioning that the classification processes in table 1 used by the authorities to accomplish their legal tasks have been introduced thoughtfully such that they split internationally common categories c f heiser et al 2015 or allow for their straightforward assignment to these hence there was no complication to be experienced in this regard table 2 shows internationally common categories and how pertaining events are distributed over the above introduced orographical distinct provinces fig 1 floodings to begin with are made up by wlv s fluviatile sediment transport debris flow like transport floods and viola s continuous rain flash floods combines viola s surface water heavy precipitation events and thunderstorms with wlv s surface water slides aggregates wlv s sub categories rotational slides and translational slides as well as gba s and viola s correspondences i e slides flows contains gba s and viola s equivalents i e flows as well as wlv s mud flows shallow landslides and earth and debris flows reflecting just a further distinction falls consists of gba s and viola s falls as well as wlv s individual blocks and large blocks while finally category others acts as a reservoir for sparsely occupied and undifferentiated processes the above described integration of the three most extensive national damage process databases wlv gba viola which is accomplished here for the first time results in an event space made up of internationally used categories e g hungr et al 2001 2013 varnes 1978 this event space provides an unprecedented scope of hazard processes i e about 20 000 occurrences in terms of floodings flash floods slides flows and falls covering a significant part of the european alps the captured outstanding extent of events does not only allow for the examination of weather sequences driving floodings and landslides but to do so in their various appearances mentioned above as well as in the three regions see fig 1 3 2 derivation of cis throughout the past seven decades several thousand hazard events have been recorded within each region and every category based on this statistically robust setup we investigate temporal total sequences extending over eight days including the target day preceding hazard occurrences figs 2 through 7 below refer to floodings slides and flash floods for different regions these are presented in a standardized layout their upper rows depict from left to right 1 share of variances explained displayed in a scree plot compagnucci and salles 1997 horn 1965 2 the fraction of hazard occurrences recorded in this region and finally 3 the distribution of totals accumulating over the 8 day sequences the figures bottom line illustrates from left to right the three leading eofs temporal pattern i e the canonical transformation s temporal total sequences triggering damage processes the color of the figures frames correspond to the region investigated as can be seen in fig 1 note that the scree plot refers to the fraction of physics contained in all observed precipitation processes represented by their eof pattern a gap between the values corresponding to eofs of increasing number or a change in the course indicates the appropriate number of eofs to retain in the subsequent analyses while there are in fact a number of criteria for deciding the number of eofs used to capture the signal from the rest containing noise we decided by scree plots to retain three eofs in each shown case the results for floodings in the northern lowlands 666 events fig 2 and in the alpine territory 4884 events fig 3 display a clearly visible difference between the most frequently attained sequence total first row rightmost panel between the alpine topography and the northern plains while this value reaches 35 mm in nl the corresponding amount in at is 30 mm this seems to match with expectations related to the regions distinct orography and thus pertaining catchment area sizes concerning the explained variances of the leading eofs there is no significant difference between the regions 40 and 43 however the patterns themselves differ obviously floodings in nl are triggered by sequences exhibiting a steep increase in daily totals from td 2 until process occurrence in contrast at s leading precipitation totals are starting a continuous rise from td 4 until td 1 followed by a slight decrease at the target day the course of the second leading patterns 23 and 30 for the corresponding explained variances respectively somehow reverses that of the first and come with clearly larger daily sums from the sequences beginning up to td 3 the explained variances 14 and 10 pertaining to the third canonical total sequences triggering floodings make up already only a quarter of those associated with the first and hence carry accordingly less importance however unlike above discussed eofs their runs highlight the first half of the sequences towards td whereby nl s has its maximum sum on td 5 and at s on td 3 this may be related to rather different sizes of the regions catchment areas the captured behavior of floodings in the southern basin chain sb not shown is much alike with the one obtained for nl figs 4 and 5 depict findings for slides in the southern basin chain 650 events and across the alpine territory 1965 events slides generally happen in open terrain and tear off particularly along edges like those brought by forest roads favoring infiltration processes the explained variances of the leading sequences are rather different showing values of 32 and 53 their courses of daily sums on the other hand share some similarities in terms of overall appearances these are reaching their maximum sums at td 1 and generally rising totals towards them as well as decline afterwards this indicates a one day time lag between weather development and the thereby initiated hazard process that is related to the soil moisture this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a delayed reaction as opposed to an instantly triggered slide directly caused by high rainfall intensity second eofs exhibit explained variances of 18 and 21 in sb and at respectively developments of totals are in both cases different from those just mentioned here precipitation sums take on their minima one and two days prior the event in sb and at while both attain their maxima at td itself i e instant trigger in experts terms the difference between instant and delayed hazard initiation may arise from geological conditions as well as differences in the water saturation of the soil in this context instant and delayed slides ought to be anticipated with flysch and calcareous substrate large totals reached from td 3 backwards may highlight the importance of infiltration and saturation processes acting as prerequisites of slides this characteristic also stands out in case of the third patterns featuring explained variances of 15 and 9 respectively sufficient moisture penetration slowly propagates towards sliding layers in all sliding processes generally slides occur delayed when penetration has reached so called critical depths which depend on the actual slide mightiness total sequences in the northern lowlands share obvious similarity with those of sb just mentioned figs 6 and 7 refer to results of category flash floods within the northern lowlands 1816 events and the alpine territory 2965 events the first patterns having sudden and pronounced maxima on td mirror the definition of flash floods merz and blöschl nied et al 2014 in at however the explained variance is considerably larger than that of nl 58 versus 40 second eofs 2 for nl and 13 in at again reverse the temporal order of minimum and maximum totals compared to the leading sequences apart from that at s pattern attains the largest daily sum on td 1 whereas in nl on td 2 this was already the case for floodings such as the fact that they come with larger daily sums until td 1 unlike in all other cases shown third total sequences show reflected behaviour in between the regions sums in nl show an overall increase up to td 1 whereas at s pattern features rather large totals from the beginning until td 2 followed by its minimum and somewhat more precipitation on td the relative gap between the explained variances stays approximately the same as that before results for flash flood in the southern basin chain show close resemblance to those in the alpine territory the main statement of the whole study standing out from all examinations and analyses is the significance and uniqueness of total sequences tied to each single hazard category region pairing totaling up to 18 cis three regions with four and two categories for landslides and floodings respectively as such our hypothesis related to the question whether it is possible or not to derive characteristic total sequences cis for various hazard categories prior threat occurrence may therefore be decided the claim that there is no detectable difference between successions of daily total sequences either inducing the same hazard floodings and landslides in various categories in topographically distinct regions or triggering different hazards within the same region has to be rejected so the event space generated and the eigen directions of our quadratic form comprising the physics through all observations allow to objectively determine canonical cis total sequences triggering damage processes the validity of the region specific cis despite their inner variability due to their geological physiographical and geomorphological conditions land cover and soil types etc reveals its subsidiary status the validity of the hazard sensitive cis in between regions on the other hand illustrates their statistical robustness it is perhaps worth mentioning that none of our findings here contradict or render obsolete already established cis the current outcomes only add to the research achievements of those for instance discussed throughout this paper as well as by caine 1980 and martelloni et al 2012 who managed to continuously improve landslide threshold levels in various regions across italy by enlarging the body of rainfall landslides information and enhancing analysis techniques these endeavors are highly relevant in terms of public protection for instance because landslides perpetrate substantial economic losses and high numbers of fatalities in terms of floodings which are addressed here too the accurate estimation of extreme precipitation totals and the proper simulation of their effects are decisively contributing to civil protection as well papaioannou et al 2018 scofield and kuligowski 2003 results derived in this study are to be used by responsible decision makers for the purpose of public protection as well as safeguarding critical infrastructure together with ensembles of downscaled climate change projections driven by different pathways of mankind they serve as cornerstone for sustainable strategies assembling bundles of protection measures that are to be effective modularly extendable combinable with structures already in effect and cheap to maintain aside from their importance for establishing sustainable protection strategies they are subject to close collaboration with european freight and logistics leaders forum s members in order to secure their business 4 outlook future work will focus on the application of cis to empirically statistically as well as dynamically downscaled ensembles of climate change projections driven by various pathways of mankind this shall enable decision makers in charge to develop sustainable strategies for e g public protection and safeguarding critical infrastructure geared to future climate conditions expected throughout the decades to come other goals worth to attain refer to case studies focusing on subsidiary effects to differentiate between seasons and to investigate whether the actual extent of landslides reveals geomorphological fingerprints and can be allocated to rapid or delayed initiation aside from these aims we set out together with those in charge to integrate findings into early warning systems as cis derived in this study exhibit daily resolution stretch a period of 8 days and are characteristic for combinations of hazard process and region at nl sb thus operationally observed weather developments may be continuously compared to cis without any additional effort in case evolutions match them after e g 5 days enhanced alertness and appropriate preparation protocols may be brought into effect such precautions can buy time when time is most critical 
636,statistical downscaling of gcm simulations is widely used for examining future changes in precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales however the downscaling process is affected by uncertainty associated with the downscaling model its parameters and also the use of different reanalysis products for model calibration this study develops a bayesian approach to calibrating a statistical downscaling model the study investigates the impact of using two different reanalysis products the national centre for environmental prediction national centre for atmospheric research reanalysis 2 ncep2 and the european centre for medium range forecasts interim reanalysis erai in precipitation downscaling over the tibetan plateau a region with sparse ground precipitation coverage the selected reanalysis products are used for modelling precipitation at selected locations with long high quality records and diverse geographic characteristics an assessment of the downscaled precipitation results using atmospheric variables from the access 1 3 gcm to drive the downscaling model calibrated using a reanalysis dataset is also performed and the impact of calibration uncertainty quantified the outcomes of this study reveal that the choice of the data length used and the type of reanalysis product adopted have a significant effect in downscaled precipitation characteristics and their uncertainties such as the wetness fraction and average annual precipitations over the study locations these findings point to a common problem in statistical downscaling applications and one that has not been recognised until now the results show that downscaling model considering erai reproduce observed precipitation attributes to a better extent than ncep2 keywords precipitation uncertainty statistical downscaling bayesian climate change 1 introduction precipitation is a key variable for hydrologic impact studies and for understanding future catchment responses to climate scenarios gcms are widely used for precipitation projections but suffer from a high degree of uncertainty charles et al 2004 fowler et al 2007 hope et al 2006 johnson et al 2011 especially at the catchment scale this uncertainty is considered a significant constraint in derivation of hydrologic variables at the local scale chen et al 2011 tebaldi et al 2011 numerous studies have demonstrated that gcm uncertainty mainly arises from model structural error ensemble error and scenario error hawkins 2011 hawkins and sutton 2011 woldemeskel et al 2012 woldemeskel et al 2016 established a basis for quantifying such uncertainties in space and time and named it as srev square root of error variance eghdamirad et al 2016 quantified the sources of uncertainties in global upper air atmospheric variables which were applied for downscaling of precipitation in tibetan plateau these uncertainties are amplified when considering predictions at finer spatial and temporal scale that are frequently needed for understanding climate change impacts in hydrology for example kannan et al 2014 found significant uncertainty from multiple reanalysis data usage in precipitation downscaling and downscaled monsoon precipitation changes was spatially heterogeneous although changes in the gcm outputs were spatially uniform to address uncertainty from multiple spatial resolutions shashikanth et al 2014 compared downscaled precipitation at different spatial resolutions and compute signal to noise ratio snr which denotes the signal of climate change in regard to the noise from multi model uncertainty they found that there is no significant change in snr for a change in data resolution and increased resolution did not improve the snr of climate projections several downscaling approaches have been developed to translate climate model outputs from a coarse resolution to a catchment scale chandler and wheater 2002 fu et al 2013 jeong et al 2014 mehrotra and sharma 2006 rashid et al 2016 wilby et al 2014 these include dynamical and statistical downscaling methods rocheta et al 2017 thatcher and mcgregor 2009 wilby et al 2003 and use bias corrected atmospheric variable simulations as the basis for assessing changes in the future dynamical downscaling uses gcm regional simulations to drive a fine scale physical model to transfer the effects of large scale climate processes to regional or local scales of interest in statistical downscaling observed relationships between local climate variable s and large scale atmospheric variables are used these models are simpler to use and better suited to capture climate change scenarios at finer temporal and spatial scales as a result of which many statistical downscaling methods exist these vary from simple linear regression based models to data driven artificial neural network ann and weather state based models although a wide variety of statistical precipitation downscaling models have been applied in

projected precipitation area averages using a statistical regional model for daily precipitation across tibet three downscaling alternatives the statistical downscaling model sdsm the generalised linear model for daily climate glimclim and non homogeneous hidden markov model nhmm were applied by hu et al 2013 for daily precipitation over the yellow river source region they found that sdsm and glimclim showed better performance in reproducing temporal dependence although nhmm showed better performance in reproducing spatial correlation xu et al 2009 studied the response of streamflow to climate change at a headwater catchment in the yellow river basin considering sdsm and delta methods for daily temperature and precipitation downscaling both sdsm and delta techniques agree with the observed data reasonably well in their study the sdsm statistical downscaling model statistical downscaling model is a widely used technique proposed by wilby et al 2002 it includes deterministic transformations as well as stochastic components and is a combination of a stochastic weather generator and multiple linear regression models between large scale atmospheric variables and local scale

vector machine ssvm and sdsm gcms and hydrological models they concluded that sdsm had better applicability than ssvm in downscaling precipitation but results for runoff simulations using sdsm downscaled precipitation were poorer than that using ssvm downscaled precipitation however sdsm is known to have low explained variance in reproducing daily precipitation statistics wilby et al 2003

possible to procure and when information on the state of the climate on a defined grid is necessary mooney et al 2011 a variety of reanalysis products are available while reanalyses have the advantage that they offer a more comprehensive representation of the dynamics of the earth s atmosphere different reanalysis products show discrepancies especially at regional scales moalafhi et al 2016 moalafhi et al 2017 used reanalysis datasets to explore its influence on dynamical downscaling using the weather research and forecasting wrf regional climate model over southern africa they found that precipitation tends to be overestimated over the domain considered although temperature was downscaled accurately depending on the reanalysis dataset being adopted overall it is clear that downscaled products are likely impacted by uncertainties in the downscaling approach used this may arise due to uncertainty in the observed data used to estimate the downscaled model parameters i e the reanalysis data set uncertainties in the selected downscaling model structure or in the model parameters to date the impact of these uncertainties in different downscaling case studies is not well

to our knowledge this is the first attempt at quantifying and characterising reanalysis data uncertainty in statistical downscaling models of precipitation the framework of the study is multi fold in the first part we characterise the uncertainty in downscaling model parameters using alternate reanalysis datasets and observed precipitation at selected point locations by means of bayesian inference

downscaling model sdsm is based on the concept of a multiple linear regression mlr that use atmospheric variables as predictors and provides precipitation occurrence or amount at daily or monthly timescales as a response variable wilby et al 2014 2002 sdsm generates multiple precipitation ensembles from which the uncertainty across attributes of interest can be quantified wilby et al 2002 describe the general formulation of sdsm described in eqs 1 and 2 where output represent precipitation occurrence as well as prcipitation amount respectively and inputs are large scale atmospheric predictors table 2 of 15 stations sdsm characterises precipitation as consisting of a precipitation occurrence and a precipitation amount process each of these processes is simulated probabilistically using an assumed functional form based on the selection of relevant predictor variables the precipitation occurrence model operates as 1 w i b 0 j 1 n b j y ij 0 w i 1 where wi wet day occurrence probability on day i from which an occurrence state is sampled and yij j th predictor variable reanalysis and gcm variables on day i each wet day is then used to calculate the precipitation amount via

through the parameter estimation step the residual term ε i is written as 3 ε i v i f z i s e d where zi random variate from a standard normal distribution se standard error of model d model bias and

mean of modelled precipitation varobs is the variance of observed precipitation varmod is the variance of modelled precipitation estimated at the time scale daily or monthly the model is specified at here modelled precipitation comes from downscaling model outputs based on reanalysis or gcm derived predictors the term vif changes the variance of the downscaled precipitation series by increasing the variability of the noise term ε i in 2 for calibration period where we use only reanalysis data d 0 and vif 1 the data from 1979 to 1996 is used to formulate the model and calibrate the model parameters whereas data from 1997 to 2005 is used for model validation 3 2 predictor variable selection in this study 15 large scale atmospheric variables are selected from ncep2 and erai reanalysis datasets for screening potential predictor variables as shown in table 2 the choice of atmospheric variables used for downscaling table 2 arises from previous assessments and is based on both the stability these variables exhibit across gcms in a future climatic setting eghdamirad et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2009 and the relationship they exhibit with the response variable of interest sharma and mehrotra 2014 these predictor variable choices are consistent with previous studies hu et al 2013 xu et al 2009 and are established choices for statistical downscaling in different climatic regimes mehrotra and sharma 2011 tavakol davani et al 2013 correlation coefficients using the pearson spearman s ρ and partial correlation and the partial mutual information sharma and mehrotra 2014 using the npred toolkit sharma et al 2016 were ascertained to identify sets of significant predictors for precipitation downscaling table 2 represents the overall list of variables that were identified across each of the response precipitation locations this study considers 3 3 bayesian inference bayesian inference is commonly used for calibration of model parameters with uncertainty and has been applied extensively in hydrologic model specification studies jeremiah et al 2011 marshall et al 2006 smith et al 2015 the approach combines existing knowledge about model parameters and the information in the data to develop probabilistic parameter estimates if we let θ denote the model parameters total number of identified atmospheric predictors plus one for constant term and one for variance term of sdsm model and let x denote the observed precipitation data then eq 6 describes uncertainty about θ probabilistically after observing data x 6 p θ x p θ x p x p θ p x θ p x where p θ x is the distribution of θ given x referred to as the posterior distribution which allows one to statistically quantify the uncertainty about θ after observing x p θ x is the joint probability distribution for θ and x p θ is the distribution of θ before collecting data representing prior knowledge of θ also known as the prior distribution p x θ is the likelihood function stating the distribution of the data x given the unknown θ and expressing the relationship between model and data for inferring errors and p x is a normalising constant a uniform prior distribution is used in this study to fit the precipitation downscaling model in a bayesian framework an integrated likelihood for precipitation occurrence and amount is proposed in eq 7 which was applied by smith et al 2015 to follow an error model for ephemeral streams a modelling task analogous to the intermittent precipitation occurrence and amount process of interest here the underlying assumptions of this likelihood are that model error is independent and homoscedastic while the distribution of the errors is assumed to be gaussian 7 l i n 1 log p n 2 log 1 p n 2 2 log 2 π σ 2 t 2 1 n 2 ε t 2 2 2 σ 2 n 3 2 log 2 π σ 2 t 3 1 n 3 ε t 3 2 2 σ 2 here l i is integrated likelihood ε represent residuals observed data minus modelled data n1 is the number of zero precipitation values with zero error n2 is the number of zero values with nonzero error n3 is the number of nonzero observations σ is the standard deviation of precipitation and p n 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 readers are referred to smith et al 2015 for a derivation of the likelihood function in 7 to evaluate the fitness of the proposed likelihood function a residual plot along with an estimate of the filliben r statistic filliben 1975 in a calibration period at station 1 is showed in fig 1 the filliben statistic is used to measure the linearity of quantile quantile plots the statistic approaches 1 0 when the quantile quantile plots become more linear linearity of a quantile quantile plot and a symmetrically shaped histogram plot generally disclose characteristics of a gaussian distribution smith et al 2015 fig 1 a suggests mostly homoscedastic residuals the quantile quantile plot of residuals indicate that a majority of the errors in the range 4 mm to 2 mm follow a gaussian distribution a good fit between standard normal residuals and quantiles of simulated rainfall residuals in fig 1 b correspondingly the filliben r statistic shows a higher value residuals are auto correlated in few lags although we also found that there is no autocorrelation when zero rainfall days are excluded from the analysis however a heavier tail is evident for residuals in the higher range 2 mm to 4 mm this suggests that the downscaling model might underestimate the frequency magnitude of larger rainfall events fig 1 a as the residuals larger than 2 mm do not follow a gaussian assumption fig 1 a b 3 4 approach markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter sampling is a convenient way to implement bayesian inference for models where the posterior distribution is analytically intractable marshall et al 2006 mcmc generates samples of the parameter values from the posterior distribution by simulating a random process that has the posterior distribution as its stationary distribution marshall et al 2004 the adaptive metropolis am algorithm haario et al 2001 has been used for mcmc simulation in this study it is characterised by a multivariate normal proposal distribution including mean at the current parameter value and varying covariance the proposal covariance matrix is updated at each iteration based on the covariance matrix of the sampled parameter values in the parameter chain to that point following the eq 8 8 b t b o t t o h d cov α o α t 1 h d ε i d t t o where bt is the proposal covariance bo is arbitrary initial covariance ε is small value to confirm bt does not singular id is identity matrix and hd is scaling parameter for reasonable acceptance rates of the proposed states for drawing the posterior distribution a full mcmc run is started by proposing initial parameters values from a prior distribution with sequential values as the iteration proceeds from a proposal distribution centred at the parameter value in the preceding iteration the chain is run following the acceptance probability of β parameters are accepted when β is greater than a generated uniform random number here β is defined as 9 β min 1 0 proposed likelihood current likelihood the mcmc algorithm was run for 50 000 iterations on each dataset in order to properly characterise the posterior distribution and achieve convergence from a visual inspection of the sampled parameters and their means marshall et al 2004 the sampled parameters convergence was diagnosed after approximately 10 000 iterations for each dataset the bayesian information criteria bic of schwarz 1978 which analytically approximates the marginal likelihood and the deviance information criteria dic of spiegelhalter et al 2002 balance model fit and complexity to compare the downscaling model considering both erai and ncep2 reanalysis data sets we compare the bic and dic estimates the bic is defined as 10 b i c k 2 l k θ k l o g n lk is the negative log likelihood θk is the number of parameters and bick is the bayesian information criteria for model k the best model is one that minimises the bic marshall et al 2005 the dic is defined as 11 d i c d θ 2 p d where d θ is the bayesian deviance pd is effective number of parameters however for a flat prior the approximation d θ 2 l o g l θ and pd p ellison 2004 pooley and marion 2018 van der linde 2005 ward 2008 may be assumed lower dic values represent a better model spiegelhalter et al 2002 4 results and discussions 4 1 analysis of model parameter uncertainty with data length bayesian inference characterises the uncertainty in model parameters via their posterior distribution rather than a single best fit parameter set in this study it is used to characterise uncertainty in the downscaling model parameters obtained using different reanalysis datasets fig 2 shows ratio of posterior variance and prior variance of model parameters as a function of sample length used in model calibration period at station 1 significant variations in the posterior variance of the model parameters with the variation in the data length highlights the importance of using long samples in establishing sdsm parameters for applications both models show similar variability with increased data length for all atmospheric variables posterior distribution of all parameters in calibration period ascertained using kernel density estimation bowman and azzalini 1997 for station 1 are presented in fig 3 significant differences are apparent among reanalysis datasets in the plots although the uncertainty between relative humidity at 500hpa rh500 of erai and ncep2 is comparatively less than other reanalysis variables which might be due to better association between atmospheric variables rh500 of erai and ncep2 correlation coefficient 0 92 in order to explore if the differences in the parameters values across both datasets have any physical relevance we plot these differences with respect to station elevations fig 4 showed differences of maximum log likelihood higher maximum likelihood means better agreement with observed precipitation across different elevations which were determined by subtracting maximum log likelihood of ncep2 from erai in different stations notable maximum log likelihood differences are visible at all stations across different elevations these fluctuations might be due to the variations of atmospheric variables of erai and ncep2 across elevations in this region this indicates that the downscaling model developed for these stations will have significant differences across the two reanalysis datasets along elevations hence impacting the simulations obtained for future climates to investigate the contribution of downscaling parameters uncertainty in downscaled precipitation we considered two cases using a single reanalysis dataset ncep2 at station 1 as the aim is to assess the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the first case a single maximum likelihood parameter set was ascertained and 2000 downscaling replicates generated this case termed a is analogous to how sdsm is used in most applications to assess the impact of uncertainty in case b 2000 parameter sets from the posterior distribution of sdsm were taken and a single downscaling replicate generated for each any differences between case a and b are now solely a function of the parameter uncertainty that exists within sdsm fig 5 a and b present wetness fraction of downscaled precipitation for cases a and b at station 1 respectively results of case b exhibit more variations than case a similarly fig 5c and d show standard deviation of downscaled precipitation for case a and case b respectively remarkable variability is seen in fig 5d than fig 5c these differing results highlight the influence of parameter uncertainty and or downscaling model structure rigidity on the downscaled precipitation this added variability has significant implications in a range of hydrologic applications 4 2 implications of using different reanalysis datasets for downscaling this section will discuss variations in the few important characteristics of the downscaled daily precipitations from posterior distributions across different datasets and locations in validation period 1997 2005 this assessment is based on the 2000 downscaled simulations reported in case b in the results in fig 5 reproduction of mean wetness fraction standard deviation and average annual precipitation are essential in simulating the water balance in any modelling exercise in which downscaled precipitation may be used important downscaled precipitation attributes expressed as anomalies observed precipitation attribute downscaled precipitation attribute using alternate reanalysis datasets are presented in fig 6 wetness fraction results showed few variations across different stations except for station 11 both erai and ncep2 showed good agreement for wetness fraction with observed rainfall at station 11 in this station relative humidity at 500hpa of both erai and ncep2 exhibits better correlation with observed rainfall correlation coefficient 0 51 than other predictors this could explain the improved representation of precipitation that is offered in comparison to other locations where this relationship is not as strong standard deviations at different stations showed some variations whereas average annual precipitation exhibited remarkable differences across alternate reanalysis it is interesting that at station 10 differences in average annual precipitation is the highest across the two reanalyses while in station 11 differences in average annual precipitation is lowest this might be due to the non stationarity in the predictor predicted relationships which can result in region or station specific biases in derived precipitation fields at almost all stations ncep2 generated higher standard deviation anomaly and average annual precipitation anomaly than erai which indicates higher variability of atmospheric variables and downscaling model parameters of ncep2 although average annual precipitation anomaly of erai is higher at station 2 and station 15 respectively 4 3 assessment of downscaled precipitation of gcm variables over the observed period further it is also of interest to look into the downscaled precipitation results when the climate variables of a gcm are bias corrected using individual reanalysis datasets and are used to drive the downscaling model this evaluation is again based on the 2000 downscaled ensembles in the validation period daily precipitation was obtained using identified atmospheric variables of access 1 3 gcm and downscaling coefficients of alternate reanalysis datasets in a bayesian setting fig 7 presents boxplots of wetness fraction daily standard deviation and average annual downscaled precipitation of gcm access 1 3 at station 1 the ranges of wetness fraction standard deviation and average annual precipitation vary markedly within and across both datasets in same location important downscaled precipitation attributes anomaly of access 1 3 obtained using erai and ncep2 reanalysis variables for all stations were presented in fig 8 wetness fraction and average annual precipitation shows noteworthy discrepancies at different stations in station 4 differences in average annual precipitation is the highest while in station 8 differences in average annual precipitation is the lowest this is might be due to variability in downscaling model parameters which interfere to capture local climatic features well here access 1 3 is also following the same pattern of reanalysis downscaling i e ncep2 shows higher standard deviation anomaly and average annual precipitation anomaly than erai whereas average annual precipitation anomaly of erai is higher at station 15 4 4 comparison of precipitation downscaling model considering bic deviance information criteria dic and bayesian information criteria bic values for the downscaling model using erai and ncep2 reanalysis are presented in table 3 in all the stations both the dic and bic of ncep2 is higher than erai although the bic of erai is higher than ncep2 in station 8 due to a lower likelihood better agreement with observed precipitation hence the downscaling model considering erai can be considered to be comparatively closer to observed precipitation than ncep2 except station 8 5 conclusions recent research has evaluated the sources of uncertainty in gcms and it is clear that these uncertainties are likely to propagate through to case studies making use of gcm products for understanding the impacts of future changes in climate in developing downscaled models for such studies the uncertainties associated with the input reanalysis calibration data the model parameters and the model itself are less well known this study develops a bayesian framework for the assessment of the relative performance of commonly used reanalysis products under uncertainty for precipitation downscaling across the tibetan plateau overall the approach presented here is general and flexible allowing investigation into the impact of uncertainty on key precipitation variables of interest for water resource studies by characterising the posterior distribution of model parameters it is evident that the length of data available to specify parameters can have a significant impact on the total parameter uncertainty significant differences in precipitation attributes are observed when calibrating models with different reanalysis data sets the uncertainties in the calibrated model propagate through to analyses for downscaled precipitation from gcm access 1 3 and when compounded with the uncertainty in the input gcm data it is likely these uncertainties will persist when used for a variety of water resource management applications highlighting the importance of such uncertainty estimation we note that the some part of the uncertainty may be as a result of the structure of the downscaling model used here use of another downscaling model where the relationship between predictor and predictand is non linear might help reducing the across the datasets uncertainty and this will be the subject of future investigation different resolution of reanalysis datasets also might have influenced the results acknowledgements review comments by the editors and reviewers of this article led to

636,statistical downscaling of gcm simulations is widely used for examining future changes in precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales however the downscaling process is affected by uncertainty associated with the downscaling model its parameters and also the use of different reanalysis products for model calibration this study develops a bayesian approach to calibrating a statistical downscaling model the study investigates the impact of using two different reanalysis products the national centre for environmental prediction national centre for atmospheric research reanalysis 2 ncep2 and the european centre for medium range forecasts interim reanalysis erai in precipitation downscaling over the tibetan plateau a region with sparse ground precipitation coverage the selected reanalysis products are used for modelling precipitation at selected locations with long high quality records and diverse geographic characteristics an assessment of the downscaled precipitation results using atmospheric variables from the access 1 3 gcm to drive the downscaling model calibrated using a reanalysis dataset is also performed and the impact of calibration uncertainty quantified the outcomes of this study reveal that the choice of the data length used and the type of reanalysis product adopted have a significant effect in downscaled precipitation characteristics and their uncertainties such as the wetness fraction and average annual precipitations over the study locations these findings point to a common problem in statistical downscaling applications and one that has not been recognised until now the results show that downscaling model considering erai reproduce observed precipitation attributes to a better extent than ncep2 keywords precipitation uncertainty statistical downscaling bayesian climate change 1 introduction precipitation is a key variable for hydrologic impact studies and for understanding future catchment responses to climate scenarios gcms are widely used for precipitation projections but suffer from a high degree of uncertainty charles et al 2004 fowler et al 2007 hope et al 2006 johnson et al 2011 especially at the catchment scale this uncertainty is considered a significant constraint in derivation of hydrologic variables at the local scale chen et al 2011 tebaldi et al 2011 numerous studies have demonstrated that gcm uncertainty mainly arises from model structural error ensemble error and scenario error hawkins 2011 hawkins and sutton 2011 woldemeskel et al 2012 woldemeskel et al 2016 established a basis for quantifying such uncertainties in space and time and named it as srev square root of error variance eghdamirad et al 2016 quantified the sources of uncertainties in global upper air atmospheric variables which were applied for downscaling of precipitation in tibetan plateau these uncertainties are amplified when considering predictions at finer spatial and temporal scale that are frequently needed for understanding climate change impacts in hydrology for example kannan et al 2014 found significant uncertainty from multiple reanalysis data usage in precipitation downscaling and downscaled monsoon precipitation changes was spatially heterogeneous although changes in the gcm outputs were spatially uniform to address uncertainty from multiple spatial resolutions shashikanth et al 2014 compared downscaled precipitation at different spatial resolutions and compute signal to noise ratio snr which denotes the signal of climate change in regard to the noise from multi model uncertainty they found that there is no significant change in snr for a change in data resolution and increased resolution did not improve the snr of climate projections several downscaling approaches have been developed to translate climate model outputs from a coarse resolution to a catchment scale chandler and wheater 2002 fu et al 2013 jeong et al 2014 mehrotra and sharma 2006 rashid et al 2016 wilby et al 2014 these include dynamical and statistical downscaling methods rocheta et al 2017 thatcher and mcgregor 2009 wilby et al 2003 and use bias corrected atmospheric variable simulations as the basis for assessing changes in the future dynamical downscaling uses gcm regional simulations to drive a fine scale physical model to transfer the effects of large scale climate processes to regional or local scales of interest in statistical downscaling observed relationships between local climate variable s and large scale atmospheric variables are used these models

parameters whereas data from 1997 to 2005 is used for model validation 3 2 predictor variable selection in this study 15 large scale atmospheric variables are selected from ncep2 and erai reanalysis datasets for screening potential predictor variables as shown in table 2 the choice of atmospheric variables used for downscaling table 2 arises from previous assessments and is based on both the stability these variables exhibit across gcms in a future climatic setting eghdamirad et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2009 and the relationship they exhibit with the response variable of interest sharma and mehrotra 2014 these predictor variable choices are consistent with previous studies hu et al 2013 xu et al 2009 and are established choices for statistical downscaling in different climatic regimes mehrotra and sharma 2011 tavakol davani et al 2013 correlation coefficients using the pearson spearman s ρ and partial correlation and the partial mutual information sharma and mehrotra 2014 using the npred toolkit sharma et al 2016 were ascertained to identify sets of significant predictors for precipitation downscaling table 2 represents the overall list of variables that were identified across each of the response precipitation locations this study considers 3 3 bayesian inference bayesian inference is commonly used for calibration of model parameters with uncertainty and has been applied extensively in hydrologic model specification studies jeremiah et al 2011 marshall et al 2006 smith et al 2015 the approach combines existing knowledge about model parameters and the information in the data to develop probabilistic parameter estimates if we let θ denote the model parameters total number of identified atmospheric predictors plus one for constant term and one for variance term of sdsm model and let x denote the observed precipitation data then eq 6 describes uncertainty about θ probabilistically after observing data x 6 p θ x p θ x p x p θ p x θ p x where p θ x is the distribution of θ given x referred to as the posterior distribution which allows one to statistically quantify the uncertainty about θ after observing x p θ x is the joint probability distribution for θ and x p θ is the distribution of θ before collecting data representing prior knowledge of θ also known as the prior distribution p x θ is the likelihood function stating the distribution of the data x given the unknown θ and expressing the relationship between model and data for inferring errors and p x is a normalising constant a uniform prior distribution is used in this study to fit the precipitation downscaling model in a bayesian framework an integrated likelihood for precipitation occurrence and amount is proposed in eq 7 which was applied by smith et al 2015 to follow an error model for ephemeral streams a modelling task analogous to the intermittent precipitation occurrence and amount process of interest here the underlying assumptions of this likelihood are that model error is independent and homoscedastic while the distribution of the errors is assumed to be gaussian 7 l i n 1 log p n 2 log 1 p n 2 2 log 2 π σ 2 t 2 1 n 2 ε t 2 2 2 σ 2 n 3 2 log 2 π σ 2 t 3 1 n 3 ε t 3 2 2 σ 2 here l i is integrated likelihood ε represent residuals observed data minus modelled data n1 is the number of zero precipitation values with zero error n2 is the number of zero values with nonzero error n3 is the number of nonzero observations σ is the standard deviation of precipitation and p n 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 readers are referred to smith et al 2015 for a derivation of the likelihood function in 7 to evaluate the fitness of the proposed likelihood function a residual plot along with an estimate of the filliben r statistic filliben 1975 in a calibration period at station 1 is showed in fig 1 the filliben statistic is used to measure the linearity of quantile quantile plots the statistic approaches 1 0 when the quantile quantile plots become more linear linearity of a quantile quantile plot and a symmetrically shaped histogram plot generally disclose characteristics of a gaussian distribution smith et al 2015 fig 1 a suggests mostly homoscedastic residuals the quantile quantile plot of residuals indicate that a majority of the errors in the range 4 mm to 2 mm follow a gaussian distribution a good fit between standard normal residuals and quantiles of simulated rainfall residuals in fig 1 b correspondingly the filliben r statistic shows a higher value residuals are auto correlated in few lags although we also found that there is no autocorrelation when zero rainfall days are excluded from the analysis however a heavier tail is evident for residuals in the higher range 2 mm to 4 mm this suggests that the downscaling model might underestimate the frequency magnitude of larger rainfall events fig 1 a as the residuals larger than 2 mm do not follow a gaussian assumption fig 1 a b 3 4 approach markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter sampling is a convenient way to implement bayesian inference for models where the posterior distribution is analytically intractable marshall et al 2006 mcmc generates samples of the parameter values from the posterior distribution by simulating a random process that has the posterior distribution as its stationary distribution marshall et al 2004 the adaptive metropolis am algorithm haario et al 2001 has been used for mcmc simulation in this study it is characterised by a multivariate normal proposal distribution including mean at the current parameter value and varying covariance the proposal covariance matrix is updated at each iteration based on the covariance matrix of the sampled parameter values in the parameter chain to that point following the eq 8 8 b t b o t t o h d cov α o α t 1 h d ε i d t t o where bt is the proposal covariance bo is arbitrary initial covariance ε is small value to confirm bt does not singular id is identity matrix and hd is scaling parameter for reasonable acceptance rates of the proposed states for drawing the posterior distribution a full mcmc run is started by proposing initial parameters values from a prior distribution with sequential values as the iteration proceeds from a proposal distribution centred at the parameter value in the preceding iteration the chain is run following the acceptance probability of β parameters are accepted when β is greater than a generated uniform random number here β is defined as 9 β min 1 0 proposed likelihood current likelihood the mcmc algorithm was run for 50 000 iterations on each dataset in order to properly characterise the posterior distribution and achieve convergence from a visual inspection of the sampled parameters and their means marshall et al 2004 the sampled parameters convergence was diagnosed after approximately 10 000 iterations for each dataset the bayesian information criteria bic of schwarz 1978 which analytically approximates the marginal likelihood and the deviance information criteria dic of spiegelhalter et al 2002 balance model fit and complexity to compare the downscaling model considering both erai and ncep2 reanalysis data sets we compare the bic and dic estimates the bic is defined as 10 b i c k 2 l k θ k l o g n lk is the negative log likelihood θk is the number of parameters and bick is the bayesian information criteria for model k the best model is one that minimises the bic marshall et al 2005 the dic is defined as 11 d i c d θ 2 p d where d θ is the bayesian deviance pd is effective number of parameters however for a flat prior the approximation d θ 2 l o g l θ and pd p ellison 2004 pooley and marion 2018 van der linde 2005 ward 2008 may be assumed lower dic values represent a better model spiegelhalter et al 2002 4 results and discussions 4 1 analysis of model parameter uncertainty with data length bayesian inference characterises the uncertainty in model parameters via their posterior distribution rather than a single best fit parameter set in this study it is used to characterise uncertainty in the downscaling model parameters obtained using different reanalysis datasets fig 2 shows ratio of posterior variance and prior variance of model parameters as a function of sample length used in model calibration period at station 1 significant variations in the posterior variance of the model parameters with the variation in the data length highlights the importance of using long samples in establishing sdsm parameters for applications both models show similar variability with increased data length for all atmospheric variables posterior distribution of all parameters in calibration period ascertained using kernel density estimation bowman and azzalini 1997 for station 1 are presented in fig 3 significant differences are apparent among reanalysis datasets in the plots although the uncertainty between relative humidity at 500hpa rh500 of erai and ncep2 is comparatively less than other reanalysis variables which might be due to better association between atmospheric variables rh500 of erai and ncep2 correlation coefficient 0 92 in order to explore if the differences in the parameters values across both datasets have any physical relevance we plot these differences with respect to station elevations fig 4 showed differences of maximum log likelihood higher maximum likelihood means better agreement with observed precipitation across different elevations which were determined by subtracting maximum log likelihood of ncep2 from erai in different stations notable maximum log likelihood differences are visible at all stations across different elevations these fluctuations might be due to the variations of atmospheric variables of erai and ncep2 across elevations in this region this indicates that the downscaling model developed for these stations will have significant differences across the two reanalysis datasets along elevations hence impacting the simulations obtained for future climates to investigate the contribution of downscaling parameters uncertainty in downscaled precipitation we considered two cases using a single reanalysis dataset ncep2 at station 1 as the aim is to assess the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the first case a single maximum likelihood parameter set was ascertained and 2000 downscaling replicates generated this case termed a is analogous to how sdsm is used in most applications to assess the impact of uncertainty in case b 2000 parameter sets from the posterior distribution of sdsm were taken and a single downscaling replicate generated for each any differences between case a and b are now solely a function of the parameter uncertainty that exists within sdsm fig 5 a and b present wetness fraction of downscaled precipitation for cases a and b at station 1 respectively results of case b exhibit more variations than case a similarly fig 5c and d show standard deviation of downscaled precipitation for case a and case b respectively remarkable variability is seen in fig 5d than fig 5c these differing results highlight the influence of parameter uncertainty and or downscaling model structure rigidity on the downscaled precipitation this added variability has significant implications in a range of hydrologic applications 4 2 implications of using different reanalysis datasets for downscaling this section will discuss variations in the few important characteristics of the downscaled daily precipitations from posterior distributions across different datasets and locations in validation period 1997 2005 this assessment is based on the 2000 downscaled simulations reported in case b in the results in fig 5 reproduction of mean wetness fraction standard deviation and average annual precipitation are essential in simulating the water balance in any modelling exercise in which downscaled precipitation may be used important downscaled precipitation attributes expressed as anomalies observed precipitation attribute downscaled precipitation attribute using alternate reanalysis datasets are presented in fig 6 wetness fraction results showed few variations across different stations except for station 11 both erai and ncep2 showed good agreement for wetness fraction with observed rainfall at station 11 in this station relative humidity at 500hpa of both erai and ncep2 exhibits better correlation with observed rainfall correlation coefficient 0 51 than other predictors this could explain the improved representation of precipitation that is offered in comparison to other locations where this relationship is not as strong standard deviations at different stations showed some variations whereas average annual precipitation exhibited remarkable differences across alternate reanalysis it is interesting that at station 10 differences in average annual precipitation is the highest across the two reanalyses while in station 11 differences in average annual precipitation is lowest this might be due to the non stationarity in the predictor predicted relationships which can result in region or station specific biases in derived precipitation fields at almost all stations ncep2 generated higher standard deviation anomaly and average annual precipitation anomaly than erai which indicates higher variability of atmospheric variables and downscaling model parameters of ncep2 although average annual precipitation anomaly of erai is higher at station 2 and station 15 respectively 4 3 assessment of downscaled precipitation of gcm variables over the observed period further it is also of interest to look into the downscaled precipitation results when the climate variables of a gcm are bias corrected using individual reanalysis datasets and are used to drive the downscaling model this evaluation is again based on the 2000 downscaled ensembles in the validation period daily precipitation was obtained using identified atmospheric variables of access 1 3 gcm and downscaling coefficients of alternate reanalysis datasets in a bayesian setting fig 7 presents boxplots of wetness fraction daily standard deviation and average annual downscaled precipitation of gcm access 1 3 at station 1 the ranges of wetness fraction standard deviation and average annual precipitation vary markedly within and across both datasets in same location important downscaled precipitation attributes anomaly of access 1 3 obtained using erai and ncep2 reanalysis variables for all stations were presented in fig 8 wetness fraction and average annual precipitation shows noteworthy discrepancies at different stations in station 4 differences in average annual precipitation is the highest while in station 8 differences in average annual precipitation is the lowest this is might be due to variability in downscaling model parameters which interfere to capture local climatic features well here access 1 3 is also following the same pattern of reanalysis downscaling i e ncep2 shows higher standard deviation anomaly and average annual precipitation anomaly than erai whereas average annual precipitation anomaly of erai is higher at station 15 4 4 comparison of precipitation downscaling model considering bic deviance information criteria dic and bayesian information criteria bic values for the downscaling model using erai and ncep2 reanalysis are presented in table 3 in all the stations both the dic and bic of ncep2 is higher than erai although the bic of erai is higher than ncep2 in station 8 due to a lower likelihood better agreement with observed precipitation hence the downscaling model considering erai can be considered to be comparatively closer to observed precipitation than ncep2 except station 8 5 conclusions recent research has evaluated the sources of uncertainty in gcms and it is clear that these uncertainties are likely to propagate through to case studies making use of gcm products for understanding the impacts of future changes in climate in developing downscaled models for such studies the uncertainties associated with the input reanalysis calibration data the model parameters and the model itself are less well known this study develops a bayesian framework for the assessment of the relative performance of commonly used reanalysis products under uncertainty for precipitation downscaling across the tibetan plateau overall the approach presented here is general and flexible allowing investigation into the impact of uncertainty on key precipitation variables of interest for water resource studies by characterising the posterior distribution of model parameters it is evident that the length of data available to specify parameters can have a significant impact on the total parameter uncertainty significant differences in precipitation attributes are observed when calibrating models with different reanalysis data sets the uncertainties in the calibrated model propagate through to analyses for downscaled precipitation from gcm access 1 3 and when compounded with the uncertainty in the input gcm data it is likely these uncertainties will persist when used for a variety of water resource management applications highlighting the importance of such uncertainty estimation we note that the some part of the uncertainty may be as a result of the structure of the downscaling model used here use of another downscaling model where the relationship between predictor and predictand is non linear might help reducing the across the datasets uncertainty and this will be the subject of future investigation different resolution of reanalysis datasets also might have influenced the results acknowledgements review comments by the editors and reviewers of this article led to

637,we introduce a perturbation method for the forward modeling of transient diffusion phenomena in aquifers with pressure measurements acquired at arbitrary observation points our numerical approach requires only two simulations to compute the permeability sensitivity function psf at an observation point under multi source and multi rate conditions one simulation captures the pressure solution due to the flow history of the sources while the second simulation is required to extract the green s function of the groundwater system the psf is calculated on the spatial temporal domain by convolving the gradients of the pressure solution and of the green s function the first order term in the perturbation expansion is obtained by weighting the spatial variations of permeability with a flow history dependent psf our work confirms the flexibility and reliability of the method after successful validation with forward numerical simulations in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates multidimensional synthetic studies including multi well and formation testing conditions were examined for diverse anisotropy dominated fluid flow regimes against perturbations of more than one order

estimation the present study deals with the solution of the forward problem and shows that perturbation theory yields efficient modeling and improved understanding of pressure diffusion phenomena in spatially heterogeneous aquifers under multi point conditions i e any distribution of sources except that of a single source coincident with the observation point the work by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 presented an extensive literature review on the advancements of perturbation theory under single well and constant flow conditions below are the most relevant findings that precede the present study pressure permeability correlations date back to the work by jacquard and jain 1965 which introduced an efficient method to estimate the distribution of permeability from measurements of velocity potentials in two dimensional 2d horizontal reservoirs grounded on the previous findings researchers have resorted to perturbation based approaches to better understand the pressure sensitivity to subsurface heterogeneity for various flow geometries and multi well conditions butler and liu 1993 developed an analytical solution in the laplace domain for 2d flow systems comprising a disk type anomaly embedded in a uniform background results from the sensitivity analysis of observed pressure drawdown to hydraulic properties of the anomaly showed that regardless of the relative spatial arrangement perturbations in transmissivity influenced the observed pressure response for a limited time window oliver 1993 invoked perturbation theory to derive integral equations for typical 2d flow models relating the pressure response due to a constant drawdown to small areal variations in transmissivity and storativity using these relationships oliver 1993 defined the corresponding analytical fréchet kernels to approximate the pressure drawdown solution at an observation well due to a single pumping well jiao and zheng 1997 studied the implications of the spatial location of an anomalous zone relative to the location of both pumping and observation wells in one dimensional 1d linear and radial flow models their sensitivity analysis showed that for constant flow pumping tests drawdown pressure is much more sensitive to the transmissivity of an anomaly located downstream as compared to upstream of an observation well copty and findikakis 2004 performed monte carlo simulations to appraise the influence of transmissivity heterogeneities on the pressure response at pumping and observation wells during 2d horizontal flow within a confined aquifer comparison of the results for the actual heterogeneous aquifer and an equivalent homogeneous system showed that the effective transmissivity approached the geometric mean of the actual perturbed medium if the transient analysis was performed with late time data knight and kluitenberg 2005 extended the work of oliver 1993 and romeu et al 1999 by deriving analytical fréchet kernels of homogeneous unconfined aquifers during pumping and slug tests knight and kluitenberg invoked the sensitivity functions in the laplace domain to investigate the behavior of isotropic anomalies close to the single pumping well or the observation point in 2d horizontal flow systems mazzilli et al 2010 resorted to a conventional perturbation approach to assess the sensitivity of rock fluid parameters on various aquifer responses results showed that the sensitivity function depend on the nature of the perturbed property and the aquifer response investigated e g hydraulic head is sensitive to spatial variations of hydraulic conductivity along the flow direction fu et al 2010 and 2011 developed an adjoint method to derive the sensitivity coefficients required for inverse modelling of heterogeneous porous media the adjoint and perturbation methods for the derivation of sensitivity functions although mathematically different yield equivalent improved efficiency when compared to time consuming traditional finite difference based methods previous works also show the application of permeability pressure correlations in the assessment of averaged hydraulic properties starting with the line source drawdown solution for homogeneous media copty et al 2011 developed a procedure that invoked the time derivative of the fréchet kernel to estimate time dependent transmissivity from constant flow pumping tests source and observation points concurring or not in heterogeneous confined aquifers results indicated that the time dependent interpreted transmissivity is a good estimate of the geometric mean of the actual aquifer property distribution within a progressively increasing diffusion volume in the same lines dagan et al 2013 demonstrated that although upscaling causes the loss of localized hydraulic information average effective medium conductivity yield good approximations of aquifer responses additionally the upscaling process enables reducing the numerical burden of otherwise fine scale heterogeneous aquifer models based on the adjoint method lu and vesselinov 2015 derived analytical expressions of the transient pressure sensitivity to transmissivity and storativity for groundwater systems in rectangular domains by invoking the sensitivities associated with homogeneous and isotropic permeable media hydraulically tested under single well constant flow conditions lu and vesselinov 2015 appraised the effect of time and the observation location on the estimation of aquifer properties chabanon et al 2017 derived an average permeability model for incompressible single phase flow in heterogeneous media results demonstrated the dependence of the effective property on the directionality of heterogeneities spatial arrangement finally the work by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 introduced a time domain perturbation theory for anisotropic aquifers and emphasized the ability to compute single source sensitivity functions of numerical aquifer models their work also introduced the joint perturbation convolution jpc method as a mean to efficiently approximate transient pressure responses via perturbed solutions results confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the method for modeling single phase single source diffusion phenomena in less than a few cpu seconds with relative errors in pressure of 5 considerable progress has been made to use perturbation theory to describe single phase flow diffusion phenomena under one or more of the following conditions 1 1d or 2d flow systems comprising one pumping and one observation well 2 vertical wells fully penetrating the aquifer 3 the pumping well producing at constant flow conditions 4 the transmissivity of the aquifer is generally isotropic very few studies consider anisotropic aquifers and 5 an analytical solution to the linear diffusion equation exists for the background medium following a reformulation of the jpc approach introduced by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 the time domain perturbation method presented in this paper enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions 1 under multi source and multi rate conditions and 2 relative to arbitrary data acquisition points e g a source or a monitoring observation location furthermore given the numerical character of our approach it benefits from the ability to reproduce and assimilate arbitrary transient flow regimes neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions spatial anisotropy and heterogeneity and spatial distribution of multiple sources it is shown that for a wide range of groundwater flow conditions sensitivities accurately capture the influence of spatial variations in permeability on transient pressure measurements at multiple testing scales e g probe type straddle packer and multi well environments hence when multiple solutions of a linear forward problem are required perturbation based approximations are found to be an efficient alternative for solving complex and or large numerical problems as compared to conventional simulation methods such as finite differences or finite elements 2 perturbation theory and superposition principle perturbation theory is a mathematical approximation that facilitates the modeling of complex physical phenomena in terms of the solution to known analogous problems in this paper perturbation theory is used to estimate the transient pressure response at an observation point starting from the numerical solution at the same point to a known background medium i e a reference tensorial permeability field homogeneous or heterogeneous the method presented herein is only useful for perturbations in permeability and therefore a different but equivalent derivation is required for perturbations in other rock fluid properties e g storativity viscosity the superposition principle holds for linear problems and can be applied in space and or time horne 1995 in pressure transient analysis space superposition allows one to calculate the pressure response due to a distribution of sources by adding the individual source responses at the desired location additionally time superposition or convolution transforms a constant flow pressure response to multi rate conditions we refer interchangeably to the term superposition regarding the spatial temporal or joint definitions above the dimensionless form of the single phase diffusion equation for a permeability perturbed aquifer with negligible gravitational effects is described by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 as 1 d e ϵ f d k d o d p d p d t d q d where k d e ϵ f d k d o describes a small relative variation of the actual tensorial permeability field k d with respect to that of the background medium k d o in the matrix exponential term ε is a dimensionless perturbation parameter that varies between zero and one f d is a dimensionless permeability variation function defined such that the magnitude of the perturbation in the property is scaled down and subscript o denotes parameters associated with the background medium it is assumed that the aquifer s deliverability is accurately described by a diagonal permeability tensor thus for full tensor permeability fields it is required to ensure that k d 1 k r e f k otherwise the equations would differ from those presented in this study in a consistent unit system the dimensionless variables i e subscript d are defined with respect

observation point in the equations above the zeroth order term pdo is given by the numerical solution of a background medium built upon eq 1 with ε 0 and the corresponding distribution of sources and flow conditions input into the simulator via the source term qd escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 defined the first order term of the perturbation expansion as 4 p d 1 ω t d ω a f d ω w d ω ω t d d ω where ω a denotes the multidimensional spatial domain of the aquifer and ω is a spatial variable of integration from the concept of fréchet derivatives oliver 1993 the psf corresponds to the kernel

describes the green s function of the background medium in electromagnetic scattering problems habashy et al 1993 the first order born approximation suggests replacing the total field with the incident field background at each point in the scatterer anomaly in pressure diffusion terms this means that if the permeability contrast between the anomaly and the background is weak the pressure and the gradient inside the anomaly are approximately equal to those of the background medium kuchuk et al 1996 therefore the born approximation yields an integral representation solution for the pressure response which is linear with respect to the aquifer s permeability variation function f d which explains why eqs 4 and 5 depend solely on the solution of the background medium finally for isotropic permeability aquifers tensorial eq 5 simplifies to an analogous scalar equation such as the one described by romeu et al 1999 for neumann conditions at the sources qd the green s function gd

varying flow condition with a set of m step rate changes q d j q d j 1 each one occurring at time t d j the dimensionless form of the uniformly distributed flow q is obtained from dividing by an arbitrary reference flow rate the superposition equations above imply that the pressure response pd of a system at a given location ω is the result of the fluid flux across the system s spatial domain the geometry and hydraulic properties of the source aquifer set are captured by the unit rate function pdu or by the green s function gd whose relationship is defined kuchuk et al 2010 as 8 g d ω ω t

the kernel i e pdu or gd is inversely calculated from pressure data and flow history in the simplest of cases discrete deconvolution of pressure measurements corresponding to uniformly distributed constant flow qdc conditions is obtained for any location ω by an arithmetic operation kuchuk et al 2010 i e 9 p d u ω t d p d ω t d q d c 3 joint perturbation superposition method observation pressure measurements on the one hand eq 5 is theoretically straightforward to solve if there exists an analytical representation of the solution to the diffusion equation governing the background medium in this case the continuous form of the green s function is obtained following eq 8 by differentiating the drawdown solution with respect to time on the other hand escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 described how to solve eq 5 from a numerical model provided that the observation point coincides with the single source in the spatial domain i e single point perturbation theory this work introduces and validates a method aimed at efficiently computing multi point sensitivity functions of numerical models to address such a problem we return to gringarten and ramey 1973 in our own nomenclature they defined the green s function as the pressure that would be created at the point ω at the time td by an instantaneous fictitious source of strength unity generated at the point ω at the time τ d td the spatial domain being initially at pd ω td 0 0 and the outer boundary being impermeable to flow inspired by the latter concept we introduce the joint perturbation superposition jps method the first and second phases of which are synthesized in figs 1 and 2 respectively the superscript attached to any parameter but ω indicates association with a numerical model whose sole fictitious source is concurrent with the observation point at ω likewise the superscript s attached to any parameter indicates association with a numerical model comprising the actual distribution of sources in the aquifer this note is important for understanding the numerical implementation of the multi point perturbation workflow detailed in figs 1 and 2 the jps method starts by computing the multi point psf of a given numerical model the workflow in fig 1 indicates that two simulations are required to capture the influence of sources relative to one observation point one additional simulation is required for every additional observation point first because our method is independent of the numerical simulator it allows one to obtain the background pressure solution p d o s given any type geometry and history of sources q d s arbitrarily distributed within the spatial domain of the aquifer ω a second based on gringarten and ramey s definition above we propose invoking an additional simulation to derive the green s function g d o from the pressure response p d o due to a single fictitious source producing at a constant flow q d c out of the observation point ω finally the psf w d of the background medium is calculated relative to ω this is achieved by considering the spatial temporal superposition implicit in the integral equation relating the gradients of the pressure solution and of the green s function to obtain the psf tensor conventional techniques demand as many simulations as number of discretized cells for each permeability component angeles et al 2007 by contrast our method requires at most two numerical simulations regardless of the anisotropic nature of the permeability perturbations the second part of the jps method is summarized in fig 2 and focuses on the rapid forward modeling rfm of multi dimensional numerical problems via perturbed solutions irrespective of the distribution type and geometry of sources if there is uniformly distributed flow conditions the execution of the rfm workflow is identical to that described by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 in other words the first order born or rytov approximation is calculated by invoking the appropriate psf built upon an arbitrary constant flow condition subsequently discrete convolution transforms the constant flow perturbed solution to uniformly distributed multi rate conditions in the form of step rate changes on the other hand let us recall that the psf equation implies the superposition in space and time of two given signals this attribute together with the semi numerical character of our method enables one to compute sensitivity functions in multi source conditions where each one exhibits its own distinct flow history in such cases the psf is obtained following the workflow in fig 1 for the flow history of the sources q d s whereby the sensitivity is said to be flow history dependent as a result the first order approximation in the rfm scheme already captures the sought after flow schedule and there is no need to resort to the discrete convolution final step the jps method summarized in figs 1 and 2 is suitable for single phase flow induced by neumann conditions and is advantageous for appraising spatial variations of aquifer hydraulic properties and for solving problems that entail multiple realizations of a forward model e g pre job planning sensitivity analyses and inverse modeling for efficient forward modeling a psf library is required that spans the anticipated permeability range a set of pre calculated sensitivity functions would avoid computational overhead thereby enabling on demand fast forward modeling via perturbed solutions if the sources are subject to dirichlet conditions only the rfm component varies with respect to the workflow described in fig 2 the equations are found in the appendix of escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 mixed or robin conditions are beyond the scope of the present study 4 results our study makes use of the university of texas at austin s wellbore numerical simulator utawns and the university of texas at austin s multi well numerical simulator utamwns with two purposes in mind to serve as reference models i e background media in the perturbation theory and to assess the accuracy of the proposed perturbed solutions the former is a single well three dimensional 3d cylindrical coordinate finite difference computer program suitable for studying near wellbore phenomena while the latter is a multi well two dimensional 2d cartesian coordinate finite difference computer program that models pressure diffusion at the field scale despite the capabilities of the simulators our work assumes that the off diagonal terms in the permeability tensor are zero and that gravitational effects are negligible numerical models built upon the single phase diffusion equation i e eq 1 with ε 0 have been successfully benchmarked with analytical solutions and with commercial and in house software sensitivity functions are examined for diverse groundwater flow conditions by comparing the rfm estimates to the true numerical solutions i e the solution to a numerical model that includes the heterogeneity anomaly explicitly in its formulation a bourdet plot is a graphical description for pressure transient analysis introduced by bourdet et al 1989 and associated with a given hydraulic testing flow sequence it consists of plotting in the same log log graph both the delta pressure and the derivative of the delta pressure with respect to a logarithmic superposition time function the bourdet derivative curve provides valuable insight into the various rock property dominated flow regimes that the pressure transient encounters while diffusing into the aquifer because in this paper we solve the forward problem dimensionless bourdet buildup plots and pressure history plots serve to qualitatively infer the reliability of perturbed solutions from the agreement to numerically computed dimensionless type curves gringarten et al 1979 additionally the l2 norm of relative errors is computed to quantify the accuracy of the approximation i e 10 ε v p t v n 2 v n 2 where ε is l2 norm of the relative error v p t is the pressure data vector yielded by perturbation theory i e rfm estimate and v n is the pressure data vector obtained with the explicit numerical formulation i e true solution in this paper we define the dimensionality of a problem as the number of spatial dimensions in which fluid flow takes place relative to an observation point regardless of the spatial distribution of aquifer properties the case studies in this work aid in appraising the reliability of the jps method for various hydraulic testing conditions namely straddle packer and probe type formation testing and multi source well testing we also highlight the benefits perturbation theory offers to hydrologists and reservoir engineers in terms of flexibility and physics based intuition for the analysis of transient pressure diffusion phenomena the single well problems are purposely chosen equivalent to those presented by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 thereby it is expected that this selection of problems allows the reader to comparatively assess the results obtained under single and multi point conditions table 1 describes the cylindrical and cartesian finite difference grids together with the common rock fluid properties assumed for the simulation models considered in this paper finally simulations were run on a personal computer equipped with an intel core i7 3 4 ghz processor 32 0 gb of memory ram and 64 bit operating system architecture 4 1 three dimensional full bore partial penetration flow system the 3d full bore partial penetration model studied consists of a 20 ft confined laterally infinite aquifer i e pressure transient do not reach the outer boundary of the model hydraulically tested with a 3 ft straddle packer centered at 5 ft above the lower impermeable barrier the formation testing pressure transient is analyzed from a vertical observation probe set 9 ft above the center of the packer following the workflow in fig 1 the multi point psf is obtained after invoking two independent numerical simulations one such that the actual source i e the straddle packer produces at 15 9 m3 d for one hour and another one that enforces a single fictitious source that produces at an arbitrary flow rate out of the vertical monitoring location the tensorial character of the sensitivity function allows one to decouple the influence as a function of space and time that each local component of the permeability field has on the observed pressure transient accordingly fig 3 shows a near wellbore snapshot of the radial and vertical psfs of a 50 md isotropic and homogeneous aquifer after one hour due to the axisymmetric character of the flow imposed by full bore completions in homogeneous rocks the azimuthal component of the sensitivity function is zero however the symmetry of the sensitivity maps is relative to the azimuth of the monitoring probe on the wellbore whereby even though a perturbation in azimuthal permeability does not influence the observed pressure transient any non axisymmetric heterogeneity could do it single point sensitivity functions derived from constant drawdown conditions are always positive escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 multi point sensitivity functions by contrast could either be positive negative or both for instance fig 3 b shows that the vertical psf comprises both positive and negative zones this means that depending on the spatial location the perturbation in permeability is directly or inversely correlated with the perturbation in pressure also because the shapes of the sensitivity maps are different fig 3 suggests that observed pressure responses are unequally influenced by the radial and vertical components of the permeability field of the aquifer in the near wellbore region the first example is intended to examine groundwater systems with radial composite heterogeneities thus the 50 md background medium is perturbed with an axisymmetric 10 ft thick radial zone located at 20 ft from the axis of the wellbore the simulated model considers a 5 md isotropic anomaly and imposes the following flow history at the straddle packer production at 7 95 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in fig 4 compares the born approximation of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solution the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 17 8 and ε 39 9 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively both quantitative results and the bourdet plot in fig 4 indicate that the predictions of pressure history and flow regime are inaccurate this occurrence can be explained by the harmonic average of permeability for radial beds in series peters 2012 essentially for spatial arrangements of this kind low permeability heterogeneities induce abrupt changes in the pressure response which are not accurately captured by the first order perturbation approximation like the previous remark jiao and zheng 1997 also concluded from their perturbation analysis that the influence of an anomaly less permeable than the background medium is much larger than that of a more permeable anomaly by resorting to the weighting method presented by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 an average tensorial permeability is obtained that best describes the aquifer permeability distribution as a function of diffusion time i e 11 k i j t d def 10 ω a log k i j ω b t w d i j ω ω t d d ω ω a b t w d i j ω ω t d d ω where k i j is the time dependent weighted permeability of the ij th component of the actual permeability distribution kij ω bt is bourdet derivative and w d ij is the ij th component of the dimensionless sensitivity function for a given background medium contrary to the time derivative expression presented by copty et al 2011 for constant flow hydraulic testing the logarithmic character of the bourdet derivative yields eq 11 more suitable to describe pressure transient diffusion phenomena on which during radial flow regime pressure is a function of the logarithm of time moreover a superposition time function also yields eq 11 adequate regardless of the history of flow sequences for practical purposes a suitable background medium is sought such that the sensitivity function is time independent with respect to permeability or in other words such that the background permeability is independent of diffusion time thus we also adopt the time average proposed by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 to compute a single effective and homogeneous tensorial permeability i e 12 k i j e k i j log t d e with log t d e 0 t d k i j τ d k i j p v τ d d l o g τ d 2 where the ij th component of the effective tensorial permeability k i j e corresponds to the time dependent weighted permeability k i j evaluated at an effective logarithmic time l o g t d e the latter is the time in logarithmic scale that corresponds to the 50 of the cumulative density function computed from the area between the curves delimited by the ij th component of the time dependent weighted permeability k i j and the ij th component of the prevailing permeability k i j p v because the pressure response is chiefly governed by the permeability of the aquifer closest to the source s and observation point the prevailing permeability is in this case 50 md based on the averaging technique and the given radial composite permeability distribution sensitivity functions are recomputed for an anisotropic and homogeneous background medium whose effective permeability tensor is krr kzz k θθ 24 44 50 in addition to the analysis above comparison of the radial and vertical psfs in fig 3 also indicates that a disturbance in the radial permeability at 20 ft or farther would have more influence on the observed pressure fig 5 confirms the improvement of the born approximation whose l 2 norm of the relative error is now ε 4 5 and ε 15 3 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively moreover by contrasting the background and rfm solutions it can be concluded that even when starting from a quite different reference solution perturbation theory accurately reproduces the actual pressure diffusion phenomenon the second example involves the same 3d flow system and is intended to examine layered heterogeneities thus the 50 md isotropic and homogenous aquifer is perturbed by embedding an axisymmetric 2 ft high petrophysical layer whose anisotropic permeability is krr kzz k θθ 5 500 5 it is generally believed that vertical observation probes mainly respond to the vertical permeability of the portion of the rock located between the source and the monitoring location however the single well aquifer description based upon the psfs shown in fig 3 confirms that the latter behavior is not necessarily the case because the sensitivity in that zone is non negligible we consider therefore two independent axial locations for the anomaly namely 2 ft below and 2 ft above the observation probe by means of eqs 11 and 12 one obtains an effective permeability tensor suitable for simulation of both layered systems from a homogeneous background medium i e krr kzz k θθ 41 97 50 and krr kzz k θθ 39 45 50 respectively in this case the dominant component of the perturbation s permeability tensor is a function of the spatial location of the anomaly for instance when the heterogeneity is located between the packer and the probe most of the influence originates from its vertical component which is not the case when the heterogeneity is located outside the zone delimited by the packer probe set information of this type is valuable for example when designing individual hydraulic fracturing stages and for appraising vertical connectivity along hydrogeological units of baffles the same testing schedule as before is now simulated i e production at 7 95 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in figs 6 and 7 compare the rytov approximations of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solutions for both layered flow systems when the perturbation is located 2 ft below the observation probe i e fig 6 the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 20 7 and ε 17 0 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively similarly when the perturbation is located 2 ft above the observation probe i e fig 7 the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 11 7 and ε 15 6 for delta pressure and its derivative respectively contrary to the analogous problem in escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 in this case both source and observation points are always closer to the spatial heterogeneity consequently this example shows that in addition to large contrasts in the permeability variation function f d proximity of the perturbation to the source s or monitoring point degrades the accuracy of first order approximations both layered anomalies and pressure diffusion span along the same direction in vertically confined single well configurations thus the accuracy is also compromised for the case of high contrast permeability variations because the influence of the layered anomaly in a homogeneous background substantially deviates from that of a theoretical perturbation 4 2 three dimensional point probe flow systems the 3d point probe model studied in this section consists of a 6 ft confined laterally infinite aquifer hydraulically tested with a 0 96 inch standard circular probe centered 1 ft above the lower impermeable barrier formation testing pressure transients are analyzed using an azimuthal observation probe placed 180 away from the source probe similar to the previous set of examples two independent numerical simulations are required to compute the sensitivity functions relative to the azimuthal probe in this case one simulation is set such that the actual source produces at 0 08 m3 d for one hour while the remaining one invokes a single fictitious source that produces at an arbitrary flow rate out of the azimuthal monitoring location following the first part of the jps method fig 8 shows a near wellbore snapshot of the radial vertical and azimuthal psfs of a 10 md isotropic and homogeneous aquifer after one hour a 200 degree segment is removed from the plots to visualize the sensitivity of the aquifer in the region surrounding both active and observation probes due to the geometry and placement alongside the wellbore probe type formation testing tools induce flow in the three dimensions therefore spatial heterogeneities in any direction or perturbations in any component of the permeability tensor would influence the observed pressure responses given the spatial disposition of the observation probe the psfs are also found to be axisymmetric the radial and azimuthal components of the sensitivity function fig 8 a and c respectively are found to be opposite in sign this implies that a perturbation in the radial and azimuthal permeability is respectively directly and inversely correlated with the observed drawdown pressure on the other hand fig 8 b suggests that the correlation between permeability and pressure for the vertical component of the tensor is spatially dependent furthermore the difference between the shapes of the functions suggests that the zone of influence associated with each term of the psf extends primarily in the corresponding spatial direction finally by contrasting figs 3 and 8 it can be inferred that the smaller the flow area and the closer the observation point is to the source the stronger and more localized the sensitivity becomes the following example is intended to examine spatial heterogeneities in permeability and flow geometry effects with probe type formation testing tools thus the background medium is perturbed by embedding a checkerboard type pattern comprising anisotropic permeability anomalies fig 9 is a 2d view plane gray scale color map that includes the outer boundaries of the model the open section of the standard circular probe and the axisymmetric perturbed medium radial and azimuthal permeability is given by krr k θθ 100 500 150 30 300 120 90 10 50 md with the index of each permeability zone in the plot increasing column wise from 1 top left to 9 bottom right even though the spatial arrangement of the permeability zones is unusual its complexity serves to validate the proposed simulation method under important heterogeneity conditions while providing valuable insight into the impact of the spatial variation of permeability on observed pressure responses to appraise the jps method for the various 3d probe type flow regimes appraised qualitatively from the bourdet derivative a relatively long flow sequence is simulated as follows production at 0 08 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in fig 10 compares the rytov approximation of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solution the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 100 0 for both delta pressure and pressure derivative such result confirms that when the background medium permeability differs greatly from that of the actual aquifer the perturbation approximation becomes inaccurate again by means of eqs 11 and 12 one can obtain the effective permeability tensor of a homogeneous background medium that is more appropriate to simulate the given perturbed medium accordingly the rytov approximation is improved by invoking the psfs of a krr kzz k θθ 75 102 184 homogeneous aquifer from the fit of the multi point rfm estimate to the actual utawns solution fig 11 confirms the reliability of perturbation theory when modeling anisotropic and arbitrarily heterogeneous groundwater systems moreover the l 2 norm of the relative error decreased to ε 6 0 and ε 16 0 for delta pressure and its derivative respectively comparison of the rfm estimates between figs 10 and 11 indicates that the weighting technique effectively adapts the permeability tensor of the sensitivity functions also from this example one concludes that perturbation theory provides accurate results even when drastically changing the permeability distribution used as background in general 3d single well formation testing results confirm that the jps method enables accurate modeling of transient pressure measurements acquired under diverse flow regimes including but not limited to early time spherical and hemispherical flow and middle to late time radial flow equally important to accuracy is the computational efficiency of the rfm scheme which is evident in large size problems on average for a 3d numerical model comprising 362100 cells each utawns simulation required 800 0 cpu seconds while each perturbed solution with a priori psf library required only 10 cpu seconds for their execution 4 3 two dimensional multi well flow systems the perturbation analysis of single well diffusion phenomena enabled the quantification of permeability and the description of flow dynamics in the near wellbore region next we focus our attention to the study of multi well conditions and spatial heterogeneities at the field scale the numerical properties of our perturbation method lend itself to capture any distribution type geometry and history of sources and arbitrary spatial variations in anisotropic permeability accordingly the assumed 2d cartesian model is described in fig 12 and consists of a 20 ft thick anisotropic checkerboard type heterogeneous horizontal aquifer with one production and one injection vertical well the pressure transient is acquired in an observation well equidistant to both producer and injector on the one hand the production well is conditioned to the following drawdown buildup sequence pump out for one day at 143 1 m3 d followed by one day of shut in on the other hand for the same time schedule the injection well operates at two different flow rates namely 15 9 m3 d and 127 2 m3 d respectively leaving aside the perturbations the background medium for this example is given by fig 12 following the workflow in fig 1 the two numerical simulations required in this case to compute the sensitivity functions are one dedicated to capture the action of the producer and the injector and another one that invokes a fictitious source producing at an arbitrary flow rate out of the observation well during the same time interval fig 13 describes the x and y psf of the background medium after two days this example confirms that with relatively low computational effort the proposed method constructs flow history dependent sensitivity maps for anisotropic and spatially heterogeneous permeable media the limitation in complexity of the psfs that one can obtain from the jps method is dictated by the robustness of the numerical aquifer model in fig 13 hot colors identify spatial zones where a perturbation in permeability and the corresponding perturbation in pressure are directly or positively correlated while cold colors identify an inverse or negative correlation the sign of the psfs is also indicative of the direction of flow relative to the observation point for instance for the given distribution of properties injection predominates when only considering the sensitivity in the y direction fig 13 b this behavior explains why the highly sensitive zone between the injection and the observation wells is positive qualitative knowledge of this type could benefit groundwater hydraulics and subsurface engineering tasks such as in the placement of infill wells or hydraulic fractures the following examples are intended to examine field scale conditions comprising discrete type permeability perturbations such as those due to impermeable barriers and natural or hydraulic fractures thus as shown in fig 12 we consider a 200 ft wide and 1000 ft long single perturbation for two distinct locations each one parallel to the principal axes of anisotropy placement of the anomalies was chosen such that the first one captures primarily the effect of a positive sensitivity fig 13 b while the second one captures primarily the effect of a negative sensitivity fig 13 a we assume that the perturbed property of the anomaly parallel to the x axis is kyy 5000 md and that of the anomaly parallel to the y axis is kxx 5000 md figs 14 and 15 describe for both cases the born approximation of the rfm scheme obtained directly from the flow history dependent psfs i e without invoking the discrete convolution final step in the workflow described in fig 2 the l 2 norm of the relative error for the case with the perturbation parallel to the x axis i e fig 14 is ε 6 8 while the l 2 norm of the relative error for the case with the perturbation parallel to the y axis i e fig 15 is ε 4 4 the rather low errors obtained when modeling anisotropic discrete type heterogeneities at the field scale validate the accuracy of flow history dependent psfs of spatially complex permeable aquifers furthermore sensitivities of this type allow one to readily understand the influence as a function of space and relative flow direction that a property perturbation has on the observed pressure response for instance because the permeability of the anomaly traversing a positive influence zone is larger than that of the background medium the pressure measured at the observation well is also larger and it appears herein as a more negative dimensionless pressure fig 14 conversely an inverse or negative correlation occurs when the anomaly traverses the negative zone of the sensitivity map fig 15 information of this kind provides valuable insight for instance to hydrologists and reservoir engineers for the appraisal of unexpected transient pressure behavior 5 discussion in 1974 carter et al reproduced jacquard and jain s 1965 original variational formulation in pressure diffusion terms they developed among others the equation for the sensitivity coefficients of the jacobian matrix required for solving gradient based inverse problems carter s et al 1974 sensitivity equation is equivalent to the sensitivity coefficient equation derived from the adjoint function described by dogru and seinfeld 1981 for solving inverse problems although such expressions are also equivalent to the anomaly function given by eq 4 our developments differ from previously published works in these respects i the equations presented herein are derived partially from perturbation principles escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 which constitute the basis for first order approximations instead of solving the associated nonlinear inverse problem we show that perturbed type solutions are suitable for efficient and accurate forward modeling of pressure diffusion phenomena ii the derivation of the equations from perturbation principles allows one to leverage the concept of sensitivity functions maps eq 5 with no need to formulate and solve an adjoint problem sensitivity functions provide valuable insight into permeability pressure correlations and flow dynamics such attributes are beneficial for improved aquifer description and optimized nonlinear parameter estimation algorithms e g via appropriate selection of the inversion measurements and reduced sequential calculations of the jacobian matrix iii the tensorial form of the sensitivity function enables one to decouple the influence as a function of space and time that each local component of the permeability field has on the observed pressure transients moreover because the anomaly function is explicitly given by a tensorial integral efficient forward and inverse modeling of anisotropic perturbations can be readily performed via perturbation principles 6 conclusion we introduced an efficient perturbation method which requires a maximum of two numerical simulations to compute flow history dependent multi point sensitivity functions relative to one observation point contrary to former laplace domain approaches time domain perturbation theory provides physics based intuition for improved aquifer description subsurface geoscience and engineering design for instance the local sign of the sensitivity function defines the type of correlation between a perturbation in permeability and the corresponding perturbation in pressure it also indicates the direction of darcy s flow relative to the observation point knowledge of this type is valuable a in the appraisal of abnormal unexpected pressure behavior otherwise difficult to examine with conventional techniques b in the design of infill wells or hydraulic fractures c in the design of next generation hydraulic testing tools or configurations and d when solving nonlinear inverse problems to estimate the spatial distribution of permeability multidimensional synthetic studies including vertical and azimuthal monitoring probes and multi well conditions were examined for diverse heterogeneity dominated fluid flow regimes results showed that the numerical properties of the jps method enable one to compute the psf tensor of anisotropic and spatially heterogeneous permeable media perturbed solutions of the rfm scheme become a reliable alternative for modeling diffusion phenomena in permeable groundwater systems over a wide range of subsurface conditions with perturbations greater than one order of magnitude of the background medium s permeability first order approximations yielded relative errors in pressure of ε 7 0 however it was also shown that large contrasts in permeability and great proximity of the perturbation to observation source points can degrade the accuracy of the approximations finally with a priori psf library the computational advantage of the rfm scheme with respect to explicit finite difference algorithms is approximately two orders of magnitude for the examples examined in this paper 7 future research work the findings of the present study and those of escobar gómez and torres verdín s 2018 constitute the foundations for two ongoing lines of research by the same authors namely single phase flow inverse problems via perturbation theory and multi phase flow forward problems via perturbation theory specifically the following are ongoing related developments single phase flow inverse problems via perturbation theory the inversion work does not seek to develop a new inversion method but rather to take advantage of the efficiency of single phase perturbation theory when solving gradient based parameter estimation problems for which the number of unknowns is greater than the number of measurements the permeability sensitivity functions derived from perturbation theory are directly related to the jacobian matrix thus the authors advance an efficient sequential computation of sensitivity coefficients frequently the most time consuming component of nonlinear inverse algorithms direct approaches demand of unknown parameters of measurement points more simulation runs to compute a single jacobian matrix than the proposed perturbation approach whereby the latter becomes more computationally efficient permeability pressure correlations help to verify that the spatial sensitivity maps stemming from the selected measurement points cover the petrophysical zones of interest otherwise if the sensitivity due to the selected measurement points is small model properties in that location cannot not be reliably estimated the efficiency of conventional gradient based algorithms is compromised due to the computational overhead of building the jacobian matrix at each iteration assimilating the iterative error and convergence rate with the spatial sensitivity functions via rapid forward modeling solutions improves the efficiency of the inversion algorithm by reducing the number of sequential calculations of the jacobian matrix preliminary results indicate that starting with a single sensitivity function spatial anisotropic permeability distributions can be accurately obtained in half the time of otherwise conventional variational approaches multi phase flow forward problems via perturbation theory according to escobar gómez et al 2016 ii if the maximum anticipated pressure drop in the porous medium is moderate linearization of the black oil i e multi phase flow model yields accurate and efficient estimation of effective or total rock fluid properties under such conditions perturbation methods for single phase flow of incompressible fluids are also valid within a reduced range of pressure drop for single phase flow of compressible fluids furthermore such linearized multi phase perturbation theory would yield equations correlating pressure measurements with total system properties e g total mobility and total compressibility in lieu of individual phase or absolute properties if the linearization of the diffusivity equation s is unacceptable then the superposition principle does not hold therefore a nonlinear green s function kernel formulation is required for the joint perturbation superposition method to be valid given the multi phase nature of the problem multi phase flow sensitivity functions would correlate perturbations in relative permeability to individual phase pressure or fractional flow measurements in order to obtain an equation correlating rock fluid properties with fractional flow the authors suggest perturbing the corresponding property e g relative permeability in the saturation equation in addition an equivalent perturbation scheme for the pressure equation could be required to be solved simultaneously because the saturation equation is a function of both perturbed properties and measurements acknowledgments

637,we introduce a perturbation method for the forward modeling of transient diffusion phenomena in aquifers with pressure measurements acquired at arbitrary observation points our numerical approach requires only two simulations to compute the permeability sensitivity function psf at an observation point under multi source and multi rate conditions one simulation captures the pressure solution due to the flow history of the sources while the second simulation is required to extract the green s function of the groundwater system the psf is calculated on the spatial temporal domain by convolving the gradients of the pressure solution and of the green s function the first order term in the perturbation expansion is obtained by weighting the spatial variations of permeability with a flow history dependent psf our work confirms the flexibility and reliability of the method after successful validation with forward numerical simulations in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates multidimensional synthetic studies including multi well and formation testing conditions were examined for diverse anisotropy dominated fluid flow regimes against perturbations of more than one order of magnitude in background permeability results show that first order approximations can be computed in tens of cpu seconds with relative errors in pressure of 7 results indicate that sensitivity

estimation the present study deals with the solution of the forward problem and shows that perturbation theory yields efficient modeling and improved understanding of pressure diffusion phenomena in spatially heterogeneous aquifers under multi point conditions i e any distribution of sources except that of a single source coincident with the observation point the work by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 presented an extensive literature review on the advancements of perturbation theory under single well and constant flow conditions below are the most relevant findings that precede the present study pressure permeability correlations date back to the work by jacquard and jain 1965 which introduced an efficient method to estimate the distribution of permeability from measurements of velocity potentials in two dimensional 2d horizontal reservoirs grounded on the previous findings researchers have resorted to perturbation based approaches to better understand the pressure sensitivity to subsurface heterogeneity for various flow geometries and multi well conditions butler and liu 1993 developed an analytical solution in the laplace domain for 2d flow systems comprising a disk type anomaly embedded in a uniform background results from the sensitivity analysis of observed pressure drawdown to hydraulic properties of the anomaly showed that regardless of the relative spatial arrangement perturbations in transmissivity influenced the observed pressure response for a limited time window oliver 1993 invoked perturbation theory to derive integral equations for typical 2d flow models relating the pressure response due to a constant drawdown to small areal variations in transmissivity and storativity using these relationships oliver 1993 defined the corresponding analytical fréchet kernels to approximate the pressure drawdown solution at an observation well due to a single pumping well jiao and zheng 1997 studied the implications of the spatial location of an anomalous zone relative to the location of both pumping and observation wells in one dimensional 1d linear and radial flow models their sensitivity analysis showed that for constant flow pumping tests drawdown pressure is much more sensitive to the transmissivity of an anomaly located downstream as compared to upstream of an observation well copty and findikakis 2004 performed monte carlo simulations to appraise the influence of transmissivity heterogeneities on the pressure response at pumping and observation wells during 2d horizontal flow within a confined aquifer comparison of the results for the actual heterogeneous aquifer and an equivalent homogeneous system showed that the effective transmissivity approached the geometric mean of the actual perturbed medium if the transient analysis was performed with late time data knight and kluitenberg 2005 extended the work of oliver 1993 and romeu et al 1999 by deriving analytical fréchet kernels of homogeneous unconfined aquifers during pumping and slug tests knight and kluitenberg invoked the sensitivity functions in the laplace domain to investigate the behavior of isotropic anomalies close to the single pumping well or the observation point in 2d horizontal flow systems mazzilli et al 2010 resorted to a conventional perturbation approach to assess the sensitivity of rock fluid parameters on various aquifer responses results showed that the sensitivity function depend on the nature of the perturbed property and the aquifer response investigated e g hydraulic head is sensitive to spatial variations of hydraulic conductivity along the flow direction fu et al 2010 and 2011 developed an adjoint method to derive the sensitivity coefficients required for inverse modelling of heterogeneous porous media the adjoint and perturbation methods for the derivation of sensitivity functions although mathematically different yield equivalent improved efficiency when compared to time consuming traditional finite difference based methods previous works also show the application of permeability pressure correlations in the assessment of averaged hydraulic properties starting with the line source drawdown solution for homogeneous media copty et al 2011 developed a procedure that invoked the time derivative of the fréchet kernel to estimate time dependent transmissivity from constant flow pumping tests source and observation points concurring or not in heterogeneous confined aquifers results indicated that the time dependent interpreted transmissivity is a good estimate of the geometric mean of the actual aquifer property distribution within a progressively increasing diffusion volume in the same lines dagan et al 2013 demonstrated that although upscaling causes the loss of localized hydraulic information average effective medium conductivity yield good approximations of aquifer responses additionally the upscaling process enables reducing the numerical burden of otherwise fine scale heterogeneous aquifer models based on the adjoint method lu and vesselinov 2015 derived analytical expressions of the transient pressure sensitivity to transmissivity and storativity for groundwater systems in rectangular domains by invoking the sensitivities associated with homogeneous and isotropic permeable media hydraulically tested under single well constant flow conditions lu and vesselinov 2015 appraised the effect of time and the observation location on the estimation of aquifer properties chabanon et al 2017 derived an average permeability model for incompressible single phase flow in heterogeneous media results demonstrated the dependence of the effective property on the directionality of heterogeneities spatial arrangement finally the work by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 introduced a time domain perturbation theory for anisotropic aquifers and emphasized the ability to compute single source sensitivity functions of numerical aquifer models their work also introduced the joint perturbation convolution jpc method as a mean to efficiently approximate transient pressure responses via perturbed solutions results confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the method for modeling single phase single source diffusion phenomena in less than a few cpu seconds with relative errors in pressure of 5 considerable progress has been made to use perturbation theory to describe single phase flow diffusion phenomena under one or more of the following conditions 1 1d or 2d flow systems comprising one pumping and one observation well 2 vertical wells fully penetrating the aquifer 3 the pumping well producing at constant flow conditions 4 the transmissivity of the aquifer is generally isotropic very few studies consider anisotropic aquifers and 5 an analytical solution to the linear diffusion equation exists for the background medium following a reformulation of the jpc approach introduced by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 the time domain perturbation method presented in this paper enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions 1 under multi source and multi rate conditions and 2 relative to arbitrary data acquisition points e g a source or a monitoring observation location furthermore given the numerical character of our approach it benefits from the ability to reproduce and assimilate arbitrary transient flow regimes neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions spatial anisotropy and heterogeneity and spatial distribution of multiple sources it is shown that for a wide range of groundwater flow conditions sensitivities accurately capture the influence of spatial variations in permeability on transient pressure measurements at multiple testing scales e g probe type straddle packer and multi well environments hence when multiple solutions of a linear forward problem are required perturbation based approximations are found to be an efficient alternative for solving complex and or large numerical problems as compared to conventional simulation methods such as finite differences or finite elements 2 perturbation theory and superposition principle perturbation theory is a mathematical approximation that facilitates the modeling of complex physical phenomena in terms of the solution to known analogous problems in this paper perturbation theory is used to estimate the transient pressure response at an observation point starting from the numerical solution at the same point to a known background medium i e a reference tensorial permeability field homogeneous or heterogeneous the method presented herein is only useful for perturbations in permeability and therefore a different but equivalent derivation is required for perturbations in other rock fluid properties e g storativity viscosity the superposition principle holds for linear problems and can be applied in space and or time horne 1995 in pressure transient analysis space superposition allows one to calculate the pressure response due to a distribution of sources by adding the individual source responses at the desired location additionally time superposition or convolution transforms a constant flow pressure response to multi rate conditions we refer interchangeably to the term superposition regarding the spatial temporal or joint definitions above the dimensionless form of the single phase diffusion equation for a permeability perturbed aquifer with negligible gravitational effects is described by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 as 1 d e ϵ f d k d o d p d p d t d q d where k d e ϵ f d k d o describes a small relative variation of the actual tensorial permeability field k d with respect to that of the background medium k d o in the matrix exponential term ε is a dimensionless perturbation parameter that varies between zero and one f d is a dimensionless permeability variation function defined such that the magnitude of the perturbation in the property is scaled down and subscript o denotes parameters associated with the background medium it is assumed that the aquifer s deliverability is accurately described by a diagonal permeability tensor thus for full tensor permeability fields it is required to ensure that k d 1 k r e f k otherwise the equations would differ from those presented in this study in a consistent unit system the dimensionless variables i e subscript d are defined with respect

observation point in the equations above the zeroth order term pdo is given by the numerical solution of a background medium built upon eq 1 with ε 0 and the corresponding distribution of sources and flow conditions input into the simulator via the source term qd escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 defined the first order term of the perturbation expansion as 4 p d 1 ω t d ω a f d ω w d ω ω t d d ω where ω a denotes the multidimensional spatial domain of the aquifer and ω is a spatial variable of integration from the concept of fréchet derivatives oliver 1993 the psf corresponds to the kernel

describes the green s function of the background medium in electromagnetic scattering problems habashy et al 1993 the first order born approximation suggests replacing the total field with the incident field background at each point in the scatterer anomaly in pressure diffusion terms this means that if the permeability contrast between the anomaly and the background is weak the pressure and the gradient inside the anomaly are approximately equal to those of the background medium kuchuk et al 1996 therefore the born approximation yields an integral representation solution for the pressure response which is linear with respect to the aquifer s permeability variation function f d which explains why eqs 4 and 5 depend solely on the solution of the background medium finally for isotropic permeability aquifers tensorial eq 5 simplifies to an analogous scalar equation such as the one described by romeu et al 1999 for neumann conditions at the sources qd the green s function gd

varying flow condition with a set of m step rate changes q d j q d j 1 each one occurring at time t d j the dimensionless form of the uniformly distributed flow q is obtained from dividing by an

the geometry and hydraulic properties of the source aquifer set are captured by the unit rate function pdu or by the green s function gd whose relationship is defined kuchuk et al 2010 as 8 g d ω ω t

the kernel i e pdu or gd is inversely calculated from pressure data and flow history in the simplest of cases discrete deconvolution of pressure measurements corresponding to uniformly distributed constant flow qdc conditions is obtained for any location ω by an arithmetic operation kuchuk et al 2010 i e 9 p d u ω t d p d ω t d q d c 3 joint perturbation superposition method observation pressure measurements on the one hand eq 5 is theoretically straightforward to solve if there exists an analytical representation of the solution to the diffusion equation governing the background medium in this case the continuous form of the green s function is obtained following eq 8 by differentiating the drawdown solution with respect to time on the other hand escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 described how to solve eq 5 from a numerical model provided that the observation point coincides with the single source in the spatial domain i e single point perturbation theory this work introduces and validates a method aimed at efficiently computing multi point sensitivity functions of numerical models to address such a problem we return to gringarten and ramey 1973 in our own nomenclature they defined the green s function as the pressure that would be created at the point ω at the time td by an instantaneous fictitious source of strength unity generated at the point ω at the time τ d td the spatial domain being initially at pd ω td 0 0 and the outer boundary being impermeable to flow inspired by the latter concept we introduce the joint perturbation superposition jps method the first and second phases of which are synthesized in figs 1 and 2 respectively the superscript attached to any parameter but ω indicates association with a numerical model whose sole fictitious source is concurrent with the observation point at ω likewise the superscript s attached to any parameter indicates association with a numerical model comprising the actual distribution of sources in the aquifer this note is important for understanding the numerical implementation of the multi point perturbation workflow detailed in figs 1 and 2 the jps method starts by computing the multi point psf of a given numerical model the workflow in fig 1 indicates that two simulations are required to capture the influence of sources relative to one observation point one additional simulation is required for every additional observation point first because our method is independent of the numerical simulator it allows one to obtain the background pressure solution p d o s given any type geometry and history of sources q d s arbitrarily distributed within the spatial domain of the aquifer ω a second based on gringarten and ramey s definition above we propose invoking an additional simulation to derive the green s function g d o from the pressure response p d o due to a single fictitious source producing at a constant flow q d c out of the observation point ω finally the psf w d of the background medium is calculated relative to ω this is achieved by considering the spatial temporal superposition implicit in the integral equation relating the gradients of the pressure solution and of the green s function to obtain the psf tensor conventional techniques demand as many simulations as number of discretized cells for each permeability component angeles et al 2007 by contrast our method requires at most two numerical simulations regardless of the anisotropic nature of the permeability perturbations the second part of the jps method is summarized in fig 2 and focuses on the rapid forward modeling rfm of multi dimensional numerical problems via perturbed solutions irrespective of the distribution type and geometry of sources if there is uniformly distributed flow conditions the execution of the rfm workflow is identical to that described by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 in other words the first order born or rytov approximation is calculated by invoking the appropriate psf built upon an arbitrary constant flow condition subsequently discrete convolution transforms the constant flow perturbed solution to uniformly distributed multi rate conditions in the form of step rate changes on the other hand let us recall that the psf equation implies the superposition in space and time of two given signals this attribute together with the semi numerical character of our method enables one to compute sensitivity functions in multi source conditions where each one exhibits its own distinct flow history in such cases the psf is obtained following the workflow in fig 1 for the flow history of the sources q d s whereby the sensitivity is said to be flow history dependent as a result the first order approximation in the rfm scheme already captures the sought after flow schedule and there is no need to resort to the discrete convolution final step the jps method summarized in figs 1 and 2 is suitable for single phase flow induced by neumann conditions and is advantageous for appraising spatial variations of aquifer hydraulic properties and for solving problems that entail multiple realizations of a forward model e g pre job planning sensitivity analyses and inverse modeling for efficient forward modeling a psf library is required that spans the anticipated permeability range a set of pre calculated sensitivity functions would avoid computational overhead thereby enabling on demand fast forward modeling via perturbed solutions if the sources are subject to dirichlet conditions only the rfm component varies with respect to the workflow described in fig 2 the equations are found in the appendix of escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 mixed or robin conditions are beyond the scope of the present study 4 results our study makes use of the university of texas at austin s wellbore numerical simulator utawns and the university of texas at austin s multi well numerical simulator utamwns with two purposes in mind to serve as reference models i e background media in the perturbation theory and to assess the accuracy of the proposed perturbed solutions the former is a single well three dimensional 3d cylindrical coordinate finite difference computer program suitable for studying near wellbore phenomena while the latter is a multi well two dimensional 2d cartesian coordinate finite difference computer program that models pressure diffusion at the field scale despite the capabilities of the simulators our work assumes that the off diagonal terms in the permeability tensor are zero and that gravitational effects are negligible numerical models built upon the single phase diffusion equation i e eq 1 with ε 0 have been successfully benchmarked with analytical solutions and with commercial and in house software sensitivity functions are examined for diverse groundwater flow conditions by comparing the rfm estimates to the true numerical solutions i e the solution to a numerical model that includes the heterogeneity anomaly explicitly in its formulation a bourdet plot is a graphical description for pressure transient analysis introduced by bourdet et al 1989 and associated with a given hydraulic testing flow sequence it consists of plotting in the same log log graph both the delta pressure and the derivative of the delta pressure with respect to a logarithmic superposition time function the bourdet derivative curve provides valuable insight into the various rock property dominated flow regimes that the pressure transient encounters while diffusing into the aquifer because in this paper we solve the forward problem dimensionless bourdet buildup plots and pressure history plots serve to qualitatively infer the reliability of perturbed solutions from the agreement to numerically computed dimensionless type curves gringarten et al 1979 additionally the l2 norm of relative errors is computed to quantify the accuracy of the approximation i e 10 ε v p t v n 2 v n 2 where ε is l2 norm of the relative error v p t is the pressure data vector yielded by perturbation theory i e rfm estimate and v n is the pressure data vector obtained with the explicit numerical formulation i e true solution in this paper we define the dimensionality of a problem as the number of spatial dimensions in which fluid flow takes place relative to an observation point regardless of the spatial distribution of aquifer properties the case studies in this work aid in appraising the reliability of the jps method for various hydraulic testing conditions namely straddle packer and probe type formation testing and multi source well testing we also highlight the benefits perturbation theory offers to hydrologists and reservoir engineers in terms of flexibility and physics based intuition for the analysis of transient pressure diffusion phenomena the single well problems are purposely chosen equivalent to those presented by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 thereby it is expected that this selection of problems allows the reader to comparatively assess the results obtained under single and multi point conditions table 1 describes the cylindrical and cartesian finite difference grids together with the common rock fluid properties assumed for the simulation models considered in this paper finally simulations were run on a personal computer equipped with an intel core i7 3 4 ghz processor 32 0 gb of memory ram and 64 bit operating system architecture 4 1 three dimensional full bore partial penetration flow system the 3d full bore partial penetration model studied consists of a 20 ft confined laterally infinite aquifer i e pressure transient do not reach the outer boundary of the model hydraulically tested with a 3 ft straddle packer centered at 5 ft above the lower impermeable barrier the formation testing pressure transient is analyzed from a vertical observation probe set 9 ft above the center of the packer following the workflow in fig 1 the multi point psf is obtained after invoking two independent numerical simulations one such that the actual source i e the straddle packer produces at 15 9 m3 d for one hour and another one that enforces a single fictitious source that produces at an arbitrary flow rate out of the vertical monitoring location the tensorial character of the sensitivity function allows one to decouple the influence as a function of space and time that each local component of the permeability field has on the observed pressure transient accordingly fig 3 shows a near wellbore snapshot of the radial and vertical psfs of a 50 md isotropic and homogeneous aquifer after one hour due to the axisymmetric character of the flow imposed by full bore completions in homogeneous rocks the azimuthal component of the sensitivity function is zero however the symmetry of the sensitivity maps is relative to the azimuth of the monitoring probe on the wellbore whereby even though a perturbation in azimuthal permeability does not influence the observed pressure transient any non axisymmetric heterogeneity could do it single point sensitivity functions derived from constant drawdown conditions are always positive escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 multi point sensitivity functions by contrast could either be positive negative or both for instance fig 3 b shows that the vertical psf comprises both positive and negative zones this means that depending on the spatial location the perturbation in permeability is directly or inversely correlated with the perturbation in pressure also because the shapes of the sensitivity maps are different fig 3 suggests that observed pressure responses are unequally influenced by the radial and vertical components of the permeability field of the aquifer in the near wellbore region the first example is intended to examine groundwater systems with radial composite heterogeneities thus the 50 md background medium is perturbed with an axisymmetric 10 ft thick radial zone located at 20 ft from the axis of the wellbore the simulated model considers a 5 md isotropic anomaly and imposes the following flow history at the straddle packer production at 7 95 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in fig 4 compares the born approximation of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solution the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 17 8 and ε 39 9 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively both quantitative results and the bourdet plot in fig 4 indicate that the predictions of pressure history and flow regime are inaccurate this occurrence can be explained by the harmonic average of permeability for radial beds in series peters 2012 essentially for spatial arrangements of this kind low permeability heterogeneities induce abrupt changes in the pressure response which are not accurately captured by the first order perturbation approximation like the previous remark jiao and zheng 1997 also concluded from their perturbation analysis that the influence of an anomaly less permeable than the background medium is much larger than that of a more permeable anomaly by resorting to the weighting method presented by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 an average tensorial permeability is obtained that best describes the aquifer permeability distribution as a function of diffusion time i e 11 k i j t d def 10 ω a log k i j ω b t w d i j ω ω t d d ω ω a b t w d i j ω ω t d d ω where k i j is the time dependent weighted permeability of the ij th component of the actual permeability distribution kij ω bt is bourdet derivative and w d ij is the ij th component of the dimensionless sensitivity function for a given background medium contrary to the time derivative expression presented by copty et al 2011 for constant flow hydraulic testing the logarithmic character of the bourdet derivative yields eq 11 more suitable to describe pressure transient diffusion phenomena on which during radial flow regime pressure is a function of the logarithm of time moreover a superposition time function also yields eq 11 adequate regardless of the history of flow sequences for practical purposes a suitable background medium is sought such that the sensitivity function is time independent with respect to permeability or in other words such that the background permeability is independent of diffusion time thus we also adopt the time average proposed by escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 to compute a single effective and homogeneous tensorial permeability i e 12 k i j e k i j log t d e with log t d e 0 t d k i j τ d k i j p v τ d d l o g τ d 2 where the ij th component of the effective tensorial permeability k i j e corresponds to the time dependent weighted permeability k i j evaluated at an effective logarithmic time l o g t d e the latter is the time in logarithmic scale that corresponds to the 50 of the cumulative density function computed from the area between the curves delimited by the ij th component of the time dependent weighted permeability k i j and the ij th component of the prevailing permeability k i j p v because the pressure response is chiefly governed by the permeability of the aquifer closest to the source s and observation point the prevailing permeability is in this case 50 md based on the averaging technique and the given radial composite permeability distribution sensitivity functions are recomputed for an anisotropic and homogeneous background medium whose effective permeability tensor is krr kzz k θθ 24 44 50 in addition to the analysis above comparison of the radial and vertical psfs in fig 3 also indicates that a disturbance in the radial permeability at 20 ft or farther would have more influence on the observed pressure fig 5 confirms the improvement of the born approximation whose l 2 norm of the relative error is now ε 4 5 and ε 15 3 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively moreover by contrasting the background and rfm solutions it can be concluded that even when starting from a quite different reference solution perturbation theory accurately reproduces the actual pressure diffusion phenomenon the second example involves the same 3d flow system and is intended to examine layered heterogeneities thus the 50 md isotropic and homogenous aquifer is perturbed by embedding an axisymmetric 2 ft high petrophysical layer whose anisotropic permeability is krr kzz k θθ 5 500 5 it is generally believed that vertical observation probes mainly respond to the vertical permeability of the portion of the rock located between the source and the monitoring location however the single well aquifer description based upon the psfs shown in fig 3 confirms that the latter behavior is not necessarily the case because the sensitivity in that zone is non negligible we consider therefore two independent axial locations for the anomaly namely 2 ft below and 2 ft above the observation probe by means of eqs 11 and 12 one obtains an effective permeability tensor suitable for simulation of both layered systems from a homogeneous background medium i e krr kzz k θθ 41 97 50 and krr kzz k θθ 39 45 50 respectively in this case the dominant component of the perturbation s permeability tensor is a function of the spatial location of the anomaly for instance when the heterogeneity is located between the packer and the probe most of the influence originates from its vertical component which is not the case when the heterogeneity is located outside the zone delimited by the packer probe set information of this type is valuable for example when designing individual hydraulic fracturing stages and for appraising vertical connectivity along hydrogeological units of baffles the same testing schedule as before is now simulated i e production at 7 95 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in figs 6 and 7 compare the rytov approximations of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solutions for both layered flow systems when the perturbation is located 2 ft below the observation probe i e fig 6 the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 20 7 and ε 17 0 for the delta pressure and its derivative respectively similarly when the perturbation is located 2 ft above the observation probe i e fig 7 the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 11 7 and ε 15 6 for delta pressure and its derivative respectively contrary to the analogous problem in escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 in this case both source and observation points are always closer to the spatial heterogeneity consequently this example shows that in addition to large contrasts in the permeability variation function f d proximity of the perturbation to the source s or monitoring point degrades the accuracy of first order approximations both layered anomalies and pressure diffusion span along the same direction in vertically confined single well configurations thus the accuracy is also compromised for the case of high contrast permeability variations because the influence of the layered anomaly in a homogeneous background substantially deviates from that of a theoretical perturbation 4 2 three dimensional point probe flow systems the 3d point probe model studied in this section consists of a 6 ft confined laterally infinite aquifer hydraulically tested with a 0 96 inch standard circular probe centered 1 ft above the lower impermeable barrier formation testing pressure transients are analyzed using an azimuthal observation probe placed 180 away from the source probe similar to the previous set of examples two independent numerical simulations are required to compute the sensitivity functions relative to the azimuthal probe in this case one simulation is set such that the actual source produces at 0 08 m3 d for one hour while the remaining one invokes a single fictitious source that produces at an arbitrary flow rate out of the azimuthal monitoring location following the first part of the jps method fig 8 shows a near wellbore snapshot of the radial vertical and azimuthal psfs of a 10 md isotropic and homogeneous aquifer after one hour a 200 degree segment is removed from the plots to visualize the sensitivity of the aquifer in the region surrounding both active and observation probes due to the geometry and placement alongside the wellbore probe type formation testing tools induce flow in the three dimensions therefore spatial heterogeneities in any direction or perturbations in any component of the permeability tensor would influence the observed pressure responses given the spatial disposition of the observation probe the psfs are also found to be axisymmetric the radial and azimuthal components of the sensitivity function fig 8 a and c respectively are found to be opposite in sign this implies that a perturbation in the radial and azimuthal permeability is respectively directly and inversely correlated with the observed drawdown pressure on the other hand fig 8 b suggests that the correlation between permeability and pressure for the vertical component of the tensor is spatially dependent furthermore the difference between the shapes of the functions suggests that the zone of influence associated with each term of the psf extends primarily in the corresponding spatial direction finally by contrasting figs 3 and 8 it can be inferred that the smaller the flow area and the closer the observation point is to the source the stronger and more localized the sensitivity becomes the following example is intended to examine spatial heterogeneities in permeability and flow geometry effects with probe type formation testing tools thus the background medium is perturbed by embedding a checkerboard type pattern comprising anisotropic permeability anomalies fig 9 is a 2d view plane gray scale color map that includes the outer boundaries of the model the open section of the standard circular probe and the axisymmetric perturbed medium radial and azimuthal permeability is given by krr k θθ 100 500 150 30 300 120 90 10 50 md with the index of each permeability zone in the plot increasing column wise from 1 top left to 9 bottom right even though the spatial arrangement of the permeability zones is unusual its complexity serves to validate the proposed simulation method under important heterogeneity conditions while providing valuable insight into the impact of the spatial variation of permeability on observed pressure responses to appraise the jps method for the various 3d probe type flow regimes appraised qualitatively from the bourdet derivative a relatively long flow sequence is simulated as follows production at 0 08 m3 d for 0 5 h followed by a 0 5 hour shut in fig 10 compares the rytov approximation of the multi point rfm scheme to the utawns solution the l 2 norm of the relative error is ε 100 0 for both delta pressure and pressure derivative such result confirms that when the background medium permeability differs greatly from that of the actual aquifer the perturbation approximation becomes inaccurate again by means of eqs 11 and 12 one can obtain the effective permeability tensor of a homogeneous background medium that is more appropriate to simulate the given perturbed medium accordingly the rytov approximation is improved by invoking the psfs of a krr kzz k θθ 75 102 184 homogeneous aquifer from the fit of the multi point rfm estimate to the actual utawns solution fig 11 confirms the reliability of perturbation theory when modeling anisotropic and arbitrarily heterogeneous groundwater systems moreover the l 2 norm of the relative error decreased to ε 6 0 and ε 16 0 for delta pressure and its derivative respectively comparison of the rfm estimates between figs 10 and 11 indicates that the weighting technique effectively adapts the permeability tensor of the sensitivity functions also from this example one concludes that perturbation theory provides accurate results even when drastically changing the permeability distribution used as background in general 3d single well formation testing results confirm that the jps method enables accurate modeling of transient pressure measurements acquired under diverse flow regimes including but not limited to early time spherical and hemispherical flow and middle to late time radial flow equally important to accuracy is the computational efficiency of the rfm scheme which is evident in large size problems on average for a 3d numerical model comprising 362100 cells each utawns simulation required 800 0 cpu seconds while each perturbed solution with a priori psf library required only 10 cpu seconds for their execution 4 3 two dimensional multi well flow systems the perturbation analysis of single well diffusion phenomena enabled the quantification of permeability and the description of flow dynamics in the near wellbore region next we focus our attention to the study of multi well conditions and spatial heterogeneities at the field scale the numerical properties of our perturbation method lend itself to capture any distribution type geometry and history of sources and arbitrary spatial variations in anisotropic permeability accordingly the assumed 2d cartesian model is described in fig 12 and consists of a 20 ft thick anisotropic checkerboard type heterogeneous horizontal aquifer with one production and one injection vertical well the pressure transient is acquired in an observation well equidistant to both producer and injector on the one hand the production well is conditioned to the following drawdown buildup sequence pump out for one day at 143 1 m3 d followed by one day of shut in on the other hand for the same time schedule the injection well operates at two different flow rates namely 15 9 m3 d and 127 2 m3 d respectively leaving aside the perturbations the background medium for this example is given by fig 12 following the workflow in fig 1 the two numerical simulations required in this case to compute the sensitivity functions are one dedicated to capture the action of the producer and the injector and another one that invokes a fictitious source producing at an arbitrary flow rate out of the observation well during the same time interval fig 13 describes the x and y psf of the background medium after two days this example confirms that with relatively low computational effort the proposed method constructs flow history dependent sensitivity maps for anisotropic and spatially heterogeneous permeable media the limitation in complexity of the psfs that one can obtain from the jps method is dictated by the robustness of the numerical aquifer model in fig 13 hot colors identify spatial zones where a perturbation in permeability and the corresponding perturbation in pressure are directly or positively correlated while cold colors identify an inverse or negative correlation the sign of the psfs is also indicative of the direction of flow relative to the observation point for instance for the given distribution of properties injection predominates when only considering the sensitivity in the y direction fig 13 b this behavior explains why the highly sensitive zone between the injection and the observation wells is positive qualitative knowledge of this type could benefit groundwater hydraulics and subsurface engineering tasks such as in the placement of infill wells or hydraulic fractures the following examples are intended to examine field scale conditions comprising discrete type permeability perturbations such as those due to impermeable barriers and natural or hydraulic fractures thus as shown in fig 12 we consider a 200 ft wide and 1000 ft long single perturbation for two distinct locations each one parallel to the principal axes of anisotropy placement of the anomalies was chosen such that the first one captures primarily the effect of a positive sensitivity fig 13 b while the second one captures primarily the effect of a negative sensitivity fig 13 a we assume that the perturbed property of the anomaly parallel to the x axis is kyy 5000 md and that of the anomaly parallel to the y axis is kxx 5000 md figs 14 and 15 describe for both cases the born approximation of the rfm scheme obtained directly from the flow history dependent psfs i e without invoking the discrete convolution final step in the workflow described in fig 2 the l 2 norm of the relative error for the case with the perturbation parallel to the x axis i e fig 14 is ε 6 8 while the l 2 norm of the relative error for the case with the perturbation parallel to the y axis i e fig 15 is ε 4 4 the rather low errors obtained when modeling anisotropic discrete type heterogeneities at the field scale validate the accuracy of flow history dependent psfs of spatially complex permeable aquifers furthermore sensitivities of this type allow one to readily understand the influence as a function of space and relative flow direction that a property perturbation has on the observed pressure response for instance because the permeability of the anomaly traversing a positive influence zone is larger than that of the background medium the pressure measured at the observation well is also larger and it appears herein as a more negative dimensionless pressure fig 14 conversely an inverse or negative correlation occurs when the anomaly traverses the negative zone of the sensitivity map fig 15 information of this kind provides valuable insight for instance to hydrologists and reservoir engineers for the appraisal of unexpected transient pressure behavior 5 discussion in 1974 carter et al reproduced jacquard and jain s 1965 original variational formulation in pressure diffusion terms they developed among others the equation for the sensitivity coefficients of the jacobian matrix required for solving gradient based inverse problems carter s et al 1974 sensitivity equation is equivalent to the sensitivity coefficient equation derived from the adjoint function described by dogru and seinfeld 1981 for solving inverse problems although such expressions are also equivalent to the anomaly function given by eq 4 our developments differ from previously published works in these respects i the equations presented herein are derived partially from perturbation principles escobar gómez and torres verdín 2018 which constitute the basis for first order approximations instead of solving the associated nonlinear inverse problem we show that perturbed type solutions are suitable for efficient and accurate forward modeling of pressure diffusion phenomena ii the derivation of the equations from perturbation principles allows one to leverage the concept of sensitivity functions maps eq 5 with no need to formulate and solve an adjoint problem sensitivity functions provide valuable insight into permeability pressure correlations and flow dynamics such attributes are beneficial for improved aquifer description and optimized nonlinear parameter estimation algorithms e g via appropriate selection of the inversion measurements and reduced sequential calculations of the jacobian matrix iii the tensorial form of the sensitivity function enables one to decouple the influence as a function of space and time that each local component of the permeability field has on the observed pressure transients moreover because the anomaly function is explicitly given by a tensorial integral efficient forward and inverse modeling of anisotropic perturbations can be readily performed via perturbation principles 6 conclusion we introduced an efficient perturbation method which requires a maximum of two numerical simulations to compute flow history dependent multi point sensitivity functions relative to one observation point contrary to former laplace domain approaches time domain perturbation theory provides physics based intuition for improved aquifer description subsurface geoscience and engineering design for instance the local sign of the sensitivity function defines the type of correlation between a perturbation in permeability and the corresponding perturbation in pressure it also indicates the direction of darcy s flow relative to the observation point knowledge of this type is valuable a in the appraisal of abnormal unexpected pressure behavior otherwise difficult to examine with conventional techniques b in the design of infill wells or hydraulic fractures c in the design of next generation hydraulic testing tools or configurations and d when solving nonlinear inverse problems to estimate the spatial distribution of permeability multidimensional synthetic studies including vertical and azimuthal monitoring probes and multi well conditions were examined for diverse heterogeneity dominated fluid flow regimes results showed that the numerical properties of the jps method enable one to compute the psf tensor of anisotropic and spatially heterogeneous permeable media perturbed solutions of the rfm scheme become a reliable alternative for modeling diffusion phenomena in permeable groundwater systems over a wide range of subsurface conditions with perturbations greater than one order of magnitude of the background medium s permeability first order approximations yielded relative errors in pressure of ε 7 0 however it was also shown that large contrasts in permeability and great proximity of the perturbation to observation source points can degrade the accuracy of the approximations finally with a priori psf library the computational advantage of the rfm scheme with respect to explicit finite difference algorithms is approximately two orders of magnitude for the examples examined in this paper 7 future research work the findings of the present study and those of escobar gómez and torres verdín s 2018 constitute the foundations for two ongoing lines of research by the same authors namely single phase flow inverse problems via perturbation theory and multi phase flow forward problems via perturbation theory specifically the following are ongoing related developments single phase flow inverse problems via perturbation theory the inversion work does not seek to develop a new inversion method but rather to take advantage of the efficiency of single phase perturbation theory when solving gradient based parameter estimation problems for which the number of unknowns is greater than the number of measurements the permeability sensitivity functions derived from perturbation theory are directly related to the jacobian matrix thus the authors advance an efficient sequential computation of sensitivity coefficients frequently the most time consuming component of nonlinear inverse algorithms direct approaches demand of unknown parameters of measurement points more simulation runs to compute a single jacobian matrix than the proposed perturbation approach whereby the latter becomes more computationally efficient permeability pressure correlations help to verify that the spatial sensitivity maps stemming from the selected measurement points cover the petrophysical zones of interest otherwise if the sensitivity due to the selected measurement points is small model properties in that location cannot not be reliably estimated the efficiency of conventional gradient based algorithms is compromised due to the computational overhead of building the jacobian matrix at each iteration assimilating the iterative error and convergence rate with the spatial sensitivity functions via rapid forward modeling solutions improves the efficiency of the inversion algorithm by reducing the number of sequential calculations of the jacobian matrix preliminary results indicate that starting with a single sensitivity function spatial anisotropic permeability distributions can be accurately obtained in half the time of otherwise conventional variational approaches multi phase flow forward problems via perturbation theory according to escobar gómez et al 2016 ii if the maximum anticipated pressure drop in the porous medium is moderate linearization of the black oil i e multi phase flow model yields accurate and efficient estimation of effective or total rock fluid properties under such conditions perturbation methods for single phase flow of incompressible fluids are also valid within a reduced range of pressure drop for single phase flow of compressible fluids furthermore such linearized multi phase perturbation theory would yield equations correlating pressure measurements with total system properties e g total mobility and total compressibility in lieu of individual phase or absolute properties if the linearization of the diffusivity equation s is unacceptable then the superposition principle does not hold therefore a nonlinear green s function kernel formulation is required for the joint perturbation superposition method to be valid given the multi phase nature of the problem multi phase flow sensitivity functions would correlate perturbations in relative permeability to individual phase pressure or fractional flow measurements in order to obtain an equation correlating rock fluid properties with fractional flow the authors suggest perturbing the corresponding property e g relative permeability in the saturation equation in addition an equivalent perturbation scheme for the pressure equation could be required to be solved simultaneously because the saturation equation is a function of both perturbed properties and measurements acknowledgments

638,we introduce a semi analytical iterative multiscale derivative computation methodology that allows for error control and reduction to any desired accuracy up to fine scale precision the model responses are computed by the multiscale forward simulation of flow in heterogeneous porous media the derivative computation method is based on the augmentation of the model equation and state vectors with the smoothing stage defined by the iterative multiscale method in the formulation we avoid additional complexity involved in computing partial derivatives associated to the smoothing step we account for it as an approximate derivative computation stage the numerical experiments illustrate how the newly introduced derivative method computes misfit objective function gradients that converge to fine scale one as the iterative multiscale residual converges the robustness of the methodology is investigated for test cases with high contrast permeability fields the iterative multiscale gradient method casts a promising approach with minimal accuracy efficiency tradeoff for large scale heterogeneous porous media optimization problems keywords subsurface flow gradient computation multiscale methods iterative multiscale finite volume direct method adjoint method 1 introduction derivative computation is an important aspect of gradient based optimization algorithms when the objective or cost function evaluation involves the numerical simulation of discretized partial derivative equations pde efficient gradient computation is of utmost importance it is well documented in the literature that the most efficient and accurate way of computing derivatives are the analytical direct anterion et al 1989 rodrigues 2006 oliver et al 2008 when the number of cost functionals is greater than the number of parameters and adjoint chavent et al 1975 li et al 2003 oliver et al 2008 kraaijevanger et al 2007 rodrigues 2006 jansen 2011 if the number of parameters is greater than the number cost functionals methods however even when considering efficient gradient methods due to the necessity to evaluate the forward model and the derivative information many times up until the optimality conditions are met techniques to reduce the forward model simulation cost have been proposed jansen 2011 cardoso et al 2009 van doren et al 2006 multiscale ms simulation methods jenny et al 2003 hou and wu 1997 have been increasingly employed for the efficient solution of elliptic zhou and tchelepi 2008 and parabolic ţene et al 2015 equations more specifically subsurface flow problems in highly heterogeneous porous media also many developments to extend its applicability to extended physics have been observed in the recent years lie et al 2017 moreover ms derivative computation strategies based on ms forward simulation models has also been subject of study ms adjoint formulation ms adj for single phase subsurface flow have been presented in fu et al 2010 2011 ms adjoint computation methods for multiphase flow have also been developed krogstad et al 2011 moraes et al 2017 more recently a mathematical framework for ms computation of derivative information has been developed de moraes et al 2017 it has been highlighted in de moraes et al 2017 fu et al 2010 that inaccurate ms gradient computations could lead to inaccurate gradient directions however as it is indicated in de moraes et al 2017 strategies that improve the ms forward simulation solution e g refinement of the ms coarse grid result in better gradient estimates moreover in fu et al 2010 it is suggested that an iterative ms gradient computation strategy could resolve the multiscale gradient inaccuracies in this work we develop an iterative multiscale gradient computation strategy which converges to the fine scale gradient solution thus allowing for error control and reduction for multiscale gradients the derivative computation method is based on the generic mathematical framework introduced in de moraes et al 2017 by augmenting the ms model equation and the state vectors with the i msfv smoothing stage the framework is capable of providing derivative information at any desired accuracy up to fine scale precision the augmentation is addressed by the implicit differentiation strategy in the formulation we avoid additional complexity involved in computing partial derivatives associated to the smoothing step by also only approximately solving the derivative state equation associated to the it also the strategy seamlessly accommodates both the direct and adjoint methods the remaining of this paper is organized as follows firstly we present an algebraic formulation for the i msfv method suitable for the derivation of the derivative computation methods next we derive the direct and adjoint methods to compute derivative information following the i msfv framework when the algorithms are presented numerical validation of the method against numerical differentiation is presented the numerical experiments conducted show that fine scale gradient can be reproduced via the i msfv method if the forward simulation converges to a small enough residual tolerance we show numerical evidence that there is a relationship between the gradient quality and the i msfv solution residual by comparing fine scale gradient and i msfv gradients and relating the difference between the two with the pressure error norm concluding remarks are finally presented in the last section 2 algebraic and algorithmic description of the multiscale iterative method we consider the set of equations that algebraically describes the forward simulation at the fine scale without any assumption regarding the underlying physical model as de moraes et al 2017 1 g f x θ 0 where g f r n f r n θ r n f represents the set of algebraic forward model equations x r n f is the state vector which for single phase flow contains the grid block pressures θ r n θ is the vector of parameters and the subscript f refers to fine scale there are nf fine scale cells and nθ parameters eq 1 implicitly assumes a dependency of the state vector x on the parameters θ i e 2 x x θ once the model state is determined the observable responses of the forward model are computed the forward model responses may not only depend on the model state but also on the parameters themselves and can be expressed as 3 y f h f x θ where h f r n f r n θ r n y represents the output equations jansen 2016 it is assumed that g f can be described as 4 g f x θ a θ x q θ where a θ r n f r n f matrix and q θ r n f a two stage multiscale ms solution strategy jenny et al 2003 wang et al 2014 can be devised by firstly computing a coarse scale solution 5 g x θ rap x rq a x q 0 g r n c r n θ r n c where nc is the number of coarse grid blocks and then an approximated fine scale solution 6 g x x θ x p x 0 where g r n f r n c r n θ r n f the so called prolongation operator p p θ which is an nf nc matrix that maps interpolates the coarse scale solution to the fine scale resolution the so called restriction operator r r θ is defined as an nc nf matrix which maps the fine scale to the coarse scale more information about how these operators are constructed for the multiscale finite volume msfv method can be found in zhou and tchelepi 2008 wang et al 2014 let x r n c be the coarse scale solution nc nf and x r n f the approximated fine scale solution the iterative multiscale strategy hajibeygi et al 2008 can be devised by considering versions of eqs 4 and 5 written in residual form let x ν 1 be an approximate solution to eq 4 at iteration ν 1 and 7 r ν 1 q a x ν 1 be the corresponding residual a multiscale improvement to this approximation can be devised by writing eq 5 in residual form as 8 g ν x ν x ν 1 θ a x ν r ν 1 0 where 9 r ν 1 r r ν 1 r ν 1 r n c here x ν is redefined as the coarse scale correction redefining eq 6 we have 10 g ν x ν x ν θ x ν p x ν 0 such that x ν now represents the approximate fine scale correction at iteration ν i e 11 x ν 1 2 x ν 1 x ν is an approximate solution of eq 4 augmented with the correction from the coarse scale calculation the approximate solution provided by eq 11 can be improved if successive smoothing steps are employed hajibeygi et al 2008 let 12 r σ ν 1 q a x ν 1 2 q a x ν 1 x ν r σ ν 1 r n f be the smoothed residual obtained from the approximation given by eq 11 and 13 g σ ν x ν x σ ν x ν 1 θ a x σ ν r σ ν 1 0 a version of eq 4 written in residual form here x σ ν r n f is the smoothed fine scale correction at iteration ν the solution smoothing is obtained by solving eq 13 using any iterative solver up to a prescribed loose tolerance or small maximum number of iterations hajibeygi et al 2008 ţene et al 2015 the solution for a given iteration ν is hence obtained from 14 g x ν x ν x ν x σ ν x ν 1 θ x ν x ν 1 x ν x σ ν 0 where g x ν r n f r n f r n f r n f r n θ r n f the ms iterative strategy is fully depicted in algorithm 1 where represents the 2 norm in algorithm 1 ϵ and ϵ σ are respectively the user defined tolerances for the outer loop and smoothing step that allows to control the smoothing step as a relative improvement starting from the ms approximate solution an investigation of an optimal relationship between the number of outer loops and the number of smoothing steps is presented in ţene et al 2015 3 iterative multiscale gradient computation for the developments that will follow in this section it is convenient to write the set of equations that is solved in every iteration namely eqs 8 10 13 and 14 in matrix form as 15 one must note however that in the i msfv procedure eq 13 is solved only approximately and therefore strictly speaking the equation in the third row of eq 15 does not hold the idea here is to describe the procedure in an algebraic manner ignoring this approximation in order to facilitate the presentation of the derivative calculation algorithms in the next section once the derivative calculation methods are obtained under the assumption that the algebraic relations in eq 15 hold the same type of smoothing approach employed in the i msfv to resolve high frequency errors will be used in the solution of the derivative information this results in a practical semi analytical algorithm for derivative calculation in an iterative formulation note that a fully analytical procedure would require calculating the derivative of the smoothing operator employed in the i msfv step 8 in algorithm 1 which can be quite complex due to its nonlinear character frank 2017 the proposed semi analytical approach also becomes general and applicable to any iterative procedure used in step 8 regardless of its nature a truly analytical derivative method would require the implementation of derivative calculation for each iterative procedure used more details on the implication of this assumption are discussed in 3 2 1 considering all equations that must be solved for all iterations ν 1 n ν they can be collated in a super vector rodrigues 2006 kraaijevanger et al 2007 jansen 2016 fashion as 16 g x θ g 1 x 1 x 0 x σ 0 θ g 1 x 1 x 1 θ g σ 1 x σ 1 x 1 x 0 x σ 0 θ g x 1 x 1 x σ 1 x 1 x 0 θ g 2 x 2 x 1 x σ 1 θ g 2 x 2 x 2 θ g σ 2 x σ 2 x 2 x 1 x σ 1 θ g x 2 x 2 x σ 2 x 2 x 1 θ g n ν x n ν x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 θ g n ν x n ν x n ν θ g σ n ν x σ n ν x n ν x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 θ g x ν x n ν x σ n ν x n ν x n ν 1 θ 0 and the super state vector defined as 17 x θ x 1 x 1 x σ 1 x 1 t x n ν 1 x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 x n ν 1 t x n ν x n ν x σ n ν x n ν t t note that we use bold italic in the notation to represent super vectors it is discussed in rodrigues 2006 de moraes et al 2017 de moraes et al how any derivative information can be efficiently computed from the pre and post multiplication of the sensitivity matrix g g r n y n θ by arbitrary matrices as 18 w g v w h x g x 1 g θ v w h θ v where v of order n θ p and w of order m ny are arbitrary matrices defined based on the derivative information one wants to obtain eq 18 requires the partial derivative of the model equations with respect to the parameters from eqs 5 and 6 as discussed in de moraes et al 2017 it follows that 19 g ν θ r θ ap r a θ p ra p θ x ν r θ q r q θ r θ a r a θ x ν 1 20 g θ ν p θ x ν and deriving eq 13 with respect to θ 21 g σ ν θ a θ x σ ν a θ x ν q θ a θ x ν 1 also from eq 14 it follows that 22 g x ν θ 0 for the sake of simplicity and in coherence with the msfv method used in the numerical experiments the dependency of r on θ is neglected now the order the operations in eq 18 are evaluated define the direct and adjoint methods the derivation of both methods will be discussed in the next sections 3 1 the direct method if w is factored out in eq 18 it can be rewritten as 23 g v h x z h θ v where 24 z g x 1 g θ v is solved from 25 g x z g θ v the linear system described in eq 25 can be re written in a block wise fashion for each iteration ν 26 where from eqs 8 10 13 and 14 27 g ν x ν g ν x ν g ν x ν g σ ν x ν g x ν x ν a 0 0 0 p i 0 0 0 a a 0 0 i i i and 28 g ν x ν 1 g ν x ν 1 g ν x ν 1 g σ ν x ν 1 g x ν x ν 1 0 0 0 r a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 i the partitioning lines indicate which matrix and vector terms belong to each iteration substituting eq 27 and 28 in eq 26 follows that 29 for every iteration the linear system that must be solved for the coarse scale equation is 30 z ν a 1 g ν θ v r a z x ν 1 for the fine scale approximate solution equation 31 z ν p z ν g ν θ v and for the smoothing equation 32 z σ ν a 1 g σ ν θ v a z ν a z x ν 1 as pointed out above it would not be feasible to fully solve eq 32 in order to obtain a practical derivative calculation method the same smoothing procedure used in the i msfv is applied here i e z σ ν is obtained by solving eq 32 using any iterative solver up to a prescribed loose tolerance or a small maximum number of iterations finally 33 z x ν z x ν 1 z ν z σ ν observing that h only depends on x x n ν eq 23 can be simplified to 34 g v h x z x n ν h θ v now the direct method for the iterative multiscale gradient computation can be fully determined it is depicted in algorithm 2 note that references to superscript 1 correspond to zero terms 3 2 the adjoint method now if v is factored out in eq 18 it can be rewritten as 35 w g z g θ w h θ where 36 z w h x g x 1 is solved from 37 z g x w h x the linear system described in eq 37 can be re written in a block wise fashion for each iteration ν as 38 the structure of eq 38 shows that it can be solved via back substitution i e the solution of the gradient information is backward in the iterations substituting eqs 27 and 28 in eq 38 follows that 39 from eq 39 and recalling that h only depends on x x n ν the transposed linear system that must be solved to compute z ν is given by 40 for ν nν while z n ν is calculated from 41 a t p t 0 0 0 i a t i 0 0 a t i 0 0 0 i z n ν t z n ν t z σ n ν t z x n ν t 0 0 0 h x t w t the equation that computes the adjoint state associated with g x ν reads 42 z x ν t z x ν 1 t a t r t z ν 1 t a t z σ ν 1 t ν n ν and 43 z x n ν t h x t w t the adjoint state for g σ ν is calculated from 44 z σ ν t a t z x ν t as discussed for the direct method in the proposed derivative calculation method eq 44 is solved as a smoothing step only using any iterative solver up to a prescribed tolerance or number of iterations for g ν the adjoint state is given by 45 z ν t z x ν t a t z σ ν t and finally for g ν 46 z ν a t p t z ν eq 35 can be written as a sum where each term corresponds to the contribution of one iteration 47 w g ν 0 n ν z ν g ν θ z ν g ν θ z σ ν g σ ν θ w h θ the algorithm can now be fully defined and is presented in 3 note the use of the notation wg ν to denote the partial sums in eq 47 and that references to superscript n ν 1 correspond to zero terms 3 2 1 remarks about the framework an alternative formulation for the i msfv formulation has been previously proposed and investigated in frank 2017 in that work both the state and the model equation vectors explicitly account for the smoothing stage the formulation here proposed is based on two observations firstly the implementation of the aforementioned variant although offers more control over the gradient quality relies on the ability of computing partial derivative matrices of smoothing step with respect to the parameters more specifically it implies on the knowledge of how the precondition m of the system matrix a is built for simpler iterative strategies e g jacobi which construction of m can be simple the computation of m θ is relatively simple however simpler iterative methods are usually less efficient also the requirement of knowing the construction of m hampers the utilization of black box type of pre conditioners secondly it has been shown in ţene et al 2015 that only a limited number of smoothing steps are necessary to result in an efficient i msfv solution strategy hence not much extra control would be achieved note that the linear solvers employed in lines 9 and 4 of respectively algorithms 2 and 3 are the same solvers employed in the solution of the forward simulation using the same prescribed loose tolerance hence the algorithms share the same computational advantages by solving for the approximated derivative information arising from the smoothing step the backward algorithm requires storing all intermediate states generated during the iterations in the forward run it also requires solving many systems of equations for each backward time step if the iteration process in the forward run goes until machine precision is reached then essentially the fully coupled system has been solved to fine scale precision and it might be more beneficial to neglect the iteration history and aim to solve the fine scale system of adjoint equations in a more efficient way given that the derivative computation problem is linear however we highlight that as it has been shown in the literature fonseca et al 2015 de moraes et al 2017 approximate gradients computed from approximate solutions are already sufficient to efficiently successfully lead the optimization process to the optimal solution how accurate this gradient will need to be is dependent on different aspects e g the optimization algorithm how early late the optimization process is in terms of finding the maximum minimum of a given objective function among others the algorithm here proposed has the advantage of controlling the gradient quality as will be shown in the numerical experiments presented in the next section 4 numerical experiments given the fundamental nature of the developments presented here we focus the numerical experiments on the validation of the computation and assessment of the gradient quality provided by the iterative multiscale method our experiments will be based on the evaluation of the gradient of a misfit objective function with no regularization term oliver et al 2008 48 o θ 1 2 h x θ d o b s t c d 1 h x θ d o b s with a gradient 49 θ o g t c d 1 h x θ d o b s where c d r n y n y is the so called data covariance matrix here c d will be considered a diagonal matrix given by oliver et al 2008 50 c d σ 2 i where σ 2 is the variance of the data measurement error in all experiments the fitting parameters are cell centered permeabilities the observed quantity d obs is the fine scale pressure at the location of non flowing observation wells therefore 51 h x i and 52 h x 0 in all experiments the standard deviation of the pressure measurement error is σ 0 03 note that the measurement error is also non dimensional this represents a very accurate measurement error in the range of those usually employed in synthetic study cases see e g oliver et al 2008 note that the wells are controlled by bottom hole pressure expressed in terms of a non dimensional pressure i e 53 p d p p p r o d p i n j p p r o d where pinj and pprod are the injection and production pressures respectively in all the experiments p i n j 1 0 and p p r o d 0 0 the grid block dimensions are δ x δ y δ z 1 m and the fluid viscosity is 1 0 10 3 pa s in addition in all the following test cases well basis functions are included the metric utilized to assess the i msfv gradient quality is the angle between fine scale and i msfv normalized gradients i e

requirement acceptable ms gradients are obtained if α is much smaller than 90 o fonseca et al 2015 and to prove our hypothesis we particularly interested in observing the behaviour of the metric as more accurate i msfv solutions are computed in our i msfv implementation the iterative process is controlled by the outer loop residual ϵ and the pre conditioner smoother error tolerance ϵ σ the krylov subspace biconjugate gradient stabilized method bicgstab saad 2003 is employed in the smoothing stage 4 1 validation experiments before focusing in the validation in this section we will validate the ims gradient method against the numerical differentiation method with a higher order two sided taylor approximation 57 θ o i 1 2 δ θ i o θ 1 θ i 1 θ i δ θ i θ i 1 θ n θ o θ 1 θ i 1 θ i δ θ i θ i 1 θ n θ where we consider δ to be a multiplicative parameter perturbation we define the relative error as 58 ε θ o n u m θ o i m s 2 θ o i m s 2 here θ o n u m is obtained by performing the proper amount of iterative multiscale reservoir simulations required to evaluate eq 57 θ o i m s is obtained by employing the iterative direct or adjoint gradient method to evaluate the correctness of the proposed iterative gradient computation methods as well as their implementation we investigate the linear decrease of the relative error ε by decreasing the parameter perturbation δ from 10 1 to 10 4 this investigation is carried out in two distinct examples both have a fine grid of 21 21 grid blocks we employ a 7 7 coarsening ratio giving a 3 3 coarse grid the reference twin experiment is generated with permeability realization number 992 fig 1 illustrates the fine coarse and dual grid cells along with the reference permeability next we determine the well positions we use the so called quarter well spot here two observation wells are placed near operating wells the full specifications can be found in table 1 the results of this experiment are found in fig 2 here we use a single outer iteration we use a very tight smoothing tolerance of ϵ σ 5 10 8 to ensure that the numerical gradient method produces accurate enough gradients first of all we can see that the fine scale numerical gradient method and the iterative ms gradient methods are of the same order of accuracy with respect to the perturbation δ for all different cases considered in all experiments we can see the linear decreasing behaviour of the relative error values ε as the perturbation δ decreases also note that the adjoint and direct methods provide the analytical gradient with the same level of accuracy in the first experiment a homogeneous test case with the permeability value of 1 0 e 13 is used the second experiment indicates the correctness of the method when it is applied to heterogeneous porous media problems 4 2 investigation of i msfv convergence behaviour and gradient quality in this investigation the error metric given by eq 54 is evaluated for a whole ensemble of heterogeneous permeability fields the ensemble is generated via the decomposition of a reference permeability image using principal component analysis parameterization fig 3 illustrates 4 different permeability realizations from the ensemble see jansen 2013 for more details the fine scale and coarse grids contain 21 x 21 and 7 x 7 cells respectively an inverted five spot well pattern is employed while four observation wells are placed close to the production wells the well configuration is depicted in table 2 the synthetic observed pressures at the observation well locations are created via the classical twin experiment strategy where the permeability field is extracted from the 1000 geological realizations the first one in fig 3 the robustness of the method is illustrated in fig 4 it is possible to observe that the angle between fine scale gradient and the i msfv gradient is smaller the tighter we make the outer loop residual tolerance moreover the variance also goes to almost zero as we set the residual tolerance to 1 e 4 for this set of relatively small permeability contrast perfect alignment with fine scale gradient is reached if the tolerance is set to 1 e 5 we highlight that the permeability contrast of this ensemble is not high next we assess the robustness for the method for geological settings with higher permeability contrasts 4 3 robustness with respect to heterogeneity contrast and distribution in order to further explore the point about the robustness of the method with respect to heterogeneity contrast and distribution four sets of 20 equiprobable realizations of log normally distributed permeability fields with a spherical variogram and dimensionless correlation lengths of ψ 1 0 5 and ψ 2 0 02 are generated using sequential gaussian simulations remy et al 2009 for each set the variance and the mean of ln k are 2 0 and 3 0 respectively where k is the grid block permeability as depicted in fig 5 for the realizations with a long correlation length the angles between the permeability layers and the horizontal axis are 0 o 15 o and 45 o a patchy small correlation length pattern is also considered fig 5d compared with the previous set the permeability contrast is much higher in this case the fine scale and coarse grids contain 100 100 and 20 20 cells respectively the well configuration utilized in this numerical experiment is depicted in table 3 the observed data is generated from a twin experiment associated with the first permeability realization of each set in this experiment ϵ 1 0 e 6 and ϵ σ 1 0 e 1 the box plot shown in fig 6 summarizes the required total number of smoothing steps for all outer i msfv steps the grid orientation effect aziz et al 1993 impact on the performance of the i msfv method is clear in this example the more the heterogeneity orientation is aligned with the flow orientation the less is the number of required iterations also in relation to fig 7 the more challenging the forward problem the more challenging it is to compute i msfv gradient in accordance to the fine scale gradient nevertheless in all cases almost all i msfv realization gradients are perfectly aligned with fine scale gradient demonstrating the robustness of the method 4 4 spe 10 comparative test case now we investigate the performance of our method in the spe 10 comparative case christie et al 2001 regarded as challenging model for upscaling durlofsky 2005 and multiscale simulation hajibeygi 2011 techniques here we consider the 2 d flow simulation of both top and bottom layer of the original 3d model which permeability fields are illustrated in fig 8 the fine grid dimensions is 60 220 while we employ a 12 x 20 coarse grid in the ms simulation a quarter five spot well setting is considered four observation wells are deliberately positioned in low permeability regions surrounded by high permeability regions the well positions are described in table 4 we emphasize that it has been reported see e g hajibeygi 2011 that the msfv method provides non monotone pressure solutions when solving the pressure for the bottom layer fig 8b strategies to improve the msfv solution among them the i msfv hajibeygi and jenny 2011 here considered are necessary to address the issue in this twin experiment the reference permeability field used to compute the observations is considered homogeneous with a value of 1e 13 in this experiment we fix ϵ σ 1 0 e 2 and vary ϵ 1 0 e 2 1 0 e 4 1 0 e 6 to evaluate whether the same convergence behaviour of the i msfv gradient toward fine scale gradient direction is observed once again we observe that the method provides accurate gradients even considering this challenging geological setting for both the top and bottom layers of the model see fig 9 4 5 discussion based on the results acquired from the different numerical cases of increasing complexity we demonstrated that our newly introduced method can provide accurate gradients up to fine scale accuracy if small enough residual tolerances are employed in the i msfv forward simulation also it is shown that only a few i msfv smoothing iterations are necessary to have reasonably accurate gradients however we highlight that from an optimization point of view gradients that are fully in accordance with fine scale gradient are not necessary as long as the gradient roughly points to the correct up downward direction the optimization process is able to progress towards the maximum minimum this is particularly true in the early iterations where there is a more steep region of the objective function on the other hand as the optimization process approaches the optimum more accurate gradients are required for a precise stopping criteria evaluation the convergent behaviour of the i msfv gradient which is demonstrated to be directly related to the outer residual tolerance which is an estimate defined a priori should allow for an error control of the gradient computation which ultimately would allow control of the optimization process performance the gradient computation methods here by design directly inherits the characteristics of the i msfv introduced in hajibeygi et al 2008 the solution of the backward transposed system of equations mirrors the solution strategy of the linear system of equations that arises from the forward problem even the system matrices from the forward and the backward system of equations share the same properties e g conditioning number therefore in principle all studies in the literature related to the robustness and efficiency of the i msfv method with respect to grid size level of heterogeneity among others should also be valid in the context of the gradient computation methods here proposed nevertheless further numerical studies are important to investigate the robustness of the method itself with respect to such aspects 5 summary and research perspectives we introduce iterative multiscale gradient computation algorithms based on the iterative multiscale finite volume i msfv simulation method by firstly re casting the i msfv in an algebraic framework we derive a flexible multi purpose derivative computation framework which accounts for the direct and adjoint methods their computational efficiency is discussed and it is shown that they share advantages equivalent to the i msfv method the new methods are

tolerance of 1 0 e 6 however we highlight that such accuracy is not necessary and only a few i msfv smoothing iterations are required for reasonably accurate gradients further control of the gradient quality via an a priori error estimate along the optimization process should allow for a computationally efficient optimization method more specifically a less accurate gradient estimate usually suffices in the early optimization iterations when the objective function convergence is more steep while more accurate gradients are required in the flatter regions for a more precise stopping

638,we introduce a semi analytical iterative multiscale derivative computation methodology that allows for error control and reduction to any desired accuracy up to fine scale precision the model responses are computed by the multiscale forward simulation of flow in heterogeneous porous media the derivative computation method is based on the augmentation of the model equation and state vectors with the smoothing stage defined by the iterative multiscale method in the formulation we avoid additional complexity involved in computing partial derivatives associated to the smoothing step we account for it as an approximate derivative computation stage the numerical experiments illustrate how the newly introduced derivative method computes misfit objective function gradients that converge to fine scale one as the iterative multiscale residual converges the robustness of the methodology is investigated for test cases with high contrast permeability fields the iterative multiscale gradient method casts a promising approach with minimal accuracy efficiency tradeoff for large scale heterogeneous porous media optimization problems keywords subsurface flow gradient computation multiscale methods iterative multiscale finite volume direct method adjoint method 1 introduction derivative computation is an important aspect of gradient based optimization algorithms when the objective or cost function evaluation involves the numerical simulation of discretized partial derivative equations pde efficient gradient computation is of utmost importance it is well documented in the literature that the most efficient and accurate way of computing derivatives are the analytical direct anterion et al 1989 rodrigues 2006 oliver et al 2008 when the number of cost functionals is greater than the number of parameters and adjoint chavent et al 1975 li et al 2003 oliver et al 2008 kraaijevanger et al 2007 rodrigues 2006 jansen 2011 if the number of parameters is greater than the number cost functionals methods however even when considering efficient gradient methods due to the necessity to evaluate the forward model and the derivative information many times up until the optimality conditions are met techniques to reduce the forward model simulation cost have been proposed jansen 2011 cardoso et al 2009 van doren et al 2006 multiscale ms simulation methods jenny et al 2003 hou and wu 1997 have been increasingly employed for the efficient solution of elliptic zhou and tchelepi 2008 and parabolic ţene et al 2015 equations more specifically subsurface flow problems in highly heterogeneous porous media also many developments to extend its applicability to extended physics have been observed in the recent years lie et al 2017 moreover ms derivative computation strategies based on ms forward simulation models has also been subject of study ms adjoint formulation ms adj for single phase subsurface flow have been presented in fu et al 2010 2011 ms adjoint computation methods for multiphase flow have also been developed krogstad et al 2011 moraes et al 2017 more recently a mathematical framework for ms computation of derivative information has been developed de moraes et al 2017 it has been highlighted in de moraes et al 2017 fu et al 2010 that inaccurate ms gradient computations could lead to inaccurate gradient directions however as it is indicated in de moraes et al 2017 strategies that improve the ms forward simulation solution e g refinement of the ms coarse grid result in better gradient estimates moreover in fu et al 2010 it is suggested that an iterative ms gradient computation strategy could resolve the multiscale gradient inaccuracies in this work we develop an iterative multiscale gradient computation strategy which converges to the fine scale gradient solution thus allowing for error control and reduction for multiscale gradients the derivative computation method is based on the generic mathematical framework introduced in de moraes et al 2017 by augmenting the ms model equation and the state vectors with the i msfv smoothing stage the framework is capable of providing derivative information at any desired accuracy up to fine scale precision the augmentation is addressed by the implicit differentiation strategy in the formulation we avoid additional complexity involved in computing partial derivatives associated to the smoothing step by also only approximately solving the derivative state equation associated to the it also the strategy seamlessly accommodates both the direct and adjoint methods the remaining of this paper is organized as follows firstly we present an algebraic formulation for the i msfv method suitable for the derivation of the derivative computation methods next we derive the direct and adjoint methods to compute derivative information following the i msfv framework when the algorithms are presented numerical validation of the method against numerical differentiation is presented the numerical experiments conducted show that fine scale gradient can be reproduced via the i msfv method if the forward simulation converges to a small enough residual tolerance we show numerical evidence that there is a relationship between the gradient quality and the i msfv solution residual by comparing fine scale gradient and i msfv gradients and relating the difference between the two with the pressure error norm concluding remarks are finally presented in the last section 2 algebraic and algorithmic description of the multiscale iterative method we consider the set of equations that algebraically describes the forward simulation at the fine scale without any assumption regarding the underlying physical model as de moraes et al 2017 1 g f x θ 0 where g f r n f r n θ r n f represents the set of algebraic forward model equations x r n f is the state vector which for single phase flow contains the grid block pressures θ r n θ is the vector of parameters and the subscript f refers to fine scale there are nf fine scale cells and nθ parameters eq 1 implicitly assumes a dependency of the state vector x on the parameters θ i e 2 x x θ once the model state is determined the observable responses of the forward model are computed the forward model responses may not only depend on the model state but also on the parameters themselves and can be expressed as 3 y f h f x θ where h f r n f r n θ r n y represents the output equations jansen 2016 it is assumed that g f can be described as 4 g f x θ a θ x q θ where a θ r n f r n f matrix and q θ r n f a two stage multiscale ms solution strategy jenny et al 2003 wang et al 2014 can be devised by firstly computing a coarse scale solution 5 g x θ rap x rq a x q 0 g r n c r n θ r n c where nc is the number of coarse grid blocks and then an approximated fine scale solution 6 g x x θ x p x 0 where g r n f r n c r n θ r n f the so called prolongation operator p p θ which is an nf nc matrix that maps interpolates the coarse scale solution to the fine scale resolution the so called restriction operator r r θ is defined as an nc nf matrix which maps the fine scale to the coarse scale more information about how these operators are constructed for the multiscale finite volume msfv method can be found in zhou and tchelepi 2008 wang et al 2014 let x r n c be the coarse scale solution nc nf and x r n f the approximated fine scale solution the iterative multiscale strategy hajibeygi et al 2008 can be devised by considering versions of eqs 4 and 5 written in residual form let x ν 1 be an approximate solution to eq 4 at iteration ν 1 and 7 r ν 1 q a x ν 1 be the corresponding residual a multiscale improvement to this approximation can be devised by writing eq 5 in residual form as 8 g ν x ν x ν 1 θ a x ν r ν 1 0 where 9 r ν 1 r r ν 1 r ν 1 r n c here x ν is redefined as the coarse scale correction redefining eq 6 we have 10 g ν x ν x ν θ x ν p x ν 0 such that x ν now represents the approximate fine scale correction at iteration ν i e 11 x ν 1 2 x ν 1 x ν is an approximate solution of eq 4 augmented with the correction from the coarse scale calculation the approximate solution provided by eq 11 can be improved if successive smoothing steps are employed hajibeygi et al 2008 let 12 r σ ν 1 q a x ν 1 2 q a x ν 1 x ν r σ ν 1 r n f be the smoothed residual obtained from the approximation given by eq 11 and 13 g σ ν x ν x σ ν x ν 1 θ a x σ ν r σ ν 1 0 a version of eq 4 written in residual form here x σ ν r n f is the smoothed fine scale correction at iteration ν the solution smoothing is obtained by solving eq 13 using any iterative solver up to a prescribed loose tolerance or small maximum number of iterations hajibeygi et al 2008 ţene et al 2015 the solution for a given iteration ν is hence obtained from 14 g x ν x ν x ν x σ ν x ν 1 θ x ν x ν 1 x ν x σ ν 0 where g x ν r n f r n f r n f r n f r n θ r n f the ms iterative strategy is fully depicted in algorithm 1 where represents the 2 norm in algorithm 1 ϵ and ϵ σ are respectively the user defined tolerances for the outer loop and smoothing step that allows to control the smoothing step as a relative improvement starting from the ms approximate solution an investigation of an optimal relationship between the number of outer loops and the number of smoothing steps is presented in ţene et al 2015 3 iterative multiscale gradient computation for the developments that will follow in this section it is convenient to write the set of equations that is solved in every iteration namely eqs 8 10 13 and 14 in matrix form as 15 one must note however that in the i msfv procedure eq 13 is solved only approximately and therefore strictly speaking the equation in the third row of eq 15 does not hold the idea here is to describe the procedure in an algebraic manner ignoring this approximation in order to facilitate the presentation of the derivative calculation algorithms in the next section once the derivative calculation methods are obtained under the assumption that the algebraic relations in eq 15 hold the same type of smoothing approach employed in the i msfv to resolve high frequency errors will be used in the solution of the derivative information this results in a practical semi analytical algorithm for derivative calculation in an iterative formulation note that a fully analytical procedure would require calculating the derivative of the smoothing operator employed in the i msfv step 8 in algorithm 1 which can be quite complex due to its nonlinear character frank 2017 the proposed semi analytical approach also becomes general and applicable to any iterative procedure used in step 8 regardless of its nature a truly analytical derivative method would require the implementation of derivative calculation for each iterative procedure used more details on the implication of this assumption are discussed in 3 2 1 considering all equations that must be solved for all iterations ν 1 n ν they can be collated in a super vector rodrigues 2006 kraaijevanger et al 2007 jansen 2016 fashion as 16 g x θ g 1 x 1 x 0 x σ 0 θ g 1 x 1 x 1 θ g σ 1 x σ 1 x 1 x 0 x σ 0 θ g x 1 x 1 x σ 1 x 1 x 0 θ g 2 x 2 x 1 x σ 1 θ g 2 x 2 x 2 θ g σ 2 x σ 2 x 2 x 1 x σ 1 θ g x 2 x 2 x σ 2 x 2 x 1 θ g n ν x n ν x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 θ g n ν x n ν x n ν θ g σ n ν x σ n ν x n ν x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 θ g x ν x n ν x σ n ν x n ν x n ν 1 θ 0 and the super state vector defined as 17 x θ x 1 x 1 x σ 1 x 1 t x n ν 1 x n ν 1 x σ n ν 1 x n ν 1 t x n ν x n ν x σ n ν x n ν t t note that we use bold italic in the notation to represent super vectors it is discussed in rodrigues 2006 de moraes et al 2017 de moraes et al how any derivative information can be efficiently computed from the pre and post multiplication of the sensitivity matrix g g r n y n θ by arbitrary matrices as 18 w g v w h x g x 1 g θ v w h θ v where v of order n θ p and w of order m ny are arbitrary matrices defined based on the derivative information one wants to obtain eq 18 requires the partial derivative of the model equations with respect to the parameters from eqs 5 and 6 as discussed in de moraes et al 2017 it follows that 19 g ν θ r θ ap r a θ p ra p θ x ν r θ q r q θ r θ a r a θ x ν 1 20 g θ ν p θ x ν and deriving eq 13 with respect to θ 21 g σ ν θ a θ x σ ν a θ x ν q θ a θ x ν 1 also from eq 14 it follows that 22 g x ν θ 0 for the sake of simplicity and in coherence with the msfv method used in the numerical experiments the dependency of r on θ is neglected now the order the operations in eq 18 are evaluated define the direct and adjoint methods the derivation of both methods will be discussed in the next sections 3 1 the direct method if w is factored out in eq 18 it can be rewritten as 23 g v h x z h θ v where 24 z g x 1 g θ v is solved from 25 g x z g θ v the linear system described in eq 25 can be re written in a block wise fashion for each iteration ν 26 where from eqs 8 10 13 and 14 27 g ν x ν g ν x ν g ν x ν g σ ν x ν g x ν x ν a 0 0 0 p i 0 0 0 a a 0 0 i i i and 28 g ν x ν 1 g ν x ν 1 g ν x ν 1 g σ ν x ν 1 g x ν x ν 1 0 0 0 r a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 i the partitioning lines indicate which matrix and vector terms belong to each iteration substituting eq 27 and 28 in eq 26 follows that 29 for every iteration the linear system that must be solved for the coarse scale equation is 30 z ν a 1 g ν θ v r a z x ν 1 for the fine scale approximate solution equation 31 z ν p z ν g ν θ v and for the smoothing equation 32 z σ ν a 1 g σ ν θ v a z ν a z x ν 1 as pointed out above it would not be feasible to fully solve eq 32 in order to obtain a practical derivative calculation method the same smoothing procedure used in the i msfv is applied here i e z σ ν is obtained by solving eq 32 using any iterative solver up to a prescribed loose tolerance or a small maximum number of iterations finally 33 z x ν z x ν 1 z ν z σ ν observing that h only depends on x x n ν eq 23 can be simplified to 34 g v h x z x n ν h θ v now the direct method for the iterative multiscale gradient computation can be fully determined it is depicted in algorithm 2 note that references to superscript 1 correspond to zero terms 3 2 the adjoint method now if v is factored out in eq 18 it can be rewritten as 35 w g z g θ w h θ where 36 z w h x g x 1 is solved from 37 z g x w h x the linear system described in eq 37 can be re written in a block wise fashion for each iteration ν as 38 the structure of eq 38 shows that it can be solved via back substitution i e the solution of the gradient information is backward in the iterations substituting eqs 27 and 28 in eq 38 follows that 39 from eq 39 and recalling that h only depends on x x n ν the transposed linear system that must be solved to compute z ν is given by 40 for ν nν while z n ν is calculated from 41 a t p t 0 0 0 i a t i 0 0 a t i 0 0 0 i z n ν t z n ν t z σ n ν t z x n ν t 0 0 0 h x t w t the equation that computes the adjoint state associated with g x ν reads 42 z x ν t z x ν 1 t a t r t z ν 1 t a t z σ ν 1 t ν n ν and 43 z x n ν t h x t w t the adjoint state for g σ ν is calculated from 44 z σ ν t a t z x ν t as discussed for the direct method in the proposed derivative calculation method eq 44 is solved as a smoothing step only using any iterative solver up to a prescribed tolerance or number of iterations for g ν the adjoint state is given by 45 z ν t z x ν t a t z σ ν t and finally for g ν 46 z ν a t p t z ν eq 35 can be written as a sum where each term corresponds to the contribution of one iteration 47 w g ν 0 n ν z ν g ν θ z ν g ν θ z σ ν g σ ν θ w h θ the algorithm can now be fully defined and is presented in 3 note the use of the notation wg ν to denote the partial sums in eq 47 and that references to superscript n ν 1 correspond to zero terms 3 2 1 remarks about the framework an alternative formulation for the i msfv formulation has been previously proposed and investigated in frank 2017 in that work both the state and the model equation vectors explicitly account for the smoothing stage the formulation here proposed is based on two observations firstly the implementation of the aforementioned variant although offers more control over the gradient quality relies on the ability of computing partial derivative matrices of smoothing step with respect to the parameters more specifically it implies on the knowledge of how the precondition m of the system matrix a is built for simpler iterative strategies e g jacobi which construction of m can be simple the computation of m θ is relatively simple however simpler iterative methods are usually less efficient also the requirement of knowing the construction of m hampers the utilization of black box type of pre conditioners secondly it has been shown in ţene et al 2015 that only a limited number of smoothing steps are necessary to result in an efficient i msfv solution strategy hence not much extra control would be achieved note that the linear solvers employed in lines 9 and 4 of respectively algorithms 2 and 3 are the same solvers employed in the solution of the forward simulation using the same prescribed loose tolerance hence the algorithms share the same computational advantages by solving for the approximated derivative information arising from the smoothing step the backward algorithm requires storing all intermediate states generated during the iterations in the forward run it also requires solving many systems of equations for each backward time step if the iteration process in the forward run goes until machine precision is reached then essentially the fully coupled system has been solved to fine scale precision and it might be more beneficial to neglect the iteration history and aim to solve the fine scale system of adjoint equations in a more efficient way given that the derivative computation problem is linear however we highlight that as it has been shown in the literature fonseca et al 2015 de moraes et al 2017 approximate gradients computed from approximate solutions are already sufficient to efficiently successfully lead the optimization process to the optimal solution how accurate this gradient will need to be is dependent on different aspects e g the optimization algorithm how early late the optimization process is in terms of finding the maximum minimum of a given objective function among others the algorithm here proposed has the advantage of controlling the gradient quality as will be shown in the numerical experiments presented in the next section 4 numerical experiments given the fundamental nature of the developments presented here we focus the numerical experiments on the validation of the computation and assessment of the gradient quality provided by the iterative multiscale method our experiments will be based on the evaluation of the gradient of a misfit objective function with no regularization term oliver et al 2008 48 o θ 1 2 h x θ d o b s t c d 1 h x θ d o b s with a gradient 49 θ o g t c d 1 h x θ d o b s where c d r n y n y is the so called data covariance matrix here c d will be considered a diagonal matrix given by oliver et al 2008 50 c d σ 2 i where σ 2 is the variance of the data measurement error in all experiments the fitting parameters are cell centered permeabilities the observed quantity d obs is the fine scale pressure at the location of non flowing observation wells therefore 51 h x i and 52 h x 0 in all experiments the standard deviation of the pressure measurement error is σ 0 03 note that the measurement error is also non dimensional this represents a very accurate measurement error in the range of those usually employed in synthetic study cases see e g oliver et al 2008 note that the wells are controlled by bottom hole pressure expressed in terms of a non dimensional pressure i e 53 p d p p p r o d p i n j p p r o d where pinj and pprod are the injection and production pressures respectively in all the experiments p i n j 1 0 and p p r o d 0 0 the grid block dimensions are δ x δ y δ z 1 m and the fluid viscosity is 1 0 10 3 pa s in addition in all the following test cases well basis functions are included the metric utilized to assess the i msfv gradient quality is the angle between fine scale and i msfv normalized gradients i e

requirement acceptable ms gradients are obtained if α is much smaller than 90 o fonseca et al 2015 and to prove our hypothesis we particularly interested in observing the behaviour of the metric as more accurate i msfv solutions are computed in our i msfv implementation the iterative process is controlled by the outer loop residual ϵ and the pre conditioner smoother error tolerance ϵ σ the krylov subspace biconjugate gradient stabilized method bicgstab saad 2003 is employed in the smoothing stage 4 1 validation experiments before focusing in the validation in this section we will validate the ims gradient method against the numerical differentiation method with a higher order two sided taylor approximation 57 θ o i 1 2 δ θ i o θ 1 θ i 1 θ i δ θ i θ i 1 θ n θ o θ 1 θ i 1 θ i δ θ i θ i 1 θ n θ where we consider δ to be a multiplicative parameter perturbation we define the relative error as 58 ε θ o n u m θ o i m s 2 θ o i m s 2 here θ o n u m is obtained by performing the proper amount of iterative multiscale reservoir simulations required to evaluate eq 57 θ o i m s is obtained by employing the iterative direct or adjoint gradient method to evaluate the correctness of the proposed iterative gradient computation methods as well as their implementation we investigate the linear decrease of the relative error ε by decreasing the parameter perturbation δ from 10 1 to 10 4 this investigation is carried out in two distinct examples both have a fine grid of 21 21 grid blocks we employ a 7 7 coarsening ratio giving a 3 3 coarse grid the reference twin experiment is generated with permeability realization number 992 fig 1 illustrates the fine coarse and dual grid cells along with the reference permeability next we determine the well positions we use the so called quarter well spot here two observation wells are placed near operating wells the full specifications can be found in table 1 the results of this experiment are found in fig 2 here we use a single outer iteration we use a very tight smoothing tolerance of ϵ σ 5 10 8 to ensure that the numerical gradient method produces accurate enough gradients first of all we can see that the fine scale numerical gradient method and the iterative ms gradient methods are of the same order of accuracy with respect to the perturbation δ for all different cases considered in all experiments we can see the linear decreasing behaviour of the relative error values ε as the perturbation δ decreases also note that the adjoint and direct methods provide the analytical gradient with the same level of accuracy in the first experiment a homogeneous test case with the permeability value of 1 0 e 13 is used the second experiment indicates the correctness of the method when it is applied to heterogeneous porous media problems 4 2 investigation of i msfv convergence behaviour and gradient quality in this investigation the error metric given by eq 54 is evaluated for a whole ensemble of heterogeneous permeability fields the ensemble is generated via the decomposition of a reference permeability image using principal component analysis parameterization fig 3 illustrates 4 different permeability realizations from the ensemble see jansen 2013 for more details the fine scale and coarse grids contain 21 x 21 and 7 x 7 cells respectively an inverted five spot well pattern is employed while four observation wells are placed close to the production wells the well configuration is depicted in table 2 the synthetic observed pressures at the observation well locations are created via the classical twin experiment strategy where the permeability field is extracted from the 1000 geological realizations the first one in fig 3 the robustness of the method is illustrated in fig 4 it is possible to observe that the angle between fine scale gradient and the i msfv gradient is smaller the tighter we make the outer loop residual tolerance moreover the variance also goes to almost zero as we set the residual tolerance to 1 e 4 for this set of relatively small permeability contrast perfect alignment with fine scale gradient is reached if the tolerance is set to 1 e 5 we highlight that the permeability contrast of this ensemble is not high next we assess the robustness for the method for geological settings with higher permeability contrasts 4 3 robustness with respect to heterogeneity contrast and distribution in order to further explore the point about the robustness of the method with respect to heterogeneity contrast and distribution four sets of 20 equiprobable realizations of log normally distributed permeability fields with a spherical variogram and dimensionless correlation lengths of ψ 1 0 5 and ψ 2 0 02 are generated using sequential gaussian simulations remy et al 2009 for each set the variance and the mean of ln k are 2 0 and 3 0 respectively where k is the grid block permeability as depicted in fig 5 for the realizations with a long correlation length the angles between the permeability layers and the horizontal axis are 0 o 15 o and 45 o a patchy small correlation length pattern is also considered fig 5d compared with the previous set the permeability contrast is much higher in this case the fine scale and coarse grids contain 100 100 and 20 20 cells respectively the well configuration utilized in this numerical experiment is depicted in table 3 the observed data is generated from a twin experiment associated with the first permeability realization of each set in this experiment ϵ 1 0 e 6 and ϵ σ 1 0 e 1 the box plot shown in fig 6 summarizes the required total number of smoothing steps for all outer i msfv steps the grid orientation effect aziz et al 1993 impact on the performance of the i msfv method is clear in this example the more the heterogeneity orientation is aligned with the flow orientation the less is the number of required iterations also in relation to fig 7 the more challenging the forward problem the more challenging it is to compute i msfv gradient in accordance to the fine scale gradient nevertheless in all cases almost all i msfv realization gradients are perfectly aligned with fine scale gradient demonstrating the robustness of the method 4 4 spe 10 comparative test case now we investigate the performance of our method in the spe 10 comparative case christie et al 2001 regarded as challenging model for upscaling durlofsky 2005 and multiscale simulation hajibeygi 2011 techniques here we consider the 2 d flow simulation of both top and bottom layer of the original 3d model which permeability fields are illustrated in fig 8 the fine grid dimensions is 60 220 while we employ a 12 x 20 coarse grid in the ms simulation a quarter five spot well setting is considered four observation wells are deliberately positioned in low permeability regions surrounded by high permeability regions the well positions are described in table 4 we emphasize that it has been reported see e g hajibeygi 2011 that the msfv method provides non monotone pressure solutions when solving the pressure for the bottom layer fig 8b strategies to improve the msfv solution among them the i msfv hajibeygi and jenny 2011 here considered are necessary to address the issue in this twin experiment the reference permeability field used to compute the observations is considered homogeneous with a value of 1e 13 in this experiment we fix ϵ σ 1 0 e 2 and vary ϵ 1 0 e 2 1 0 e 4 1 0 e 6 to evaluate whether the same convergence behaviour of the i msfv gradient toward fine scale gradient direction is observed once again we observe that the method provides accurate gradients even considering this challenging geological setting for both the top and bottom layers of the model see fig 9 4 5 discussion based on the results acquired from the different numerical cases of increasing complexity we demonstrated that our newly introduced method can provide accurate gradients up to fine scale accuracy if small enough residual tolerances are employed in the i msfv forward simulation also it is shown that only a few i msfv smoothing iterations are necessary to have reasonably accurate gradients however we highlight that from an optimization point of view gradients that are fully in accordance with fine scale gradient are not necessary as long as the gradient roughly points to the correct up downward direction the optimization process is able to progress towards the maximum minimum this is particularly true in the early iterations where there is a more steep region of the objective function on the other hand as the optimization process approaches the optimum more accurate gradients are required for a precise stopping criteria evaluation the convergent behaviour of the i msfv gradient which is demonstrated to be directly related to the outer residual tolerance which is an estimate defined a priori should allow for an error control of the gradient computation which ultimately would allow control of the optimization process performance the gradient computation methods here by design directly inherits the characteristics of the i msfv introduced in hajibeygi et al 2008 the solution of the backward transposed system of equations mirrors the solution strategy of the linear system of equations that arises from the forward problem even the system matrices from the forward and the backward system of equations share the same properties e g conditioning number therefore in principle all studies in the literature related to the robustness and efficiency of the i msfv method with respect to grid size level of heterogeneity among others should also be valid in the context of the gradient computation methods here proposed nevertheless further numerical studies are important to investigate the robustness of the method itself with respect to such aspects 5 summary and research perspectives we introduce iterative multiscale gradient computation algorithms based on the iterative multiscale finite volume i msfv simulation method by firstly re casting the i msfv in an algebraic framework we derive a flexible multi purpose derivative computation framework which accounts for the direct and adjoint methods their computational efficiency is discussed and it is shown that they share advantages equivalent to the i msfv method the new methods are validated via numerical experiments against numerical differentiation are shown to address the challenges encountered by the msfv gradient computation specifically associated with high heterogeneity contrast fine scale accurate gradients are obtained for challenging geological models with high permeability contrasts e g the spe 10 comparative test case if the i msfv model converges to an error tolerance of 1 0 e 6 however we highlight that such accuracy is not necessary and only a few i msfv smoothing iterations are required for reasonably accurate gradients further control of the gradient quality via an a priori error estimate along the optimization process should allow for a computationally efficient optimization method more specifically a less accurate gradient estimate usually suffices in the early optimization iterations when the objective function convergence is more steep while more accurate gradients are required in the flatter regions for a more precise stopping criterion hence the determination of an a priori error estimate should be a key development acknowledgements this work is part of rafael moraes phd project sponsored by petrobras through its employee

639,the paper deals with bed load rates in a mobile bed channel with emerging vegetation we have adapted the probabilistic deterministic sediment transport model of armanini et al 2015 to account for changes in the flow field induced by vegetation in addition to the two dimensionless parameters proposed by einstein 1950 φ and ψ the new adapted model also depends on a third dimensionless parameter representative of vegetation size and density the adaptation requires two major changes to the original model by armanini et al 2015 firstly the presence of vegetation reduces the bed area that is active with processes of sediment entrainment and deposition to account for this we propose reducing the net unit area useful for the exchange of sediments between bed and flow in proportion to vegetation density this hypothesis implies redefining einstein s parameter φ which represents the dimensionless sediment transport rate secondly the presence of vegetation modifies some important parameters that according to the adopted model contribute to the formation of the bed load i e probability distributions of the particle hop length and detachment instead of adapting the bed load formula to account for vegetation we propose redefining both of einstein s dimensionless parameters φ and ψ so that they are functions of the vegetation characteristics this formulation is compared with a wide range of experimental data obtained in a laboratory channel where the plants were represented by rigid emerging cylinders of different sizes and distribution densities within the channel under statistically homogenous and stationary conditions these tests provided solid flow rates and hydrodynamic characteristics for 93 configurations with different values of hydrodynamic granulometric and stem parameters the comparison between experimental results and theoretical predictions shows the validity of the approach keywords sediment transport vegetation rivers fluvial morphology fluid mechanics 1 introduction the importance of vegetation in improving the quality of coastal and riverine environments is widely recognized moreover vegetation influences river morphology by affecting erosion and deposition processes in stream beds and flood plains abt et al 1994 murray and paola 2003 coulthard 2005 tal and paola 2007 zong and nepf 2010 vegetation increases local resistance to flow because of drag offered by stems and foliage nepf and vivoni 2000 this causes a reduction of depth averaged velocity and an increase in water depth when compared to the situation without vegetation nepf 1999 kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 carollo et al 2002 righetti and armanini 2002 carollo et al 2005 armanini et al 2005 ghisalberti and nepf 2006 liu et al 2008 righetti 2008 nepf 2012 kothyari et al 2009 cavedon 2012 furthermore vegetation has a great influence on the profiles of turbulence intensity and reynolds stresses tsujimoto 1999 lópez and garcía 2001 lightbody and nepf 2006 liu et al 2008 these effects on velocity and turbulence profiles make it particularly difficult to understand the mechanisms of sediment transport through a vegetated patch kothyari et al 2009 cavedon 2012 very often sediment transport rates in vegetated beds are calculated in analogy with the theories and formulae for bed loads in unvegetated rivers that is by assuming that the bed shear stress τo is responsible for sediment entrainment and consequently for bed load transport tollner et al 1982 jordanova and james 2003 folkard 2011 the bed shear stress is estimated directly with empirical formulae similar to those used in the absence of vegetation alternatively it is obtained by subtracting the drag offered by vegetation from the global flow resistance partitioning method villada arroyave and crosato 2010 thus the bed shear stress is converted into an equivalent skin friction or grain friction velocity u o τ o ρ that is introduced directly into an appropriate solid transport formula in which the values of constants can be modified as functions of vegetation characteristics armanini et al 2009 wu and he 2009 baptist et al 2007 wu et al 2005 righetti 2008 the situation brought yager and schmeeckle 2013 to write that although flow patterns through vegetation have received considerable attention few studies quantitatively examine the relationship between near bed 1 cm flow turbulence and local and reach averaged bed load transport previous investigations have related suspended sediment fluxes to changes in flow turbulence throughout the flow column but not at the bed since then new contributions have appeared in literature that have shed new light on the theme le bouteiller and venditti 2014 2015 vargas luna et al 2015 solari et al 2016 caponi and siviglia 2018 bertagni et al 2018 but we cannot conclude that a complete and exhaustive theoretical or experimental framework for the problem exists yet the availability of reliable mathematical models of sediment transport through vegetation could have real practical benefits once resolved for example it could aid in assessing the short and long term consequences on river morphology of restoration and rehabilitation interventions in general one and two dimensional depth integrated morphodynamic shallow water models require two closure relations one for flow resistance and one for sediment transport capacity crowder and diplas 2000 armanini 2018b closure relations are almost always equilibrium relations they are based on the assumption that the flow is in equilibrium locally that is to say that flow resistance and sediment flow rate are what they would be if the flow were locally uniform steady and homogenous in the flow direction under the local conditions of velocity and water depth armanini 2018b from this point of view flow in beds with submerged vegetation is substantially different from in beds with emergent vegetation in a prismatic channel with uniformly distributed emergent vegetation the stationary condition coincides with the homogeneous condition of uniform channel flow in this case a variation in bed level through deposition or erosion does not cause a change in the net height of vegetation which is always equal to the depth of flow therefore it does not affect the resistance of the vegetation either the same cannot be said for submerged vegetation where for example the burial of vegetation during the deposition of sediments causes a variation in net height of the vegetation itself and therefore a change to its drag see appendix a with reference to the relatively simpler problem of homogeneous emergent vegetation in this paper we propose an attempt to discern the effects of emergent vegetation on sediment transport for this reason we conducted an experimental investigation in a mobile bed laboratory channel to measure liquid and solid flow rates and bed and free surface profiles with adequate precision in the channel it was possible to recirculate liquid and solid discharges so as to obtain a statistically stationary liquid and sediment flow our approach is based on a reconsideration of the different steps in the formulation of a recent model of bed load transport armanini et al 2015 in section 2 we describe our experimental strategy and the experimental set up section 3 explains how we adapted the sediment transport model for vegetated beds in section 4 we explain how we calibrated the experimental parameters of the model to give best fit with the experimental results in section 5 we present a discussion on assumptions we made in the model and draw some conclusions 2 experimental investigation strategy experiments were carried out in a rectangular flume 15 m long and 0 50 m wide the sidewalls and bottom of the flume were made of glass as in vargas luna et al 2016 vegetation elements were simulated by two types of cylindrical elements aluminum cylinders with an average diameter of 1 cm and rigid plastic cylinders with an average diameter of 3 cm both types of cylinders were inserted into the channel bottom and they emerged above the free surface in all the experiments cavedon 2012 we wanted to conduct the tests under conditions of statistical stationarity and homogeneity uniform channel flow first of all however we needed to verify whether these conditions occur with emerging vegetation and if they do what other conditions they imply we know from the literature jansen et al 1979 armanini 2018b that in a mobile bed prismatic channel the stationarity of the flow i e constant solid and liquid flow rates also entails its homogeneity in the flow direction it is possible to demonstrate appendix a that this is also valid for a mobile bed prismatic channel with emerging vegetation cylindrical stems provided that the vegetation is distributed in a statistically homogeneous arrangement therefore the water depth and the depth averaged velocity are constant in the flow direction when they are averaged over a longitudinal reach of the flume long enough to consider the density and shape of the vegetation to be distributed in a statistically homogeneous manner let us consider a mobile bed prismatic channel fed with constant solid and liquid discharges that is composed of two contiguous reaches each characterized by a different but statistically homogeneous density of vegetation in each reach a statistically stationary and homogenous flow is established each one characterized by its own uniform flow depth and depth averaged velocity the transition between the two reaches runs out in a relatively short distance i e of the order of water depth armanini and di silvio 1988 see section iv of the supplementary materials in the transition between reaches the flow profiles are very short and not analogous with permanent flow profiles that develop between reaches in a fixed bed channel with different vegetation densities with this in mind we partitioned the channel into four zones in series as shown in fig 1 three zones had a different vegetation density as shown in fig 2 the final downstream reach of the flume was free of plants allowing the free flow condition for each discharges for the flows of water and sediment we adopted two separate closed circuit supply systems guy et al 1967 parker and wilcock 1993 this feeding system requires a lot of technical skill to install but if well made it simplifies operations and logistics furthermore and more importantly it allows for tests of long duration even several days feeding solid and liquid flow rates that are statistically speaking significantly constant in time this solution in its entirety of zones and feeds allows us to compare the hydrodynamic and morphological conditions that occur in the different reaches under conditions of uniform flow that is to say with different vegetation density but crossed by the same liquid and solid flow rates see eqs a 2a and a 2b of the appendix we have identified each reach based on its areal density of vegetation ωv hereafter defined as 1 ω v j 1 n p s v j a t o t where sv j is the horizontal cross sections of the plants contained in a portion of the bed surface of area atot and np the number of plants contained in it two types of sediments were used fine uniform sand ρ s 2591 kg m 3 and d 50 0 5 mm and artificial spherical particles composed of light polymeric material ρ s 1050 kg m 3 and d 50 0 55 mm in each test we measured the sediment discharge qs and the water discharge q which were the same in the four zones of the flume the slopes of the free surface and average bed surface ifs and ib coincident and the water depth h in each zone all experiments continued until conditions of equilibrium were reached as demonstrated in appendix a when the stationary condition was attained along the flume uniform flow conditions were established in each reach of the channel this aspect deserves attention since one of the major problems with experiments in fixed bed channels is the achievement of uniform flow conditions paradoxically the situation is simpler with mobile beds since flow stationarity guarantees its uniformity in fixed bed channels on the other hand the uniform flow condition also depends on boundary conditions the water discharge q was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter installed in the water recirculation system the sediment transport rate was measured at intervals of one or two hours during daylight hours by intercepting the solid volume discharged at the final end of the channel with a net for 10 20 min however the sediment rates measured at the end of the flume were subject to oscillations in some cases even of considerable amplitude the water surface and the bed levels were also measured periodically these profiles were measured with a pointer gauge mounted on a trolley moving along rails above the flume and with a set of piezometers which gave a more precise measure of the free surface slope when this was very small less than 0 01 a test was considered to be in a statistically steady condition when variations in bed elevation averaged across channel width in the vegetated reaches fluctuated within values of approximately 1 mm for at least 24 h the condition of stationarity was also confirmed by a good parallelism between the free surface profile and that of the bed for each partition of the channel with constant vegetation density for this purpose the slope of the water surface was determined by least square linear regression of the pointer gauge measurements and their locations a more detailed description of the experimental apparatus and measurements is reported in cavedon 2012 some examples of these measurements are also reported in section 3 of the supplementary materials 3 sediment transport in vegetated streams the analysis presented here concerns the bed load transport rate in a mobile bed channel with uniform flow that is in statistically stationary and homogenous conditions in these conditions i e in the absence of average erosions and depositions in time and space transport rate and transport capacity coincide and hereafter we will use the two terms indiscriminately the most widely used theories for bed load transport in unvegetated channels can be roughly classified as those based on a columbian approach somehow derivable from the du boys 1879 scheme statistical theories such as einstein 1950 theory theories based on the concept of grain interactions such as bagnold 1936 theory and kinetic theories for granular flows hsu et al 2004 in general these models arrive at a formulation in terms of two dimensionless parameters einstein 1950 2 φ q s d p g δ d p and ψ g δ d p u 2 where qs is the solid flow rate per unit width dp is a representative diameter of the particles usually the mean or the geometric mean diameter d 50 of the grain size distribution δ ρ s ρ w ρ w is the submerged relative density of the material with ρs and ρw being the densities of the solid and of the water respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and u τ o ρ is the shear velocity or friction velocity where τo is the average bed shear stress φ is einstein 1950 the dimensionless sediment transport rate and ψ the flow intensity parameter since the formulae are calibrated in statistically steady and homogenous conditions uniform channel flow from the momentum balance we have that u g r h i e where rh is the hydraulic radius and ie is the slope of energy line which given the uniformity of flow coincides with the slopes of the free surface and the bed if the channel is wide enough and the bed is relatively rough compared to the side walls we can assume that rh h this hypothesis is even more reasonable in the presence of vegetation because of the drag caused by the plants henceforth we will adopt this approximation so that u g h i e in many bed load formulae the flow intensity parameter is replaced by its reciprocal i e the shields mobility parameter θ 1 ψ furthermore many formulae also contain the critical mobility parameter θcr shields 1936 this parameter however does not appear in stochastic or semi stochastic theories or in the formulae derived from them e g einstein 1950 in our extension of bed load formulae to vegetated beds we prefer a model in which the critical condition of incipient motion does not appear because its definition in a vegetated bed is a further complication among these approaches einstein 1950 theory likely represents the most complete theoretical model that is suitable for an extension to a complicated flow field such as that established within emerging vegetation armanini et al 2009 einstein s original theory is not without conceptual problems however yalin 1977 ancey et al 2006 hu and guo 2010 armanini et al 2015 several authors see yalin 1977 have proposed suitable revisions of the theory here we refer to a recent revision armanini et al 2015 which we will indicate hereafter as ballistic model 3 1 main features of the adopted sediment transport model the ballistic model armanini et al 2015 is based on the observation that in statistically stationary and homogeneous channel flow solid discharge is formed by all the grains crossing the generic cross section of the channel a in fig 3 per unit time the infinitesimal contribution to the bed load dqs by the infinitesimal strip dx of unit width and located in the generic position x upstream of the reference cross section a is given only by those particles that once detached from the bed are able to jump from x to section a i e the particles with a probability pj of having a range longer than x that is 3 d q s u s α 2 d p 2 d x α 2 d p 2 p j p 0 where us is the longitudinal component of the particle velocity at the instant it crosses the section a α 2 d p 2 is the projected frontal area of the particle and the ratio d x α 2 d p 2 expresses the number of particles contained in the element dx of the bed surface of unit width p 0 is the probability of particle detachment the model assumes the following hypotheses i pj and p 0 are gamma distributions 4 p j x l m ξ e ξ d ξ 1 x l m e x l m and 5 p 0 b a ψ 1 η 0 a ζ e ζ d ζ 1 b a ψ 1 η 0 a e b a ψ 1 η 0 a where ξ and ζ are variables of integration lm is the average range of the particles contributing to the bed load and b a is a constant ii the particle velocity us depends on the shear velocity and on the flow intensity parameter that is u s a u g δ d p ψ where au is a constant iii the average particle range is expressed through a hyperbolic function of the flow intensity parameter ψ 6 l m d p 100 1 4 ψ by substituting the above expressions for p

transport rate φ based on a comparison with a large number of experimental data the authors suggested the following set of constants for their model a u 0 5 b a 0 45 η 0 a 2 eq 7 was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data 3 2 preliminary considerations we had initially tried to link the sediment transport rate through stems to the flow intensity parameter ψ o g δ d u o 2 expressed in function of the grain shear stress τo only this was calculated with the logarithmic relation frequently used for this purpose einstein 1950 van rijn 1984 baptist 2005 that binds the depth averaged velocity to the skin friction velocity u o τ o ρ relative to the bed shear stress 8 u u o 5 75 log 10 12 h 3 d p from the friction velocity u o we calculated the flow intensity parameter relative to the wall stress only ψ o g δ d u o 2 the graph on the left of fig 4 clearly shows that the solid discharge calculated as a function of the skin friction is systematically underestimated in particular as vegetation density increases the deviations between calculated and measured transport rates increase consistently we then checked whether we could get better results by using the flow intensity parameter calculated with respect to the total resistance ψ tot in this case ψ t o t g δ d p u t 2 in which u t g h i e is the total friction velocity where ie is the slope of the energy line which coincides with that of the bed and free surface the graph on the right of fig 4 compares the sediment transport capacity calculated as a function of ψ tot through eq 7 with the experimental data the figure shows that the calculated flow rate systematically exceeds the measured ones this result already observed baptist 2005 is not surprising given that the free surface and energy gradient ie is strongly affected by the hydrodynamic drag offered by the plants while the drag offered by the plants does not reflect directly on the sediment transport mechanisms we can imagine that the plants modify some mechanisms that contribute to the solid flow rate for example the probability pj relative to the length of the particles hops the average range lm and the entrainment probability p 0 could all potentially be influenced by the different distribution of velocity and turbulence statistics induced by the presence of the stems besides it is quite reasonable to assume that the scale of velocities relevant to these quantities is somehow linked to the grain friction velocity u o the total friction velocity u t or ultimately to some combination of the two scales to better understand how the presence of vegetation influences the sediment transport capacity it is convenient to evaluate the role of the different forces contributing to the total flow resistance in terms of the flow intensity parameter 3 3 momentum analysis to highlight the effects of bed shear stress and drag on the flow intensity parameter it is useful to apply the momentum balance to a reach of channel with homogeneously distributed emergent vegetation let us consider a section of stream of length l and width b and with a cross section area a b h as shown in fig 5 following a procedure similar to that proposed by petryk and bosmajian 1975 we can state that in uniform flow conditions the component in the longitudinal direction of the weight of the fluid in the control volume ρ g a l ie is balanced by the stresses acting on the bed τo b l and by the sum of hydrodynamic drags offered by the np plants present in the control volume j 1 n p f d j 9 ρ g a l i e τ o b l j 1 n p f d j where i e i b tan α b sin α b is the slope of the energy line coincident with the bed slope the drag offered by a single plant can be expressed in function of the drag coefficient cd the average projected area of the plant sv j and the velocity averaged over the channel cross section u 10 f d j c d ρ s v j u 2 2 to simplifying eq 9 we recall that τ o ρ u o 2 and we introduce the total friction velocity u t g h i e which can be rewritten as 11 i e u t 2 g h so that eq 9 becomes 12 u t 2 u o 2 u 2 2 l b j 1 n p c d j s v j u o 2 1 u u o 2 n p 2 c d h d v l b d v is the average diameter of the plants d v j 1 n p s v j n p and c d the average drag coefficient furthermore according to the definition of areal density of vegetation eq 1 can be written 13 ω v n p π 4 d v 2 l b the ratio u u o 2 in eq 12 can be expressed as 8 f where f is the darcy weisbach friction coefficient in the case of a channel with a rough bed this ratio can be expressed with a simple monomial formula see armanini 2018a as 14 u u o a h d p b where for example according to meyer peter and müller 1948 a 8 30 b 0 167 and d p d 90 while according to strickler 1923 a 6 74 b 0 167 and d p d 50 however we expect both coefficient a and exponent b to be influenced by differences in the distributions of velocity and reynolds stresses induced by the plants by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into 12 we obtain 15 u t 2 u o 2 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b where 16 λ v ω v h d v and β t o t a 2 c d 2 π the parameter λ v will be henceforth known as the composite density of vegetation finally from eq 15 we have 17 ψ t o t g δ d p u t 2 g δ d p u o 2 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b 1 ψ o 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b 1 3 4 application of the bed load model to vegetated beds we have already shown fig 4 right that if in the bed load formula we assume the flow intensity parameter of the vegetated bed ψv equal to ψ tot we obtain an overestimation of the sediment transport rate we have also shown that by assuming eq 17 ψ v ψ o ψ t o t 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b the calculated sediment transport rate underestimates the measured one fig 4 left moreover the same graphs show that the experimental data concerning the same vegetation density tend to be reasonably disposed along lines parallel to the curves of the model for both cases given that the two expressions differ only by the dimensionless group λv h dp 2b it is then likely reasonable to assume 18 ψ v ψ t o t 1 β v λ v h d p b v where β v βtot and b v are two parameters that can be determined by experimental analysis of course in the case of unvegetated beds the above definition reduces to einstein s original definition of flow intensity parameter in the applications to vegetated beds of bed load models in general and of the ballistic model in particular we have to account that the presence of plants reduces the active exchange surface between the stream and the bed we obtained the bed load by integrating â the infinitesimal contribution dqs from the strip of infinitesimal length dx eq 3 over the whole channel bed upstream of the reference cross section a in the case of vegetation the strip area must be reduced by the encumbrance of the plants present in it we should also consider that around each plant an excavation similar to those found at bridge piers will form see yagci et al 2016 and neary et al 2011 a careful observation of sediment flow around the base of the cylinders showed that this area participates in the exchange process of sediments between river bed and stream but with a lower intensity the phenomenon is rather complex so we propose to account for it in the final bed load formula by appropriately increasing the extent of the plants cross section experimental observation suggests that the virtual dimension of this area is 3 7 times the cross section of the cylinders themselves in other words we can multiply the elementary area of the active surface dx in eq 3 by 1 α ω ω v where ωv is the areal plant density and α ω is a suitable coefficient of the order of some units that will be determined by the experiments as a consequence we changed the definition of the dimensionless sediment transport in vegetated beds as follows 19 φ v q s d g δ d p 1 α ω ω v of course in the case of unvegetated beds the above definition reduces to einstein s original definition of dimensionless sediment transport rate 4 model calibration it should be noted that in our approach we have not modified the bed load formula rather we modified the definitions of einstein 1950 two parameters φ and ψ that characterize sediment transport in other words the final bed load formula is formally similar to the original bed load formula for unvegetated beds 20 φ v 200 a u ψ v 1 4 ψ v 1 b a ψ v 1 η 0 a e b a ψ v 1 η 0 a but now the dimensionless transport rate φv is defined by eq 19 and the flow intensity parameter ψv by eq 18 the three parameters βtot b v and α ω that appear in their definitions are to be determined on the basis of experimental investigations these parameters were established through 93 different configurations with varying values of hydrodynamic granulometric and vegetational parameters see also section i of the supplementary materials liquid discharges q ranging from 0 0032 and 0 0250 m 3 s 1 solid discharges qs ranging from 1 068 10 8 and 5 43 10 4 m 3 s 1 vegetation density ωv ranging from 0 and 0 1414 two sediments types plastic d p 00055 m ρ s 1050 kg m 3 and sand d p 0005 m ρ s 2591 kg m 3 both uniformly sized fig 6 shows the experimental data for the tests with sand compared to the model prediction obtained with the following three constants β t o t 40 b v 0 and α ω 5 it is appreciable that a reasonable result is obtained with respect to all the data from the sand tests instead in all the tests with plastic material the model tends to overestimate the bed load as reported in fig 7 experimental observation suggests that the difference between the sand and plastic results is because part of the plastic material was transported in a regime between bed load and suspended load also due to the small value of particle drag coefficient the transport rate is likely dependent on fluid viscosity also without any intention of extending the ballistic model to suspended loads we wanted to take account of the possible effect of fluid viscosity within the range of our experiments for this purpose we identified the dimensionless particle diameter d d δ g ν 2 1 3 bonnefille 1963 as representative of these effects since it contains both the viscosity ν of the fluid and the relative reduced density δ ρ s ρ ρ of the solid we recall that van rijn 1984 also makes the bed load rate dependent on this parameter we then introduced an effective diameter into the definition of the flow intensity parameter ψv the effective diameter of a particle is defined as d e f f d p 1 f d where f d is a suitable function of d to be determined on the basis of the experimental results we found the following expression to give the best fit to sediment transport data 21 d e f f d p 1 1 5 d 0 75 1 consequently the final definition of the flow intensity parameter ψv in a vegetated bed is 22 ψ v g δ d p 1 1 5 d 0 75 1 u t 2 1 40 λ v after having processed the data we decided to slightly revise the three constants au b a and 1 η 0a of the model with respect to the original formulation armanini et al 2015 see fig s5 of the supplementary materials with the aim of improving the fit between model and data both with and without vegetation the new set of the constants is a u 0 35 b a 0 45 1 η 0 a 0 these work quite well in the absence of vegetation also in conclusion the transport capacity in bed load or quasi bed load condition in the presence of emerging rigid vegetation is calculated with 23 φ v 70 ψ v 1 4 ψ v 1 0 45 ψ v e 0 45 ψ v with 24 φ v q s d p g δ d p 1 5 ω v and ψv defined by eq 22 fig 8 compares the experimental data with the curve dotted line expressed by eq 23 which uses the definitions of φv and ψv given by eqs 24 and 22 respectively 5 discussion and conclusion the tests were carried out simultaneously for four different vegetation densities i e without vegetation and with sparse medium and dense vegetation under the same solid and liquid discharges therefore it is possible to draw some conclusions about the effect of vegetation on the parameters that influence the sediment transport process at constant liquid and solid flow rates this condition is important first we want to check whether the assumptions we made to build the ballistic model without vegetation and those we introduced to account for the influence of vegetation on the transport rate make physical sense in other words in addition to the quantitative comparison between model and experimental data presented in the previous sections we want to compare the situations with different stems concentration and without rigid stems for example table 1 shows a series of values recorded for the same liquid and solid flow rates from the table we observe that an increase in areal density of vegetation ωv results in i an increase in flow depth h ii a decrease in mean velocity u iii a significant relative increase in total shear velocity u t g h i e and iv a more consistent relative increase in the free surface and bed slopes ie this results in a decrease in the total flow intensity parameter ψ t o t g δ d u t 2 as reported in detail in cavedon 2012 and in the supplementary materials the trend of the data in the table 1 is the same in all the tests therefore we can affirm that this is a general trend with emergent rigid vegetation we can exclude that the effect of the stems is attributable to a simple reduction of the net cross section a constriction in a mobile bed channel flow armanini 2018b jansen et al 1979 cause both flow depth and speed to increase while here the velocity decreases as vegetation density increases we observe an increase in the global friction factor last column of table 1 which is proportional to the ratio u t u 2 section 3 3 and an increase in the energy slope ie these two effects can reasonably be implicated to increased stem drag since the sediment rate is constant in each of the four reaches of the flume the parameter φv dimensionless transport rate calculated with respect to an area reduced by the virtual footprint of the vegetation on the bed changes only slightly as can be seen in the sixth column of table 1 if φv remains nearly constant vegetation density changes then the flow intensity parameter ψv also change very little in accordance with eq 23 but since the vegetation density both ωv and λv increases significantly then we expect ψ tot ψ v 1 40 λ v to decrease according to eq 22 which is confirmed by column seven of the table moreover if ψv is nearly constant then the average particle range lm also remains nearly constant as is consistent with eq 6 fig 9 left shows the effect of vegetation density on the particle range it can be noted that for equal relative particle range ψtot decreases as plant density increases in other words to keep the sediment flow rate constant with increasing vegetation density a reduction of the total flow intensity parameter is needed in contrast when ψtot remains constant with increasing the vegetation density the particle range decreases as would be expected similar considerations can be made for the other ingredients of the sediment transport model adopted for example for po pj and us fig 9 right shows the effect of the dimensionless diameter d on the average particle range it can be noted that in our experimental conditions the influence of d is less significant than the other effects of the vegetation as would be expected in conclusion we have developed a procedure to estimate bed load transport capacity that is valid both with and without of emergent vegetation being present instead of modifying the solid transport formula we modified the definitions of einstein s two parameters φ and ψ in function of vegetation characteristics the approach has been calibrated for the ballistic model armanini et al 2015 however since this criterion acts only on the dimensionless parameters ψ and φ and not on the formula the method can be reasonably applied to any bed load formula based only on these two parameters as proof of this in section v of the supplementary materials we have compared our experimental data with curves obtained by applying the new dimensionless variables to the formulae of meyer peter and müller 1948 parker 1990 van rijn 1984 and ashida and michiue 1971 the discrepancies in these cases are greater than with the ballistic model however they fall within the band of uncertainty that usually exists for bed load formulae applied to unvegetated channels finally it is important to remember that the model as it is cannot be applied to the case of submerged vegetation where we expect that stationarity of the flow does not imply its homogeneity acknowledgments the work was carried out as part of contracts between aipo and cudam sap codes 30101264 30101561 30101727 and 30102086 appendix a stationary solution of a flow in a mobile bed channel with emergent vegetation if the average solid concentration is small enough i g c 1 then the conservation of liquid and solid masses in a 1d rectangular channel can be written as armanini 2018b a 1a t b h b z b b u h x 0 a 1b t b c h b c z b q s x 0 where b is the channel width c and u are sediment concentration and velocity respectively averaged over the channel cross section qs is the solid volumetric discharge zb is bed elevation and x and t are the longitudinal space and time coordinates respectively in statistically stationary conditions all the time derivatives vanish so eq a 1 reduces to a 2a b u h x 0 a 2b q s x 0 in section 4 we showed eqs 22 24 how the bed load in equilibrium condition and in the presence of homogenous emerging vegetation can be expressed through einstein s two variables modified to account for vegetation density φv and ψv according to eq 23 the bed load transport rate φv is a bijective function of the flow intensity parameter ψv of the type φ v f ψ ψ v where f ψ f u n c t ψ v is a general function representing the bed load formula i e the same function used to calculate bed transport capacity in the absence of vegetation from eq

639,the paper deals with bed load rates in a mobile bed channel with emerging vegetation we have adapted the probabilistic deterministic sediment transport model of armanini et al 2015 to account for changes in the flow field induced by vegetation in addition to the two dimensionless parameters proposed by einstein 1950 φ and ψ the new adapted model also depends on a third dimensionless parameter representative of vegetation size and density the adaptation requires two major changes to the original model by armanini et al 2015 firstly the presence of vegetation reduces the bed area that is active with processes of sediment entrainment and deposition to account for this we propose reducing the net unit area useful for the exchange of sediments between bed and flow in proportion to vegetation density this hypothesis implies redefining einstein s parameter φ which represents the dimensionless sediment transport rate secondly the presence of vegetation modifies some important parameters that according to the adopted model contribute to the formation of the bed load i e probability distributions of the particle hop length and detachment instead of adapting the bed load formula to account for vegetation we propose redefining both of einstein s dimensionless parameters φ and ψ so that they are functions of the vegetation characteristics this formulation is compared with a wide range of experimental data obtained in a laboratory channel where the plants were represented by rigid emerging cylinders of different sizes and distribution densities within the channel under statistically homogenous and stationary conditions these tests provided solid flow rates and hydrodynamic characteristics for 93 configurations with different values of hydrodynamic granulometric and stem parameters the comparison between experimental results and theoretical predictions shows the validity of the approach keywords sediment transport vegetation rivers fluvial morphology fluid mechanics 1 introduction the importance of vegetation in improving the quality of coastal and riverine environments is widely recognized moreover vegetation influences river morphology by affecting erosion and deposition processes in stream beds and flood plains abt et al 1994 murray and paola 2003 coulthard 2005 tal and paola 2007 zong and nepf 2010 vegetation increases local resistance to flow because of drag offered by stems and foliage nepf and vivoni 2000 this causes a reduction of depth averaged velocity and an increase in water depth when compared to the situation without vegetation nepf 1999 kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 carollo et al 2002 righetti and armanini 2002 carollo et al 2005 armanini et al 2005 ghisalberti and nepf 2006 liu et al 2008 righetti 2008 nepf 2012 kothyari et al 2009 cavedon 2012 furthermore vegetation has a great influence on the profiles of turbulence intensity and reynolds stresses tsujimoto 1999 lópez and garcía 2001 lightbody and nepf 2006 liu et al 2008 these effects on velocity and turbulence profiles make it particularly difficult to understand the mechanisms of sediment transport through a vegetated patch kothyari et al 2009 cavedon 2012 very often sediment transport rates in vegetated beds are calculated in analogy with the theories and formulae for bed loads in unvegetated rivers that is by assuming that the bed shear stress τo is responsible for sediment entrainment and consequently for bed load transport tollner et al 1982 jordanova and james 2003 folkard 2011 the bed shear stress is estimated directly with empirical formulae similar to those used in the absence of vegetation alternatively it is obtained by subtracting the drag offered by vegetation from the global flow resistance partitioning method villada arroyave and crosato 2010 thus the bed shear stress is converted into an equivalent skin friction or grain friction velocity u o τ o ρ that is introduced directly into an appropriate solid transport formula in which the values of constants can be modified as functions of vegetation characteristics armanini et al 2009 wu and he 2009 baptist et al 2007 wu et al 2005 righetti 2008 the situation brought yager and schmeeckle 2013 to write that although flow patterns through vegetation have received considerable attention few studies quantitatively examine the relationship between near bed 1 cm flow turbulence and local and reach averaged bed load transport previous investigations have related suspended sediment fluxes to changes in flow turbulence throughout the flow column but not at the bed since then new contributions have appeared in literature that have shed new light on the theme le bouteiller and venditti 2014 2015 vargas luna et al 2015 solari et al 2016 caponi and siviglia 2018 bertagni et al 2018 but we cannot conclude that a complete and exhaustive theoretical or experimental framework for the problem exists yet the availability of reliable mathematical models of sediment transport through vegetation could have real practical benefits once resolved for example it could aid in assessing the short and long term consequences on river morphology of restoration and rehabilitation interventions in general one and two dimensional depth integrated morphodynamic shallow water models require two closure relations one for flow resistance and one for sediment transport capacity crowder and diplas 2000 armanini 2018b closure relations are almost always equilibrium relations they are based on the assumption that the flow is in equilibrium locally that is to say that flow resistance and sediment flow rate are what they would be if the flow were locally uniform steady and homogenous in the flow direction under the local conditions of velocity and water depth armanini 2018b from this point of view flow in beds with submerged vegetation is substantially different from in beds with emergent vegetation in a prismatic channel with uniformly distributed emergent vegetation the stationary condition coincides with the homogeneous condition of uniform channel flow in this case a variation in bed level through deposition or erosion does not cause a change in the net height of vegetation which is always equal to the depth of flow therefore it does not affect the resistance of the vegetation either the same cannot be said for submerged vegetation where for example the burial of vegetation during the deposition of sediments causes a variation in net height of the vegetation itself and therefore a change to its drag see appendix a with reference to the relatively simpler problem of homogeneous emergent vegetation in this paper we propose an attempt to discern the effects of emergent vegetation on sediment transport for this reason we conducted an experimental investigation in a mobile bed laboratory channel to measure liquid and solid flow rates and bed and free surface profiles with adequate precision in the channel it was possible to recirculate liquid and solid discharges so as to obtain a statistically stationary liquid and sediment flow our approach is based on a reconsideration of the different steps in the formulation of a recent model of bed load transport armanini et al 2015 in section 2 we describe our experimental strategy and the experimental set up section 3 explains how we adapted the sediment transport model for vegetated beds in section 4 we explain how we calibrated the experimental parameters of the model to give best fit with the experimental results in section 5 we present a discussion on assumptions we made in the model and draw some conclusions 2 experimental investigation strategy experiments were carried out in a rectangular flume 15 m long and 0 50 m wide the sidewalls and bottom of the flume were made of glass as in vargas luna et al 2016 vegetation elements were simulated by two types of cylindrical elements aluminum cylinders with an average diameter of 1 cm and rigid plastic cylinders with an average diameter of 3 cm both types of cylinders were inserted into the channel bottom and they emerged above the free surface in all the experiments cavedon 2012 we wanted to conduct the tests under conditions of statistical stationarity and homogeneity uniform channel flow first of all however we needed to verify whether these conditions occur with emerging vegetation and if they do what other conditions they imply we know from the literature jansen et al 1979 armanini 2018b that in a mobile bed prismatic channel the stationarity of the flow i e constant solid and liquid flow rates also entails its homogeneity in the flow direction it is possible to demonstrate appendix a that this is also valid for a mobile bed prismatic channel with emerging vegetation cylindrical stems provided that the vegetation is distributed in a statistically homogeneous arrangement therefore the water depth and the depth averaged velocity are constant in the flow direction when they are averaged over a longitudinal reach of the flume long enough to consider the density and shape of the vegetation to be distributed in a statistically homogeneous manner let us consider a mobile bed prismatic channel fed with constant solid and liquid discharges that is composed of two contiguous reaches each characterized by a different but statistically homogeneous density of vegetation in each reach a statistically stationary and homogenous flow is established each one characterized by its own uniform flow depth and depth averaged velocity the transition between the two reaches runs out in a relatively short distance i e of the order of water depth armanini and di silvio 1988 see section iv of the supplementary materials in the transition between reaches the flow profiles are very short and not analogous with permanent flow profiles that develop between reaches in a fixed bed channel with different vegetation densities with this in mind we partitioned the channel into four zones in series as shown in fig 1 three zones had a different vegetation density as shown in fig 2 the final downstream reach of the flume was free of plants allowing the free flow condition for each discharges for the flows of water and sediment we adopted two separate closed circuit supply systems guy et al 1967 parker and wilcock 1993 this feeding system requires a lot of technical skill to install but if well made it simplifies operations and logistics furthermore and more importantly it allows for tests of long duration even several days feeding solid and liquid flow rates that are statistically speaking significantly constant in time this solution in its entirety of zones and feeds allows us to compare the hydrodynamic and morphological conditions that occur in the different reaches under conditions of uniform flow that is to say with different vegetation density but crossed by the same liquid and solid flow rates see eqs a 2a and a 2b of the appendix we have identified each reach based on its areal density of vegetation ωv hereafter defined as 1 ω v j 1 n p s v j a t o t where sv j is the horizontal cross sections of the plants contained in a portion of the bed surface of area atot and np the number of plants contained in it two types of sediments were used fine uniform sand ρ s 2591 kg m 3 and d 50 0 5 mm and artificial spherical particles composed of light polymeric material ρ s 1050 kg m 3 and d 50 0 55 mm in each test we measured the sediment discharge qs and the water discharge q which were the same in the four zones of the flume the slopes of the free surface and average bed surface ifs and ib coincident and the water depth h in each zone all experiments continued until conditions of equilibrium were reached as demonstrated in appendix a when the stationary condition was attained along the flume uniform flow conditions were established in each reach of the channel this aspect deserves attention since one of the major problems with experiments in fixed bed channels is the achievement of uniform flow conditions paradoxically the situation is simpler with mobile beds since flow stationarity guarantees its uniformity in fixed bed channels on the other hand the uniform flow condition also depends on boundary conditions the water discharge q was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter installed in the water recirculation system the sediment transport rate was measured at intervals of one or two hours during daylight hours by intercepting the solid volume discharged at the final end of the channel with a net for 10 20 min however the sediment rates measured at the end of the flume were subject to oscillations in some cases even of considerable amplitude the water surface and the bed levels were also measured periodically these profiles were measured with a pointer gauge mounted on a trolley moving along rails above the flume and with a set of piezometers which gave a more precise measure of the free surface slope when this was very small less than 0 01 a test was considered to be in a statistically steady condition when variations in bed elevation averaged across channel width in the vegetated reaches fluctuated within values of approximately 1 mm for at least 24 h the condition of stationarity was also confirmed by a good parallelism between the free surface profile and that of the bed for each partition of the channel with constant vegetation density for this purpose the slope of the water surface was determined by least square linear regression of the pointer gauge measurements and their locations a more detailed description of the experimental apparatus and measurements is reported in cavedon 2012 some examples of these measurements are also reported in section 3 of the supplementary materials 3 sediment transport in vegetated streams the analysis presented here concerns the bed load transport rate in a mobile bed channel with uniform flow that is in statistically stationary and homogenous conditions in these conditions i e in the absence of average erosions and depositions in time and space transport rate and transport capacity coincide and hereafter we will use the two terms indiscriminately the most widely used theories for bed load transport in unvegetated channels can be roughly classified as those based on a columbian approach somehow derivable from the du boys 1879 scheme statistical theories such as einstein 1950 theory theories based on the concept of grain interactions such as bagnold 1936 theory and kinetic theories for granular flows hsu et al 2004 in general these models arrive at a formulation in terms of two dimensionless parameters einstein 1950 2 φ q s d p g δ d p and ψ g δ d p u 2 where qs is the solid flow rate per unit width dp is a representative diameter of the particles usually the mean or the geometric mean diameter d 50 of the grain size distribution δ ρ s ρ w ρ w is the submerged relative density of the material with ρs and ρw being the densities of the solid and of the water respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and u τ o ρ is the shear velocity or friction velocity where τo is the average bed shear stress φ is einstein 1950 the dimensionless sediment transport rate and ψ the flow intensity parameter since the formulae are calibrated in statistically steady and homogenous conditions uniform channel flow from the momentum balance we have that u g r h i e where rh is the hydraulic radius and ie is the slope of energy line which given the uniformity of flow coincides with the slopes of the free surface and the bed if the channel is wide enough and the bed is relatively rough compared to the side walls we can assume that rh h this hypothesis is even more reasonable in the presence of vegetation because of the drag caused by the plants henceforth we will adopt this approximation so that u g h i e in many bed load formulae the flow intensity parameter is replaced by its reciprocal i e the shields mobility parameter θ 1 ψ furthermore many formulae also contain the critical mobility parameter θcr shields 1936 this parameter however does not appear in stochastic or semi stochastic theories or in the formulae derived from them e g einstein 1950 in our extension of bed load formulae to vegetated beds we prefer a model in which the critical condition of incipient motion does not appear because its definition in a vegetated bed is a further complication among these approaches einstein 1950 theory likely represents the most complete theoretical model that is suitable for an extension to a complicated flow field such as that established within emerging vegetation armanini et al 2009 einstein s original theory is not without conceptual problems however yalin 1977 ancey et al 2006 hu and guo 2010 armanini et al 2015 several authors see yalin 1977 have proposed suitable revisions of the theory here we refer to a recent revision armanini et al 2015 which we will indicate hereafter as ballistic model 3 1 main features of the adopted sediment transport model the ballistic model armanini et al 2015 is based on the observation that in statistically stationary and homogeneous channel flow solid discharge is formed by all the grains crossing the generic cross section of the channel a in fig 3 per unit time the infinitesimal contribution to the bed load dqs by the infinitesimal strip dx of unit width and located in the generic position x upstream of the reference cross section a is given only by those particles that once detached from the bed are able to jump from x to section a i e the particles with a probability pj of having a range longer than x that is 3 d q s u s α 2 d p 2 d x α 2 d p 2 p j p 0 where us is the longitudinal component of the particle velocity at the instant it crosses the section a α 2 d p 2 is the projected frontal area of the particle and the ratio d x α 2 d p 2 expresses the number of particles contained in the element dx of the bed surface of unit width p 0 is the probability of particle detachment the model assumes the following hypotheses i pj and p 0 are gamma distributions 4 p j x l m ξ e ξ d ξ 1 x l m e x l m and 5 p 0 b a ψ 1 η 0 a ζ e ζ d ζ 1 b a ψ 1 η 0 a e b a ψ 1 η 0 a where ξ and ζ are variables of integration lm is the average range of the particles contributing to the bed load and b a is a constant ii the particle velocity us depends on the shear velocity and on the flow intensity parameter that is u s a u g δ d p ψ where au is a constant iii the average particle range is expressed through a hyperbolic function of the flow intensity parameter ψ 6 l m d p 100 1 4 ψ by substituting the above expressions for p

transport rate φ based on a comparison with a large number of experimental data the authors suggested the following set of constants for their model a u 0 5 b a 0 45 η 0 a 2 eq 7 was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data 3 2 preliminary considerations we had initially tried to link the sediment transport rate through stems to the flow intensity parameter ψ o g δ d u o 2 expressed in function of the grain shear stress τo only this was calculated with the logarithmic relation frequently used for this purpose einstein 1950 van rijn 1984 baptist 2005 that binds the depth averaged velocity to the skin friction velocity u o τ o ρ relative to the bed shear stress 8 u u o 5 75 log 10 12 h 3 d p from the friction velocity u o we calculated the flow intensity parameter relative to the wall stress only ψ o g δ d u o 2 the graph on the left of fig 4 clearly shows that the solid discharge calculated as a function of the skin friction is systematically underestimated in particular as vegetation density increases the deviations between calculated and measured transport rates increase consistently we then checked whether we could get better results by using the flow intensity parameter calculated with respect to the total resistance ψ tot in this case ψ t o t g δ d p u t 2 in which u t g h i e is the total friction velocity where ie is the slope of the energy line which coincides with that of the bed and free surface the graph on the right of fig 4 compares the sediment transport capacity calculated as a function of ψ tot through eq 7 with the experimental data the figure shows that the calculated flow rate systematically exceeds the measured ones this result already observed baptist 2005 is not surprising given that the free surface and energy gradient ie is strongly affected by the hydrodynamic drag offered by the plants while the drag offered by the plants does not reflect directly on the sediment transport mechanisms we can imagine that the plants modify some mechanisms that contribute to the solid flow rate for example the probability pj relative to the length of the particles hops the average range lm and the entrainment probability p 0 could all potentially be influenced by the different distribution of velocity and turbulence statistics induced by the presence of the stems besides it is quite reasonable to assume that the scale of velocities relevant to these quantities is somehow linked to the grain friction velocity u o the total friction velocity u t or ultimately to some combination of the two scales to better understand how the presence of vegetation influences the sediment transport capacity it is convenient to evaluate the role of the different forces contributing to the total flow resistance in terms of the flow intensity parameter 3 3 momentum analysis to highlight the effects of bed shear stress and drag on the flow intensity parameter it is useful to apply the momentum balance to a reach of channel with homogeneously distributed emergent vegetation let us consider a section of stream of length l and width b and with a cross section area a b h as shown in fig 5 following a procedure similar to that proposed by petryk and bosmajian 1975 we can state that in uniform flow conditions the component in the longitudinal direction of the weight of the fluid in the control volume ρ g a l ie is balanced by the stresses acting on the bed τo b l and by the sum of hydrodynamic drags offered by the np plants present in the control volume j 1 n p f d j 9 ρ g a l i e τ o b l j 1 n p f d j where i e i b tan α b sin α b is the slope of the energy line coincident with the bed slope the drag offered by a single plant can be expressed in function of the drag coefficient cd the average projected area of the plant sv j and the velocity averaged over the channel cross section u 10 f d j c d ρ s v j u 2 2 to simplifying eq 9 we recall that τ o ρ u o 2 and we introduce the total friction velocity u t g h i e which can be rewritten as 11 i e u t 2 g h so that eq 9 becomes 12 u t 2 u o 2 u 2 2 l b j 1 n p c d j s v j u o 2 1 u u o 2 n p 2 c d h d v l b d v is the average diameter of the plants d v j 1 n p s v j n p and c d the average drag coefficient furthermore according to the definition of areal density of vegetation eq 1 can be written 13 ω v n p π 4 d v 2 l b the ratio u u o 2 in eq 12 can be expressed as 8 f where f is the darcy weisbach friction coefficient in the case of a channel with a rough bed this ratio can be expressed with a simple monomial formula see armanini 2018a as 14 u u o a h d p b where for example according to meyer peter and müller 1948 a 8 30 b 0 167 and d p d 90 while according to strickler 1923 a 6 74 b 0 167 and d p d 50 however we expect both coefficient a and exponent b to be influenced by differences in the distributions of velocity and reynolds stresses induced by the plants by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into 12 we obtain 15 u t 2 u o 2 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b where 16 λ v ω v h d v and β t o t a 2 c d 2 π the parameter λ v will be henceforth known as the composite density of vegetation finally from eq 15 we have 17 ψ t o t g δ d p u t 2 g δ d p u o 2 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b 1 ψ o 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b 1 3 4 application of the bed load model to vegetated beds we have already shown fig 4 right that if in the bed load formula we assume the flow intensity parameter of the vegetated bed ψv equal to ψ tot we obtain an overestimation of the sediment transport rate we have also shown that by assuming eq 17 ψ v ψ o ψ t o t 1 β t o t λ v h d p 2 b the calculated sediment transport rate underestimates the measured one fig 4 left moreover the same graphs show that the experimental data concerning the same vegetation density tend to be reasonably disposed along lines parallel to the curves of the model for both cases given that the two expressions differ only by the dimensionless group λv h dp 2b it is then likely reasonable to assume 18 ψ v ψ t o t 1 β v λ v h d p b v where β v βtot and b v are two parameters that can be determined by experimental analysis of course in the case of unvegetated beds the above definition reduces to einstein s original definition of flow intensity parameter in the applications to vegetated beds of bed load models in general and of the ballistic model in particular we have to account that the presence of plants reduces the active exchange surface between the stream and the bed we obtained the bed load by integrating â the infinitesimal contribution dqs from the strip of infinitesimal length dx eq 3 over the whole channel bed upstream of the reference cross section a in the case of vegetation the strip area must be reduced by the encumbrance of the plants present in it we should also consider that around each plant an excavation similar to those found at bridge piers will form see yagci et al 2016 and neary et al 2011 a careful observation of sediment flow around the base of the cylinders showed that this area participates in the exchange process of sediments between river bed and stream but with a lower intensity the phenomenon is rather complex so we propose to account for it in the final bed load formula by appropriately increasing the extent of the plants cross section experimental observation suggests that the virtual dimension of this area is 3 7 times the cross section of the cylinders themselves in other words we can multiply the elementary area of the active surface dx in eq 3 by 1 α ω ω v where ωv is the areal plant density and α ω is a suitable coefficient of the order of some units that will be determined by the experiments as a consequence we changed the definition of the dimensionless sediment transport in vegetated beds as follows 19 φ v q s d g δ d p 1 α ω ω v of course in the case of unvegetated beds the above definition reduces to einstein s original definition of dimensionless sediment transport rate 4 model calibration it should be noted that in our approach we have not modified the bed load formula rather we modified the definitions of einstein 1950 two parameters φ and ψ that characterize sediment transport in other words the final bed load formula is formally similar to the original bed load formula for unvegetated beds 20 φ v 200 a u ψ v 1 4 ψ v 1 b a ψ v 1 η 0 a e b a ψ v 1 η 0 a but now the dimensionless transport rate φv is defined by eq 19 and the flow intensity parameter ψv by eq 18 the three parameters βtot b v and α ω that appear in their definitions are to be determined on the basis of experimental investigations these parameters were established through 93 different configurations with varying values of hydrodynamic granulometric and vegetational parameters see also section i of the supplementary materials liquid discharges q ranging from 0 0032 and 0 0250 m 3 s 1 solid discharges qs ranging from 1 068 10 8 and 5 43 10 4 m 3 s 1 vegetation density ωv ranging from 0 and 0 1414 two sediments types plastic d p 00055 m ρ s 1050 kg m 3 and sand d p 0005 m ρ s 2591 kg m 3 both uniformly sized fig 6 shows the experimental data for the tests with sand compared to the model prediction obtained with the following three constants β t o t 40 b v 0 and α ω 5 it is appreciable that a reasonable result is obtained with respect to all the data from the sand tests instead in all the tests with plastic material the model tends to overestimate the bed load as reported in fig 7 experimental observation suggests that the difference between the sand and plastic results is because part of the plastic material was transported in a regime between bed load and suspended load also due to the small value of particle drag coefficient the transport rate is likely dependent on fluid viscosity also without any intention of extending the ballistic model to suspended loads we wanted to take account of the possible effect of fluid viscosity within the range of our experiments for this purpose we identified the dimensionless particle diameter d d δ g ν 2 1 3 bonnefille 1963 as representative of these effects since it contains both the viscosity ν of the fluid and the relative reduced density δ ρ s ρ ρ of the solid we recall that van rijn 1984 also makes the bed load rate dependent on this parameter we then introduced an effective diameter into the definition of the flow intensity parameter ψv the effective diameter of a particle is defined as d e f f d p 1 f d where f d is a suitable function of d to be determined on the basis of the experimental results we found the following expression to give the best fit to sediment transport data 21 d e f f d p 1 1 5 d 0 75 1 consequently the final definition of the flow intensity parameter ψv in a vegetated bed is 22 ψ v g δ d p 1 1 5 d 0 75 1 u t 2 1 40 λ v after having processed the data we decided to slightly revise the three constants au b a and 1 η 0a of the model with respect to the original formulation armanini et al 2015 see fig s5 of the supplementary materials with the aim of improving the fit between model and data both with and without vegetation the new set of the constants is a u 0 35 b a 0 45 1 η 0 a 0 these work quite well in the absence of vegetation also in conclusion the transport capacity in bed load or quasi bed load condition in the presence of emerging rigid vegetation is calculated with 23 φ v 70 ψ v 1 4 ψ v 1 0 45 ψ v e 0 45 ψ v with 24 φ v q s d p g δ d p 1 5 ω v and ψv defined by eq 22 fig 8 compares the experimental data with the curve dotted line expressed by eq 23 which uses the definitions of φv and ψv given by eqs 24 and 22 respectively 5 discussion and conclusion the tests were carried out simultaneously for four different vegetation densities i e without vegetation and with sparse medium and dense vegetation under the same solid and liquid discharges therefore it is possible to draw some conclusions about the effect of vegetation on the parameters that influence the sediment transport process at constant liquid and solid flow rates this condition is important first we want to check whether the assumptions we made to build the ballistic model without vegetation and those we introduced to account for the influence of vegetation on the transport rate make physical sense in other words in addition to the quantitative comparison between model and experimental data presented in the previous sections we want to compare the situations with different stems concentration and without rigid stems for example table 1 shows a series of values recorded for the same liquid and solid flow rates from the table we observe that an increase in areal density of vegetation ωv results in i an increase in flow depth h ii a decrease in mean velocity u iii a significant relative increase in total shear velocity u t g h i e and iv a more consistent relative increase in the free surface and bed slopes ie this results in a decrease in the total flow intensity parameter ψ t o t g δ d u t 2 as reported in detail in cavedon 2012 and in the supplementary materials the trend of the data in the table 1 is the same in all the tests therefore we can affirm that this is a general trend with emergent rigid vegetation we can exclude that the effect of the stems is attributable to a simple reduction of the net cross section a constriction in a mobile bed channel flow armanini 2018b jansen et al 1979 cause both flow depth and speed to increase while here the velocity decreases as vegetation density increases we observe an increase in the global friction factor last column of table 1 which is proportional to the ratio u t u 2 section 3 3 and an increase in the energy slope ie these two effects can reasonably be implicated to increased stem drag since the sediment rate is constant in each of the four reaches of the flume the parameter φv dimensionless transport rate calculated with respect to an area reduced by the virtual footprint of the vegetation on the bed changes only slightly as can be seen in the sixth column of table 1 if φv remains nearly constant vegetation density changes then the flow intensity parameter ψv also change very little in accordance with eq 23 but since the vegetation density both ωv and λv increases significantly then we expect ψ tot ψ v 1 40 λ v to decrease according to eq 22 which is confirmed by column seven of the table moreover if ψv is nearly constant then the average particle range lm also remains nearly constant as is consistent with eq 6 fig 9 left shows the effect of vegetation density on the particle range it can be noted that for equal relative particle range ψtot decreases as plant density increases in other words to keep the sediment flow rate constant with increasing vegetation density a reduction of the total flow intensity parameter is needed in contrast when ψtot remains constant with increasing the vegetation density the particle range decreases as would be expected similar considerations can be made for the other ingredients of the sediment transport model adopted for example for po pj and us fig 9 right shows the effect of the dimensionless diameter d on the average particle range it can be noted that in our experimental conditions the influence of d is less significant than the other effects of the vegetation as would be expected in conclusion we have developed a procedure to estimate bed load transport capacity that is valid both with and without of emergent vegetation being present instead of modifying the solid transport formula we modified the definitions of einstein s two parameters φ and ψ in function of vegetation characteristics the approach has been calibrated for the ballistic model armanini et al 2015 however since this criterion acts only on the dimensionless parameters ψ and φ and not on the formula the method can be reasonably applied to any bed load formula based only on these two parameters as proof of this in section v of the supplementary materials we have compared our experimental data with curves obtained by applying the new dimensionless variables to the formulae of meyer peter and müller 1948 parker 1990 van rijn 1984 and ashida and michiue 1971 the discrepancies in these cases are greater than with the ballistic model however they fall within the band of uncertainty that usually exists for bed load formulae applied to unvegetated channels finally it is important to remember that the model as it is cannot be applied to the case of submerged vegetation where we expect that stationarity of the flow does not imply its homogeneity acknowledgments the work was carried out as part of contracts between aipo and cudam sap codes 30101264 30101561 30101727 and 30102086 appendix a stationary solution of a flow in a mobile bed channel with emergent vegetation if the average solid concentration is small enough i g c 1 then the conservation of liquid and solid masses in a 1d rectangular channel can be written as armanini 2018b a 1a t b h b z b b u h x 0 a 1b t b c h b c z b q s x 0 where b is the channel width c and u are sediment concentration and velocity respectively averaged over the channel cross section qs is the solid volumetric discharge zb is bed elevation and x and t are the longitudinal space and time coordinates respectively in statistically stationary conditions all the time derivatives vanish so eq a 1 reduces to a 2a b u h x 0 a 2b q s x 0 in section 4 we showed eqs 22 24 how the bed load in equilibrium condition and in the presence of homogenous emerging vegetation can be expressed through einstein s two variables modified to account for vegetation density φv and ψv according to eq 23 the bed load transport rate φv is a bijective function of the flow intensity parameter ψv of the type φ v f ψ ψ v where f ψ f u n c t ψ v is a general function representing the bed load formula i e the same function used to calculate bed transport capacity in the absence of vegetation from eq 19 the bed load rate can be expressed as a 3 q s b d g δ d d 1 α ω ω v f ψ so eq a 2 become a 4a u h b x b u h x 0 a 4b q s b b x b d g δ d d 1 α ω ω v f ψ ψ v ψ v x 0 by assuming a quasi rectangular

1 β t o t λ v h d v h d p 2 b 0 since all variables and parameters inside the brackets of eq a 11 are positive we can observe that a 12 2 2 b 1 b v β v λ v h d v h d p b v 1 β v λ v h d v h d p b v 1 1 2 b 2 β t o t λ v h d v h d p 2 b 1 β t o t λ v h d v h d p 2 b 1 1 being 2b 1 e g according to strickler 2 b 1 3 the only possibility for eq a 11 is a 13 u x 0 that is to say in a prismatic mobile bed channel with rigid emergent homogenous vegetation the only possible steady flow solution is uniform flow we point out that the insertion of the term with d in the definition of ψv as in eq 22 does not change the reasoning as d is independent of both u and h this conclusion is valid for any sediment transport formula in which the flow rate is inversely proportional to the flow depth and for any uniform flow formula in the case of natural grain roughness a different situation is not realistic and the conclusion can be taken as valid in general list of most used symbols a channel cross section
