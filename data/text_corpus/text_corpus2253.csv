sugarcane crop multiplication method from the beginning is based on burying the stalks in the planting furrow in the past manual crop planting used to spend 15 to 21 buds m 1 of planting furrow with a stalk consumption of 11 to 14 mg ha 1 at present mechanized planting is widely used but planting failures are frequent in this system despite advances in mechanization and planting methods in an attempt to avoid yield reduction planting density was increased from 24 to 60 buds m 1 of planting furrow which increased the stalk consumption to 20 mg ha 1 in order to reduce the consumption of buds in sugarcane planting and increase crop multiplication rates the sugarcane pre sprouted plantlets psp production system has been used as an efficient and innovative method psp production consists of

study was carried out in a sugarcane pre sprouted plantlet psp greenhouse of são martinho mill são martinho s a located at the coordinates 21 19 23 s and 48 06 47 w and an altitude of 528 m in the city of pradópolis sp brazil according to köppen the region climate classification is cwa alvares et al 2013 characterized by a mean precipitation of 1400 mm and a mean temperature of 22 7 c with a dry and mild winter and hot and rainy summer cepagri 2016 the study greenhouse was built with eight bows of 7 m width and 24 modules of 4 5 m length totaling 6048 m² 56 m width and 108 m length ginegar polysack diffuser anti virus effect film was used as cover with 150 μm thickness and ultraviolet ray treatment with 15 solar radiation filter whereas the frontal and lateral side cover constituted of white net with 150 μm thickness and ultraviolet ray treatment with 30 solar radiation filter 2 2 treatments three sugarcane cultivars were chosen to compose the treatments of study ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 the ctc9005hp cultivar was developed by the sugarcane research center piracicaba sp brazil and is an early to medium maturation cultivar adapted in high fertility soil this cultivar has a high multiplication rate due to a large number of buds per unit area around 1 65 million buds per hectare the rb966928 cultivar was developed by paraná federal university and has a high sucrose content tolerance to most sugarcane diseases except for smut sporisorium scitamineum good sprouts on plants and ratoons high adaptation to mechanical harvesting rare flowering uncommon stool tipping and medium herbicide tolerance this cultivar is recommended for medium to high fertility soils and has an early maturation cycle sp87365 was developed by the company formerly named copersucar currently the sugarcane research center it stands out for its great yield high tolerance to sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis and low herbicide and hydric deficit tolerance this cultivar is recommended for high fertility soils and has a medium maturation cycle 2 3 lysimeters characteristics three weighing lysimeters ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 were built and installed in the greenhouse to support three trays composed of 54 tubes of 125 cm³ of sugarcane psps totalizing 162 plants per lysimeter lysimeters were constructed by a rectangular tank of 1179 mm length 586 mm width 0 6909 m² and 400 mm depth the tank was made of carbon steel sheets of 1 58 mm thickness welded and painted with gray epoxy and paint to avoid material oxidation fig 1 a liquid level indicator was installed to indicate the water level storage and drainage requirement in the tank the tank was supported by three retractable threaded rods under which the load cells were threaded by hangers the system was sustained by a rectangular steel sheet base of 600 mm length 400 mm width and 12 7 mm thickness which was laid on the greenhouse ground by four 150 mm length and 20 mm diameter pointed rods which were located at the edges of the underside base to secure the lysimeters to the ground lysimeters were installed with positional adjustments to ensure the tank free fluctuation above the load cells avoiding any external interference the datalogger multiplexer and solar panel were used as data acquisition systems and were fixed on a greenhouse support pole with prefabricated supports after structural installation cable connections between the load cells junction box datalogger multiplexer battery and solar panel were established lysimeters were previously calibrated following the methods of faria et al 2006 and mariano et al 2015 calibration revealed for the three lysimeters a high correlation r² 1 0000 between the equivalent mass mm and electrical signal mv great measurement accuracy evidenced by a high willmott s index of agreement d 1 0000 mean absolute error of 0 0272 to 0 0382 and mean square error of 0 0011 to 0 0024 a low variation in the angular coefficient 1 0236 mm mv 1 of linear regressions reveals that the lysimeters measure homogeneity therefore the equipment was assumed to be adequate for sugarcane psp etc with a 0 1 mm accuracy suitable for the

sugarcane cultivars were obtained from a high sanitary nursery where a sample of 50 stalks per cultivar were taken to a specialized laboratory of the sugarcane center at the campinas agriculture institute to ensure the absence of pest or disease problems the nursery was a plant sugarcane crop with 8 months of cycle and upright stalks the mini stalks were obtained on november 17 2016 by removing old leaves from stalks extracting 4 cm length mini stalks selecting mini stalks with visually undamaged buds and applying phytosanitary treatment with fungicide 13 3 ml l 1 solution with 75 g l 1 azoxystrobin 37 5 g l 1 metalaxyl m and 12 5 g l 1 fludioxonil insecticide 13 3 ml l 1 solution with 350 g l 1 thiamethoxam and growth regulator 5 ml l 1 solution with 0 05 g l 1 indole 3 butyric acid 0 05 g l 1 gibberellic acid and 0 09 g l 1 kinetin thereafter mini stalks were planted in 125 cm³ tubes arranged in 50 trays of 54 tubes per each treatment previously filled with sugarcane bagasse based substrate and covered with a 2 cm layer of extra fine vermiculite bagasse substrate chemical analysis is described in table 1 subsequently after planting each treatment tray was conditioned on mobile trolleys that were projected to have 50 trays arranged at five height levels with 10 trays per level for a period of 10 days in a sprouting room with environmental controlled conditions of high temperature 33 c and relative humidity 90 after that period 35 psp trays of each treatment were transferred to the greenhouse following the arrangement of fig 2 which was maintained for 46 days after transference dat to etc and kc evaluations at 37 dat treatments were submitted to the pruning of excess leaves maintaining leaves 15 cm height from the dewlap to the top of leaves

inferior basal sugarcane temperature c according to barbieri et al 1979 optimum sugarcane growth occurs at daily mean temperatures of between 22 30 c on the other hand growth is reduced at temperatures below 20 c and temperatures above 38 c causes slow growth becoming practically null fauconnier and bassereau 1975 barbieri et al 1979 thus growth was considered to occur at between superior and inferior basal temperatures of 38 c and 20 c respectively in an attempt to relate kc to leaf growth the leaf area index lai was determined as the ratio of plantlet leaf area and lysimeter surface area during the plantlet cycle leaf area was determined by measuring the leaf area of 10 plantlets randomly sampled in the buffer part of the trays in each treatment at 7 14 21 28 and 41 dat and multiplying the result by 162 plantlets in the lysimeter this measure was taken by digital images of leaves detached at the leaf blade joints and pasted with double sided tape onto white

maximum temperature exceeded the superior basal temperature 38 c and on 8 days the minimum temperature was lower than the inferior basal temperature 20 c at the end of experimental period the sum of gdd reached 403 4 c fig 3 the mean relative humidity was 75 9 with a variation of 68 2 to 86 7 the mean net solar radiation was 11 1 mj m ² d 1 with a variation of 5 7 to 15 3 mj m ² d 1 fig 4 the mean wind speed from 2 m above the ground was 0 271 m s 1 with a variation of 0 024 to 0 912 m s 1 the irrigation was applied by a 14 m length sprinkler bar with 33 nozzles tt teejet 11008vs teejet springfield illinois usa with 430 mm spaces at a height of 1 5 m from the ground irrigation depth was defined by the bar speed which was limited at 8 m min 1 with the nozzle flow fixed at 2 61 min 1 defining irrigation depths greater than 0 67 mm in each application the total applied irrigation depth during the experimental period was 389 2 mm ranging from 5 4 to 13 2 mm d 1 with a mean of 8 3 mm d 1 the total eto was 175 7 mm ranging from 1 9 to 5 3 mm with a mean of 3 7 mm d 1 since the irrigation was greater than the eto there was no water deficit during the experimental period fig 5 this confirmation guaranteed the water supply for crop evapotranspiration at a maximum rate which is required for kc determination the lysimeter water content included the substrate humidity in the plantlet tubes and drainage water stored in the tank before draining hourly and daily variation in the water storage shown in fig 6 reveals the uniformity among the three lysimeters and their sensibility and precision to measure mass variation as well as the influence of drainage in the lysimeter mass during the experimental period the data acquisition system failed at 2 3 6 and 8 12 dat because of electrical communication problems between the datalogger and lysimeters fig 6b 3 results five day moving means of daily eto and etc measured by the three lysimeters were similar during the first week of the experimental period 0 to 7 dat with means varying from 3 to 4 mm which were lower than the measurements taken during the remaining period due to lower leaf area temperature and solar radiation after the second week there was a detachment of etc curves from eto fig 7 due to an increase in etc caused by an increase in lai the comparison between treatments showed that the etc sum for ctc9005hp was equal to 190 0 mm mean of 4 9 mm d 1 and range from 3 0 to 6 9 mm d 1 rb966928 had a sum of 187 3 mm mean of 4 8 mm d 1 and range from 3 1 to 6 8 mm d 1 and sp87365 had sum of 190 6 mm mean of 4 9 mm d 1 and range from 2 9 to 6 6 mm d 1 table 2 and fig 7 these etc results for psp were similar to reports in the literature for field sugarcane etc however eto results were lower than those reported previously carmo et al 2017 silva et al 2013a the growing degree day gdd estimates by the model proposed by ometto 1981 and leaf area index lai presented high correlations r² 0 99 to dat fig 8 and 9 enabling these models to be used to determine kc lai has also presented a high correlation to ci r² 0 98 fig 10 enabling it to be used to determine the sugarcane psp phenological stage as an easy way to obtain data when comparing to leaf area assessments leaves pruning at 37 dat caused a reduction in lai and ci and consequently in etc and kc the etc values for ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 before pruning 32 36 dat were 6 6 6 4 and 6 3 mm d 1 respectively to 4 4 4 6 and 4 9 mm d 1 after pruning 37 41 dat crop coefficients at the beginning of the cycle 0 7 dat were close to 1 00 maximum kc values were obtained between 32 and 36 dat and were 1 50 for ctc9005hp 1 46 for rb966928 and 1 45 for sp87365 table 3 daily kc values obtained by the five day moving mean as presented in fig 11 showed that daily kc curves increased from 1 00 to 1 46 for ctc9005hp 1 02 to 1 53 for rb966928 and 1 02 to 1 49 for sp87365 the increment of kc as plantlets grow makes evident the importance of assessing appropriate kc values in order to estimate crop water requirements and irrigation needs the crop water requirements are also related to weather condition interacting with lai over plantlet age therefore fixed depth irrigation scheduled during psp cycle determines generally excessive water in the beginning of the cycle causing water and energy waste increases in crop susceptibility to diseases and a water deficit at the end of the cycle causing a reduction in plantlet growth pruning was notably the cause of reduced kc values after 37 dat there was a high correlation between kc and dat r² 0 94 gdd r² 0 95 and lai r² 0 91 for all treatments fig 12 providing a reliable tool for estimating sugarcane psp greenhouse irrigation requirements 4 discussion several kc values are widely recommended for crop stages allen et al 1998 however these values are highly influenced by many factors such as the climate of the region cultivar production system tillage planting season and soil cover carvalho et al 2012 silva et al 2012 2013a jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2018a worldwide recommended kc values allen et al 1998 and calculated kc in the region can diverge by nearby 40 during the crop development stages carvalho et al 2012 silva et al 2013a lozano et al 2017 water wastage is up to 20 for irrigation management with overestimated kc values djaman et al 2018 whereas the yield reduction can reach up to 38 with underestimated kc values kharrou et al 2011 crop coefficient determination is an expensive and laborious operation alternative methods have been tested and validated to overcome these problems without dropping the precision of kc determination the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been extensively applied to kc determination with high accuracy since kc is extremely influenced by leaf area kamble et al 2013 oliveira et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 therefore kc determination by leaf area cover index is a promising technique according to the high precision leaf area estimative models in this study r² 0 98 fig 10 nevertheless this technique has the advantages of easy measurement and the lack of need for specific equipment since only a mobile app is needed because of the microclimate planting density and crop management in protected cultivation plant water requirements can be higher than those in open field conditions contreras et al 2017 studies report that maximum kc value in greenhouses are higher than the fao 56 recommendation to open field environments blanco and folegatti 2003 wang et al 2018b achieving increases of up to 40 for this study the kc results during the psp cycle were higher than the results reported in the literature for field sugarcane silva et al 2013a esteves et al 2014 carmo et al 2017 the kc results indicate that the relationship between etc and eto are higher than those in field sugarcane because of the plantlet density and specific evaporative area of the trays causing higher kc values for the psp cycle therefore this study presented a great purpose providing kc values for sugarcane plantlet irrigation management and adding to the literature recommendations for this subject instead of adopting fao 56 kc values which would result in a water deficit in sugarcane plantlets declarations of interest none acknowledgments this work was

study was carried out in a sugarcane pre sprouted plantlet psp greenhouse of são martinho mill são martinho s a located at the coordinates 21 19 23 s and 48 06 47 w and an altitude of 528 m in the city of pradópolis sp brazil according to köppen the region climate classification is cwa alvares et al 2013 characterized by a mean precipitation of 1400 mm and a mean temperature of 22 7 c with a dry and mild winter and hot and rainy summer cepagri 2016 the study greenhouse was built with eight bows of 7 m width and 24 modules of 4 5 m length totaling 6048 m² 56 m width and 108 m length ginegar polysack diffuser anti virus effect film was used as cover with 150 μm thickness and ultraviolet ray treatment with 15 solar radiation filter whereas the frontal and lateral side cover constituted of white net with 150 μm thickness and ultraviolet ray treatment with 30 solar radiation filter 2 2 treatments three sugarcane cultivars were chosen to compose the treatments of study ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 the ctc9005hp cultivar was developed by the sugarcane research center piracicaba sp brazil and is an early to medium maturation cultivar adapted in high fertility soil this cultivar has a high multiplication rate due to a large number of buds per unit area around 1 65 million buds per hectare the rb966928 cultivar was developed by paraná federal university and has a high sucrose content tolerance to most sugarcane diseases except for smut sporisorium scitamineum good sprouts on plants and ratoons high adaptation to mechanical harvesting rare flowering uncommon stool tipping and medium herbicide tolerance this cultivar is recommended for medium to high fertility soils and has an early maturation cycle sp87365 was developed by the company formerly named copersucar currently the sugarcane research center it stands out for its great yield high tolerance to sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis and low herbicide and hydric deficit tolerance this cultivar is recommended for high fertility soils and has a medium maturation cycle 2 3 lysimeters characteristics three weighing lysimeters ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 were built and installed in the greenhouse to support three trays composed of 54 tubes of 125 cm³ of sugarcane psps totalizing 162 plants per lysimeter lysimeters were constructed by a rectangular tank of 1179 mm length 586 mm width 0 6909 m² and 400 mm depth the tank was made of carbon steel sheets of 1 58 mm thickness welded and painted with gray epoxy and paint to avoid material oxidation fig 1 a liquid level indicator was installed to indicate the water level storage and drainage requirement in the tank the tank was supported by three retractable threaded rods under which the load cells were threaded by hangers the system was sustained by a rectangular steel sheet base of 600 mm length 400 mm width and 12 7 mm thickness which was laid on the greenhouse ground by four 150 mm length and 20 mm diameter pointed rods which were located at the edges of the underside base to secure the lysimeters to the ground lysimeters were installed with positional adjustments to ensure the tank free fluctuation above the load cells avoiding any external interference the datalogger multiplexer and solar panel were used as data acquisition systems and were fixed on a greenhouse support pole with prefabricated supports after structural installation cable connections between the load cells junction box datalogger multiplexer battery and solar panel were established lysimeters were previously calibrated following the methods of faria et al 2006 and mariano et al 2015 calibration revealed for the three lysimeters a high correlation r² 1 0000 between the equivalent mass mm and electrical signal mv great measurement accuracy evidenced by a high willmott s index of agreement d 1 0000 mean absolute error of 0 0272 to 0 0382 and mean square error of 0 0011 to 0 0024 a low variation in the angular coefficient 1 0236

sugarcane cultivars were obtained from a high sanitary nursery where a sample of 50 stalks per cultivar were taken to a specialized laboratory of the sugarcane center at the campinas agriculture institute to ensure the absence of pest or disease problems the nursery was a plant sugarcane crop with 8 months of cycle and upright stalks the mini stalks were obtained on november 17 2016 by removing old leaves from stalks extracting 4 cm length mini stalks selecting mini stalks with visually undamaged buds and applying phytosanitary treatment with fungicide 13 3 ml l 1 solution with 75 g l 1 azoxystrobin 37 5 g l 1 metalaxyl m and 12 5 g l 1 fludioxonil insecticide 13 3 ml l 1 solution with 350 g l 1 thiamethoxam and growth regulator 5 ml l 1 solution with 0 05 g l 1 indole 3 butyric acid 0 05 g l 1 gibberellic acid and 0 09 g l 1 kinetin thereafter mini stalks were planted in 125 cm³ tubes arranged in 50 trays of 54 tubes per each treatment previously filled with sugarcane bagasse based substrate and covered with a 2 cm layer of extra fine vermiculite bagasse substrate chemical analysis is described in table 1 subsequently after planting each treatment tray was conditioned on mobile trolleys that were projected to have 50 trays arranged at five height levels with 10 trays per level for a period of 10 days in a sprouting room with environmental controlled conditions of high temperature 33 c and relative humidity 90 after that period 35 psp trays of each treatment were transferred to the greenhouse following the arrangement of fig 2 which was maintained for 46 days after transference dat to etc and kc evaluations at 37 dat treatments were submitted to the pruning of excess leaves maintaining leaves 15 cm height from the dewlap to the top of leaves due to canopy interception avoiding substrate irrigation 2 6 evaluations crop evapotranspiration etc was determined daily according to eq 1 1 et c x s x 1 s x i 1 n i xi i 1 n d xi where etcx crop

inferior basal sugarcane temperature c according to barbieri et al 1979 optimum sugarcane growth occurs at daily mean temperatures of between 22 30 c on the other hand growth is reduced at temperatures below 20 c and temperatures above 38 c causes slow growth becoming practically null fauconnier and bassereau 1975 barbieri et al 1979 thus growth was considered to occur at between superior and inferior basal temperatures of 38 c and 20 c respectively in an attempt to relate kc to leaf growth the leaf area index lai was determined as the ratio of plantlet leaf area and lysimeter surface area during the plantlet cycle leaf area was determined by measuring the leaf area of 10 plantlets randomly sampled in the buffer part of the trays in each treatment at 7 14 21 28 and 41 dat and multiplying the result by 162 plantlets in the lysimeter this measure was taken by digital images of leaves detached at the leaf blade joints and pasted with double sided tape onto white

2 7 weather condition and irrigation during the experimental period the mean air temperature was 26 5 c mean maximum air temperature was 35 2 c and mean minimum temperature was 20 9 c on 13 days the maximum temperature exceeded the superior basal temperature 38 c and on 8 days the minimum temperature was lower than the inferior basal temperature 20 c at the end of experimental period the sum of gdd reached 403 4 c fig 3 the mean relative humidity was 75 9 with a variation of 68 2 to 86 7 the mean net solar radiation was 11 1 mj m ² d 1 with a variation of 5 7 to 15 3 mj m ² d 1 fig 4 the mean wind speed from 2 m above the ground was 0 271 m s 1 with a variation of 0 024 to 0 912 m s 1 the irrigation was applied by a 14 m length sprinkler bar with 33 nozzles tt teejet 11008vs teejet springfield illinois usa with 430 mm spaces at a height of 1 5 m from the ground irrigation depth was defined by the bar speed which was limited at 8 m min 1 with the nozzle flow fixed at 2 61 min 1 defining irrigation depths greater than 0 67 mm in each application the total applied irrigation depth during the experimental period was 389 2 mm ranging from 5 4 to 13 2 mm d 1 with a mean of 8 3 mm d 1 the total eto was 175 7 mm ranging from 1 9 to 5 3 mm with a mean of 3 7 mm d 1 since the irrigation was greater than the eto there was no water deficit during the experimental period fig 5 this confirmation guaranteed the water supply for crop evapotranspiration at a maximum rate which is required for kc determination the lysimeter water content included the substrate humidity in the plantlet tubes and drainage water stored in the tank before draining hourly and daily variation in the water storage shown in fig 6 reveals the uniformity among the three lysimeters and their sensibility and precision to measure mass variation as well as the influence of drainage in the lysimeter mass during the experimental period the data acquisition system failed at 2 3 6 and 8 12 dat because of electrical communication problems between the datalogger and lysimeters fig 6b 3 results five day moving means of daily eto and etc measured by the three lysimeters were similar during the first week of the experimental period 0 to 7 dat with means varying from 3 to 4 mm which were lower than the measurements taken during the remaining period due to lower leaf area temperature and solar radiation after the second week there was a detachment of etc curves from eto fig 7 due to an increase in etc caused by an increase in lai the comparison between treatments showed that the etc sum for ctc9005hp was equal to 190 0 mm mean of 4 9 mm d 1 and range from 3 0 to 6 9 mm d 1 rb966928 had a sum of 187 3 mm mean of 4 8 mm d 1 and range from 3 1 to 6 8 mm d 1 and sp87365 had sum of 190 6 mm mean of 4 9 mm d 1 and range from 2 9 to 6 6 mm d 1 table 2 and fig 7 these etc results for psp were similar to reports in the literature for field sugarcane etc however eto results were lower than those reported previously carmo et al 2017 silva et al 2013a the growing degree day gdd estimates by the model proposed by ometto 1981 and leaf area index lai presented high correlations r² 0 99 to dat fig 8 and 9 enabling these models to be used to determine kc lai has also presented a high correlation to ci r² 0 98 fig 10 enabling it to be used to determine the sugarcane psp phenological stage as an easy way to obtain data when comparing to leaf area assessments leaves pruning at 37 dat caused a reduction in lai and ci and consequently in etc and kc the etc values for ctc9005hp rb966928 and sp87365 before pruning 32 36 dat were 6 6 6 4 and 6 3 mm d 1 respectively to 4 4 4 6 and 4 9 mm d 1 after pruning 37 41 dat crop coefficients at the beginning of the cycle 0 7 dat were close to 1 00 maximum kc values were obtained between 32 and 36 dat and were 1 50 for ctc9005hp 1 46 for rb966928 and 1 45 for sp87365 table 3 daily kc values obtained by the five day moving mean as presented in fig 11 showed that daily kc curves increased from 1 00 to 1 46 for ctc9005hp 1 02 to 1 53 for rb966928 and 1 02 to 1 49 for sp87365 the increment of kc as plantlets grow makes evident the importance of assessing appropriate kc values in order to estimate crop water requirements and irrigation needs the crop water requirements are also related to weather condition interacting with lai over plantlet age therefore fixed depth irrigation scheduled during psp cycle determines generally excessive water in the beginning of the cycle causing water and energy waste increases in crop susceptibility to diseases and a water deficit at the end of the cycle causing a reduction in plantlet growth pruning was notably the cause of reduced kc values after 37 dat there was a high correlation between kc and dat r² 0 94 gdd r² 0 95 and lai r² 0 91 for all treatments fig 12 providing a reliable tool for estimating sugarcane psp greenhouse irrigation requirements 4 discussion several kc values are widely recommended for crop stages allen et al 1998 however these values are highly influenced by many factors such as the climate of the region cultivar production system tillage planting season and soil cover carvalho et al 2012 silva et al 2012 2013a jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2018a worldwide recommended kc values allen et al 1998 and calculated kc in the region can diverge by nearby 40 during the crop development stages carvalho et al 2012 silva et al 2013a lozano et al 2017 water wastage is up to 20 for irrigation management with overestimated kc values djaman et al 2018 whereas the yield reduction can reach up to 38 with underestimated kc values kharrou et al 2011 crop coefficient determination is an expensive and laborious operation alternative methods have been tested and validated to overcome these problems without dropping the precision of kc determination the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been extensively applied to kc determination with high accuracy since kc is extremely influenced by leaf area kamble et al 2013 oliveira et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 therefore kc determination by leaf area cover index is a promising technique according to the high precision leaf area estimative models in this study r² 0 98 fig 10 nevertheless this technique has the advantages of easy measurement and the lack of need for specific equipment since only a mobile app is needed because of the microclimate planting density and crop management in protected cultivation plant water requirements can be higher than those in open field conditions contreras et al 2017 studies report that maximum kc value in greenhouses are higher than the fao 56 recommendation to open field environments blanco and folegatti 2003 wang et al 2018b achieving increases of up to 40 for this study the kc results during the psp cycle were higher than the results reported in the literature for field sugarcane silva et al 2013a esteves et al 2014 carmo et al 2017 the kc results indicate that the relationship between etc and eto are higher than those in field sugarcane because of the plantlet density and specific evaporative area of the trays causing higher kc values for the psp cycle therefore this study presented a great purpose providing kc values for sugarcane plantlet irrigation management and adding to the literature recommendations for this subject instead of adopting fao 56 kc values which would result in a water deficit in sugarcane plantlets declarations of interest none acknowledgments this work was

consuming crops in china the annual water consumption of rice accounts for 51 1 of the total water consumption of crops mao 2001 due to the shortage of water resources and for the better allocation and utilization of water resources many researchers inside and outside china have carried out tests on water requirements and irrigation quotas of rice mao 2001 watanabe et al 2006 tuong et al 2005 tabbal et al 2002 martini et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xu et al 2017 as a large rice growing province in china yunnan has a long history of rice cultivation in this province rice is widely distributed katsura et al 2008 principally mid season rice is cultivated for one season the traditional flood irrigation method is mainly used pan and yao 1992 to date the results of experimental research on etc

east west barriers and north south transmission channels towards the southeastern and southwestern monsoons in this region forming a channel barrier effect changes in climate and runoff also show significant characteristics due to this channel barrier effect wang 2005 altitudes mountains and valleys also affect solar radiation humidity wind speed rainfall and temperature with certain correlations among them however the topography and weather conditions of yunnan make the correlations among these parameters very complex wang 2005 komuscu et al 1998 thus a complex and diverse three

28 n is the most southwestern province in china with the tropic of cancer running through its southern part the province borders the qinghai tibet plateau to the north and the indochina peninsula to the south not far from the tropical oceans it has an intricate topography which creates a unique low latitude plateau monsoon climate thomas 1993 yunnan s climate is complex and diverse the province has cold warm and hot zones its main climatic features are as follows 1 the climate varies greatly with region and altitude elevation is high in the north and low in the south and the difference in elevation between the north and south reaches 6000 m enlarging the altitude related temperature difference across the province 2 the annual temperature difference is small and the daily temperature difference is big the average temperature of the hottest month is about 19 22 c and the coldest month is about 6 8 c the average temperature is about 5 c in the north and 24 c in the south with a difference of about 19 c in winter and spring the daily temperature difference is up to 12 20 c 3 precipitation is abundant but unevenly distributed forming a distinct difference between wet and dry seasons the annual precipitation in most areas of the province is 1100 mm with that in the southern part of 1600 mm or more most of the precipitation mainly takes place from june to august accounting for about 60 of the annual precipitation in yunnan 18 types of soil are present and the red soil prevails among them over 94 of yunnan comprises mountains and is cut longitudinally by the hengduan mountains including the ailaoshan gaoligong and baima snow mountains and their branches between mountains there are six major river systems jinsha river upper yangtze river nanpan river upper pearl river yuan river upper red river lancang river upper mekong river nu river upper salween river and dulong river upper irrawaddy river between the mountains and valleys the altitudes vary greatly forming a complex three dimensional climate and channel barrier effect 2 2 data collection there are 36 national meteorological stations in yunnan the areas harboring these stations excluding the deqin weixi and zhongdian stations are suitable for growing rice according to the planting regionalization in yunnan pan and yao 1992 yunnan is divided into five regions central yunnan northwestern yunnan northeastern yunnan southwestern yunnan and southeastern yunnan the distribution of meteorological stations and the digital elevation model dem of yunnan http www gscloud cn are shown in fig 1 the stations collected meteorological data including hourly temperature radiation wind speed precipitation and relative humidity http www data cma cn soil type and rice cultivation data for 48 years from 1970 to 2017 wang 1996 the area of the weather stations were flat and unobstructed maintaining the uniform grass layers and the grass heights were less than 20 cm temperature humidity wind speed wind direction rain radiation and barometer sensors were installed in the observation fields of weather stations all the installation heights were 1 5 m except that the installation heights of wind speed and wind direction sensors were 10 m they all provided hourly data 2 3 test design southwestern yunnan has a large area of land and therefore is subdivided into two rice growing areas southern yunnan and western yunnan both northwestern yunnan and northeastern yunnan belong to the frigid highland zone and have a small area of cultivated land thereby they are regarded as one rice growing area considering the topographic and climatic characteristics and rice growing traditions of yunnan in this study the zuoyi station in central yunnan was selected as the basic station to test the etc of rice with other selected representative stations in each growing area the characteristics of basic station and representative stations are showed in fig 1a and are described in table 1 the test zones of the basic and representative stations were 60 m2 12 m long and 5 m wide in cultivated fields plastic films covered ridges and were buried 0 4 m below the field surface to prevent water leakage in each field both the height and width of a ridge were 0 4 m a schematic diagram of a test zone is shown in fig 2 the experiments were conducted at the zuoyi and xizhou stations in 2015 2016 and 2017 at other representative stations only in 2016 and 2017 at each station the rice was fertilized three times the ratio of base fertilizer to tillering fertilizer to panicle fertilizer 5 3 2 the base fertilizer was composed of compound fertilizer and urea the tillering and panicle fertilizers were composed of urea all fertilizers were applyed into the surface water evenly with a total fertilizer volume of 180 kg hm 2 only the pure nitrogen is counted the rice grew well with high production table 1 the rice growth cycle falls into returning green tillering jointing booting heading

respectively d is the drainage amount l is the leakage amount m is the irrigation amount p is the precipitation all these values are in the unit of mm a hobo water level logger onset the united states recorded the hourly water levels of the test zones besides the depth of water layer was manually measured with point gague at 8 00 a m everyday the irrigation and drainage were conducted manually and the water volume was recorded manually by pump with water meter every time the precipitation was measured by weather station installed in the station the leakage was measured by leakage measurement cylinders which bottom was vertical extended into the plough of test zone and the cover was put on to prevent the water volatilization in the cylinder and precipitation from falling into it the daily water level in the cylinder was observed manually like test zone water layer 2 4 3 observed iq the rice iq m for the whole growth stage includes the steeping quota m0 at the steeping stage and the net

stations fig 1a due to the heavy workload so they are calculated based on revised kc according to fao 56 method while the kc should be revised based on the kc observed at some sites in the province or region if possible rather than using the kc recommended by fao 56 directly kashyap and panda 2001 so the observed kc of representative stations were used to revise kc of weather stations in corresponding rice growing areas in this study the crop growth cycle was divided into initial development middle and late growth stages according to the fao 56 table 3 furthermore fao 56 generalizes the changing process of kc into four values kcini kcdev kcmid and kcend corresponding to the four growth stages the suggested typical values of kcini for the various climate conditions as shown in table 4 allen et al 1998 for the mid season stage and late season stage transpiration through the rice leaf and stem should be considered as per fao 56 method the height of crop is one of the terms affecting crop coefficient the kcmid was revised with climatic condition and height of crop by eq 6 6 k c m i d k c b m i d 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb mid is the value of observed k c at the mid season stage by eq 5 u 2 is the mean value for daily wind speed at 2 m height over grass during the midseason growth stage m s 1 rh min is the mean value for daily minimum relative humidity and h is the mean rice during mid season stage m the method for revising kcend was the same as kcmid then linear interpolation was used to calculate the daily kc of whole growth stages

observations generally the steeping quota can be determined by data of similar fields in soil topography groundwater depth and tillage depth steeping quotas of different groundwater depth and soil types were shown in table 5 guo 1995 chen and guo 1995 calculated the measured data of irrigation experiment stations for many years and obtained the monthly leakage rate of rice paddies under different soil types table 6 with water layer control standards table 2 daily etc eq 7 leakage rate table 6 and precipitation the net iq was calculated day by day according to eq 2 guo 1995 if the water level hdown in the test zone at the end of the period was lower than the water layer lower limit in table 2 irrigation was required so the irrigation amount per time during the growth period was 8 m h u p h d o w n where m is irrigation amount per time mm hup is the upper limit of irrigation in table 2 mm the net iq was the sum of irrigation amount per time 9 m 1 i 1 n m i where m1 is the net

observed values of etc and iq both the re and rmse were desirably as small as possible that high reliability could be gained perera et al 2014 in this study the rice etc and iq of representative stations were observed by experiment at the same time they were calculated based on kc measured in zuoyi station the results of comparison between calculated and observed values of etc and iq in representative stations served as the basis for evaluating the reliability of the fao 56 method for etc and iq calculation we believe that only if the reliability of etc and iq calculated by the fao 56 method is high can the etc and iq of 36 weather stations be calculated using the kc observed at the representative stations in the corresponding rice growing areas the re and rmse were calculated as fellows 10 r e c i o i o i 100 11 r m s e i 1 n c i o i 2 n where n is the number of observations ci and oi are the ith calculated and observed values respectively the spss software was used to analyze the correlation between the etc and iq of 36 weather stations and the meteorological factors besides the correlation between meteorological elements was also analyzed two levels of significance were used p 0 01 and p 0 05 3 results and analysis 3 1 reliability for the calculated etc and iq the comparison results of the calculated and observed etc and iq for the representative stations are presented in table 7 for all representative stations the re between the calculated and observed etc ranged from 1 4 to 5 1 and that between the calculated and observed iq ranged from 0 2 to 10 8 overall the re was smaller between the calculated and observed etc than that between the calculated and observed iq the rmse between the calculated and observed etc at the representative stations was 14 8 mm and that between the calculated and observed iq was 27 1 mm both of which were small it can be seen that it is reasonable and feasible to use the single kc approach to calculate the rice etc and iq 3 2 etc spatial distribution regularities and influencing factors 3 2 1 etc spatial distribution the rice kc of each weather station in the corresponding growth zones were revised based on the kc observed from corresponding representative station and the meteorological data of 36 stations in yunnan for 48 years and then the average daily etc of all weather stations in different years were calculated mapping with geographic information system gis highlighted the spatial variation the gis inverse distance weighting method was used to draw the contour map for the average daily etc of rice at various stations for the study years as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the etc of the yuanmou and yuanjiang stations in the dry hot valley areas decrease with distance from the center of the areas and that the average daily etc of the deqin gongshan and zhongdian stations in northwestern yunnan which are at higher altitude were the lowest for the study years at about 3 mm d 1 the average daily etc of rice at the yuanmou station was nearly 6 mm and that at the yuanjiang station was 5 mm the average daily etc of rice in most of central northwestern and southeastern yunnan generally ranged from 3 to 4 mm 3 2 2 impact of the channel barrier effect on etc because of the complicated and changeable topography of yunnan the altitude varies greatly the impact of the channel barrier effect on the rice etc in yunnan mainly manifests itself in the small difference in the rice etc between mountains between mountains and rivers and between rivers and rivers the minimum etc 2 9 3 3 mm d 1 occurs in the high altitude area between the qinghai tibet plateau and mainri snow mountain an etc of 3 3 3 8 mm d 1 occurs in the area between the gaoligong mountains and the yun range an etc of 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 occurs in the area between the yun range and jade dragon snow mountain there is little climatic difference within each channel but the climate varies greatly between channels and the corresponding etc varies greatly in southern yunnan the northwest southeast ailao mountains and yuan river form a dividing line between one area with an etc of 3 3 3 8 mm d 1 and another with an etc of 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in southeastern yunnan the nanpanjiang river a headwater of the pearl river divides the etc ranges of 3 3 3 8 and 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in northeastern yunnan the wumeng mountains which run northeast to southwest divide the etc ranges of 3 3 3 8 and 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in western yunnan the rice etc run in strips from north to south which is in good agreement with the terrain of the hengduan mountains running from north to south in this area 3 2 3 impact of three dimensional climate on etc within the same range the etc may change abruptly in other words the etc in a certain sub area may be higher or lower than that in the surrounding areas this is mainly influenced by meteorological factors table 8 shows that etc is significantly correlated with temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and rainfall except wind speed and elevation relative humidity has a significant relationship with rainfall sunshine hours and wind speed and rainfall affects temperature and sunshine hours the causes of the abrupt change of etc are not the same it can be seen from fig 3 that the etc of rice in the nujiang huaping yuanmou and yuanjiang stations are significantly higher than those of the surrounding areas in the same range this is mainly because the leeward slopes of mountains have foehn winds and prevent cold air the foehn wind effect is a situation in which after the air passes over and down the leeward slope of a mountain adiabatic warming occurs and the air drops as a result the temperature at the foot on the leeward slope of the mountain is significantly high making them climatic enclaves beyond latitudinal zonality in the north tropical zone the four climatic enclaves are located in the nu river valley nujiang station jinsha river valley huaping and yuanmou stations and yuan river valley yuanjiang station fig 1 unlike the climate enclaves the etc at some stations such as the tengchong yuxi jiangcheng pingbian and simao stations were lower than those in areas surrounding the stations the reasons for these differences vary per station the tengchong station is located on the western slope of the gaoligong mountains which run north to south i e a windward slope of warm and moist air in southwestern china therefore at this station it is usually cloudy and rainy and the temperature is low in addition at the foot of the gentle western slope is the curved qushi basin which allows cold air to come in easily but makes it difficult for it to leave the cold lake effect is obvious the low etc of the yuxi station is also the result of the cold lake effect the yuxi station is surrounded by mountains and thereby has a concave landform the average annual temperature is only 12 c in the jiangcheng pingbian and simao stations the altitude is low because of the influence of the southwest warm and moist airflow in the warmer half of the year it is wet and rainy at these three stations and fewer hours of sunshine occur there than in other parts of yunnan province 3 3 spatial distribution regularities and influencing factors of the iq 3 3 1 spatial distribution of the iq according to the calculating method of rice iq in this study the average rice iq of all weather stations for the study years were obtained the contour map drawn by the gis inverse distance weighting method for the average iq at various stations for the study years was shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the distribution regularity of the contour lines of rice iq of all stations is obvious as it was with the etc the iq decreases from the dry hot river valley areas where the yuanmou and yuanjiang stations are located with distance from these areas the yuanmou station had the largest iq with an average value of 743 5 mm for the study years the iq at the yuanjiang station was 672 2 mm southern yunnan had the smallest iq at the jiangcheng station the iq was only 180 mm as almost no irrigation except for steeping is required within the rice growth period the iq of the yuanmou station is fourfold larger than that of the jiangcheng station presenting a large spatial difference overall the iq are distributed like belts however abrupt changes in iq occur in some places a typical example of this is in southern yunnan where the iq within a small area changes abruptly from a value of approximately 700 mm to the minimum value of yunnan the iq varied greatly from year to year owing to the large variation in precipitation between years and the impact of other climatic conditions on the etc different rainfall frequencies generally are used to represent the dryness of a typical year however to avoid the influence of uneven rainfall during the year in this study the rainfall frequencies during the rice growth period were ranked to obtain the iq of 36 stations for three categories of hydrological year normal years the rainfall frequency is 50 dry years the rainfall frequency is 75 very dry years the rainfall frequency is 90 the contour map drawn by the gis inverse distance weighting method for the average daily iq of rice for the different hydrological years was shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 4 that the multiyear average annual iq is close to the iq of the normal year fig 5a at each station rainfall exerts the greatest influence on the iq of the yuanjiang station with the iq of the very dry year 142 5 mm higher than the multiyear average annual iq rainfall has no effect on the iq of the jiangcheng station at this station rice does not need to be irrigated during the rice growth period because of extremely heavy rainfall and the iq is only the amount of water needed during the steeping stage the rice iq in the normal year fig 5a is smaller than the multiyear average iq fig 4 in southwestern and southeast yunnan greater than the multiyear average iq in northwestern and northeastern yunnan and almost the same as the multiyear average iq in central yunnan from fig 5a it can be seen that yunnan province is subject to greater spatial variability in rice iq and has a more obvious gradient in iq in the normal year in the dry year fig 5b the iq of rice is obviously greater than in the normal year and the area with greater iq largely increases however comparing the dry and very dry years fig 5c the increase of iq mainly occurred in southwestern and northeastern yunnan the gradient difference of the iq contour map is not obvious between these two hydrological years 3 3 2 impact of the channel barrier effect on the iq influenced by the direction of mountains in yunnan province rainfall is greater in the south than in the north during the rice growth period fig 6 and the rice iq is significantly affected primarily the hengduan and gaoligong mountains thomas 1993 rainfall in yunnan mainly comes from the streams of warm and moist air from the bay of bengal in the southwest indian ocean and from the southeast from south to north the air streams pass over mountains and condense into clouds and rain in addition most of the southern part of the province is located in the windward slope of warm and moist air and thereby receives ample rainfall the hengduan mountains one after another block the streams of warm and moist air coming from the west therefore the rainfall decreases continuously from west to east until the air streams arrive at the central area the central area receives the minimum rainfall the tengchong and baoshan stations for example are located on the west and east sides of the gaoligong mountains with altitudes of 1654 6 and 1653 5 m respectively their straight line distance is 68 km during the growth period of rice the rainfall is 1061 2 mm at the tengchong station but only 652 7 mm at the baoshan station with the steeping quota deducted the iq during the rice growth period is 203 6 mm at the baoshan station but only 65 6 mm at the tengchong station in addition to the longitudinal barriers such as the hengduan mountains the deep river valleys in this area such as the lancang nu and jinsha river valleys are also apparent barriers to the distribution of surface hydrothermal conditions in the river valley in the east west direction forming typical dryhot valleys climate yunnan has three typical dry hot valleys i e yuanmou yuanjiang and jinghong where the extreme maximum temperature exceeds 41 c they are known as yunnan s three stove areas these valley areas are generally hot and dry year round and thereby have large iq besides these valleys also have significant channeling and diffusion effects in the north south direction cold air from the qinghai tibet plateau flows southward along these channels and meets the southwestern warm and moist air in the southern part of the longitudinal valley region to form a local wind water belt including jiangcheng station ruili station mengding station and lancang station the rainfall during the rice growth period in this area exceeds 1000 mm fig 6 and the net iq is generally below 100 mm 3 3 3 impact of the three dimensional climate on the iq it can be seen from table 9 in addition to rainfall other meteorological factors and elevation have a certain effect on iq the results show that the wind speed and sunshine hours are positively correlated with the iq mainly because the higher the wind speed is the smaller the rainfall and the larger the sunshine time is the greater the etc table 8 the relative humidity increases with the increase of rainfall and has a significant negative correlation with the iq the higher the altitude is the less the sunshine hours the lower the temperature the larger the iq however the influence of temperature on iq is more complex under normal circumstances rice in low temperature areas needs little water and the iq is small the temperature is lower in northwestern and northeastern yunnan than in southern yunnan however the rice iq is higher this is mainly due to the higher rainfall in southern yunnan overall the iq in high temperature areas are smaller than in low temperature areas fig 4 and table 9 another reason is that rice in low temperature areas has a longer growth period mahmood 1997 the growth period of mid season rice is about 120 days in southern yunnan but 150 days in northeastern and northwestern yunnan for example the rice growth period of the sanyi station is 23 days longer than that of the xizhou station table 3 thus the rice growth period exceeds the length of the rainy season meaning water can be provided through irrigation only subsequently increasing the rice iq dry hot valley areas possess the highest iq in yunnan province owing to their long sunshine hours and low rainfall 3 4 uncertainties affecting etc and iq there is a large variety of rice in yunnan with the continuous rice growing behavior and the influence of the market technologies and government policies rice varieties are constantly changing in this study it was hypothesized that the rice variety at each station would not change over the study years for the rice growth period this study fixed the dates of transplanting and harvesting for each station which is nearly impossible in reality with global climate change especially the rising temperature and the climate change during the year rice transplanting and maturity periods are also changing which was not considered in this study with the shortage of water resources and the progress of science and technology many water saving irrigation technologies have been used for rice cultivation in some irrigation areas the use of such technologies will reduce the rice etc and iq lahue et al 2016 mao 2001 xu et al 2017 in yunnan province maybe water saving irrigation technologies are adopted in some areas the rice etc and iq in these areas may be different from that calculated under traditional flood irrigation table 2 in this study yunnan has a great diversity of soil types however the soil physical and chemical properties in this area have yet to be characterized fully in particular the soil water retention which has great influence on the iq varies greatly with the soil type even for the same soil type the slope and groundwater level can affect soil water retention this may have an effect on the actual iq of rice in yunnan province 4 conclusions when studying the impacts of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate on rice etc and iq in some area with changeable climate and terrain such as yunnan with wide agro ecological variation it is essential to account for spatial variability the outputs from spatial assessments with gis can complement more detailed site specific study which can benefit from long run historical climate datasets in this study the k c approach recommended by fao was used to calculate the rice etc in yunnan province and then the iq was calculated owing to the special topographic and climatic conditions in yunnan province the spatial variability of rice etc and iq is significant under the influence of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate and the channel barrier effect is dominant compared with the three dimensional climate by changing the course and process of warm and moist air mountains and valleys affect the formation of rainfall and the distribution of water and heat conditions subsequently dividing the rice etc and iq into multiple channels the rice etc and iq vary greatly between different channels and slightly in the same channel the run and trend lines of the mountains and valleys have become the boundaries of rice etc and iq the three dimensional climate mainly influences the local rice etc and iq which causes abrupt changes in the rice etc and iq within a certain range temperature and rainfall are the most critical elements in the three dimensional climate in addition to directly affecting the rice etc the temperature will affect the length of rice growth and influence the iq while the rainfall will directly affect the distribution of iq other factors such as rice varieties irrigation modes and soil physical and chemical properties need to be

11266,yunnan is a large rice growing province in china that is situated in a low latitude plateau area in this province the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate play prominent roles and significantly influence the rice water requirement etc and irrigation quota iq while the research about the influence mechanism and results is lacking we estimated the rice etc and iq of different hydrological years based on the experimental data from six areas of mid season rice and the single crop efficient approach recommended by fao 56 the contour maps were drawn with gis and the spatial distribution of the rice etc and iq under the influence of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate were analyzed the results showed that high water etc and iq of rice were distributed in the hot dry river valley area the rice etc was the smallest in northwestern yunnan and the iq was the smallest in southern yunnan the etc and iq of rice were divided into several intervals by mountains and valleys and varied largely among different channels and little within one channel the three dimensional climate results in the abrupt changes of etc and iq the leading meteorological factors causing the abrupt changes were different and there were also complex correlations between these meteorological factors taken together temperature and rainfall were the most critical elements in the three dimensional climate the results of this study illustrated the regularity and inherent mechanism of the rice etc and iq under the influences of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate providing certain references for the analyses and calculation of the rice etc and iq in similar circumstances keywords water balance equation crop coefficient spatial variability water resources geographical information system 1 introduction at present agricultural irrigation water accounts for more than 70 of the total water consumption in china rice is one of the most water consuming crops in china the annual water consumption of rice accounts for 51 1 of the total water consumption of crops mao 2001 due to the shortage of water resources and for the better allocation and utilization of water resources many researchers inside and outside china have carried out tests on water requirements and irrigation quotas of rice mao 2001 watanabe et al 2006 tuong et al 2005 tabbal et al 2002 martini et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xu et al 2017 as a large rice growing province in china yunnan has a long history of rice cultivation in this province rice is widely distributed katsura et al 2008 principally mid season rice is cultivated for one season the traditional flood irrigation method is mainly used pan and yao 1992 to date the results of experimental research on etc and iq of rice in yunnan are hardly useful as reference for most of them were obtained based on meteorological data via analytical calculation and via modeling and forecasting http www ynqi gov cn these results are valuable for reference to some extent but the differences between them and the actual values need to be verified yunnan is located in a low latitude plateau region with more than 94 of its area mountainous altitudes and climates vary widely across the province there are large rivers featured with longitudinal range gorge region lrgr in the near surface layer such landforms act as east west barriers and north south transmission channels towards the southeastern and southwestern monsoons in this region forming a channel barrier effect changes in climate and runoff also show significant characteristics due to this channel barrier effect wang 2005 altitudes mountains and valleys also affect solar radiation humidity wind speed rainfall and temperature with certain correlations among them however the topography and weather conditions of yunnan make the correlations among these parameters very complex wang 2005 komuscu et al 1998 thus a complex and diverse three dimensional climate eventually forms research has shown that climate change greatly influences the etc and iq of rice yoo et al 2012 silva et al 2007 rodriguez diaz et al 2007 ye et al 2015 thomas 2008 and temperature is one of the most important influencing factors temperature can affect the growth and vegetation of rice nishiyama 1976 de datta 1981 oldeman et al 1987 and further affect the length of the rice growth period oldeman et al 1987 the higher the temperature is the shorter the rice growth period the greater the average daily etc and the lower the final total etc when the temperature rises by 1 c the total etc decreases by 4 mahmood 1997 temperature can also affect the suitable areas for growing rice in the northern hemisphere an increase in temperature drives the suitable areas for growing most crops including rice northward frich et al 2002 linderholm et al 2008 under such circumstances the regularity and intensity of rice etc will change greatly thus influencing the rice etc and iq owing to the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate in yunnan the existing test results of rice etc and iq in low altitude areas tabbal et al 2002 ye et al 2015 zhu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 cannot be directly applied to yunnan for irrigation guidance the test results of one or more test sites are inadequate to represent the actual rice etc and iq of the whole yunnan province thus the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the channel barrier effect and dimensional climate on the rice etc and iq to illustrate the regularity and inherent mechanism and to provide certain references for the analyses and calculation of the rice etc and iq in similar circumstances 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area yunnan 97 105 e 20 28 n is the most southwestern province in china with the tropic of cancer running through its southern part the province borders the qinghai tibet plateau to the north and the indochina peninsula to the south not far from the tropical oceans it has an intricate topography which creates a unique low latitude plateau monsoon climate thomas 1993 yunnan s climate is complex and diverse the province has cold warm and hot zones its main climatic features are as follows 1 the climate varies greatly with region and altitude elevation is high in the north and low in the south and the difference in elevation between the north and south reaches 6000 m enlarging the altitude related temperature difference across the province 2 the annual temperature difference is small and the daily temperature difference is big the average temperature of the hottest month is about 19 22 c and the coldest month is about 6 8 c the average temperature is about 5 c in the north and 24 c in the south with a difference of about 19 c in winter and spring the daily temperature difference is up to 12 20 c 3 precipitation is abundant but unevenly distributed forming a distinct difference between wet and dry seasons the annual precipitation in most areas of the province is 1100 mm with that in the southern part of 1600 mm or more most of the precipitation mainly takes place from june to august accounting for about 60 of the annual precipitation in yunnan 18 types of soil are present and the red soil prevails among them over 94 of yunnan comprises mountains and is cut longitudinally by the hengduan mountains including the ailaoshan gaoligong and baima snow mountains and their branches between mountains there are six major river systems jinsha river upper yangtze river nanpan river upper pearl river yuan river upper red river lancang river upper mekong river nu river upper salween river and dulong river upper irrawaddy river between the mountains and valleys the altitudes vary greatly forming a complex three dimensional climate and channel barrier effect 2 2 data collection there are 36 national meteorological stations in yunnan the areas harboring these stations excluding the deqin weixi and zhongdian stations are suitable for growing rice according to the planting regionalization in yunnan pan and yao 1992 yunnan is divided into five regions central yunnan northwestern yunnan northeastern yunnan southwestern yunnan and southeastern yunnan the distribution of meteorological stations and the digital elevation model dem of yunnan http www gscloud cn are shown in fig 1 the stations collected meteorological data including hourly temperature radiation wind speed precipitation and relative humidity http www data cma cn soil type and rice cultivation data for 48 years from 1970 to 2017 wang 1996 the area of the weather stations were flat and unobstructed maintaining the uniform grass layers and the grass heights were less than 20 cm temperature humidity wind speed wind direction rain radiation and barometer sensors were installed in the observation fields of weather stations all the installation heights were 1 5 m except that the installation heights of wind speed and wind direction sensors were 10 m they all provided hourly data 2 3 test design southwestern yunnan has a large area of land and therefore is subdivided into two rice growing areas southern yunnan and western yunnan both northwestern yunnan and northeastern yunnan belong to the frigid highland zone and have a small area of cultivated land thereby they are regarded as one rice growing area considering the topographic and climatic characteristics and rice growing traditions of yunnan in this study the zuoyi station in central yunnan was selected as the basic station to test the etc of rice with other selected representative stations in each growing area the characteristics of basic station and representative stations are showed in fig 1a and are described in table 1 the test zones of the basic and representative stations were 60 m2 12 m long and 5 m wide in cultivated fields plastic films covered ridges and were buried 0 4 m below the field surface to prevent water leakage in each field both the height and width of a ridge were 0 4 m a schematic diagram of a test zone is shown in fig 2 the experiments were conducted at the zuoyi and xizhou stations in 2015 2016 and 2017 at other representative stations only in 2016 and 2017 at each station the rice was fertilized three times the ratio of base fertilizer to tillering fertilizer to panicle fertilizer 5 3 2 the base fertilizer was composed of compound fertilizer and urea the tillering and panicle fertilizers were composed of urea all fertilizers were applyed into the surface water evenly with a total fertilizer volume of 180 kg hm 2 only the pure nitrogen is counted the rice grew well with high production table 1 the rice growth cycle falls into returning green tillering jointing booting heading flowering milky ripening and yellow ripening stages all stations adopted traditional flood irrigation the standards of water layer control in the test zones at different growth stages are presented in

respectively d is the drainage amount l is the leakage amount m is the irrigation amount p is the precipitation all these values are in the unit of mm a hobo water level logger onset the united states recorded the hourly water levels of the test zones besides the depth of water layer was manually measured with point gague at 8 00 a m everyday the irrigation and drainage were conducted manually and the water volume was recorded manually by pump with water meter every time the precipitation was measured by weather station installed in the station the leakage was measured by leakage measurement cylinders which bottom was vertical extended into the plough of test zone and the cover was put on to prevent the water volatilization in the cylinder and precipitation from falling into it the daily

stations fig 1a due to the heavy workload so they are calculated based on revised kc according to fao 56 method while the kc should be revised based on the kc observed at some sites in the province or region if possible rather than using the kc recommended by fao 56 directly kashyap and panda 2001 so the observed kc of representative stations were used to revise kc of weather stations in corresponding rice growing areas in this study the crop growth cycle was divided into initial development middle and late growth stages according to the fao 56 table 3 furthermore fao 56 generalizes the changing process of kc into four values kcini kcdev kcmid and kcend corresponding to the four growth stages the suggested typical values of kcini for the various climate conditions as shown in table 4 allen et al 1998 for the mid season stage and late season stage transpiration through the rice leaf and stem should be considered as per fao 56 method the height of crop is one of the terms affecting crop coefficient the kcmid was revised with climatic condition and height of crop by eq 6 6 k c m i d k c b m i d 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb mid is the value of observed k c at the mid season stage by eq 5 u 2 is the mean value for daily wind speed at 2 m height over grass during the midseason growth stage m s 1 rh min is the mean value for daily minimum relative humidity and h is the mean rice during mid season stage m the method for revising kcend was the same as kcmid then linear interpolation was used to calculate the daily kc of whole growth stages

observations generally the steeping quota can be determined by data of similar fields in soil topography groundwater depth and tillage depth steeping quotas of different groundwater depth and soil

different soil types table 6 with water layer control standards table 2 daily etc eq 7 leakage rate table 6 and precipitation the net iq was calculated day by day according to eq 2 guo 1995 if the water level hdown in the test zone at the end of the period was lower than the water layer lower limit in table 2 irrigation was required so the irrigation amount per time during the growth period was

observed values of etc and iq both the re and rmse were desirably as small as possible that high reliability could be gained perera et al 2014 in this study the rice etc and iq of representative stations were observed by experiment at the same time they were calculated based on kc measured in zuoyi station the results of comparison between calculated and observed values of etc and iq in representative stations served as the basis for evaluating the reliability of the fao 56 method for etc and iq calculation we believe that only if the reliability of etc and iq calculated by the fao 56 method is high can the etc and iq of 36 weather stations be calculated using the kc observed at the representative stations in the corresponding rice growing areas the re and rmse were calculated as fellows 10 r e c i o i o i 100 11 r m s e i 1 n c i o i 2 n where n is the number of observations ci and oi are the ith calculated and observed values respectively the spss software was used to analyze the correlation between the etc and iq of 36 weather stations and the meteorological factors besides the correlation between meteorological elements was also analyzed two levels of significance were used p 0 01 and p 0 05 3 results and analysis 3 1 reliability for the calculated etc and iq the comparison results of the calculated and observed etc and iq for the representative stations are presented in table 7 for all representative stations the re between the calculated and observed etc ranged from 1 4 to 5 1 and that between the calculated and observed iq ranged from 0 2 to 10 8 overall the re was smaller between the calculated and observed etc than that between the calculated and observed iq the rmse between the calculated and observed etc at the representative stations was 14 8 mm and that between the calculated and observed iq was 27 1 mm both of which were small it can be seen that it is reasonable and feasible to use the single kc approach to calculate the rice etc and iq 3 2 etc spatial distribution regularities and influencing factors 3 2 1 etc spatial distribution the rice kc of each weather station in the corresponding growth zones were revised based on the kc observed from corresponding representative station and the meteorological data of 36 stations in yunnan for 48 years and then the average daily etc of all weather stations in different years were calculated mapping with geographic information system gis highlighted the spatial variation the gis inverse distance weighting method was used to draw the contour map for the average daily etc of rice at various stations for the study years as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the etc of the yuanmou and yuanjiang stations in the dry hot valley areas decrease with distance from the center of the areas and that the average daily etc of the deqin gongshan and zhongdian stations in northwestern yunnan which are at higher altitude were the lowest for the study years at about 3 mm d 1 the average daily etc of rice at the yuanmou station was nearly 6 mm and that at the yuanjiang station was 5 mm the average daily etc of rice in most of central northwestern and southeastern yunnan generally ranged from 3 to 4 mm 3 2 2 impact of the channel barrier effect on etc because of the complicated and changeable topography of yunnan the altitude varies greatly the impact of the channel barrier effect on the rice etc in yunnan mainly manifests itself in the small difference in the rice etc between mountains between mountains and rivers and between rivers and rivers the minimum etc 2 9 3 3 mm d 1 occurs in the high altitude area between the qinghai tibet plateau and mainri snow mountain an etc of 3 3 3 8 mm d 1 occurs in the area between the gaoligong mountains and the yun range an etc of 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 occurs in the area between the yun range and jade dragon snow mountain there is little climatic difference within each channel but the climate varies greatly between channels and the corresponding etc varies greatly in southern yunnan the northwest southeast ailao mountains and yuan river form a dividing line between one area with an etc of 3 3 3 8 mm d 1 and another with an etc of 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in southeastern yunnan the nanpanjiang river a headwater of the pearl river divides the etc ranges of 3 3 3 8 and 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in northeastern yunnan the wumeng mountains which run northeast to southwest divide the etc ranges of 3 3 3 8 and 3 8 4 2 mm d 1 in western yunnan the rice etc run in strips from north to south which is in good agreement with the terrain of the hengduan mountains running from north to south in this area 3 2 3 impact of three dimensional climate on etc within the same range the etc may change abruptly in other words the etc in a certain sub area may be higher or lower than that in the surrounding areas this is mainly influenced by meteorological factors table 8 shows that etc is significantly correlated with temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and rainfall except wind speed and elevation relative humidity has a significant relationship with rainfall sunshine hours and wind speed and rainfall affects temperature and sunshine hours the causes of the abrupt change of etc are not the same it can be seen from fig 3 that the etc of rice in the nujiang huaping yuanmou and yuanjiang stations are significantly higher than those of the surrounding areas in the same range this is mainly because the leeward slopes of mountains have foehn winds and prevent cold air the foehn wind effect is a situation in which after the air passes over and down the leeward slope of a mountain adiabatic warming occurs and the air drops as a result the temperature at the foot on the leeward slope of the mountain is significantly high making them climatic enclaves beyond latitudinal zonality in the north tropical zone the four climatic enclaves are located in the nu river valley nujiang station jinsha river valley huaping and yuanmou stations and yuan river valley yuanjiang station fig 1 unlike the climate enclaves the etc at some stations such as the tengchong yuxi jiangcheng pingbian and simao stations were lower than those in areas surrounding the stations the reasons for these differences vary per station the tengchong station is located on the western slope of the gaoligong mountains which run north to south i e a windward slope of warm and moist air in southwestern china therefore at this station it is usually cloudy and rainy and the temperature is low in addition at the foot of the gentle western slope is the curved qushi basin which allows cold air to come in easily but makes it difficult for it to leave the cold lake effect is obvious the low etc of the yuxi station is also the result of the cold lake effect the yuxi station is surrounded by mountains and thereby has a concave landform the average annual temperature is only 12 c in the jiangcheng pingbian and simao stations the altitude is low because of the influence of the southwest warm and moist airflow in the warmer half of the year it is wet and rainy at these three stations and fewer hours of sunshine occur there than in other parts of yunnan province 3 3 spatial distribution regularities and influencing factors of the iq 3 3 1 spatial distribution of the iq according to the calculating method of rice iq in this study the average rice iq of all weather stations for the study years were obtained the contour map drawn by the gis inverse distance weighting method for the average iq at various stations for the study years was shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the distribution regularity of the contour lines of rice iq of all stations is obvious as it was with the etc the iq decreases from the dry hot river valley areas where the yuanmou and yuanjiang stations are located with distance from these areas the yuanmou station had the largest iq with an average value of 743 5 mm for the study years the iq at the yuanjiang station was 672 2 mm southern yunnan had the smallest iq at the jiangcheng station the iq was only 180 mm as almost no irrigation except for steeping is required within the rice growth period the iq of the yuanmou station is fourfold larger than that of the jiangcheng station presenting a large spatial difference overall the iq are distributed like belts however abrupt changes in iq occur in some places a typical example of this is in southern yunnan where the iq within a small area changes abruptly from a value of approximately 700 mm to the minimum value of yunnan the iq varied greatly from year to year owing to the large variation in precipitation between years and the impact of other climatic conditions on the etc different rainfall frequencies generally are used to represent the dryness of a typical year however to avoid the influence of uneven rainfall during the year in this study the rainfall frequencies during the rice growth period were ranked to obtain the iq of 36 stations for three categories of hydrological year normal years the rainfall frequency is 50 dry years the rainfall frequency is 75 very dry years the rainfall frequency is 90 the contour map drawn by the gis inverse distance weighting method for the average daily iq of rice for the different hydrological years was shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 4 that the multiyear average annual iq is close to the iq of the normal year fig 5a at each station rainfall exerts the greatest influence on the iq of the yuanjiang station with the iq of the very dry year 142 5 mm higher than the multiyear average annual iq rainfall has no effect on the iq of the jiangcheng station at this station rice does not need to be irrigated during the rice growth period because of extremely heavy rainfall and the iq is only the amount of water needed during the steeping stage the rice iq in the normal year fig 5a is smaller than the multiyear average iq fig 4 in southwestern and southeast yunnan greater than the multiyear average iq in northwestern and northeastern yunnan and almost the same as the multiyear average iq in central yunnan from fig 5a it can be seen that yunnan province is subject to greater spatial variability in rice iq and has a more obvious gradient in iq in the normal year in the dry year fig 5b the iq of rice is obviously greater than in the normal year and the area with greater iq largely increases however comparing the dry and very dry years fig 5c the increase of iq mainly occurred in southwestern and northeastern yunnan the gradient difference of the iq contour map is not obvious between these two hydrological years 3 3 2 impact of the channel barrier effect on the iq influenced by the direction of mountains in yunnan province rainfall is greater in the south than in the north during the rice growth period fig 6 and the rice iq is significantly affected primarily the hengduan and gaoligong mountains thomas 1993 rainfall in yunnan mainly comes from the streams of warm and moist air from the bay of bengal in the southwest indian ocean and from the southeast from south to north the air streams pass over mountains and condense into clouds and rain in addition most of the southern part of the province is located in the windward slope of warm and moist air and thereby receives ample rainfall the hengduan mountains one after another block the streams of warm and moist air coming from the west therefore the rainfall decreases continuously from west to east until the air streams arrive at the central area the central area receives the minimum rainfall the tengchong and baoshan stations for example are located on the west and east sides of the gaoligong mountains with altitudes of 1654 6 and 1653 5 m respectively their straight line distance is 68 km during the growth period of rice the rainfall is 1061 2 mm at the tengchong station but only 652 7 mm at the baoshan station with the steeping quota deducted the iq during the rice growth period is 203 6 mm at the baoshan station but only 65 6 mm at the tengchong station in addition to the longitudinal barriers such as the hengduan mountains the deep river valleys in this area such as the lancang nu and jinsha river valleys are also apparent barriers to the distribution of surface hydrothermal conditions in the river valley in the east west direction forming typical dryhot valleys climate yunnan has three typical dry hot valleys i e yuanmou yuanjiang and jinghong where the extreme maximum temperature exceeds 41 c they are known as yunnan s three stove areas these valley areas are generally hot and dry year round and thereby have large iq besides these valleys also have significant channeling and diffusion effects in the north south direction cold air from the qinghai tibet plateau flows southward along these channels and meets the southwestern warm and moist air in the southern part of the longitudinal valley region to form a local wind water belt including jiangcheng station ruili station mengding station and lancang station the rainfall during the rice growth period in this area exceeds 1000 mm fig 6 and the net iq is generally below 100 mm 3 3 3 impact of the three dimensional climate on the iq it can be seen from table 9 in addition to rainfall other meteorological factors and elevation have a certain effect on iq the results show that the wind speed and sunshine hours are positively correlated with the iq mainly because the higher the wind speed is the smaller the rainfall and the larger the sunshine time is the greater the etc table 8 the relative humidity increases with the increase of rainfall and has a significant negative correlation with the iq the higher the altitude is the less the sunshine hours the lower the temperature the larger the iq however the influence of temperature on iq is more complex under normal circumstances rice in low temperature areas needs little water and the iq is small the temperature is lower in northwestern and northeastern yunnan than in southern yunnan however the rice iq is higher this is mainly due to the higher rainfall in southern yunnan overall the iq in high temperature areas are smaller than in low temperature areas fig 4 and table 9 another reason is that rice in low temperature areas has a longer growth period mahmood 1997 the growth period of mid season rice is about 120 days in southern yunnan but 150 days in northeastern and northwestern yunnan for example the rice growth period of the sanyi station is 23 days longer than that of the xizhou station table 3 thus the rice growth period exceeds the length of the rainy season meaning water can be provided through irrigation only subsequently increasing the rice iq dry hot valley areas possess the highest iq in yunnan province owing to their long sunshine hours and low rainfall 3 4 uncertainties affecting etc and iq there is a large variety of rice in yunnan with the continuous rice growing behavior and the influence of the market technologies and government policies rice varieties are constantly changing in this study it was hypothesized that the rice variety at each station would not change over the study years for the rice growth period this study fixed the dates of transplanting and harvesting for each station which is nearly impossible in reality with global climate change especially the rising temperature and the climate change during the year rice transplanting and maturity periods are also changing which was not considered in this study with the shortage of water resources and the progress of science and technology many water saving irrigation technologies have been used for rice cultivation in some irrigation areas the use of such technologies will reduce the rice etc and iq lahue et al 2016 mao 2001 xu et al 2017 in yunnan province maybe water saving irrigation technologies are adopted in some areas the rice etc and iq in these areas may be different from that calculated under traditional flood irrigation table 2 in this study yunnan has a great diversity of soil types however the soil physical and chemical properties in this area have yet to be characterized fully in particular the soil water retention which has great influence on the iq varies greatly with the soil type even for the same soil type the slope and groundwater level can affect soil water retention this may have an effect on the actual iq of rice in yunnan province 4 conclusions when studying the impacts of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate on rice etc and iq in some area with changeable climate and terrain such as yunnan with wide agro ecological variation it is essential to account for spatial variability the outputs from spatial assessments with gis can complement more detailed site specific study which can benefit from long run historical climate datasets in this study the k c approach recommended by fao was used to calculate the rice etc in yunnan province and then the iq was calculated owing to the special topographic and climatic conditions in yunnan province the spatial variability of rice etc and iq is significant under the influence of the channel barrier effect and three dimensional climate and the channel barrier effect is dominant compared with the three dimensional climate by changing the course and process of warm and moist air mountains and valleys affect the formation of rainfall and the distribution of water and heat conditions subsequently dividing the rice etc and iq into multiple channels the rice etc and iq vary greatly between different channels and slightly in the same channel the run and trend lines of the mountains and valleys have become the boundaries of rice etc and iq the three dimensional climate mainly influences the local rice etc and iq which causes abrupt changes in the rice etc and iq within a certain range temperature and rainfall are the most critical elements in the three dimensional climate in addition to directly affecting the rice etc the temperature will affect the length of rice growth and influence the iq while the rainfall will directly affect the distribution of iq other factors such as rice varieties irrigation modes and soil physical and chemical properties need to be

11267,frequent spring droughts and nitrogen n fertilizer overuse limit rain fed maize production in northeast china however the interactions between water stress and n rates on maize seedling growth

great transitions in diet structure tilman et al 2011 maize zea mays l has overtaken wheat and rice and become the most important staple food crop in china and many other countries fao 2017 playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring food security and socio economic stability the northeast plain nep is the major maize production zone of china almost 40 of the farmland is sown for maize cultivation and accounting for approximately 1 3 of the national total maize production most of the maize fields are under rain fed cultivation in the nep therefore seasonal drought stress has been the largest limitation to maize production in this region during recent decades causing 33 maize yields loss and even with no harvests at maturity in the extreme drought years zhang 2004 zhang et al 2011a yin et al 2016 in the nep maize yields are more sensitive to drought stress at the milky mature stage than other growing stages guo et al 2017 nevertheless the frequency of drought occurrence is highest at the seedling stage which often limits maize emergence and seedling growth and even inducing irreversible damage and final yield losses zhang et al 2011a drought stress affects maize seedling growth via inducing various changes in morphology physiology and chemistry in plants in general soil drought induced water and nutrient absorption reduction in root systems leaf rolling and decreased leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance further limits photosynthesis and assimilate translocation and thus resulting in lower growth rate and plant dry biomass dm reduction banziger et al 2000 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2011b in addition to drought stress n fertilizer management is another important challenge in maize production of nep a single basal application of excessive n fertilizer has been increasingly favored by farmers in local maize production due to the increasing labor shortages and inconvenient topdressings at later stage gao et al 2012 yin et al 2014 however overuse of n fertilizer at seedling stage may leads to excessive vegetative growth with a greater plant size and larger leaf area thus increasing superfluous water and energy consumption and also inducing more n leaching and gaseous loss to the environment peng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 rudnick et al 2017 in the context of global climate warming the frequency of drought events will increase dramatically in most regions of the nep because of increasing temperature and declining precipitation yin et al 2016 predictably maize production will likely suffer more frequent and severe spring droughts in these regions which may also have large impacts on plant growth and n utilization of maize seedling therefore it is necessary to investigate appropriate water and n management strategies with adaption to drought stress at the seedling stage to optimize maize vegetative growth and improve wue and nue root system play a crucial role in plant growth and productivity enabling plants to anchor themselves tightly in the soil substrate and to forage their environment for water and nutrients ristova and busch 2014 during the vegetative growth period root development and architecture display considerable plasticity in response to the heterogeneous distribution of soil water and nutrients resources eapen et al 2005 yu et al 2014 and also in turn have significant influences on water and nutrient acquisition and plant growth at late period hodge et al 2009 lynch 1995 many studies have found that more photosynthetic product is transported to root system both under drought and low n stress aiming to improve root growth and enhance water and nutrient absorption via producing higher root length more fine root and deeper root distribution in soil profile mu et al 2015 oikeh et al 1999 sharp and davies 1985 trachsel et al 2013 by conducting a controlled slight soil water deficit at the early growing period based on water saving irrigation technique such as regulated deficit irrigation or alternate partial root zone irrigation methods maize seedling experiences stress training and enhances plant drought resistance thus could be better adapted to later drought stress during the growing season ultimately with more effective nutrient uptake wue and grain yield pandey et al 2000 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 by optimizing n fertilizer management

plant resistance to drought stress muschietti piana et al 2018 peng et al 2012 trachsel et al 2013 rudnick et al 2017 moreover numerous studies have indicated the interactive effects of soil water and n management on maize growth grain yield and n uptake at various stages bennett et al 1989 hokam et al 2011 wang et al 2008 yin et al 2014 significant water n interactions on actual evapotranspiration et and soil profile water extraction pattern were also observed in maize by lenka et al 2009 however in several other studies chilundo et al 2017 gheysari et al 2009 rudnick et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the interactions between irrigation and n management are not observed in maize growth and wue especially not in root morphology and distribution chilundo et al 2017 as yet it is less clear how the interaction between soil water and n management affects maize root growth and morphology in relation to plant drought resistance soil water consumption wue and nue the objectives of this study are to investigate the interactive effects of soil water stress and n rates on maize root morphology and distribution at the seedling stage and explore the relationships between root morphology and drought resistance wue and nue of maize plant the results would provide important references for soil water n management strategies in maize production of nep and other rain fed cropping regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials the pot experiment was conducted from june to july 2016 under a large rain shelter with natural light and temperature conditions in an experimental greenhouse at the key laboratory of sustainable utilization of soil resources in the commodity grain bases of jilin province jilin agricultural university changchun china 43 48 29 n 125 24 50 e this area has semi humid continental monsoon climate and had average monthly temperatures of 16 8 c in june and 22 1 c in july during the experimental period which were slightly higher than the long term averages 1985 2015 of 15 6 c in june and 20 9 c in july the experimental soil type is black soil i e mollisol usda soil taxonomy with a clay loam texture moderately high organic matter content and inherent fertility has a ph of 6 6 total n of 1 7 g kg 1 olsen p of 13 8 mg kg 1 exchangeable k of 130 9 mg kg 1 soil organic matter content of 2 6 g kg 1 and soil water content at field capacity of 21 4 on the mass basis the soil was naturally air dried and sieved passing through 5 mm mesh before filling into experimental pots maize plants zd958 a dominant hybrid in china were grown in plastic pots 42 cm in diameter and 45 cm in height fig 1 filled with 55 kg of air dried soil per pot the soil depth of each experimental pot was approximately 36 cm which could fully meet the root system growth during the experimental period oikeh et al 1999 trachsel et al 2013 moreover approximately 4 cm thick clastic rocks were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand to prevent waterlogging in the subsoil in each pot a maize seedling was planted in the middle and three pvc tubes 2 cm in diameter with holes were installed along the pot wall at equidistant intervals to avoid surface soil hardening and to simulate the water status of the soil profile in field 2 2 experimental design and implementation the experimental treatments included three n fertilization rates and three soil water levels this experimental plan yielded 9 treatments i e 3 3 and each treatment was replicated four times with a total of 36 pots the three n fertilization rates included 0 0 12 and 0 24 g n per kg dry soil representing n omission n0 low n ln and high n hn respectively in addition to the n supply 0 15 g p2o5 0 15 g k2o and 0 02 g znso4 per kg dry soil were applied to meet the maize nutrient requirement for successful vegetative growth nitrogen fertilizer was supplied as urea 46 n and p and k were applied as triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 and muriate of potash 60 k2o respectively all the fertilizers were applied and mixed into the soil in powdered forms at the commencement of the experiment the three soil water levels were 30 50 and 70 of field capacity representing severe water stress ss moderate water stress ms and well watered ww conditions respectively maize seeds were sown on 7 june 2016 with three sprouting seeds in each pot one plant per pot at the middle of the pots was chosen for uniformity on 20 june at the v2 stage the soil water regimes in all the pots were initiated on 29 june at the v4 stage and lasted 2 weeks to the v6 v7 stage before the soil water was controlled the soil water regimes in all pots were maintained under ww i e 70 of field capacity during the experimental period the soil water content was controlled to the target level by weighing the pot and irrigating with tap water every day or every two days the weighing intervals depended on weather condition soil water status and crop growth performance 2 3 sampling and measurements the maize plants were harvested on 12 july when the 2 weeks soil water regimes ended shoot plants were destructively taken from all four pots in each treatment and the leaves and stems were harvested separately the samples were first oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then at 70 c until a constant weight to obtain shoot dm before shoot sampling leaf relative water content rwc was measured in the three fully expanded leaves from the top of the maize plant leaf rolling is a typical plant phenotypic response to water deficit which is associated with lower leaf water potential and higher leaf temperature fernandez and castrillo 1999 the leaf rolling score was estimated in this study according to the classification and visual leaf rolling performances described by banziger et al 2000 to indicate plant response to drought stress the leaf rolling score included five levels the specific classification criteria of leaf performances were plotted as level 1 leaf is unrolled and turgid level 2 leaf rim starting to roll level 3 leaf has a shape of a v level 4 rolled leaf rim covers part of leaf blade and level 5 leaf is rolled like an onion the dried shoot samples were ground and sifted through a 0 5 mm griddle to analyze the total n concentration using an automatic kjeldahl apparatus k1100f haineng china then shoot n uptake and nue were calculated as follow shoot n uptake shoot dm n concentration in shoot plant nue snuf snu0 n rate where snuf and snu0 are the shoot n uptake in the treatments with and without n fertilization respectively the roots were sampled using the method described in fig 1 to investigate the root vertical distribution in the soil profile the entire soil vertical section in each pot was divided into six layers i e z axis direction with a thickness of 6 cm and each soil layer was horizontally cut to seven cores i e x axis direction with a width of 6 cm thus the vertical section area of the soil core was consistent in each root sampling unit and was 6 cm 6 cm i e x axis width z axis height obviously the soil core volumes were different across the various sampling units in the same soil layer due to their altered lengths in the y axis direction fig 1 root sampling was conducted layer by layer from the top to the bottom of each experimental pot by manually using a sharp blade the mixture of roots and soil in each soil core was collected into a 100 mesh nylon bag and then submerged in water for 30 min then the root samples were washed with tap water and the impurities were removed the cleaned root samples in each soil core were scanned with an epson perfection v700 photo flatbed scanner seiko epson corp nagano japan subsequently the acquired photos were analyzed by using winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec canada to obtain root morphology parameters in each soil core including root length root surface area and root volume then the root samples were oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight to obtain root

ratio were observed both under different soil water levels and n rates at the seedling stage fig 2 moreover soil water levels and n rates showed significant interactive effects on shoot root and total dm but not on the r s ratio soil water stress significantly reduced plant dm accumulation at the seedling stage especially under the ss condition compared with ww treatments on average the total dm was reduced by 56 8 in ss treatments and 23 0 in ms treatments nitrogen fertilization significantly increased plant dm across all the soil water levels however the dm responses to n fertilization were obviously affected by soil water conditions compared with the n0 treatment the dm increase in total plant was 9 4 g in ln treatment and 10 6 g in hn treatment under the ss condition the increases were 27 8 and 28 9 g plant 1 under the ms condition respectively and 60 5 and 53 3 g plant 1 under the ww condition respectively obviously the total dm had greater responses to n fertilization with increasing soil water content and similar trends were also observed in the n fertilization responses of shoot and root dm across the different soil water conditions these results indicated the significant interactions between soil water levels and n rates on plant dm at the seedling stage across all the water n treatments in this study the highest dm in shoot root and total plant were simultaneously obtained in the ww ln treatment while the lowest values were simultaneously observed in the ss n0 treatment regardless of n rates the averaged r s ratio was 0 16 0 19 and 0 18 in ss ms and ww treatments respectively fig 2 compared with the ww treatment although there was no significant difference the r s ratio did show an increased trend in the ms treatment but the r s ratio decreased significantly in the ss treatment when analyzed across the soil water levels the r s ratio showed significant decline with increasing n rates on average the r s ratio was 0 20 0 18 and 0 16 in n0 ln and hn treatments respectively overall compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment have equal or higher dm and r s ratio under soil water stress 3 2 root system morphology soil water levels and n rates showed significant individual and interactive effects on root morphology including root length root surface area and root volume at the seedling stage table 1 across all the water n treatments both the greatest root length and root surface area were observed in the ww ln treatment while the highest root volume was found in the ww hn treatment these root morphology parameters were simultaneously the lowest in the ss hn treatment the root morphology responses to n rates differed under the different soil water levels root length decreased with increasing n rates under the ss and ms conditions while it had the highest value in the ln treatment under the ww condition root surface area in n0 treatment was highest under the ss condition but lowest under the ww condition and it had no difference among various n rates under the ms condition root volume was equal among the n rates under the ss condition but followed the order of ln hn n0 under the ms condition and hn ln n0 under the ww condition srl as the ratio of root length to root dm could be a proxy for root diameter based on the assumption that fine root systems or higher srl smaller diameter have a lower dm than the root systems with lower srl larger diameter oikeh et al 1999 in this study a significant difference was observed in srl under the different n rates at the seedling stage but soil water levels and the water n interaction had no significant effects on srl table 1 across the soil water levels srls were significantly lower in n fertilization treatments than that in n0 treatment indicating that maize roots had larger diameter when n fertilizer was applied although there was no statistically difference but the srls in ln treatments were slightly higher than those in the hn treatments 3 3 root system distribution figs 3 4 shows the isogram distributions of maize rdmd and rld respectively in the 0 36 cm soil profile obviously both soil water levels and n rates had strong influences on the spatial distributions of maize rdmd and rld in the soil profile at the seedling stage across all the water n treatments the ss ln treatment showed an optimal root distribution with a mean of 0 25 mg cm 3 in rdmd and 0 30 cm cm 3 in rld respectively and its root penetration scale was larger and deeper than the other water stress treatments throughout the soil layers soil water stress resulted in smaller concentration regions both in the rdmd and rld due to the limited root growth across the n rates the average rdmd was 0 21 mg cm 3 in ms treatment and 0 10 mg cm 3 in ss treatment which were 19 9 and 62 2 lower than that in the ww treatment 0 26 mg cm 3 respectively the average rld was 0 29 cm cm 3 in ms treatment and 0 19 mg cm 3 in ss treatment the reductions were 35 8 and 58 2 compared that in ww treatment 0 45 cm cm 3 respectively in addition the concentrated points values of rdmd as shown by the solid arrows in fig 3 followed the order of ms ww ss but that of rld followed the order of ww ms ss fig 4 compared with the soil water factor n input factor had a greater influence on the vertical distribution of rdmd and rld and root distribution responses to n rates altered with changing soil water levels figs 3 4 in the n0 treatments both the concentration regions of rdmd and rld were mainly located in the deeper soil 18 30 cm and showed narrower horizontal extension indicating that maize root system generated a deeper distribution with steeper growth angles under the low n supply conditions when n fertilizer was applied the concentration regions of rdmd enlarged obviously and concentrated heavily into the topsoil layer especially under the ww conditions fig 3 the concentrated point values of rdmd were much higher in ln than hn treatments unlike with rdmd the concentration regions of rld mainly moved up to the 6 18 cm soil layer after applying n fertilizer and the distribution responses to n rates obviously altered under different soil water levels fig 4 the rld showed larger concentration region scales and higher concentrated point values in n0 than n fertilization treatments under the ss and ms conditions but the results were opposite under the ww condition moreover the concentration region scales of rld were larger and the concentrated point values were also higher in ln than hn treatments especially under the ms condition 3 4 water and n characteristics in plant both soil water levels and n rates had significant individual effects on leaf rolling score leaf rwc pwc wue shoot n uptake and nue and the two factors also showed significant interactive effects on above parameters except for leaf rwc table 2 soil water stress induced a significant decrease in rwc pwc and shoot n uptake and resulted in a severe rolling performance in maize leaves especially under the ss condition maize plants showed lower leaf rwc in the n fertilization treatment than n0 treatment however n fertilization increased significantly pwc and shoot n uptake as well as the leaf rolling score especially in the hn treatment similar to shoot dm the pwc and shoot n uptake showed greater responses to n rates with increasing soil water levels across all the water n treatments the highest leaf rolling score was obtained in the ss hn treatment followed by ss ln treatment and no leaf rolling was observed in the ww treatments the highest pwc and shoot n uptake were simultaneously obtained in the ww hn treatment while the lowest values were found in the ss n0 treatment in terms of nue and wue the highest values were obtained in the ww ln and ms ln treatments respectively while the lowest values were observed in the ss hn and ww n0 treatments respectively the wue followed the same sequences of ln hn n0 under the ms and ww conditions but no difference was observed among the different n rates under the ss condition the nue was higher in ln than hn treatments regardless of soil water conditions but the nue gap between two n fertilization treatments obviously increased with increasing soil water levels 3 5 relationships between root growth and plant resistance wue and nue in this study a significant negative linear relationship was observed between leaf rolling score and leaf rwc across the water n treatments fig 5 however no relationship was observed between wue and nue across the n fertilization treatments both the nue and pwc showed significant positive exponential relationships with leaf rwc and they showed significant negative logarithmic relationships with leaf rolling score in contrast wue showed significant parabolic relationships both with leaf rolling score and leaf rwc these relationships revealed that maize plants with higher drought resistance tended to have higher nue and pwc at the seedling stage and might be associated with a lower wue when dm production was limited by n deficiency as shown in fig 6 across all the water n treatments significant negative logarithmic relationships were observed in the leaf rolling score with root dm root length root surface area and root volume while significant positive logarithmic relationships were found in the leaf rwc with these parameters both the leaf rolling score and leaf rwc showed strong relationships with root length and root surface area but they had moderate relationships with root dm and root volume unlike with leaf rolling score and leaf rwc pwc showed significant and quite strong positive linear relationships with all the above parameters for nue it showed significant positive exponential relationships with all these parameters and the correlations were strong except for root volume 4 discussion drought and low n stress are the major limiting environmental factors in maize production worldwide and thus have received significant attention banziger et al 2000 lynch 2013 mi et al 2010 sharp et al 2004 kang et al 2017 many studies have found the significant individual and interactive effects of soil water and n fertilizer management on maize growth grain yield and n uptake but the water n interactive effects on root growth and wue are not well explained or understood the results obtained in this study confirmed the significant water n interactive effects on maize seedling growth root morphology and distribution as well as the wue and nue these results may give an insight into the complicated water n interaction on crop growth and resource utilization and also might provide an agronomic strategy for drought stricken crops to cope with the future climatic change numerous studies have found that both soil water and n fertilization greatly affect dm accumulation and allocation in maize plants at various growth stages anderson 1988 benjamin et al 2014 bennett et al 1989 gheysari et al 2009 in this study in addition to individual effects significant interactive effects were observed in maize plant dm accumulation under different soil water levels and n rates at the seedling stage similar interactive effect of water n management was also reported by bennett et al 1989 for maize dm accumulation throughout the growing season the previous studies showed that maize plants generally had higher r s ratios when experiencing drought stress due to increased dm allocation into roots to improve root growth and water acquisition benjamin et al 2014 mi et al 2010 in this study the r s ratio did show an increased trend under the ms condition however it decreased significantly under the ss condition this may be the result of an extreme limitation in photosynthate translocation from shoot to root under severe soil drought the response of r s ratio to n fertilization were consistent with the previous results anderson 1988 showing an obvious decrease trend with increasing n rates this indicates that reducing basal n supply has positive influence on improving dm allocation into roots so to cope with the drought stress effect at the seedling stage root morphology has strong plasticity in the response to the availability of both water and mineral nutrients in the soil eapen et al 2005 yu et al 2014 many studies have found that soil water and n management had significant individual effects on maize root morphology oikeh et al 1999 peng et al 2012 sharp and davies 1985 our results are concurrent with the above findings and further indicated the significant water n interactive effects on root morphology moreover significant relationships were observed in root morphology parameters with leaf rolling rwc pwc and nue indicating the key roles of root growth and morphology in improving plant drought resistance soil water acquisition and n utilization of maize plant at the seedling stage in addition to root morphology the spatial distribution of root systems in a soil profile also has a significant influence on soil water and nutrient absorption and thus affects crop growth and productivity amato and ritchie 2002 in general deeper root distribution is considered as a key characteristic of the ideotype maize root system architecture which optimizes water and n capture throughout the whole soil strata lynch 2013 mi et al 2010 in this study obvious differences were observed in root system distribution under different water n treatments maize seedling formed deeper root distribution characteristics with steeper growth angle in the n0 treatments in the contrast the distribution region of root system showed large vertical shift and concentrated heavily into the topsoil layer when n fertilizer was applied the similar changes in maize root architecture affected by soil water management regimes and or n rates also have been observed at the other growing stages chilundo et al 2017 oikeh et al 1999 sharp and davies 1985 trachsel et al 2013 mu et al 2015 compared with the other water n treatments in this study maize plants in ms ln treatment showed an optimal root distribution characterizing by larger and deeper penetration scale with higher root length density throughout the soil layers and thus showed fewer drought responses and obtained the higher wue and nue interestingly although maize growth and n uptake in the n0 treatment was much weaker than those in n fertilization treatments the plants showed obviously slighter leaf rolling under soil water stress conditions this was mainly attributed to the deeper root distribution and the lower evapotranspiration from the stunted plant n fertilization increased not only shoot n uptake but also pwc and wue the results were consistent with those observed by lenka et al 2009 and pandey et al 2000 because n fertilization improved plant growth with a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rate consequently increased plant water requirement and et rudnick et al 2017 however when drought stress occurred the larger leaf area and higher et resulted in more water loss meanwhile the shallower root distribution reduced the water absorption from soil therefore maize plant in n fertilization treatments showed lower substantially leaf rwc and more severe leaf rolling compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment showed fewer leaf rolling responses due to the lower pwc and deeper root distribution under soil water stress and thus obtained significantly higher wue and nue therefore reducing basal n rate was suggested to optimize root growth morphology and distribution to improve maize seedling growth and plant resistance under drought stress a similar conclusion was also presented by gheysari et al 2009 based on a 2 year field experiment in which they found that plant dm responses to n rates depended on soil water availability and that n rate should be decreased under drought stress 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the significant and complex interactions between soil water levels and n rates on dm leaf rolling nue wue root morphology and distribution of maize plants at the seedling stage by conducting a pot experiment in northeast china the dual stress of drought and n deficiency in the ss ln treatment severely limited maize growth and n uptake but maize plant showed slight leaf rolling under soil water stress due to deeper root distribution and lower water consumption from the stunted plant the responses of maize plant performance to n rates obviously differed under the different soil water levels compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization significantly improved maize growth increased dm n uptake pwc and wue under soil water stress although the plant dm and the absorption of water and n were still much lower than those under the ww condition and that n fertilization aggravated leaf rolling in maize plant when drought stress occurred especially under the ss condition which was mainly due to the higher pwc and shallower root distribution however compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment developed greater root dm and root length with more fine roots and generated a larger penetration scale throughout the soil layers absorbed more soil water and n and thus showing fewer drought responses and higher wue and nue under soil water stress in contrast high n supply had no advantage for dm accumulation in maize plant but in turn limited root growth and extension in the soil profile eventually resulting in higher water and n resource depletion and lower use efficiencies especially under the ss condition across all the water n treatments ms ln treatment showed optimal root morphology and distribution in the soil and thereby obtained the highest wue and nue under soil water stress in conclusion the results in this study suggest reducing basal n rate to optimize root growth morphology and distribution at the seedling stage in the rain fed maize production to enhance plant drought resistance and improve nue and wue especially under slight to moderate soil water stress acknowledgements this work was supported by the

11267,frequent spring droughts and nitrogen n fertilizer overuse limit rain fed maize production in northeast china however the interactions between water stress and n rates on maize seedling growth

moderate water stress ms and well watered ww conditions for 2 week from 4 leaf stage dry biomass dm leaf rolling performance water use efficiency wue n fertilizer use efficiency nue root morphology and distribution were evaluated it was showed that soil water levels and n rates had significant individual and interactive effects on most measured parameters the dual stress of drought and n deficiency severely limited maize growth and n uptake nitrogen fertilization improved maize growth n uptake and wue under water stress however compared with hn treatment ln treatment had less water consumption higher leaf relative water content and less leaf rolling symptom both under the ms and ss conditions the reason is that ln enhanced root growth and elongation with more fine roots especially in deep soil notably maize plants in ms ln treatment had an optimal root distribution characterized by higher root length density 0 30 cm cm 3 larger and deeper penetration scale throughout the soil layers and thus showed fewer drought responses and obtained the highest wue 4 1 g l 1 and nue 17 2 among all the water stress treatments in contrast hn limited root growth and extension in

great transitions in diet structure tilman et al 2011 maize zea mays l has overtaken wheat and rice and become the most important staple food crop in china and many other countries fao 2017 playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring food security and socio economic stability the northeast plain nep is the major maize production zone of china almost 40 of the farmland is sown for maize cultivation and accounting for approximately 1 3 of the national total maize production most of the maize fields are under rain fed cultivation in the nep therefore seasonal drought stress has been the largest limitation to maize production in this region during recent decades causing 33 maize yields loss and even with no harvests at maturity in the extreme drought years zhang 2004 zhang et al 2011a yin et al 2016 in the nep maize yields are more sensitive to drought stress at the milky mature stage than other growing stages guo et al 2017 nevertheless the frequency of drought occurrence is highest at the seedling stage which often limits maize emergence and seedling growth and even inducing irreversible damage and final yield losses zhang et al 2011a drought stress affects maize seedling growth via inducing various changes in morphology physiology and chemistry in plants in general soil drought induced water and nutrient absorption reduction in root systems leaf rolling and decreased leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance further limits photosynthesis and assimilate translocation and thus resulting in lower growth rate and plant dry biomass dm reduction banziger et al 2000 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2011b in addition to drought stress n fertilizer management is another important challenge in maize production of nep a single basal application of excessive n fertilizer has been increasingly favored by farmers in local maize production due to the increasing labor shortages and inconvenient topdressings at later stage gao et al 2012 yin et al 2014 however overuse of n fertilizer at seedling stage may leads to excessive vegetative growth with a greater plant size and larger leaf area thus increasing superfluous water and energy consumption and also inducing more n leaching and gaseous loss to the environment peng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 rudnick et al 2017 in the context of global climate warming the frequency of drought events will increase dramatically in most regions of the nep because of increasing temperature and declining precipitation yin et al 2016 predictably maize production will likely suffer more frequent and severe spring droughts in these regions which may also have large impacts on plant growth and n utilization of maize seedling therefore it is necessary to investigate appropriate water and n management strategies with adaption to drought stress at the seedling stage to optimize maize vegetative growth and improve wue and nue root system play a crucial role in plant growth and productivity enabling plants to anchor themselves tightly in the soil substrate and to forage their environment for water and nutrients ristova and busch 2014 during the vegetative growth period root development and architecture display considerable plasticity in response to the heterogeneous distribution of soil water and nutrients resources eapen et al 2005 yu et al 2014 and also in turn have significant influences on water and nutrient acquisition and plant growth at late period hodge et al 2009 lynch 1995 many studies have found that more photosynthetic product is transported to root system both under drought and low n stress aiming to improve root growth and enhance water and nutrient absorption via producing higher root length more fine root and deeper root distribution in soil profile mu et al 2015 oikeh et al 1999 sharp and davies 1985 trachsel et al 2013 by conducting a controlled slight soil water deficit at the early growing period based on water saving irrigation technique such as regulated deficit irrigation or alternate partial root zone irrigation methods maize seedling experiences stress training and enhances plant drought resistance thus could be better adapted to later drought stress during the growing season ultimately with more effective nutrient uptake wue and grain yield pandey et al 2000 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 by optimizing n fertilizer management methods maize seedling increase water and nutrient absorption via forming a strong and dense root system and deeper root distribution and thereby improve plant growth and nue and also improve enhance plant resistance to drought stress muschietti piana et al 2018 peng et al 2012 trachsel et al 2013 rudnick et al 2017 moreover numerous studies have indicated the interactive effects of soil water and n management on maize growth grain yield and n uptake at various stages bennett et al 1989 hokam et al 2011 wang et al 2008 yin et al 2014 significant water n interactions on actual evapotranspiration et and soil profile water extraction pattern were also observed in maize by lenka et al 2009 however in several other studies chilundo et al 2017 gheysari et al 2009 rudnick et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the interactions between irrigation and n management are not observed in maize growth and wue especially not in root morphology and distribution chilundo et al 2017 as yet it is less clear how the interaction between soil water and n management affects maize root growth and morphology in relation to plant drought resistance soil water consumption wue and nue the objectives of this study are to investigate the interactive effects of soil water stress and n rates on maize root morphology and distribution at the seedling stage and explore the relationships between root morphology and drought resistance wue and nue of maize plant the results would provide important references for soil water n management strategies in maize production of nep and other rain fed cropping regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials the pot experiment was conducted from june to july 2016 under a large rain shelter with natural light and temperature conditions in an experimental greenhouse at the key laboratory of sustainable utilization of soil resources in the commodity grain bases of jilin province jilin agricultural university changchun china 43 48 29 n 125 24 50 e this area has semi humid continental monsoon climate and had average monthly temperatures of 16 8 c in june and 22 1 c in july during the experimental period which were slightly higher than the long term averages 1985 2015 of 15 6 c in june and 20 9 c in july the experimental soil type is black soil i e mollisol usda soil taxonomy with a clay loam texture moderately high organic matter content and inherent fertility has a ph of 6 6 total n of 1 7 g kg 1 olsen p of 13 8 mg kg 1 exchangeable k of 130 9 mg kg 1 soil organic matter content of 2 6 g kg 1 and soil water content at field capacity of 21 4 on the mass basis the soil was naturally air dried and sieved passing through 5 mm mesh before filling into experimental pots maize plants zd958 a dominant hybrid in china were grown in plastic pots 42 cm in diameter and 45 cm in height fig 1 filled with 55 kg of air dried soil per pot the soil depth of each experimental pot was approximately 36 cm which could fully meet the root system growth during the experimental period oikeh et al 1999 trachsel et al 2013 moreover approximately 4 cm thick clastic rocks were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand to prevent waterlogging in the subsoil in each pot a maize seedling was planted in the middle and three pvc tubes 2 cm in diameter with holes were installed along the pot wall at equidistant intervals to avoid surface soil hardening and to simulate the water status of the soil profile in field 2 2 experimental design and implementation the experimental treatments included three n fertilization rates and three soil water levels this experimental plan yielded 9 treatments i e 3 3 and each treatment was replicated four times with a total of 36 pots the three n fertilization rates included 0 0 12 and 0 24 g n per kg dry soil representing n omission n0 low n ln and high n hn respectively in addition to the n supply 0 15 g p2o5 0 15 g k2o and 0 02 g znso4 per kg dry soil were applied to meet the maize nutrient requirement for successful vegetative growth nitrogen fertilizer was supplied as urea 46 n and p and k were applied as triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 and muriate of potash 60 k2o respectively all the fertilizers were applied and mixed into the soil in powdered forms at the commencement of the experiment the three soil water levels were 30 50 and 70 of field capacity representing severe water stress ss moderate water stress ms and well watered ww conditions respectively maize seeds were sown on 7 june 2016 with three sprouting seeds in each pot one plant per pot at the middle of the pots was chosen for uniformity on 20 june at the v2 stage the soil water regimes in all the pots were initiated on 29 june at the v4 stage and lasted 2 weeks to the v6 v7 stage before the soil water was controlled the soil water regimes in all pots were maintained under ww i e 70 of field capacity during the experimental period the soil water content was controlled to the target level by weighing the pot and irrigating with tap water every day or every two days the weighing intervals depended on weather condition soil water status and crop growth performance 2 3 sampling and measurements the maize plants were harvested on 12 july when the 2 weeks soil water regimes ended shoot plants were destructively taken from all four pots in each treatment and the leaves and stems were harvested separately the samples were first oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then at 70 c until a constant weight to obtain shoot dm before shoot sampling leaf relative water content rwc was measured in the three fully expanded leaves from the top of the maize plant leaf rolling is a typical plant phenotypic response to water deficit which is associated with lower leaf water potential and higher leaf temperature fernandez and castrillo 1999 the leaf rolling score was estimated in this study according to the classification and visual leaf rolling performances described by banziger et al 2000 to indicate plant response to drought stress the leaf rolling score included five levels the specific classification criteria of leaf performances were plotted as level 1 leaf is unrolled and turgid level 2 leaf rim starting to roll level 3 leaf has a shape of a v level 4 rolled leaf rim covers part of leaf blade and level 5 leaf is rolled like an onion the dried shoot samples were ground and sifted through a 0 5 mm griddle to analyze the total n concentration using an automatic kjeldahl apparatus k1100f haineng china then shoot n uptake and nue were calculated as follow shoot n uptake shoot dm n concentration in shoot plant nue snuf snu0 n rate where snuf and snu0 are the shoot n uptake in the treatments with and without n fertilization respectively the roots were sampled using the method described in fig 1 to investigate the root vertical distribution in the soil profile the entire soil vertical section in each pot was divided into six layers i e z axis direction with a thickness of 6 cm and each soil layer was horizontally cut to seven cores i e x axis direction with a width of 6 cm thus the vertical section area of the soil core was consistent in each root sampling unit and was 6 cm 6 cm i e x axis width z axis height obviously the soil core volumes were different across the various sampling units in the same soil layer due to their altered lengths in the y axis direction fig 1 root sampling was conducted layer by layer from the top to the bottom of each experimental pot by manually using a sharp blade the mixture of roots and soil in each soil core was collected into a 100 mesh nylon bag and then submerged in water for 30 min then the root samples were washed with tap water and the impurities were removed the cleaned root samples in each soil core were scanned with an epson perfection v700 photo flatbed scanner seiko epson corp nagano japan subsequently the acquired photos were analyzed by using winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec canada to obtain root morphology parameters in each soil core including root length root surface area and root volume then the root samples were oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight to obtain root

experimental pots at harvest liters no leakage occurred during plant growth in this experiment and the soil was air dried at the beginning of the experiment the swh was calculated by the actual soil

levels and their interactions on the measured variables were tested using one and two way anovas the means were compared using the least significant difference lsd test at a probability level of 0 05 when f values were significant regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between the measured parameters graphics on the vertical distribution of rld and rdmd in the soil profile

ratio were observed both under different soil water levels and n rates at the seedling stage fig 2 moreover soil water levels and n rates showed significant interactive effects on shoot root and total dm but not on the r s ratio soil water stress significantly reduced plant dm accumulation at the seedling stage especially under the ss condition compared with ww treatments on average the total dm was reduced by 56 8 in ss treatments and 23 0 in ms treatments nitrogen fertilization significantly increased plant dm across all the soil water levels however the dm responses to n fertilization were obviously affected by soil water conditions compared with the n0 treatment the dm increase in total plant was 9 4 g in ln treatment and 10 6 g in hn treatment under the ss condition the increases were 27 8 and 28 9 g plant 1 under the ms condition respectively and 60 5 and 53 3 g plant 1 under the ww condition respectively obviously the total dm had greater responses to n fertilization with increasing soil water content and similar trends were also observed in the n fertilization responses of shoot and root dm across the different soil water conditions these results indicated the significant interactions between soil water levels and n rates on plant dm at the seedling stage across all the water n treatments in this study the highest dm in shoot root and total plant were simultaneously obtained in the ww ln treatment while the lowest values were simultaneously observed in the ss n0 treatment regardless of n rates the averaged r s ratio was 0 16 0 19 and 0 18 in ss ms and ww treatments respectively fig 2 compared with the ww treatment although there was no significant difference the r s ratio did show an increased trend in the ms treatment but the r s ratio decreased significantly in the ss treatment when analyzed across the soil water levels the r s ratio showed significant decline with increasing n rates on average the r s ratio was 0 20 0 18 and 0 16 in n0 ln and hn treatments respectively overall compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment have equal or higher dm and r s ratio under soil water stress 3 2 root system morphology soil water levels and n rates showed significant individual and interactive effects on root morphology including root length root surface area and root volume at the seedling stage table 1 across all the water n treatments both the greatest root length and root surface area were observed in the ww ln treatment while the highest root volume was found in the ww hn treatment these root morphology parameters were simultaneously the lowest in the ss hn treatment the root morphology responses to n rates differed under the different soil water levels root length decreased with increasing n rates under the ss and ms conditions while it had the highest value in the ln treatment under the ww condition root surface area in n0 treatment was highest under the ss condition but lowest under the ww condition and it had no difference among various n rates under the ms condition root volume was equal among the n rates under the ss condition but followed the order of ln hn n0 under the ms condition and hn ln n0 under the ww condition srl as the ratio of root length to root dm could be a proxy for root diameter based on the assumption that fine root systems or higher srl smaller diameter have a lower dm than the root systems with lower srl larger diameter oikeh et al 1999 in this study a significant difference was observed in srl under the different n rates at the seedling stage but soil water levels and the water n interaction had no significant effects on srl table 1 across the soil water levels srls were significantly lower in n fertilization treatments than that in n0 treatment indicating that maize roots had larger diameter when n fertilizer was applied although there was no statistically difference but the srls in ln treatments were slightly higher than those in the hn treatments 3 3 root system distribution figs 3 4 shows the isogram distributions of maize rdmd and rld respectively in the 0 36 cm soil profile obviously both soil water levels and n rates had strong influences on the spatial distributions of maize rdmd and rld in the soil profile at the seedling stage across all the water n treatments the ss ln treatment showed an optimal root distribution with a mean of 0 25 mg cm 3 in rdmd and 0 30 cm cm 3 in rld respectively and its root penetration scale was larger and deeper than the other water stress treatments throughout the soil layers soil water stress resulted in smaller concentration regions both in the rdmd and rld due to the limited root growth across the n rates the average rdmd was 0 21 mg cm 3 in ms treatment and 0 10 mg cm 3 in ss treatment which were 19 9 and 62 2 lower than that in the ww treatment 0 26 mg cm 3 respectively the average rld was 0 29 cm cm 3 in ms treatment and 0 19 mg cm 3 in ss treatment the reductions were 35 8 and 58 2 compared that in ww treatment 0 45 cm cm 3 respectively in addition the concentrated points values of rdmd as shown by the solid arrows in fig 3 followed the order of ms ww ss but that of rld followed the order of ww ms ss fig 4 compared with the soil water factor n input factor had a greater influence on the vertical distribution of rdmd and rld and root distribution responses to n rates altered with changing soil water levels figs 3 4 in the n0 treatments both the concentration regions of rdmd and rld were mainly located in the deeper soil 18 30 cm and showed narrower horizontal extension indicating that maize root system generated a deeper distribution with steeper growth angles under the low n supply conditions when n fertilizer was applied the concentration regions of rdmd enlarged obviously and concentrated heavily into the topsoil layer especially under the ww conditions fig 3 the concentrated point values of rdmd were much higher in ln than hn treatments unlike with rdmd the concentration regions of rld mainly moved up to the 6 18 cm soil layer after applying n fertilizer and the distribution responses to n rates obviously altered under different soil water levels fig 4 the rld showed larger concentration region scales and higher concentrated point values in n0 than n fertilization treatments under the ss and ms conditions but the results were opposite under the ww condition moreover the concentration region scales of rld were larger and the concentrated point values were also higher in ln than hn treatments especially under the ms condition 3 4 water and n characteristics in plant both soil water levels and n rates had significant individual effects on leaf rolling score leaf rwc pwc wue shoot n uptake and nue and the two factors also showed significant interactive effects on above parameters except for leaf rwc table 2 soil water stress induced a significant decrease in rwc pwc and shoot n uptake and resulted in a severe rolling performance in maize leaves especially under the ss condition maize plants showed lower leaf rwc in the n fertilization treatment than n0 treatment however n fertilization increased significantly pwc and shoot n uptake as well as the leaf rolling score especially in the hn treatment similar to shoot dm the pwc and shoot n uptake showed greater responses to n rates with increasing soil water levels across all the water n treatments the highest leaf rolling score was obtained in the ss hn treatment followed by ss ln treatment and no leaf rolling was observed in the ww treatments the highest pwc and shoot n uptake were simultaneously obtained in the ww hn treatment while the lowest values were found in the ss n0 treatment in terms of nue and wue the highest values were obtained in the ww ln and ms ln treatments respectively while the lowest values were observed in the ss hn and ww n0 treatments respectively the wue followed the same sequences of ln hn n0 under the ms and ww conditions but no difference was observed among the different n rates under the ss condition the nue was higher in ln than hn treatments regardless of soil water conditions but the nue gap between two n fertilization treatments obviously increased with increasing soil water levels 3 5 relationships between root growth and plant resistance wue and nue in this study a significant negative linear relationship was observed between leaf rolling score and leaf rwc across the water n treatments fig 5 however no relationship was observed between wue and nue across the n fertilization treatments both the nue and pwc showed significant positive exponential relationships with leaf rwc and they showed significant negative logarithmic relationships with leaf rolling score in contrast wue showed significant parabolic relationships both with leaf rolling score and leaf rwc these relationships revealed that maize plants with higher drought resistance tended to have higher nue and pwc at the seedling stage and might be associated with a lower wue when dm production was limited by n deficiency as shown in fig 6 across all the water n treatments significant negative logarithmic relationships were observed in the leaf rolling score with root dm root length root surface area and root volume while significant positive logarithmic relationships were found in the leaf rwc with these parameters both the leaf rolling score and leaf rwc showed strong relationships with root length and root surface area but they had moderate relationships with root dm and root volume unlike with leaf rolling score and leaf rwc pwc showed significant and quite strong positive linear relationships with all the above parameters for nue it showed significant positive exponential relationships with all these parameters and the correlations were strong except for root volume 4 discussion drought and low n stress are the major limiting environmental factors in maize production worldwide and thus have received significant attention banziger et al 2000 lynch 2013 mi et al 2010 sharp et al 2004 kang et al 2017 many studies have found the significant individual and interactive effects of soil water and n fertilizer management on maize growth grain yield and n uptake but the water n interactive effects on root growth and wue are not well explained or understood the results obtained in this study confirmed the significant water n interactive effects on maize seedling growth root morphology and distribution as well as the wue and nue these results may give an insight into the complicated water n interaction on crop growth and resource utilization and also might provide an agronomic strategy for drought stricken crops to cope with the future climatic change numerous studies have found that both soil water and n fertilization greatly affect dm accumulation and allocation in maize plants at various growth stages anderson 1988 benjamin et al 2014 bennett et al 1989 gheysari et al 2009 in this study in addition to individual effects significant interactive effects were observed in maize plant dm accumulation under different soil water levels and n rates at the seedling stage similar interactive effect of water n management was also reported by bennett et al 1989 for maize dm accumulation throughout the growing season the previous studies showed that maize plants generally had higher r s ratios when experiencing drought stress due to increased dm allocation into roots to improve root growth and water acquisition benjamin et al 2014 mi et al 2010 in this study the r s ratio did show an increased trend under the ms condition however it decreased significantly under the ss condition this may be the result of an extreme limitation in photosynthate translocation from shoot to root under severe soil drought the response of r s ratio to n fertilization were consistent with the previous results anderson 1988 showing an obvious decrease trend with increasing n rates this indicates that reducing basal n supply has positive influence on improving dm allocation into roots so to cope with the drought stress effect at the seedling stage root morphology has strong plasticity in the response to the availability of both water and mineral nutrients in the soil eapen et al 2005 yu et al 2014 many studies have found that soil water and n management had significant individual effects on maize root morphology oikeh et al 1999 peng et al 2012 sharp and davies 1985 our results are concurrent with the above findings and further indicated the significant water n interactive effects on root morphology moreover significant relationships were observed in root morphology parameters with leaf rolling rwc pwc and nue indicating the key roles of root growth and morphology in improving plant drought resistance soil water acquisition and n utilization of maize plant at the seedling stage in addition to root morphology the spatial distribution of root systems in a soil profile also has a significant influence on soil water and nutrient absorption and thus affects crop growth and productivity amato and ritchie 2002 in general deeper root distribution is considered as a key characteristic of the ideotype maize root system architecture which optimizes water and n capture throughout the whole soil strata lynch 2013 mi et al 2010 in this study obvious differences were observed in root system distribution under different water n treatments maize seedling formed deeper root distribution characteristics with steeper growth angle in the n0 treatments in the contrast the distribution region of root system showed large vertical shift and concentrated heavily into the topsoil layer when n fertilizer was applied the similar changes in maize root architecture affected by soil water management regimes and or n rates also have been observed at the other growing stages chilundo et al 2017 oikeh et al 1999 sharp and davies 1985 trachsel et al 2013 mu et al 2015 compared with the other water n treatments in this study maize plants in ms ln treatment showed an optimal root distribution characterizing by larger and deeper penetration scale with higher root length density throughout the soil layers and thus showed fewer drought responses and obtained the higher wue and nue interestingly although maize growth and n uptake in the n0 treatment was much weaker than those in n fertilization treatments the plants showed obviously slighter leaf rolling under soil water stress conditions this was mainly attributed to the deeper root distribution and the lower evapotranspiration from the stunted plant n fertilization increased not only shoot n uptake but also pwc and wue the results were consistent with those observed by lenka et al 2009 and pandey et al 2000 because n fertilization improved plant growth with a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rate consequently increased plant water requirement and et rudnick et al 2017 however when drought stress occurred the larger leaf area and higher et resulted in more water loss meanwhile the shallower root distribution reduced the water absorption from soil therefore maize plant in n fertilization treatments showed lower substantially leaf rwc and more severe leaf rolling compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment showed fewer leaf rolling responses due to the lower pwc and deeper root distribution under soil water stress and thus obtained significantly higher wue and nue therefore reducing basal n rate was suggested to optimize root growth morphology and distribution to improve maize seedling growth and plant resistance under drought stress a similar conclusion was also presented by gheysari et al 2009 based on a 2 year field experiment in which they found that plant dm responses to n rates depended on soil water availability and that n rate should be decreased under drought stress 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the significant and complex interactions between soil water levels and n rates on dm leaf rolling nue wue root morphology and distribution of maize plants at the seedling stage by conducting a pot experiment in northeast china the dual stress of drought and n deficiency in the ss ln treatment severely limited maize growth and n uptake but maize plant showed slight leaf rolling under soil water stress due to deeper root distribution and lower water consumption from the stunted plant the responses of maize plant performance to n rates obviously differed under the different soil water levels compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization significantly improved maize growth increased dm n uptake pwc and wue under soil water stress although the plant dm and the absorption of water and n were still much lower than those under the ww condition and that n fertilization aggravated leaf rolling in maize plant when drought stress occurred especially under the ss condition which was mainly due to the higher pwc and shallower root distribution however compared with the hn treatment maize plants in the ln treatment developed greater root dm and root length with more fine roots and generated a larger penetration scale throughout the soil layers absorbed more soil water and n and thus showing fewer drought responses and higher wue and nue under soil water stress in contrast high n supply had no advantage for dm accumulation in maize plant but in turn limited root growth and extension in the soil profile eventually resulting in higher water and n resource depletion and lower use efficiencies especially under the ss condition across all the water n treatments ms ln treatment showed optimal root morphology and distribution in the soil and thereby obtained the highest wue and nue under soil water stress in conclusion the results in this study suggest reducing basal n rate to optimize root growth morphology and distribution at the seedling stage in the rain fed maize production to enhance plant drought resistance and improve nue and wue especially under slight to moderate soil water stress acknowledgements this work was supported by the

11268,programs targeting conversion to irrigation techniques promoted as water efficient such as drip irrigation are multiplying worldwide with the claimed objective to secure food production while alleviating the pressure on water resources however there is a persisting and widespread questioning about the actual impact when implementing the techniques in the real world context particularly in smallholder farms we propose a framework to support an integrated assessment of the impact on farm holding performance resulting from the conversion towards a new irrigation technique it is implemented for a 4030 ha agricultural district in the triffa plain of ne morocco where increasing number of farms are changing surface to drip irrigation the indicators within the framework are calculated using survey data from a sample of 25 farm holdings collected in 2012 and 2013 the survey data are enriched with institutional data and data estimated from hydrologic modeling the results indicate that in the study area farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors while most environmental and economic indicators are signaling a neutral or undesirable effect resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation these results question the relevance of the water use reduction objective underlying the ongoing national plan plan maroc vert pmv that aims converting up to 50 of irrigated agricultural land in drip irrigation and call for a stronger appropriation of this water saving objective by the farm holders however limited data availability and quality did not allow to firmly demonstrate the robustness of the findings this severe data constraint revealed the difficulty to assess the socio eco and environmental impact of such irrigation plan in the study area and highlights the need for a data collection centralization and sharing effort conditioned to a strong reduction in data uncertainty the framework methodology proposed in this study can serve as a practical reference for other studies seeking for an integrated assessment of irrigation management changes keywords surface irrigation drip irrigation irrigation performance irrigation efficiency integrated assessment framework green morocco plan 1 introduction irrigated crops contribute to 21 of total agricultural area anduse 69 of the withdrawn water resources worldwide aquastat making the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of water this use of water often leads to surface and groundwater resources depletion in irrigated perimeters which harms ecosystems and prejudices water access and food security therefore the sound management of water resources in irrigated agriculture is a key for sustainable development the most widely used indices to assess the performance of irrigated systems are the engineers irrigation efficiency ie defined as the ratio of water consumed by irrigated crops to water that is diverted boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012a b seckler 1996 the agronomists water productivity wp defined as the ratio of crop yield to water consumed by the irrigated crop zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and the water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of yield to water applied stanhill 1986 the use of these indicators has been repeatedly questioned and criticized as they are limited to the technical performance of the irrigation technology hence disregarding the larger context into which it is applied pereira et al 2012 perry 2008 willardson et al 1994 yet the spatial and temporal scale dependency of the performance is obvious for example studies have shown that ie values can go from very poor to very good if the computation considers the fraction of lost water that is re used at another point in space or time clarck and aniq 1993 guillet 2006 these indicators have also been criticized for not only considering the technical aspects and not the socio economic ones boelens and vos 2012 van halsema and vincent 2012 despite these limitations these indicators remain widely used ie can be separated into conveyance efficiency ec and application efficiency ea bos and nugteren 1990 tiercelin and vidal 2006 van halsema and vincent 2012 conveyance efficiency mainly depends on the design and state of the hydraulic infrastructure transporting water to the irrigated field while application efficiency is usually expressed as a function of application technique given the significant financial investment needed to improve ec ea is most often used as the actionable parameter when seeking to save water during irrigation practices boelens and vos 2012 knox et al 2012 as a result irrigation water application techniques characterized by higher ea values such as micro irrigation are increasingly being promoted to improve the performance of irrigated agriculture micro irrigation is indeed considered to be water efficient and to reduce the pressure on the water resources thereby increasing yields and economic incomes chandran and surendran 2015 darouich et al 2012 2014 garb and friedlander 2014 drip irrigation the most widespread micro irrigation technique is characterized by a high uniformity of the water distribution and the capability to deliver the water directly to the root zone of the plant at a controlled timing goldberg and shmueli 1970 tiercelin 2006 hence theoretically minimizing evaporation and deep drainage van der kooij et al 2013a these technical specificities translate into a high potential irrigation efficiency ie the ratio between the irrigation water used by the plant and applied of drip irrigation ranging between 70 to 95 fader et al 2016 hassanli et al 2010 tiercelin and vidal 2006 van halsema and vincent 2012 these ie values outperform those of surface irrigation for which ie ranges normally between 40 and 75 however such a high efficiency is calculated under controlled conditions and is only achieved if the system is well designed and taken care of and if the irrigation scheme is appropriately managed fader et al 2016 tiercelin and vidal 2006 such conditions are rarely met when implemented in practical real world conditions lankford 2012a additionally adaptation of the farming practice by for instance increasing the irrigated land area and cropping intensity and harvesting different crops often ensue from the modernisation of irrigated perimeters and may result in a higher water consumption batchelor et al 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 fishman et al 2015 lopez gunn et al 2012 olmstead 2010 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 such adaptation may at end counterbalance the envisioned water saving effect of the modernization programme therefore although many scientists politics and actors in the agricultural sector are promoting and justifying the conversion to drip irrigation as an effective strategy to tackle the water scarcity issue e g berbel and mateos 2014 chandran and surendran 2015 cooley et al 2009 evans and sadler 2008 friedlander et al 2013 johnson et al 2001 khan et al 2008 lopez gunn et al 2012 monaghan et al 2013 negri and hanchar 1989 olmstead 2010 others draw attention to the divergence often existing between the potential ie obtained experimentally under controlled conditions and the real ie once it is calculated beyond the scale of the experimental field lankford 2012b van halsema and vincent 2012 and once the technique is implemented in the context of the farm holding batchelor et al 2014 boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012b perry 2011 peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 van der kooij et al 2013b venot et al 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 some of these authors attribute this divergence issue to communication failure by making among other a confusing use of the ie concept boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012a perry 2011 venot et al 2014 go even further by supporting that the widespread positive image of drip irrigation has been actively sustained by a group of actors to fit their values interests and mission following up on this rational authors recommend drip irrigation conversion programs to be implemented in conjunction with educational and politic measures to ensure that the conversion to drip irrigation actually results in the completion of the water conservation objectives and an evaluation that takes into account the context into which it is implemented berbel and mateos 2014 darouich et al 2014 lopez gunn et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2013 following up on these recommendations and to allow the evaluation of the actual impact of the conversion to a new irrigation technique this study proposed and tested a framework for an integrated assessment of irrigation performance at the farm scale the objectives underlying the implementation of the framework are i to overcome the limitations linked with the concept of ie wp and wue as such the notion of performance refers here to the integrated aspect of the evaluation and is used instead of efficiency and productivity and ii to identify the actual factors explaining the appropriation of the drip irrigation techniques by farmers this framework implies the evaluation of a set of indicators and is tested in the field for the cmv103 irrigation district case study this 4040 ha case study is situated in the irrigated triffa plain in the north eastern part of morocco fig 1 this case study is interesting as morocco is undergoing a plan for irrigation water saving i e the plan maroc vert pmv among other targets this latter plan aims at converting 50 of the moroccan irrigated agricultural land area by 2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program the framework is applied to compare farm holdings that are still using the traditional surface irrigation technique and others that engaged with drip irrigation results are used to assess whether the actual factors driving the farmers to use drip irrigation and the impacts of such conversion are aligned with the pmv objectives that are water saving and modernisation of agricultural sector 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study focusses on the 4030 ha cmv103 administrative district in the triffa agricultural plain in the oriental region of morocco fig 1 the region is populated by 2 314 346 inhabitants among which 35 live in rural area mamp 2009 the region is drained by the moulouya river whose basin forms one of the six largest moroccan catchments the triffa plain is the most fertile and productive agricultural region of north east morocco it elevation averages 75 m and it is bordered by the bni snassens mountain in the south by the moulouya river and its affluent the charrâa in the west by the hills of oulad mansour towards the mediterranean sea in the north and by the kiss river in the east it is bordered by the bni snassens mountain in the south by the moulouya river in the west by the kiss river in the east and by the ouled mansour hills in the north fig 1 climate is semi arid with a 0 23 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio fao 1992 average temperatures alternate between 11 c in winter and 25 c in summer ormvam 2009 inventory and personal communication with ormvam officers average rainfall is 329 mm mostly distributed from september to may with a high inter annual variability annual mobilized freshwater resources in the moulouya basin are estimated at 1610 mm3 from surface water and 512 mm3 from groundwater which amounts to around 964 m3 per capita aquastat 2018 water resources in the region are therefore below the commonly accepted 1000 m3 water scarcity threshold the agricultural area in the cmv103 district covers 4030 ha and is cultivated by around 750 farmers farm size averages 5 ha but is characterized by a high variability ranging from less than 1 ha to 400 ha sixty six percent of the land is owned by farmers while 17 is managed by private companies and 17 belongs to the state and are managed by public institutions ormvam 2009 census record and personal communications with ormvam officers cultivated crop in the region are various and include mainly cereals and fodder vegetable and citrus almonds and oleaginous trees mamp 2014 in the cmv103 district main irrigated crops in 2009 were citrus 70 6 of irrigated agricultural land area followed by potatoes 10 0 cereals 6 2 various fruit growing 4 6 vegetable growing 2 8 alfalfa 2 1 and artichokes 1 5 other crops are grape vines olive trees forage sugar beets and beans less than 1 ormvam 2009 inventory and personal communication with ormvam officers fig 2 indicates the crop calendar for the main crops the corresponding cultural coefficient kc and the monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration et0 values are higher than rainfall during the entire year thereby illustrating the need to complement with irrigation water even when kc values are low as a response about a quarter of the agricultural land surface in the region is irrigated mamp 2009 the water in the moulouya basin is mostly withdrawn from two dams 556 mm3 year and from flowing surface water 330 mm3 year fig 1 the dams were built in the late 1960 s in the context of a national strategy to develop large scale infrastructures for intensive irrigated agriculture most farmers also pump groundwater to complement surface water resources although the volume of groundwater withdrawn is less significant than surface water it has been repeatedly claimed to lead to an overall decline in the water table elevation in the regional aquifers see 2017 surface irrigation and sprinkle irrigation remain the main irrigation practices in morocco with in 2011 72 and 9 of irrigated agricultural area respectively aquastat however areas in drip irrigation have been increasing considerably as a result of drip irrigation subsidy programs conducted under the npiws the objective underlying these programs is to increase irrigated area under drip irrigation up to 550 mha by 2020 which corresponds to 50 of the total irrigated agricultural land area in morocco irrigation water resources in morocco are managed in accordance to the 36 15 water law and the national program for irrigation water saving npiws encompassed within the green morocco plan pmv for plan maroc vert three ministries and agencies organize a sector wide planning and designated authorities oversee the cross sectoral coordination the main actors in charge of the irrigation sector are the hydraulic basin agencies abh for agences de bassin hydraulique and the regional offices for the valorization of agriculture ormva for office régionale de mise en valeur agricole 2 2 data collection we conducted agricultural surveys within the cmv103 district fig 1 in march 2012 and march 2013 we designed the farms sampling to have a representative sample of the region agricultural landscape soil type and cultivated crops and to have an equivalent number of farms using surface and drip irrigation in total we surveyed 25 agricultural holdings 13 using surface irrigation and having 26 irrigated fields and 12 using drip irrigation and having 28 irrigated fields characteristics of the surveyed holdings are given in tables 1 and 2 an important assumption underlying this study is that the holdings using surface irrigation are representative of the holdings using drip irrigation prior to their conversion collected data were to document the agricultural holders and labor force farm land use field number and areas main crops and irrigation agricultural and irrigation practices technology timing and water source and amount and economic size and fluxes for the holdings surveys were carried out by the authors of the study most of them accompanied with local ormvam officers to overcome language and cultural barriers the survey encompassed a visit of the farm to reduce errors or farmer perception bias during these visits we corroborated the data collected about agricultural practices and irrigation management and inquired additional information when necessary to deepen the understanding about irrigation practices in addition to the survey data we collected census data about the land use and area main crops irrigated area and irrigation technology in the study area from the ormva of moulouya ormvam data department these were complemented with hydrologic data generated from a field scale water budget model ran at a daily time step supplementary material and feltz et al 2016 2 3 integrated performance assessment framework in this study we defined the integrated performance assessment as the quantification of the technical agricultural socio economic and environmental components that are prone to change in a farm holding when implementing a new irrigation technique as such the concept of performance is broader than the concept of ie in contrast to field experimentations conducted to quantify ie performance aims for an integrated assessment of an irrigation technique at the scale of the farm holding we built the assessment framework from the sustainability assessment of farming and the environment safe framework van cauwenbergh et al 2007a and complemented it by evaluation criteria and indicators extracted from an in depth review of irrigation performance assessment studies bos and nugteren 1990 dembélé et al 2001 fekete and stakhiv 2014 kristensen and pirc velkavrh 2003 lofgren et al 1999 margat 2005 molden et al 1998 muller 2009 rao 1993 skaggs and samani 2005 un tfimr 2009 un wwap 2009 van cauwenbergh et al 2007b the safe framework was designed to support an integrated and systematic assessment of the sustainability of belgian agricultural systems and is well recognized in the scientific community e g binder et al 2010 gómez limón and sanchez fernandez 2010 ripoll bosch et al 2012 the safe framework was designed to assess a range of spatial scales from field to regional or country scale and embodies three hierarchical assessment levels principles criteria and indicators pc i principles and criteria are related to the multiple functions of the agro ecosystem they go beyond the production function and include the three pillars of sustainability the environmental economic and social the principles aim to list the general ecosystem functions that contribute to the achievement of sustainability e g the water supply function while the criteria indicate for the resulting state when the corresponding principle is respected e g adequate amount of soil moisture is provided the indicators are quantitative or qualitative variables that can be used to assess the sustainability of the agro ecosystems in relation to each criterion the holistic approach embodied by the safe framework presents various advantages for our study firstly it enables the evaluation of multiple aspects of agrosystems once irrigation is implemented in the real world context which differs from the technical experimentation in controlled conditions secondly it allows this evaluation to be done at the farm holding scale and from the farmer s perspective this is important since studies on irrigated systems around the world have reported that the decision factors for the conversion to another irrigation practices are variable but most often linked to practical considerations related to the farmers holdings benouniche et al 2011 van der kooij 2009 2013 thirdly a holistic evaluation framework allows investigating agrosystem performance without formulating uni dimensional or unduly constraining hypotheses about the objectives that motivated the farmers to follow a given farming strategy we adapted the safe framework by applying a six rule screening procedure to all the pc i in the safe framework successively 1 every pc i must be prone to be impacted when converting a farm holding irrigation scheme to a new technology to apply this rule we first compiled a comprehensive list of the socio economic and environmental variables that are subject to be impacted using the reference irrigation book traité d irrigation tiercelin and vidal 2006 table 2 we excluded any principle criteria or indicator that was not related with any of the listed variables 2 every pc i must be relevant for the study agricultural district in this case the cmv103 perimeter this rule was applied because irrigation performance is dependent on the specificity of the study area rao 1993 we applied this rule on the basis of our conceptual understanding of the socio economic and environmental context in the study area its issues and challenges 3 every indicator must have implications at the farm holding scale this rule is to comply with the study objective that is to evaluate performance from the farmer s standpoint it assumes that the farmer s evaluation of the performance doesn t expand beyond the boundaries of the farm holding as such this rule involves the systematic elimination of all safe indicators for which the application scale was the landscape region watershed ecosystem and country 4 it must be possible to calculate every indicator based on existing data or knowledge since one of the fundamental property of an indicator is the possibility to be calculated and quantified bell and morse 2004 fekete and stakhiv 2014 reed et al 2006 5 all criteria or indicators nested under a principle or criterion that was eliminated was also eliminated additionally all principles and criteria for which all the nested criteria and or indicators were ruled out were eliminated prior to eliminating a criterion based on this rule possible alternative indicators listed from the literature body for this criterion were reviewed and any indicator suitable to quantify the orphan criterion was retained 6 pc i related to pollution aspects must be excluded because this study focusses on the quantitative aspect of the resources finally we compared the indicator list resulting from this screening procedure to the indicators listed from the literature review and added the indicators that did not have an equivalent in the safe framework in such case we revised the definitions of the selected indicators to fit the study case 2 4 indicator calculation we provided a definition and calculation method for each selected indicator based on the definitions in the safe framework adjusted to fit with the study area and objective we calculated the compiled list of indicators for each surveyed holding using the data from the surveys census and a simplified hydrologic model to assess the difference between farm using surface irrigation and the farms using drip irrigation we calculated the aggregated statistics mean standard deviation and ranges of the indicators grouped by type of holding surface and drip irrigation and assessed the significance of the difference by conducting student t tests statistical tests 3 results 3 1 indicator selection we selected seventeen indicators to support a performance assessment of the change in irrigation technique in the cmv103 district of the triffa plain morocco the final assessment framework is structured around the three sustainability pillars and encompasses eight principles 13 criteria and 17 indicators table 3 this represents a sharp simplification of the initial safe framework that originally consisted of 18 principles 48 criteria and 96 indicators we removed eight pc is because they were insensitive to a change in irrigation technique rule 1 14 because they were not relevant for the study site rule 2 14 because they reflected on a system property that was outside of the farmers standpoint rule 3 16 because of the lack of data rule 4 and the remaining were eliminated according to the fifth rule besides we added four indicators identified in the literature because they had no equivalent in the safe framework or to support the assessment of criteria for which all indicators had been eliminated during the screening procedure detailed results from the selection procedure are given in the supplementary material table sm eigth of the selected indicators serve the assessment of the environmental pillar four the economic pillar and five the social pillar selected environmental indicators were related to water and energy aspects while the indicators linked to biodiversity issues were excluded due to insufficient data we kept all the principles and criteria in the economic pillar but excluded seven indicators due to insufficient data the scarcity of farm scale economic data in public records was linked to the high sparsity and variability of reliable raw economic data which hinders the compilation of such database in regional or national level besides surveyed farm holders were not always participative in disclosing such data even under the cover of anonymity if the data had been available pc i for the economic pillar would be almost identical with the original safe framework this correspondence regardless of the highly distinct agricultural context between belgium and morocco reflects the universality of the economic concerns in an agricultural project both for decision makers and for farm holders in contrast to the economic pillar we removed the majority of pc i for assessing the social pillar from the original safe framework and included three additional indicators which highlights the distinct social specificities between the two regions the definitions of the selected indicators are given in table 4 and additional information is in the supplementary material 3 2 comparative evaluation of performance in cmv103 district results indicate that conversion to drip irrigation in the cmv103 district has impact at the p 0 05 significance level on five out of the 17 performance indicators table 5 analysis of the direction and implications of the changes are detailed for each pillar of sustainability 3 2 1 environmental pillar almost all indicators exhibiting a significant change in the environmental pillar are changing in an undesirable direction the lower number of harvested species in farms using drip irrigation indicator 8 table 5 indicates the higher specialization of these farms a combination of factors might explain this higher specialization the main one is that engaging with drip irrigation involves a significant conversion of the farmers practice hence crops that are not suited to drip irrigation such as cereals are no longer cultivated another factor is that farmers using surface irrigation in cash crop orchards often take profit of the moist soil conditions prevailing in the tree inter rows to grow other crops for personal use agricultural input or local market this increases the diversity of harvested species this diversification is no more possible in farms using drip irrigation as the moist soil conditions are restricted to the immediate proximity of the root system of the primarily harvested plant however some farmers using drip irrigation practice inter row cropping on citrus tree fields when the trees are at young growing stages overall conversion to drip irrigation is often embedded in a broader strategy towards a more intensive cash crop oriented industrial agricultural practice this implies a reduction of the diversity and an increase of the specialization level table 6 energy input indicator 5 is significantly higher in drip irrigated farms however this result must be interpreted cautiously as the energy indicator is calculated based on theoretical assumption in addition it is not related to crop yield although an increase in energy use per harvested land unit might be compensated by an increase in crop yield on that same unit as found in other studies e g pergola et al 2013 no exact yield data are available to evaluate such indicator in this case study no renewable energy input was recorded in the surveyed farms indicator 6 although it has been recently observed in other farm holdings that farmers are starting to use solar panels as energy source for groundwater pumping hence drastically reducing non renewable energy consumption no significant difference is found for the hydric stress indicator indicator 2 when all fields are considered yet previous study had shown that when restricting the analysis to citrus fields i e the dominant crop in the cmv103 district the hydric stress indicator is higher p value 0 06 for citrus irrigated with drip irrigation annual number of days with hydric stress 47 as compared to surface irrigation annual number of days with hydric stress 34 feltz and vanclooster 2013 this inability to cope with hydric stress suggests that the control of irrigation timing and quantity is not optimal and that this management failure is exacerbated when using drip irrigation in addition although the statistical significance of the indicator 3 is low p value 0 1 it signals that the conversion to drip irrigation might not lead to the expected decrease in groundwater withdrawal these results highlight the poor management of the irrigation technology and the risk of failure to meet the water saving objective targeted by the npiws based on our field observations and discussions during the agricultural surveys very few farmers are using soil moisture sensor technologies to assess the need in irrigation water instead many farm holders that engaged with drip irrigation keep making decisions about irrigation timing and quantity using the same decision criteria as when using surface irrigation we observed instances of farmers in assessing crop water needs based on apparent observed soil dryness or wetness in drip irrigated fields although this practical assessment is valid for field in surface irrigation it is misleading for fields in drip irrigation and likely triggers excess irrigation in absence of rainfall soil wetness status is indeed very low outside the dripper irrigation cone these results highlight the gap between the theoretical and actual efficiency of the drip irrigation technique and the importance of considering the context into which the technique is deployed when assessing performance this also emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical training of the farmers when drip irrigation is implemented and to implement real incentive programs to encourage famers to manage water as a scarce resource despite indications that the conversion to drip irrigation could alleviate pressure on water resources the environmental performance of the farms under drip irrigation as compared to surface are either identical or lower more energy consumption lower crop diversity higher hydric stress these findings suggest that in the study area the factors motivating the farmers to use drip irrigation are not directly related to environmental concerns 3 2 2 economic pillar the conversion to drip irrigation does not appear to have a significant economic impact in the study area except for a lower diversity of income sources indicator 11 which is in accordance with the higher level of specialization revealed in the environmental pillar indicator 8 this lower diversity of income sources and crop types might make the holdings less resilient to any market shock or crop harvest failure due for instance to crop diseases the absence of significant difference regarding the longevity of the estate status indicator 12 between the two types of holdings contrast with findings from several other studies e g burnham et al 2014 salhi et al 2012 the conversion to drip irrigation indeed supposedly requires heavy financial investments that starts being profitable only after a long period and therefore requires stable conditions the fact that this assumption does not hold true in the cmv103 district may be explained by the use of cheaper technologies by some farmers among other through pumping water directly from the aquifer instead of building a reservoir the resulting drastic cost reduction can justify a conversion towards drip irrigation even when the longevity of the holding is less secured on another hand the conversion towards drip irrigation is heavily subsidized which may explain that farm holders would take the risk to convert even if case of lower stability finally results indicate that the conversion to drip irrigation does not change the annual income nor the economic balance however the results should be regarded cautiously since economic data are generally marred by high uncertainty in addition they were not disclosed by all the survey respondents 3 2 3 social pillar indicator 15 exhibits significant differences farms using drip irrigation hire more farm workers for daily operations this is to be attributed to the generally bigger farmland area of the exploitations under drip irrigation and the higher workload thereof but also indicates a clear cut difference in the daily management of the farm depending on the irrigation model the farms using surface irrigation are generally smallholder family farms with external workers hired on a punctual basis while the farms using drip irrigation tend to have a higher dependency on daily workers this result also corroborates studies that reported that a frequent criterion motivating conversion to drip irrigation is the reduction of the time that the farm manager spends in the field e g foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 the education level of farm managers indicator 16 is significantly higher in exploitations under drip irrigation none of the 13 managers in farms using surface irrigation attended vocational nor higher education while all the surveyed farm managers who received an education are practicing drip irrigation hence higher education is most likely a favorable factor for the farm holder to question the traditional irrigation system and engage with the conversion this result corroborates findings in alcon et al 2011 and salhi et al 2012 that educated farmers are more prone to decide for conversion to drip irrigation the dependency to commercial contract indicator 17 is significantly higher for farmers using drip irrigation this is because the major part of their crops is citrus for exportation and sugar beets for sugar industry both inherently dependent to contracts the agricultural models in farmers using surface irrigation are more oriented towards local market and for the consumption at the farm level therefore from a social standpoint the performance of a farm using drip irrigation is weakened due to a higher dependency to contracts in these farms owner and manager most often have a professional education land area is bigger and there are several contracted workers the conversion to drip irrigation does not impact the performance criteria supported by the 12 other indicators hence very similar percentage of irrigated farmland area indicator 14 for the two irrigation systems indicates that such land attribution is depending on decision factors that are independent from the type of irrigation practice used and that the proportion of irrigated farmland is not an incentive for a farm manager to implement the conversion to drip irrigation finally the lesser significance of the difference for indicators 13 number of commercialized crop types and 8 number of crop types including non commercialized crops i e crops grown for household consumption testifies for the more market oriented model of holdings using drip irrigation 4 discussion most indicators supporting environmental and economic performance assessment are signaling a neutral effect or undesirable alteration resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation these results support the conclusions in venot et al 2014 that drip irrigation should not be framed as an effective practice for water saving and poverty alleviation without considering the context into which it is implemented it also supports the conclusion by the same author that the conversion to drip irrigation has had little capability to improve smallholder farming these neutral or negative effects on environmental and economic factors suggests that in the study area farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors specifically the difference in farm management highlighted by indicator 15 suggests that the main drivers motivating farmers for using drip irrigation is the possibility to organize daily work tasks differently therefore implying a higher convenience and comfort improvement this has been repeatedly corroborated by discussions with the farmers and it has also been highlighted in other studies led in tunisian and algerian irrigation districts exhibiting similar farm holding models and harvest crop schemes foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 indeed in the study region surface irrigation requires substantial human labor for water application and distribution which is typically executed by workers hired on a punctual basis and whose guidance and supervision is highly time consuming for the farm manager inversely drip irrigation is more automated and less labor intensive thereof which supposedly eliminates the need for punctual workers hiring and training social and cultural reasons were also pointed by alcon et al 2011 foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 and wanvoeke et al 2016 as determinant motivators for engaging with drip irrigation technologies wanvoeke et al 2016 indicated specifically that in their burkinabe study area this engagement is primarily linked with advantages such as access to attractive credits higher social prestige and resulting opportunities to create new alliances the higher dependency to contract for farms under drip irrigation revealed in this study aligns with many studies e g berbel and mateos 2014 boelens and vos 2012 lopez gunn et al 2012 olmstead 2010 van der kooij et al 2013a van halsema and vincent 2012 venot et al 2014 these studies showed that the conversion to drip irrigation is often used to modernize infrastructures and comply with export companies requirements overall the findings in this study question the significance of the national plan for irrigation water saving pneei under the plan maroc vert targeting the conversion of 50 of irrigated land to drip irrigation it highlights that environmental concerns are not sufficient incentive for farmers to weight into their operational decisions this stresses the need to complement the subsidy programs by real incentives such as pricing measures to motivate farmers to conserve water and training programs to support farmers for an optimal operation and management of the drip irrigation technology several drawbacks limited the scope of this study which calls for additional work on the topic the first and major one is linked to data scarcity limited data caused the exclusion of numerous performance indicators and compromised the reliability of some of the final indicators among others all indicators related to quality concerns water pollution soil salinization etc were excluded although this component is crucial for a truly holistic assessment of irrigation practices causes of data scarcity were the limited pool of pre existing data and the restriction to data access by institutional authorities and the limited time and funding to deploy instrumentation network and grow the pool of agricultural surveys another drawback is that the study didn t incorporate the temporal dimension instead to cope with the lack of data that would have allowed evaluating the performance of a farm holding prior and after the conversion to drip irrigation the holdings that were still using surface irrigation were used as a proxy for the holding of the drip irrigation farms prior to their conversion although this simplification is acceptable to gain preliminary knowledge and understanding results still need to be regarded with caution due to possible differences in farm typology and farmer profiles existing prior to the conversion the problem of data scarcity is a common and widespread issue in agricultural studies in developing countries e g bastiaanssen et al 2007 hamid et al 2011 kharrou et al 2013 therefore this study is an additional instance highlighting the need for a data collection and storage program and strategy at the institutional level such program should include i the conduction of repeated agricultural census ii the deployment of monitoring network to track the temporal evolution of key environmental variables and adapt management as needed iii the cleaning and storage of historic and new data in a central database iv a lift of the institutional barrier that make the data acquisition a very time and resources consuming if not impossible process lastly no reference values were proposed to evaluate the absolute values taken by the indicators such references would have been difficult to determine because of their high dependency to the socio economic and environmental specificities of the region under study the comparative assessment between farms using surface irrigation and farms using drip irrigation allows to overcome this difficulty it allows to measure the direction and amplitude of any possible change while integrating the specificities of the region 5 conclusions a framework to support a comparative integrated assessment of the performance of farm holdings using traditional surface irrigation and those that engaged with a new irrigation technique was defined and applied to the cmv103 irrigation district in the triffa agricultural plain in eastern morocco results indicate that the conversion from surface to drip irrigation in the study area led to neutral or negative effects on environmental and economic aspects while most significant beneficial effects were detected for the social pillar as drip irrigation allows structural changes in the holding the latter result suggests that the objectives pursued by the farm holders engaging with the drip irrigation technique are different from the objectives underlying the subsidy programs led under the moroccan national plan for irrigation water saving under the plan maroc vert results indicate that farmers do not consider the need to reduce consumption when planning their irrigation scheme and stress that environmental concerns are not sufficient incentive to motivate farmers for irrigation water saving this divergence in the objectives might undermine the success of the plan in targeting water scarcity issue and therefore calls for a more meaningful engagement and training of the farmers along with raising awareness about the water scarcity issue prevailing in the region more generally results from the study are confirming that despite the high theoretical water use efficiency of the drip irrigation technology its performance when evaluated at the farm holding scale is far less obvious therefore the decision to engage with that technique should be based on a multi level criteria evaluation despite the conduction of surveys with the farmers the institutional and long term monitoring data scarcity context into which this study was implemented was a major obstacle and compromises the robustness of the results this calls for the institutionalization of the data standardization centralization the release of the data in public database along with the implementation of continuous

11268,programs targeting conversion to irrigation techniques promoted as water efficient such as drip irrigation are multiplying worldwide with the claimed objective to secure food production while alleviating the pressure on water resources however there is a persisting and widespread questioning about the actual impact when implementing the techniques in the real world context particularly in smallholder farms we propose a framework to support an integrated assessment of the impact on farm holding performance resulting from the conversion towards a new irrigation technique it is implemented for a 4030 ha agricultural district in the triffa plain of ne morocco where increasing number of farms are changing surface to drip irrigation the indicators within the framework are calculated using survey data from a sample of 25 farm holdings collected in 2012 and 2013 the survey data are enriched with institutional data and data estimated from hydrologic modeling the results indicate that in the study area farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors while most environmental and economic indicators are signaling a neutral or undesirable effect resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation these results question the relevance of the water use reduction objective underlying the ongoing national plan plan maroc vert pmv that aims converting up to 50 of irrigated agricultural land in drip irrigation and call for a stronger appropriation of this water saving objective by the farm holders however limited data availability and quality did not allow to firmly demonstrate the robustness of the findings this severe data constraint revealed the difficulty to assess the socio eco and environmental impact of such irrigation plan in the study area and highlights the need for a data collection centralization and sharing effort conditioned to a strong reduction in data uncertainty the framework methodology proposed in this study can serve as a practical reference for other studies seeking for an integrated assessment of irrigation management changes keywords surface irrigation drip irrigation irrigation performance irrigation efficiency integrated assessment framework green morocco plan 1 introduction irrigated crops contribute to 21 of total agricultural area anduse 69 of the withdrawn water resources worldwide aquastat making the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of water this use of water often leads to surface and groundwater resources depletion in irrigated perimeters which harms ecosystems and prejudices water access and food security therefore the sound management of water resources in irrigated agriculture is a key for sustainable development the most widely used indices to assess the performance of irrigated systems are the engineers irrigation efficiency ie defined as the ratio of water consumed by irrigated crops to water that is diverted boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012a b seckler 1996 the agronomists water productivity wp defined as the ratio of crop yield to water consumed by the irrigated crop zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and the water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of yield to water applied stanhill 1986 the use of these indicators has been repeatedly questioned and criticized as they are limited to the technical performance of the irrigation technology hence disregarding the larger context into which it is applied pereira et al 2012 perry 2008 willardson et al 1994 yet the spatial and temporal scale dependency of the performance is obvious for example studies have shown that ie values can go from very poor to very good if the computation considers the fraction of lost water that is re used at another point in space or time clarck and aniq 1993 guillet 2006 these indicators have also been criticized for not only considering the technical aspects and not the socio economic ones boelens and vos 2012 van halsema and vincent 2012 despite these limitations these indicators remain widely used ie can be separated into conveyance efficiency ec and application efficiency ea bos and nugteren 1990 tiercelin and vidal 2006 van halsema and vincent 2012 conveyance efficiency mainly depends on the design and state of the hydraulic infrastructure transporting water to the irrigated field while application efficiency is usually expressed as a function of application technique given the significant financial investment needed to improve ec ea is most often used as the actionable parameter when seeking to save water during irrigation practices boelens and vos 2012 knox et al 2012 as a result irrigation water application techniques characterized by higher ea values such as micro irrigation are increasingly being promoted to improve the performance of irrigated agriculture micro irrigation is indeed considered to be water efficient and to reduce the pressure on the water resources thereby increasing yields and economic incomes chandran and surendran 2015 darouich et al 2012 2014 garb and friedlander 2014 drip irrigation the most widespread micro irrigation technique is characterized by a high uniformity of the water distribution and the capability to deliver the water directly to the root zone of the plant at a controlled timing goldberg and shmueli 1970 tiercelin 2006 hence theoretically minimizing evaporation and deep drainage van der kooij et al 2013a these technical specificities translate into a high potential irrigation efficiency ie the ratio between the irrigation water used by the plant and applied of drip irrigation ranging between 70 to 95 fader et al 2016 hassanli et al 2010 tiercelin and vidal 2006 van halsema and vincent 2012 these ie values outperform those of surface irrigation for which ie ranges normally between 40 and 75 however such a high efficiency is calculated under controlled conditions and is only achieved if the system is well designed and taken care of and if the irrigation scheme is appropriately managed fader et al 2016 tiercelin and vidal 2006 such conditions are rarely met when implemented in practical real world conditions lankford 2012a additionally adaptation of the farming practice by for instance increasing the irrigated land area and cropping intensity and harvesting different crops often ensue from the modernisation of irrigated perimeters and may result in a higher water consumption batchelor et al 2014 berbel and mateos 2014 fishman et al 2015 lopez gunn et al 2012 olmstead 2010 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 such adaptation may at end counterbalance the envisioned water saving effect of the modernization programme therefore although many scientists politics and actors in the agricultural sector are promoting and justifying the conversion to drip irrigation as an effective strategy to tackle the water scarcity issue e g berbel and mateos 2014 chandran and surendran 2015 cooley et al 2009 evans and sadler 2008 friedlander et al 2013 johnson et al 2001 khan et al 2008 lopez gunn et al 2012 monaghan et al 2013 negri and hanchar 1989 olmstead 2010 others draw attention to the divergence often existing between the potential ie obtained experimentally under controlled conditions and the real ie once it is calculated beyond the scale of the experimental field lankford 2012b van halsema and vincent 2012 and once the technique is implemented in the context of the farm holding batchelor et al 2014 boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012b perry 2011 peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 van der kooij et al 2013b venot et al 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 some of these authors attribute this divergence issue to communication failure by making among other a confusing use of the ie concept boelens and vos 2012 lankford 2012a perry 2011 venot et al 2014 go even further by supporting that the widespread positive image of drip irrigation has been actively sustained by a group of actors to fit their values interests and mission following up on this rational authors recommend drip irrigation conversion programs to be implemented in conjunction with educational and politic measures to ensure that the conversion to drip irrigation actually results in the completion of the water conservation objectives and an evaluation that takes into account the context into which it is implemented berbel and mateos 2014 darouich et al 2014 lopez gunn et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2013 following up on these recommendations and to allow the evaluation of the actual impact of the conversion to a new irrigation technique this study proposed and tested a framework for an integrated assessment of irrigation performance at the farm scale the objectives underlying the implementation of the framework are i to overcome the limitations linked with the concept of ie wp and wue as such the notion of performance refers here to the integrated aspect of the evaluation and is used instead of efficiency and productivity and ii to identify the actual factors explaining the appropriation of the drip irrigation techniques by farmers this framework implies the evaluation of a set of indicators and is tested in the field for the cmv103 irrigation district case study this 4040 ha case study is situated in the irrigated triffa plain in the north eastern part of morocco fig 1 this case study is interesting as morocco is undergoing a plan for irrigation water saving i e the plan maroc vert pmv among other targets this latter plan aims at converting 50 of the moroccan irrigated agricultural land area by 2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program the framework is applied to compare farm holdings that are still using the traditional surface irrigation technique and others that engaged with drip irrigation results are used to assess whether the actual factors driving the farmers to use drip irrigation and the impacts of such conversion are aligned with the pmv objectives that are water saving and modernisation of agricultural sector 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study focusses on the 4030 ha cmv103 administrative district in the triffa agricultural plain in the oriental region of morocco fig 1 the region is populated by 2 314 346 inhabitants among which 35 live in rural area mamp 2009 the region is drained by the moulouya river whose basin forms one of the six largest moroccan catchments the triffa plain is the most fertile and productive agricultural region of north east morocco it elevation averages 75 m and it is bordered by the bni snassens mountain in the south by the moulouya river and its affluent the charrâa in the west by the hills of oulad mansour towards the mediterranean sea in the north and by the kiss river in the east it is bordered by the bni snassens mountain in the south by the moulouya river in the west by the kiss river in the east and by the ouled mansour hills in the north fig 1 climate is semi arid with a 0 23 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio fao 1992 average temperatures alternate between 11 c in winter and 25 c in summer ormvam 2009 inventory and personal communication with ormvam officers average rainfall is 329 mm mostly distributed from september to may with a high inter annual variability annual mobilized freshwater resources in the moulouya basin are estimated at 1610 mm3 from surface water and 512 mm3 from groundwater which amounts to around 964 m3 per capita aquastat 2018 water resources in the region are therefore below the commonly accepted 1000 m3 water scarcity threshold the agricultural area in the cmv103 district covers 4030 ha and is cultivated by around 750 farmers farm size averages 5 ha but is characterized by a high variability ranging from less than 1 ha to 400 ha sixty six percent of the land is owned by farmers while 17 is managed by private companies and 17 belongs to the state and are managed by public institutions ormvam 2009 census record and personal communications with ormvam officers cultivated crop in the region are various and include mainly cereals and fodder vegetable and citrus almonds and oleaginous trees mamp 2014 in the cmv103 district main irrigated crops in 2009 were citrus 70 6 of irrigated agricultural land area followed by potatoes 10 0 cereals 6 2 various fruit growing 4 6 vegetable growing 2 8 alfalfa 2 1 and artichokes 1 5 other crops are grape vines olive trees forage sugar beets and beans less than 1 ormvam 2009 inventory and personal communication with ormvam officers fig 2 indicates the crop calendar for the main crops the corresponding cultural coefficient kc and the monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration et0 values are higher than rainfall during the entire year thereby illustrating the need to complement with irrigation water even when kc values are low as a response about a quarter of the agricultural land surface in the region is irrigated mamp 2009 the water in the moulouya basin is mostly withdrawn from two dams 556 mm3 year and from flowing surface water 330 mm3 year fig 1 the dams were built in the late 1960 s in the context of a national strategy to develop large scale infrastructures for intensive irrigated agriculture most farmers also pump groundwater to complement surface water resources although the volume of groundwater withdrawn is less significant than surface water it has been repeatedly claimed to lead to an overall decline in the water table elevation in the regional aquifers see 2017 surface irrigation and sprinkle irrigation remain the main irrigation practices in morocco with in 2011 72 and 9 of irrigated agricultural area respectively aquastat however areas in drip irrigation have been increasing considerably as a result of drip irrigation subsidy programs conducted under the npiws the objective underlying these programs is to increase irrigated area under drip irrigation up to 550 mha by 2020 which corresponds to 50 of the total irrigated agricultural land area in morocco irrigation water resources in morocco are managed in accordance to the 36 15 water law and the national program for irrigation water saving npiws encompassed within the green morocco plan pmv for plan maroc vert three ministries and agencies organize a sector wide planning and designated authorities oversee the cross sectoral coordination the main actors in charge of the irrigation sector are the hydraulic basin agencies abh for agences de bassin hydraulique and the regional offices for the valorization of agriculture ormva for office régionale de mise en valeur agricole 2 2 data collection we conducted agricultural surveys within the cmv103 district fig 1 in march 2012 and march 2013 we designed the farms sampling to have a representative sample of the region agricultural landscape soil type and cultivated crops and to have an equivalent number of farms using surface and drip irrigation in total we surveyed 25 agricultural holdings 13 using surface irrigation and having 26 irrigated fields and 12 using drip irrigation and having 28 irrigated fields characteristics of the surveyed holdings are given in tables 1 and 2 an important assumption underlying this study is that the holdings using surface irrigation are representative of the holdings using drip irrigation prior to their conversion collected data were to document the agricultural holders and labor force farm land use field number and areas main crops and irrigation agricultural and irrigation practices technology timing and water source and amount and economic size and fluxes for the holdings surveys were carried out by the authors of the study most of them accompanied with local ormvam officers to overcome language and cultural barriers the survey encompassed a visit of the farm to reduce errors or farmer perception bias during these visits we corroborated the data collected about agricultural practices and irrigation management and inquired additional information when necessary to deepen the understanding about irrigation practices in addition to the survey data we collected census data about the land use and area main crops irrigated area and irrigation technology in the study area from the ormva of moulouya ormvam data department these were complemented with hydrologic data generated from a field scale water budget model ran at a daily time step supplementary material and feltz et al 2016 2 3 integrated performance assessment framework in this study we defined the integrated performance assessment as the quantification of the technical agricultural socio economic and environmental components that are prone to change in a farm holding when implementing a new irrigation technique as such the concept of performance is broader than the concept of ie in contrast to field experimentations conducted to quantify ie performance aims for an integrated assessment of an irrigation technique at the scale of the farm holding we built the assessment framework from the sustainability assessment of farming and the environment safe framework van cauwenbergh et al 2007a and complemented it by evaluation criteria and indicators extracted from an in depth review of irrigation performance assessment studies bos and nugteren 1990 dembélé et al 2001 fekete and stakhiv 2014 kristensen and pirc velkavrh 2003 lofgren et al 1999 margat 2005 molden et al 1998 muller 2009 rao 1993 skaggs and samani 2005 un tfimr 2009 un wwap 2009 van cauwenbergh et al 2007b the safe framework was designed to support an integrated and systematic assessment of the sustainability of belgian agricultural systems and is well recognized in the scientific community e g binder et al 2010 gómez limón and sanchez fernandez 2010 ripoll bosch et al 2012 the safe framework was designed to assess a range of spatial scales from field to regional or country scale and embodies three hierarchical assessment levels principles criteria and indicators pc i principles and criteria are related to the multiple functions of the agro ecosystem they go beyond the production function and include the three pillars of sustainability the environmental economic and social the principles aim to list the general ecosystem functions that contribute to the achievement of sustainability e g the water supply function while the criteria indicate for the resulting state when the corresponding principle is respected e g adequate amount of soil moisture is provided the indicators are quantitative or qualitative variables that can be used to assess the sustainability of the agro ecosystems in relation to each criterion the holistic approach embodied by the safe framework presents various advantages for our study firstly it enables the evaluation of multiple aspects of agrosystems once irrigation is implemented in the real world context which differs from the technical experimentation in controlled conditions secondly it allows this evaluation to be done at the farm holding scale and from the farmer s perspective this is important since studies on irrigated systems around the world have reported that the decision factors for the conversion to another irrigation practices are variable but most often linked to practical considerations related to the farmers holdings benouniche et al 2011 van der kooij 2009 2013 thirdly a holistic evaluation framework allows investigating agrosystem performance without formulating uni dimensional or unduly constraining hypotheses about the objectives that motivated the farmers to follow a given farming strategy we adapted the safe framework by applying a six rule screening procedure to all the pc i in the safe framework successively 1 every pc i must be prone to be impacted when converting a farm holding irrigation scheme to a new technology to apply this rule we first compiled a comprehensive list of the socio economic and environmental variables that are subject to be impacted using the reference irrigation book traité d irrigation tiercelin and vidal 2006 table 2 we excluded any principle criteria or indicator that was not related with any of the listed variables 2 every pc i must be relevant for the study agricultural district in this case the cmv103 perimeter this rule was applied because irrigation performance is dependent on the specificity of the study area rao 1993 we applied this rule on the basis of our conceptual understanding of the socio economic and environmental context in the study area its issues and challenges 3 every indicator must have implications at the farm holding scale this rule is to comply with the study objective that is to evaluate performance from the farmer s standpoint it assumes that the farmer s evaluation of the performance doesn t expand beyond the boundaries of the farm holding as such this rule involves the systematic elimination of all safe indicators for which the application scale was the landscape region watershed ecosystem and country 4 it must be possible to calculate every indicator based on existing data or knowledge since one of the fundamental property of an indicator is the possibility to be calculated and quantified bell and morse 2004 fekete and stakhiv 2014 reed et al 2006 5 all criteria or indicators nested under a principle or criterion that was eliminated was also eliminated additionally all principles and criteria for which all the nested criteria and or indicators were ruled out were eliminated prior to eliminating a criterion based on this rule possible alternative indicators listed from the literature body for this criterion were reviewed and any indicator suitable to quantify the orphan criterion was retained 6 pc i related to pollution aspects must be excluded because this study focusses on the quantitative aspect of the resources finally we compared the indicator list resulting from this screening procedure to the indicators listed from the literature review and added the indicators that did not have an equivalent in the safe framework in such case we revised the definitions of the selected indicators to fit the study case 2 4 indicator calculation we provided a definition and calculation method for each selected indicator based on the definitions in the safe framework adjusted to fit with the study area and objective we calculated the compiled list of indicators for each surveyed holding using the data from the surveys census and a simplified hydrologic model to assess the difference between farm using surface irrigation and the farms using drip irrigation we calculated the aggregated statistics mean standard deviation and ranges of the indicators grouped by type of holding surface and drip irrigation and assessed the significance of the difference by conducting student t tests statistical tests 3 results 3 1 indicator selection we selected seventeen indicators to support a performance assessment of the change in irrigation technique in the cmv103 district of the triffa plain morocco the final assessment framework is structured around the three sustainability pillars and encompasses eight principles 13 criteria and 17 indicators table 3 this represents a sharp simplification of the initial safe framework that originally consisted of 18 principles 48 criteria and 96 indicators we removed eight pc is because they were insensitive to a change in irrigation technique rule 1 14 because they were not relevant for the study site rule 2 14 because they reflected on a system property that was outside of the farmers standpoint rule 3 16 because of the lack of data rule 4 and the remaining were eliminated according to the fifth rule besides we added four indicators identified in the literature because they had no equivalent in the safe framework or to support the assessment of criteria for which all indicators had been eliminated during the screening procedure detailed results from the selection procedure are given in the supplementary material table sm eigth of the selected indicators serve the assessment of the environmental pillar four the economic pillar and five the social pillar selected environmental indicators were related to water and energy aspects while the indicators linked to biodiversity issues were excluded due to insufficient data we kept all the principles and criteria in the economic pillar but excluded seven indicators due to insufficient data the scarcity of farm scale economic data in public records was linked to the high sparsity and variability of reliable raw economic data which hinders the compilation of such database in regional or national level besides surveyed farm holders were not always participative in disclosing such data even under the cover of anonymity if the data had been available pc i for the economic pillar would be almost identical with the original safe framework this correspondence regardless of the highly distinct agricultural context between belgium and morocco reflects the universality of the economic concerns in an agricultural project both for decision makers and for farm holders in contrast to the economic pillar we removed the majority of pc i for assessing the social pillar from the original safe framework and included three additional indicators which highlights the distinct social specificities between the two regions the definitions of the selected indicators are given in table 4 and additional information is in the supplementary material 3 2 comparative evaluation of performance in cmv103 district results indicate that conversion to drip irrigation in the cmv103 district has impact at the p 0 05 significance level on five out of the 17 performance indicators table 5 analysis of the direction and implications of the changes are detailed for each pillar of sustainability 3 2 1 environmental pillar almost all indicators exhibiting a significant change in the environmental pillar are changing in an undesirable direction the lower number of harvested species in farms using drip irrigation indicator 8 table 5 indicates the higher specialization of these farms a combination of factors might explain this higher specialization the main one is that engaging with drip irrigation involves a significant conversion of the farmers practice hence crops that are not suited to drip irrigation such as cereals are no longer cultivated another factor is that farmers using surface irrigation in cash crop orchards often take profit of the moist soil conditions prevailing in the tree inter rows to grow other crops for personal use agricultural input or local market this increases the diversity of harvested species this diversification is no more possible in farms using drip irrigation as the moist soil conditions are restricted to the immediate proximity of the root system of the primarily harvested plant however some farmers using drip irrigation practice inter row cropping on citrus tree fields when the trees are at young growing stages overall conversion to drip irrigation is often embedded in a broader strategy towards a more intensive cash crop oriented industrial agricultural practice this implies a reduction of the diversity and an increase of the specialization level table 6 energy input indicator 5 is significantly higher in drip irrigated farms however this result must be interpreted cautiously as the energy indicator is calculated based on theoretical assumption in addition it is not related to crop yield although an increase in energy use per harvested land unit might be compensated by an increase in crop yield on that same unit as found in other studies e g pergola et al 2013 no exact yield data are available to evaluate such indicator in this case study no renewable energy input was recorded in the surveyed farms indicator 6 although it has been recently observed in other farm holdings that farmers are starting to use solar panels as energy source for groundwater pumping hence drastically reducing non renewable energy consumption no significant difference is found for the hydric stress indicator indicator 2 when all fields are considered yet previous study had shown that when restricting the analysis to citrus fields i e the dominant crop in the cmv103 district the hydric stress indicator is higher p value 0 06 for citrus irrigated with drip irrigation annual number of days with hydric stress 47 as compared to surface irrigation annual number of days with hydric stress 34 feltz and vanclooster 2013 this inability to cope with hydric stress suggests that the control of irrigation timing and quantity is not optimal and that this management failure is exacerbated when using drip irrigation in addition although the statistical significance of the indicator 3 is low p value 0 1 it signals that the conversion to drip irrigation might not lead to the expected decrease in groundwater withdrawal these results highlight the poor management of the irrigation technology and the risk of failure to meet the water saving objective targeted by the npiws based on our field observations and discussions during the agricultural surveys very few farmers are using soil moisture sensor technologies to assess the need in irrigation water instead many farm holders that engaged with drip irrigation keep making decisions about irrigation timing and quantity using the same decision criteria as when using surface irrigation we observed instances of farmers in assessing crop water needs based on apparent observed soil dryness or wetness in drip irrigated fields although this practical assessment is valid for field in surface irrigation it is misleading for fields in drip irrigation and likely triggers excess irrigation in absence of rainfall soil wetness status is indeed very low outside the dripper irrigation cone these results highlight the gap between the theoretical and actual efficiency of the drip irrigation technique and the importance of considering the context into which the technique is deployed when assessing performance this also emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical training of the farmers when drip irrigation is implemented and to implement real incentive programs to encourage famers to manage water as a scarce resource despite indications that the conversion to drip irrigation could alleviate pressure on water resources the environmental performance of the farms under drip irrigation as compared to surface are either identical or lower more energy consumption lower crop diversity higher hydric stress these findings suggest that in the study area the factors motivating the farmers to use drip irrigation are not directly related to environmental concerns 3 2 2 economic pillar the conversion to drip irrigation does not appear to have a significant economic impact in the study area except for a lower diversity of income sources indicator 11 which is in accordance with the higher level of specialization revealed in the environmental pillar indicator 8 this lower diversity of income sources and crop types might make the holdings less resilient to any market shock or crop harvest failure due for instance to crop diseases the absence of significant difference regarding the longevity of the estate status indicator 12 between the two types of holdings contrast with findings from several other studies e g burnham et al 2014 salhi et al 2012 the conversion to drip irrigation indeed supposedly requires heavy financial investments that starts being profitable only after a long period and therefore requires stable conditions the fact that this assumption does not hold true in the cmv103 district may be explained by the use of cheaper technologies by some farmers among other through pumping water directly from the aquifer instead of building a reservoir the resulting drastic cost reduction can justify a conversion towards drip irrigation even when the longevity of the holding is less secured on another hand the conversion towards drip irrigation is heavily subsidized which may explain that farm holders would take the risk to convert even if case of lower stability finally results indicate that the conversion to drip irrigation does not change the annual income nor the economic balance however the results should be regarded cautiously since economic data are generally marred by high uncertainty in addition they were not disclosed by all the survey respondents 3 2 3 social pillar indicator 15 exhibits significant differences farms using drip irrigation hire more farm workers for daily operations this is to be attributed to the generally bigger farmland area of the exploitations under drip irrigation and the higher workload thereof but also indicates a clear cut difference in the daily management of the farm depending on the irrigation model the farms using surface irrigation are generally smallholder family farms with external workers hired on a punctual basis while the farms using drip irrigation tend to have a higher dependency on daily workers this result also corroborates studies that reported that a frequent criterion motivating conversion to drip irrigation is the reduction of the time that the farm manager spends in the field e g foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 the education level of farm managers indicator 16 is significantly higher in exploitations under drip irrigation none of the 13 managers in farms using surface irrigation attended vocational nor higher education while all the surveyed farm managers who received an education are practicing drip irrigation hence higher education is most likely a favorable factor for the farm holder to question the traditional irrigation system and engage with the conversion this result corroborates findings in alcon et al 2011 and salhi et al 2012 that educated farmers are more prone to decide for conversion to drip irrigation the dependency to commercial contract indicator 17 is significantly higher for farmers using drip irrigation this is because the major part of their crops is citrus for exportation and sugar beets for sugar industry both inherently dependent to contracts the agricultural models in farmers using surface irrigation are more oriented towards local market and for the consumption at the farm level therefore from a social standpoint the performance of a farm using drip irrigation is weakened due to a higher dependency to contracts in these farms owner and manager most often have a professional education land area is bigger and there are several contracted workers the conversion to drip irrigation does not impact the performance criteria supported by the 12 other indicators hence very similar percentage of irrigated farmland area indicator 14 for the two irrigation systems indicates that such land attribution is depending on decision factors that are independent from the type of irrigation practice used and that the proportion of irrigated farmland is not an incentive for a farm manager to implement the conversion to drip irrigation finally the lesser significance of the difference for indicators 13 number of commercialized crop types and 8 number of crop types including non commercialized crops i e crops grown for household consumption testifies for the more market oriented model of holdings using drip irrigation 4 discussion most indicators supporting environmental and economic performance assessment are signaling a neutral effect or undesirable alteration resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation these results support the conclusions in venot et al 2014 that drip irrigation should not be framed as an effective practice for water saving and poverty alleviation without considering the context into which it is implemented it also supports the conclusion by the same author that the conversion to drip irrigation has had little capability to improve smallholder farming these neutral or negative effects on environmental and economic factors suggests that in the study area farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors specifically the difference in farm management highlighted by indicator 15 suggests that the main drivers motivating farmers for using drip irrigation is the possibility to organize daily work tasks differently therefore implying a higher convenience and comfort improvement this has been repeatedly corroborated by discussions with the farmers and it has also been highlighted in other studies led in tunisian and algerian irrigation districts exhibiting similar farm holding models and harvest crop schemes foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 indeed in the study region surface irrigation requires substantial human labor for water application and distribution which is typically executed by workers hired on a punctual basis and whose guidance and supervision is highly time consuming for the farm manager inversely drip irrigation is more automated and less labor intensive thereof which supposedly eliminates the need for punctual workers hiring and training social and cultural reasons were also pointed by alcon et al 2011 foltz 2003 salhi et al 2012 and wanvoeke et al 2016 as determinant motivators for engaging with drip irrigation technologies wanvoeke et al 2016 indicated specifically that in their burkinabe study area this engagement is primarily linked with advantages such as access to attractive credits higher social prestige and resulting opportunities to create new alliances the higher dependency to contract for farms under drip irrigation revealed in this study aligns with many studies e g berbel and mateos 2014 boelens and vos 2012 lopez gunn et al 2012 olmstead 2010 van der kooij et al 2013a van halsema and vincent 2012 venot et al 2014 these studies showed that the conversion to drip irrigation is often used to modernize infrastructures and comply with export companies requirements overall the findings in this study question the significance of the national plan for irrigation water saving pneei under the plan maroc vert targeting the conversion of 50 of irrigated land to drip irrigation it highlights that environmental concerns are not sufficient incentive for farmers to weight into their operational decisions this stresses the need to complement the subsidy programs by real incentives such as pricing measures to motivate farmers to conserve water and training programs to support farmers for an optimal operation and management of the drip irrigation technology several drawbacks limited the scope of this study which calls for additional work on the topic the first and major one is linked to data scarcity limited data caused the exclusion of numerous performance indicators and compromised the reliability of some of the final indicators among others all indicators related to quality concerns water pollution soil salinization etc were excluded although this component is crucial for a truly holistic assessment of irrigation practices causes of data scarcity were the limited pool of pre existing data and the restriction to data access by institutional authorities and the limited time and funding to deploy instrumentation network and grow the pool of agricultural surveys another drawback is that the study didn t incorporate the temporal dimension instead to cope with the lack of data that would have allowed evaluating the performance of a farm holding prior and after the conversion to drip irrigation the holdings that were still using surface irrigation were used as a proxy for the holding of the drip irrigation farms prior to their conversion although this simplification is acceptable to gain preliminary knowledge and understanding results still need to be regarded with caution due to possible differences in farm typology and farmer profiles existing prior to the conversion the problem of data scarcity is a common and widespread issue in agricultural studies in developing countries e g bastiaanssen et al 2007 hamid et al 2011 kharrou et al 2013 therefore this study is an additional instance highlighting the need for a data collection and storage program and strategy at the institutional level such program should include i the conduction of repeated agricultural census ii the deployment of monitoring network to track the temporal evolution of key environmental variables and adapt management as needed iii the cleaning and storage of historic and new data in a central database iv a lift of the institutional barrier that make the data acquisition a very time and resources consuming if not impossible process lastly no reference values were proposed to evaluate the absolute values taken by the indicators such references would have been difficult to determine because of their high dependency to the socio economic and environmental specificities of the region under study the comparative assessment between farms using surface irrigation and farms using drip irrigation allows to overcome this difficulty it allows to measure the direction and amplitude of any possible change while integrating the specificities of the region 5 conclusions a framework to support a comparative integrated assessment of the performance of farm holdings using traditional surface irrigation and those that engaged with a new irrigation technique was defined and applied to the cmv103 irrigation district in the triffa agricultural plain in eastern morocco results indicate that the conversion from surface to drip irrigation in the study area led to neutral or negative effects on environmental and economic aspects while most significant beneficial effects were detected for the social pillar as drip irrigation allows structural changes in the holding the latter result suggests that the objectives pursued by the farm holders engaging with the drip irrigation technique are different from the objectives underlying the subsidy programs led under the moroccan national plan for irrigation water saving under the plan maroc vert results indicate that farmers do not consider the need to reduce consumption when planning their irrigation scheme and stress that environmental concerns are not sufficient incentive to motivate farmers for irrigation water saving this divergence in the objectives might undermine the success of the plan in targeting water scarcity issue and therefore calls for a more meaningful engagement and training of the farmers along with raising awareness about the water scarcity issue prevailing in the region more generally results from the study are confirming that despite the high theoretical water use efficiency of the drip irrigation technology its performance when evaluated at the farm holding scale is far less obvious therefore the decision to engage with that technique should be based on a multi level criteria evaluation despite the conduction of surveys with the farmers the institutional and long term monitoring data scarcity context into which this study was implemented was a major obstacle and compromises the robustness of the results this calls for the institutionalization of the data standardization centralization the release of the data in public database along with the implementation of continuous monitoring programs to track and scrutinize the state of the natural resources and the agricultural activities contributions aa work synthesis and writing of the manuscript nf project instigator

11269,water scarcity has threatened the food security and been a critical concern in china promoting modern agricultural irrigation technologies has been identified as an important measure against water scarcity the overall goal of this study was to analyze the adoption of water saving irrigation technology by farmers and to identify the major influencing factors of this decision for metropolis suburbs based on a field survey of beijing of china the results showed that 53 1 of farmers adopted water saving irrigation technologies to cope with water scarcity most of which adopted engineering water saving technologies the number of adopted water saving irrigation technologies followed a strong negative correlation with the share of adopters econometric analysis revealed that education farm size on farm demonstration cooperative training groundwater access to information water use associations drought prone area neighboring farmers and policy subsidies significantly improved the adaption to water scarcity age production specialization and cost posed a negative effect on famers adoption of water saving irrigation technologies these results and implications provide an understanding of farmers sustainable irrigation practices and offer an insight to influencing factors to frame improved strategies and policies that enable to cope with water scarcity of metropolis suburbs keywords water saving irrigation technology farmers adoption water scarcity metropolis suburbs china 1 introduction water scarcity and drought have been of critical concern and pose severe threats to both food security and economy throughout many parts of the world alam 2015 chen et al 2014 about 40 of the global population lives in regions where water resources are over allocated due to scarcity and competition wheeler et al 2015 water shortage in china is very severe particularly in the north and northwest of the country zhang et al 2013 with water scarcity becoming an increasing constraint for food production in northern china the pressure to procure sufficient agricultural water is growing and has been the most important factor to threaten china s food security chen et al 2014 yang et al 2003 in light of increasingly severe water scarcity conditions appropriate measures were taken to mitigate its impacts for china despite an improvement of water use efficiency in the agricultural sector from about 40 in 2006 to nearly 50 in 2013 it is very low compared to the 70 to 90 reached by most developed countries deng et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 in addition future climate change will further require irrigators to improve irrigation water use efficiency thus enabling a decreased reliance on water as input wallace 2000 wheeler et al 2015 more widespread use of water saving irrigation is one central way to promote water conservation in irrigated areas nikouei et al 2012 peck et al 2004 in the water saving irrigation extension system how to apply water saving technologies is key for the production practice to achieve better economic social and environmental benefits this has aroused concern on how to promote the adoption of water saving irrigation by producers for instance bjornlund et al 2009 indicated that the major drivers for the adoption of improved irrigation technologies and management practices were to ensure the security of the water supply during droughts to increase quantity and quality of crops and to decrease the costs involved alam 2015 reported that farmers with more experience of farming better schooling more secure tenure rights better access to electricity and institutional facilities and an awareness of climatic effects are more likely to embrace adaptation strategies to avoid water scarcity cremades et al 2015 emphasized that governmental subsidies and extension service policies have played an important role in promoting the adoption of modern irrigation technology however the majority of adoption studies to date focused on rural areas and major grain producing areas while studies specifically focusing on agriculture in metropolis suburbs are rare abdulai et al 2011 alam 2015 cai and rosegrant 2004 mostafa and fujimoto 2014 wang et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2013 agriculture is an essential component of the sustainable development of metropolis it plays an important role to ensure steady farmers income and thus promote rural economic development the important function of agriculture is to serve the metropolis generating as stable supply of safe agricultural products improving the ecological environment as well as enhancing leisure tourism and cultural education for citizens with the enormous population and limited area of metropolis increasing demand for water from urban and industrial sectors exert increased pressure on agricultural water nikouei et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 however farmers in metropolis suburbs are different from those of other areas benefiting from multi channels of revenue sources multi functions of agricultural production higher production requirements and increased pressure on environmental resources this leads to differences in farmers attitudes and adoption behaviors of water saving irrigation technology wsit in metropolis suburbs and rural areas studies are required that investigate metropolis suburbs in light of water scarcity to increase our understanding of farmers adoption behaviors and influencing factors to ultimately promote a sustainable development of agriculture beijing located on the northern north china plain of china is a metropolis with more than 21 7 million people in 2015 making it one of the world s most water scarce cities nbsc 2016 in this area water resources per capita 124 0 m3 are far below the national average of 2039 2 m3 which is only 1 4 of the world s average cheng et al 2015 nbsc 2016 therefore the objective of this study was to provide an understanding of farmers sustainable irrigation practices used to cope with water stress in water scarcity environments of beijing china furthermore identifying major factors that influence farmers adoption of wsit in the study area is a further important research aim the results obtained in the present study provide insights that could help goverments to understand barriers and drivers of farmers adoption of wsit the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows the next section provides a brief overview and classification of wsit section 3 considers theoretical arguments while also discussing the conceptual framework and hypothesis section 4 presents the empirical model and data section 5 discusses empirical results the final section provides conclusions and policy implications 2 water saving irrigation technology for crop irrigation ideal water efficiency refers to reducing losses caused by evaporation runoff or subsurface drainage while increasing production yang 2012 water saving irrigation is required to reduce agricultural water waste while timely and fully meeting the requirements of crop water using wsit not only saves water and increases production it also improves the nutrition of agricultural products ensuring food safety by improving the environment abdulai et al 2011 cremades et al 2015 jalota et al 2009 wang et al 2002 water saving includes the entire irrigation process all measures techniques and methods for reducing water loss and improving water use efficiency are part of water saving irrigation fig 1 shows that agricultural irrigation water from water sources to final crop use has undergone roughly three stages during the first state the water was drawn from the water source and moved to the field through canals during this process there will be leakage seepage and further means of water loss during the second state the water is drawn from the field to the crop root system to facilitate water absorption by the crops this is also the traditional irrigation concept including traditional irrigation e g flood irrigation and furrow irrigation and modern irrigation e g drip irrigation and micro sprinkler irrigation the final state accompanies the whole process of crop growth where water from the roots of the crop is transported throughout the entire plant which is also the ultimate use of water resources for crop growth the core of water saving irrigation lies in minimizing water loss during these three processes while improving the efficiency of water resources utilization various definitions for the adaption options against water scarcity have been classified to make these easy to understand for farmers chen et al 2014 classified the adaptation options against drought as types of either engineering e g investment or maintenance options or non engineering e g technological regulatory or market options alam 2015 defined adaptation as the increased use of surface water increased use of ground water crop diversification and calendar adjustment all of which are changed land use strategies to cope with drought pereira et al 2002 summarized adaptation methods to drought including supplemental irrigation deficit irrigation improved irrigation methods and performance distribution uniformity and various soil and water conservation practices since we collected information on whether farmers have actually adopted wsit our analysis investigated adaptation practices of adopting wsit rather than of potential adaptation options and other adaptation measures based on theoretical analysis and personal experience during a field survey we classified the wsit as types of engineering water saving technology ewst agricultural water saving technology awst biological and chemical water saving technology bcwst and managerial water saving technology mwst fig 2 ewst is mainly accomplished through the construction of a variety of water saving irrigation projects that reduce water consumption including the delivery of water the distribution of water the irrigation of water and other processes of water leakage and evaporation to improve the utilization of irrigation water chen et al 2014 wang et al 2002 awst is mainly accomplished through specific measures that control the field of water and optimize the production structure while improving water use efficiency jiménez and chávez 2003 zou et al 2013 bcwst is a real time and reasonable irrigation system that promotes crop growth with biological and chemical technology it also involves the use of biotechnology for breeding and cultivating of crop varieties that are drought resistant and water saving wang et al 2007 mwst can achieve a reasonable allocation of irrigation water resources and an optimal scheduling of irrigation measures to reach a specific target which is deriving the maximum benefit from limited water resources gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 naranjo gil 2017 reilly et al 2003 3 conceptual framework and hypothesis according to the theory of innovation diffusion rogers 2003 the innovation decision process is an information seeking and information processing activity with five steps in the farmers adoption process including knowledge of an adoption persuasion to form an attitude decision implementation and confirmation either reinforcement or rejection based on the theory of planned behavior farmers adoption behaviors have been shown to be related to multiple factors ajzen 1991 previous studies reported that an economic incentive social capital natural environment technical characteristics family and farm characteristics and other factors significantly affected farmers adoptions of agricultural technologies abdulai et al 2011 alam 2015 bjornlund et al 2009 chen et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 nikouei et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in this study we developed a conceptual framework suggesting that farmers adoption of wsit is a result of common influence of householder characteristics family characteristics farm characteristics production conditions perceptions of technology and environmental factors the conceptual framework is shown in fig 3 3 1 householder characteristics some characteristics of the surveyed households tend to influence the adoption of irrigation technologies abdulai et al 2011 the probability for the adoption of irrigation technologies declines with increasing age abdulai and huffman 2005 wang et al 2015 the education level of farmers played an important role in the adoption of modern irrigation technology alam 2015 cremades et al 2015 fernandez cornejo et al 2005 saha and schwart 1994 better educated farmers are often in a better position to understand and appreciate the advantages of adopting irrigation technologies this finding is consistent with the notion that education is important in helping farmers to reach decisions about adopting new innovations and technologies abdulai and huffman 2005 abdulai et al 2011 farming experience affects farmers decision making behavior hisali et al 2011 seekao and pharino 2016 alam 2015 suggested that the greater the experiences in agricultural farming the more likely farmers would be to adopt alternative adaptation strategies based on this we hypothesized that h1 householder characteristics are related to farmers adoption of wsit 3 2 family characteristics the family is the basic unit for farmers to engage in agricultural production household size and production specialization are the main family characteristics as pointed out by previous studies farmers adoption decisions are influenced by household size abdulai et al 2011 bekele and drake 2003 mariano et al 2012 in contrast chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 found that the likelihood for an adoption behavior of farmers is not significantly related to household size thus we assume that a larger household size will lead to a better chance wsit adoption moreover adoption of agricultural innovations is also linked to off farm income through managerial time fernandez cornejo et al 2005 deressa et al 2009 indicated that both the farm income and nonfarm income have a significant relationship with the adoption behavior furthermore total income was found to be related to the adoption decision of agriculture goswami et al 2012 to address this concern the production specialization was used as a household income index that refers to the proportion of farm income to the total income in line with this suggestion we hypothesized that h2 family characteristics will affect farmers adoption of wsit 3 3 farm characteristics in general farm size is based on the total cultivable acres in operation both owned and rented mariano et al 2012 abdulai et al 2011 noted that farm size which normally indicates wealth was frequently used in adoption models to capture the impact of wealth on the decision process studies on adoption of agricultural technologies indicate that farm size exerts both negative and positive effects on adoption indicating that the effect of farm size on technology adoption is inconclusive bradshaw et al 2004 deressa et al 2009 the studies confirm that farm size influences farmers adoption of novel agricultural technologies alam 2015 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 goswami et al 2012 on farm easy informal demonstrations are the most effective extension conditions which allow the farmers to enhance their own autodidactic approach badrage et al 2009 previous studies show on farm demonstration to be an effective way to transfer technology by improving farmers adoption of agricultural technologies barao 1992 participating in a cooperative helps farmers to enter social networks for the flow of information which tends to enhance the adoption of new agricultural technologies bandiera and rasul 2006 abdulai et al 2011 and mariano et al 2012 suggested that being a member of a farmer s cooperatives increases the probability to adopt new agricultural technologies based on these publications we hypothesized that h3 farm characteristics will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 4 production conditions training seems to be an effective tool to improve knowledge cunha et al 2014 attendance of agricultural technology training encourages adoption since exposure to information reduces subjective uncertainty about the technology mariano et al 2012 based on this we assumed the attendance by farmers at training sessions had a positive impact on the adoption of wsit market was identified as an important determinant of adoption since markets also served as a platform for farmers to exchange information gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 market access is an important factor to affect adoption of agricultural technologies feder et al 1985 greater distance between the farm and the nearest market indicates poor access which will constrain adoption mariano et al 2012 the two main sources of agricultural water ground and surface water are regulated separately yoo et al 2013 the water source has a significant influence on the adoption of wsit for farmers green et al 1996 previous studies confirmed that farmers exclusively using groundwater are more likely to adopt modern irrigation technology alam 2015 caswell and zilberman 1985 cremades et al 2015 yang et al 2003 therefore we hypothesized that h4 production conditions will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 5 perceptions of technology information is the foundation of any adoption farmers generally adopt agricultural technologies only if they fully understand the provided technical information negatu and parikh 1999 in particular when the respective technologies involve different practices information is critical for their adoption abdulai et al 2011 clear associations exist between the access to technical information and the level of adoption of agricultural technology wang et al 2015 moreover an adoption of modern irrigation technology occurs when incremental net benefits of the modern irrigation technology exceed its cost dridi and khanna 2005 farmers subjective perceptions of the costs of adoption are key factors to adoption bandiera and rasul 2006 consequently the following hypothesis has been derived h5 perceptions of technology will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 6 environmental factors in general water use associations wuas are voluntary non governmental nonprofit and have been established and are managed by a group of irrigators wuas have become the dominant form of irrigation in several areas wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 examined which wuas play a significant role in promoting water productivity among households that belong to a wua in northern china previous studies found that adoption of irrigation technology is positively and significantly related to the natural and geographical environments cremades et al 2015 schuck et al 2005 when the resource is scarce the technology needed to save the resource is more likely to be adopted ruttan and hayami 1984 correspondingly farmers are more willing to adopt wsit in water scarcity regions cai and rosegrant 2004 caswell and zilberman 1986 schuck et al 2005 shrestha and gopalakrishnan 1993 moreover between neighboring farmers it is important to model extension and diffusion of agricultural technology jørs et al 2016 islam et al 2013 reported that neighboring farmers adoption influenced farmers adoption of agricultural technology finally policy subsidies cut the cost of technology and provide important incentives for farmers to adopt wsit bjornlund et al 2009 blanke et al 2007 cremades et al 2015 dinar et al 1992 nikouei et al 2012 wheeler et al 2015 more importantly when subsidies are available for farmers they are more likely to adopt irrigation technologies cremades et al 2015 therefore we assumed that h6 environmental factors will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 4 empirical model and data sources 4 1 empirical model most of the technology choices that farmers consider for their decision making are of a use or do not use nature mariano et al 2012 in this study responding farmers were asked whether they used wsit or not the advantage of the binary logit choice model was used to analyze the choice between two categories and the model is widely used in the adoption research abdulai et al 2011 chen et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 goswami et al 2012 mariano et al 2012 therefore each farmer s choice is represented by a dummy variable y i 1 if the farmer adopts wsit 0 if the farmer does not adopt wsit to better quantify the influences of different factors on farmer decisions to adopt wsit based on our framework we constructed a binary model as follows 1 ln p i 1 p i α n 1 n β n x n i where the dependent variable pi represents the probability of technology adoption α represents the intercept parameter β represents the vector of regression coefficients and x x 1 xn denotes a vector of n independent variables e g householder family and farm characteristics when the dependent variable is also the categorical variable an ordinary least squares ols estimation method is not effective due to the nonlinearity of the relationship therefore a maximum likelihood estimation mle method is required for the logit regression model mzoughi 2011 pampel 2000 importantly the estimated parameters are not directly tied to the actual magnitude of change but only provide the direction of the effect of independent variables in the logit regression model deressa et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 we determined the marginal effects to analyze the level of contribution of the factors that influence farmers adoption of wsit alam 2015 wang et al 2015 the marginal effect was defined as the effect of a unit change in x while all other factors remained constant on the probability that a farmer chose to adopt wsit mariano et al 2012 it can be shown that 2 δ p i δ x i all other x consant p i x i 4 2 data and definition of variables to meet the objectives of this research and study the behavior of farmers regarding their adoption of wsit as well as the factors that influenced this behavior we designed a structured questionnaire with several aspects first we collected basic characteristics about farmers their family and their farms e g age education income and farm size second data about the adoption of wsit was to be collected as the focus of our data collection furthermore we also recorded other information such as training access to information cost and policy subsidies the data used in this study were collected from one field survey via face to face interview in beijing during 2015 it was conducted in the top seven crop producing districts of beijing including daxing changping fangshan huairou shunyi miyun and tongzhou after approval by the beijing municipal bureau of agriculture each district elected one outstanding agricultural technology extension worker as investigator who was then trained on the questionnaire content and specific considerations from us then stratified random sampling was used in field surveys first villages were chosen from each district via a system sampling technique based on spatial location and their geographical position was dispersed then we chose several farmers in each selected village via simple random sampling method a total of 490 valid samples originated from 121 villages of seven districts the data were widely distributed therefore we considered the data to be representative of the overall population of the entire study area in the remainder of this paper both the descriptive statistical analysis and the econometric analysis refer to this sample of 490 farmers the definitions and descriptive statistics of explanatory variables used for the binary model are provided in table 1 on average farmers were 49 84 years of age had 9 68 years of formal schooling 14 71 years of farm experience and approximately four household members for production specialization most farmers had other jobs and farm income formed only part of their total family income the mean farm size was 0 32 ha the proportion of farmers that belonged to demonstration farmers was 34 4 and 48 6 farmers had joined cooperatives the rate of farmer attendance to training was 88 0 and the mean distance between farm and the nearest market was 5 49 km however perceptions of technology were poor such as access to information was difficult and connected to high input cost only 17 8 of farmers have been members of wuas and 29 1 had access to policy subsidies most fields are prone to drought but had better adoption environment from neighboring farmers 5 results and discussion 5 1 farmers adoption of water saving irrigation technologies the field surveys showed that half of the farmers took water saving action in response to drought for example of the 260 farmers who faced drought during the study period 53 1 adopted wsit table 2 of those farmers who were able to apply wsit in response to water scarcity further analyses indicate that 79 2 adopted ewst this is understandable as the water saving effect of ewst is remarkable the facilities and equipment can be reused for a long period of time and maintenance is simple in addition 52 3 of these farmers adopted awst to make full use of the provided advantages including simple operation and lower cost operating the equipment needed for mwst and bcwst is more difficult and requires a higher level of professionalism which is difficult for many farmers to master this leads to the relatively low adoption of both technologies for example the share of farmers adopting bcwst and mwst accounted for 31 2 and 36 9 respectively further analysis revealed that six technologies were adopted at more than 25 in the survey of 23 specific types of wsit table 3 these are drip irrigation technology 41 9 field coverage technology 39 6 field cultivation technology 36 9 reasonable irrigation system 28 5 on film irrigation technology 28 1 and drought resistant varieties 26 5 the highest rate of adoption of a specific technology in each of the four types of wsit was drip irrigation technology ewst field coverage technology awst drought resistant and water saving varieties bcwst and reasonable irrigation system mwst it is worth noting that the adoption of 10 types of wsit remained below 10 and three types remained below 5 examples of some of these minimally adopted technologies include chemical reagent water saving using impervious membranes and concrete anti seepage technology according to our understanding based on our survey of farmers adoption of wsit adoption of a technology occurs when the technology has reached a high degree of maturity is easy to operate causes low cost and offers obvious benefits in contrast when the technology is high cost complicated to operate requires a high degree of professional knowledge and does not offer an immediate benefit farmers are not likely to adopt them however the water saving effect is a result of the interaction of a number of wsit the results show that a strong negative correlation existed between the number of wsit adopted and the share of adopters fig 4 the share of farmers who adopted two technologies in combination was maximal accounting for 20 8 and 20 4 of adopters who had only used single wsit when the farmers used a small amount of wsit the effect was better with the increasing number of adopted technologies the benefits of wsit gradually decreased while the cost of investment increased this led to a reduction in overall efficiency which caused farmers to abandon the increase of other wsit 5 2 estimation results of the econometric model we used stata 14 0 software to estimate the logit model and marginal effects the results are shown in table 4 the chi squared test statistic was significant at the 1 level implying joint significance of the wsit adoption variables mariano et al 2012 the pseudo r2 values of the logit model were 0 363 which is a reasonably high value for a multivariate analysis based on cross sectional data wang et al 2015 importantly 14 of the 18 selected variables were significant at a 10 level of significance in the logit model therefore the logit model developed in this study was effective and explained the farmers adoption of wsit 5 3 householder characteristics as expected older farmers had a lower probability of wsit adoption for instance a unit increase in age of the householder resulted in a 1 1 decline in the probability of adoption of wsit education is one of the key determinants for adopting wsit results of table 4 indicate that education appeared to have a positive effect on the adoption of wsit according to the calculated results on the marginal effects a one unit year increase of schooling led to a 0 4 increase in the probability of adoption while the effect on the remaining options was negligible as suggested by mariano et al 2012 farmers who are better educated have greater ability to process information and search for technologies that are suitable for their production constraints compared to farmers who are less educated these results reinforced the findings of other studies showing that farmer characteristics were significantly related to the choice of adoption alam 2015 mzoughi 2011 torkamani and shajari 2007 wang et al 2015 5 4 family characteristics the coefficient of the production specialization variable was negative and statistically significant for farmer s adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that each additional unit in production specialization reduced the probability of wsit adoption by 1 4 these results indicate that farmers with higher production specialization were less likely to have the ability to withstand risks arising from the adoption of wsit this finding suggests that reducing risk is an important pathway for promoting the adoption of wsit by farmers barham et al 2015 for adoption of wsit increasing household size did not significantly reduce the probability although the coefficient was negative 5 5 farm characteristics as for control variables results show that farm size had a positive and significant impact on the adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that a unit ha of increase in farm size increased the probability of farmers wsit adoption by 2 as noted by filho et al 1999 and wang et al 2015 farmers with larger farms are more likely to adopt new agricultural technologies compared to those with smaller farms the positive effect of farm size for the adoption is consistent with the findings of this study this is probably because larger farms contribute to highlight a number of shortcomings of traditional irrigation such as time consumption and labor intensity and waste of water resources which drives farmers to pay more attention to save resources and reduce costs via wsit adoption the on farm demonstration variable shows a significantly positive sign in the adoption equation indicating that farmers who participated in on farm demonstrations were more likely to adopt wsit more importantly the marginal effects revealed that if farmers had participated in on farm demonstration their likelihood of adoption of wsit increased by 31 5 similarly results in table 4 indicate a positive and significant correlation between being a member of cooperatives and the likelihood of adoption of wsit to cope with water scarcity marginal effects indicated that if a farmer participated in a cooperative the likelihood of adoption of wsit increased by 31 1 these results imply that on farm demonstration and cooperative tremendously promotes the adoption and diffusion of wsit 5 6 production conditions as predicted by hypothesis h4 some production conditions correlate with farmers decisions to adopt wsit for example results show that attendance at training sessions had a significant positive influence on farmers wsit adoption probability marginal effects indicated that if farmers received training on agricultural technology their probability of adoption of wsit increased by 26 4 moreover the estimated results also showed that the groundwater variable were significantly positive at the 1 level on farmers adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that compared to other farmers the likelihood of wsit adoption by farmers with groundwater for irrigation increased by 12 1 5 7 perceptions of technology the perceptions of technology significantly influenced the farmers adoption of wsit the coefficient for the access to information was significant and positive suggesting that farmers who have easily access to information of technology were more likely to adopt wsit this result confirms the importance of information for the farmers adoption of agricultural technologies mariano et al 2012 marginal effects suggested that the access to information increased the likelihood of wsit adoption by 7 9 in contrast the results of this analysis reconfirmed that increasing cost significantly decreased the likelihood of wsit adoption the probability of wsit adoption was 8 8 lower when the cost increased by one unit based on farmers small scale production high cost improved the barrier of adoption with respect to capital input mzoughi 2011 suggested that farmers are more likely to adopt technology which reduces production costs this result implies that it is important to reduce the cost of a farmer s initial investment for wsit adoption to effectively promote a technology s popularization and application 5 8 environmental factors as predicted by hypothesis h6 the results show that environmental factors significantly influenced farmers wsit adoption first wuas posed a significant positive influence on farmers adoption of wsit for example a farmer who is a member of wuas is 24 0 more likely to adopt wsit second results indicate that farmers who were exposed to drought were encouraged to use wsit technology adoption in such adverse areas is higher by 2 2 ongoing water scarcity in combination with future anticipated drought conditions increased the likelihood of farmers who use wsit to appreciate water resources and improve irrigation efficiency in addition the variable of neighboring farmers had a significantly positive impact at the 1 level regarding wsit adoption the results for marginal effects indicated that if neighboring farmers adopted wsit the probability of farmer s adoption increased by 18 8 finally we also noted the importance of policy subsidies to farmers decisions to adopt wsit based on estimation results the coefficient of policy subsidies is significantly positive in the model implying that there is a positive relationship between policy subsidies and the adoption of wsit in other words if farmers had access to policy subsidies the possibility that they will adopt wsit increases by 19 5 based on these findings it can be concluded that improving the environments farmers face can help to promote wsit adoption 6 conclusions and policy implications based on field surveys conducted in beijing china this study examined farmers practices when facing water scarcity and identified the major factors that affect farmers decisions on whether or not to adopt wsit to alleviate water scarcity the results show that when facing water scarcity about half of the farmers 53 1 in beijing adopted wsit for those farmers the results of the analysis indicate that 79 2 52 3 31 2 and 36 9 adopted ewst awst mwst and bcwst respectively it is also worth noting that the results show a strong negative correlation between the number of wsit adopted and the share of adopters further analysis from the utilized econometric model indicates that farmers adoption decisions on wsit are a result of common influence of householder characteristics family characteristics farm characteristics production conditions perceptions of technology and environmental factors in detail education farm size participation in on farm demonstration cooperative training groundwater access to information wuas drought prone area neighboring farmers and policy subsidies significantly improved farmers adaption to water scarcity while age production specialization and cost posed a negative effect on famers adoption of wsit the results of this study have several potential policy implications first there is significant room for the government to promote wsit extension against water scarcity based on farmers production demand differential promotion measures will be conducted to help farmers adopt wsit for the sustainable development of agriculture in metropolis suburbs second improving performance increasing the stability and reducing the cost of wsit is a way to help farmers reduce adoption barriers for example farmers were more likely to adopt wsit if the technology had a high degree of maturity and was easy to operate according to field surveys and interviews farmers encountered many wsit problems such as quickly aging equipment and ease of breakdown having a short service life being ineffectual and being complex to operate third the results of this analysis reconfirm that increasing cost significantly decreases the likelihood of wsit adoption results indicate that 54 4 of farmers thought the costs of wsit were high this finding suggests that reducing cost is important to drive farmers to adopt wsit fourth the results indicated a positive relationship between policy subsidies and the adoption of wsit therefore in future local governments may need to continue to expand their policy of supporting farmers to adopt wsit against water scarcity such as subsidies extension policies and technical services lastly the study also reveals that improving farmers social capital and environments for the adoption of wsit can play an important role to help farmers against water scarcity for example policies that aimed at promoting the adoption of wsit need to emphasize the critical role of providing timely and accurate information on improved techniques and water scarcity then the government should encourage and guide farmers to take part in wuas on farm demonstrations and cooperatives through incentives and demonstration measures moreover local governments should also offer education and training programs to help farmers improve their understanding of the necessity to improve water use efficiency and to increase their capacity to use innovative practices or technologies overall the aims of this study have been achieved however it is also worth noting that our study only focused on farmers adoption of wsit and factors influencing whether they adopted wsit against water scarcity factors influencing farmers adoption of different types and number of wsit are also important and provide interesting research topics for future studies finally we also believe that the results and implications of this study are important for the extension of wsit under conditions of water scarcity and drought of other metropolis across the world acknowledgement this work was supported by the beijing social science foundation 16yja007 and beijing leafy vegetables innovation team of modern agro industry technology

11269,water scarcity has threatened the food security and been a critical concern in china promoting modern agricultural irrigation technologies has been identified as an important measure against water scarcity the overall goal of this study was to analyze the adoption of water saving irrigation technology by farmers and to identify the major influencing factors of this decision for metropolis suburbs based on a field survey of beijing of china the results showed that 53 1 of farmers adopted water saving irrigation technologies to cope with water scarcity most of which adopted engineering water saving technologies the number of adopted water saving irrigation technologies followed a strong negative correlation with the share of adopters econometric analysis revealed that education farm size on farm demonstration cooperative training groundwater access to information water use associations drought prone area neighboring farmers and policy subsidies significantly improved the adaption to water scarcity age production specialization and cost posed a negative effect on famers adoption of water saving irrigation technologies these results and implications provide an understanding of farmers sustainable irrigation practices and offer an insight to influencing factors to frame improved strategies and policies that enable to cope with water scarcity of metropolis suburbs keywords water saving irrigation technology farmers adoption water scarcity metropolis suburbs china 1 introduction water scarcity and drought have been of critical concern and pose severe threats to both food security and economy throughout many parts of the world alam 2015 chen et al 2014 about 40 of the global population lives in regions where water resources are over allocated due to scarcity and competition wheeler et al 2015 water shortage in china is very severe particularly in the north and northwest of the country zhang et al 2013 with water scarcity becoming an increasing constraint for food production in northern china the pressure to procure sufficient agricultural water is growing and has been the most important factor to threaten china s food security chen et al 2014 yang et al 2003 in light of increasingly severe water scarcity conditions appropriate measures were taken to mitigate its impacts for china despite an improvement of water use efficiency in the agricultural sector from about 40 in 2006 to nearly 50 in 2013 it is very low compared to the 70 to 90 reached by most developed countries deng et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 in addition future climate change will further require irrigators to improve irrigation water use efficiency thus enabling a decreased reliance on water as input wallace 2000 wheeler et al 2015 more widespread use of water saving irrigation is one central way to promote water conservation in irrigated areas nikouei et al 2012 peck et al 2004 in the water saving irrigation extension system how to apply water saving technologies is key for the production practice to achieve better economic social and environmental benefits this has aroused concern on how to promote the adoption of water saving irrigation by producers for instance bjornlund et al 2009 indicated that the major drivers for the adoption of improved irrigation technologies and management practices were to ensure the security of the water supply during droughts to increase quantity and quality of crops and to decrease the costs involved alam 2015 reported that farmers with more experience of farming better schooling more secure tenure rights better access to electricity and institutional facilities and an awareness of climatic effects are more likely to embrace adaptation strategies to avoid water scarcity cremades et al 2015 emphasized that governmental subsidies and extension service policies have played an important role in promoting the adoption of modern irrigation technology however the majority of adoption studies to date focused on rural areas and major grain producing areas while studies specifically focusing on agriculture in metropolis suburbs are rare abdulai et al 2011 alam 2015 cai and rosegrant 2004 mostafa and fujimoto 2014 wang et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2013 agriculture is an essential component of the sustainable development of metropolis it plays an important role to ensure steady farmers income and thus promote rural economic development the important function of agriculture is to serve the metropolis generating as stable supply of safe agricultural products improving the ecological environment as well as enhancing leisure tourism and cultural education for citizens with the enormous population and limited area of metropolis increasing demand for water from urban and industrial sectors exert increased pressure on agricultural water nikouei et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 however farmers in metropolis suburbs are different from those of other areas benefiting from multi channels of revenue sources multi functions of agricultural production higher production requirements and increased pressure on environmental resources this leads to differences in farmers attitudes and adoption behaviors of water saving irrigation technology wsit in metropolis suburbs and rural areas studies are required that investigate metropolis suburbs in light of water scarcity to increase our understanding of farmers adoption behaviors and influencing factors to ultimately promote a sustainable development of agriculture beijing located on the northern north china plain of china is a metropolis with more than 21 7 million people in 2015 making it one of the world s most water scarce cities nbsc 2016 in this area water resources per capita 124 0 m3 are far below the national average of 2039 2 m3 which is only 1 4 of the world s average cheng et al 2015 nbsc 2016 therefore the objective of this study was to provide an understanding of farmers sustainable irrigation practices used to cope with water stress in water scarcity environments of beijing china furthermore identifying major factors that influence farmers adoption of wsit in the study area is a further important research aim the results obtained in the present study provide insights that could help goverments to understand barriers and drivers of farmers adoption of wsit the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows the next section provides a brief overview and classification of wsit section 3 considers theoretical arguments while also discussing the conceptual framework and hypothesis section 4 presents the empirical model and data section 5 discusses empirical results the final section provides conclusions and policy implications 2 water saving irrigation technology for crop irrigation ideal water efficiency refers to reducing losses caused by evaporation runoff or subsurface drainage while increasing production yang 2012 water saving irrigation is required to reduce agricultural water waste while timely and fully meeting the requirements of crop water using wsit not only saves water and increases production it also improves the nutrition of agricultural products ensuring food safety by improving the environment abdulai et al 2011 cremades et al 2015 jalota et al 2009 wang et al 2002 water saving includes the entire irrigation process all measures techniques and methods for reducing water loss and improving water use efficiency are part of water saving irrigation fig 1 shows that agricultural irrigation water from water sources to final crop use has undergone roughly three stages during the first state the water was drawn from the water source and moved to the field through canals during this process there will be leakage seepage and further means of water loss during the second state the water is drawn from the field to the crop root system to facilitate water absorption by the crops this is also the traditional irrigation concept including traditional irrigation e g flood irrigation and furrow irrigation and modern irrigation e g drip irrigation and micro sprinkler irrigation the final state accompanies the whole process of crop growth where water from the roots of the crop is transported throughout the entire plant which is also the ultimate use of water resources for crop growth the core of water saving irrigation lies in minimizing water loss during these three processes while improving the efficiency of water resources utilization various definitions for the adaption options against water scarcity have been classified to make these easy to understand for farmers chen et al 2014 classified the adaptation options against drought as types of either engineering e g investment or maintenance options or non engineering e g technological regulatory or market options alam 2015 defined adaptation as the increased use of surface water increased use of ground water crop diversification and calendar adjustment all of which are changed land use strategies to cope with drought pereira et al 2002 summarized adaptation methods to drought including supplemental irrigation deficit irrigation improved irrigation methods and performance distribution uniformity and various soil and water conservation practices since we collected information on whether farmers have actually adopted wsit our analysis investigated adaptation practices of adopting wsit rather than of potential adaptation options and other adaptation measures based on theoretical analysis and personal experience during a field survey we classified the wsit as types of engineering water saving technology ewst agricultural water saving technology awst biological and chemical water saving technology bcwst and managerial water saving technology mwst fig 2 ewst is mainly accomplished through the construction of a variety of water saving irrigation projects that reduce water consumption including the delivery of water the distribution of water the irrigation of water and other processes of water leakage and evaporation to improve the utilization of irrigation water chen et al 2014 wang et al 2002 awst is mainly accomplished through specific measures that control the field of water and optimize the production structure while improving water use efficiency jiménez and chávez 2003 zou et al 2013 bcwst is a real time and reasonable irrigation system that promotes crop growth with biological and chemical technology it also involves the use of biotechnology for breeding and cultivating of crop varieties that are drought resistant and water saving wang et al 2007 mwst can achieve a reasonable allocation of irrigation water resources and an optimal scheduling of irrigation measures to reach a specific target which is deriving the maximum benefit from limited water resources gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 naranjo gil 2017 reilly et al 2003 3 conceptual framework and hypothesis according to the theory of innovation diffusion rogers 2003 the innovation decision process is an information seeking and information processing activity with five steps in the farmers adoption process including knowledge of an adoption persuasion to form an attitude decision implementation and confirmation either reinforcement or rejection based on the theory of planned behavior farmers adoption behaviors have been shown to be related to multiple factors ajzen 1991 previous studies reported that an economic incentive social capital natural environment technical characteristics family and farm characteristics and other factors significantly affected farmers adoptions of agricultural technologies abdulai et al 2011 alam 2015 bjornlund et al 2009 chen et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 nikouei et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in this study we developed a conceptual framework suggesting that farmers adoption of wsit is a result of common influence of householder characteristics family characteristics farm characteristics production conditions perceptions of technology and environmental factors the conceptual framework is shown in fig 3 3 1 householder characteristics some characteristics of the surveyed households tend to influence the adoption of irrigation technologies abdulai et al 2011 the probability for the adoption of irrigation technologies declines with increasing age abdulai and huffman 2005 wang et al 2015 the education level of farmers played an important role in the adoption of modern irrigation technology alam 2015 cremades et al 2015 fernandez cornejo et al 2005 saha and schwart 1994 better educated farmers are often in a better position to understand and appreciate the advantages of adopting irrigation technologies this finding is consistent with the notion that education is important in helping farmers to reach decisions about adopting new innovations and technologies abdulai and huffman 2005 abdulai et al 2011 farming experience affects farmers decision making behavior hisali et al 2011 seekao and pharino 2016 alam 2015 suggested that the greater the experiences in agricultural farming the more likely farmers would be to adopt alternative adaptation strategies based on this we hypothesized that h1 householder characteristics are related to farmers adoption of wsit 3 2 family characteristics the family is the basic unit for farmers to engage in agricultural production household size and production specialization are the main family characteristics as pointed out by previous studies farmers adoption decisions are influenced by household size abdulai et al 2011 bekele and drake 2003 mariano et al 2012 in contrast chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 found that the likelihood for an adoption behavior of farmers is not significantly related to household size thus we assume that a larger household size will lead to a better chance wsit adoption moreover adoption of agricultural innovations is also linked to off farm income through managerial time fernandez cornejo et al 2005 deressa et al 2009 indicated that both the farm income and nonfarm income have a significant relationship with the adoption behavior furthermore total income was found to be related to the adoption decision of agriculture goswami et al 2012 to address this concern the production specialization was used as a household income index that refers to the proportion of farm income to the total income in line with this suggestion we hypothesized that h2 family characteristics will affect farmers adoption of wsit 3 3 farm characteristics in general farm size is based on the total cultivable acres in operation both owned and rented mariano et al 2012 abdulai et al 2011 noted that farm size which normally indicates wealth was frequently used in adoption models to capture the impact of wealth on the decision process studies on adoption of agricultural technologies indicate that farm size exerts both negative and positive effects on adoption indicating that the effect of farm size on technology adoption is inconclusive bradshaw et al 2004 deressa et al 2009 the studies confirm that farm size influences farmers adoption of novel agricultural technologies alam 2015 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 goswami et al 2012 on farm easy informal demonstrations are the most effective extension conditions which allow the farmers to enhance their own autodidactic approach badrage et al 2009 previous studies show on farm demonstration to be an effective way to transfer technology by improving farmers adoption of agricultural technologies barao 1992 participating in a cooperative helps farmers to enter social networks for the flow of information which tends to enhance the adoption of new agricultural technologies bandiera and rasul 2006 abdulai et al 2011 and mariano et al 2012 suggested that being a member of a farmer s cooperatives increases the probability to adopt new agricultural technologies based on these publications we hypothesized that h3 farm characteristics will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 4 production conditions training seems to be an effective tool to improve knowledge cunha et al 2014 attendance of agricultural technology training encourages adoption since exposure to information reduces subjective uncertainty about the technology mariano et al 2012 based on this we assumed the attendance by farmers at training sessions had a positive impact on the adoption of wsit market was identified as an important determinant of adoption since markets also served as a platform for farmers to exchange information gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 market access is an important factor to affect adoption of agricultural technologies feder et al 1985 greater distance between the farm and the nearest market indicates poor access which will constrain adoption mariano et al 2012 the two main sources of agricultural water ground and surface water are regulated separately yoo et al 2013 the water source has a significant influence on the adoption of wsit for farmers green et al 1996 previous studies confirmed that farmers exclusively using groundwater are more likely to adopt modern irrigation technology alam 2015 caswell and zilberman 1985 cremades et al 2015 yang et al 2003 therefore we hypothesized that h4 production conditions will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 5 perceptions of technology information is the foundation of any adoption farmers generally adopt agricultural technologies only if they fully understand the provided technical information negatu and parikh 1999 in particular when the respective technologies involve different practices information is critical for their adoption abdulai et al 2011 clear associations exist between the access to technical information and the level of adoption of agricultural technology wang et al 2015 moreover an adoption of modern irrigation technology occurs when incremental net benefits of the modern irrigation technology exceed its cost dridi and khanna 2005 farmers subjective perceptions of the costs of adoption are key factors to adoption bandiera and rasul 2006 consequently the following hypothesis has been derived h5 perceptions of technology will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 3 6 environmental factors in general water use associations wuas are voluntary non governmental nonprofit and have been established and are managed by a group of irrigators wuas have become the dominant form of irrigation in several areas wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 examined which wuas play a significant role in promoting water productivity among households that belong to a wua in northern china previous studies found that adoption of irrigation technology is positively and significantly related to the natural and geographical environments cremades et al 2015 schuck et al 2005 when the resource is scarce the technology needed to save the resource is more likely to be adopted ruttan and hayami 1984 correspondingly farmers are more willing to adopt wsit in water scarcity regions cai and rosegrant 2004 caswell and zilberman 1986 schuck et al 2005 shrestha and gopalakrishnan 1993 moreover between neighboring farmers it is important to model extension and diffusion of agricultural technology jørs et al 2016 islam et al 2013 reported that neighboring farmers adoption influenced farmers adoption of agricultural technology finally policy subsidies cut the cost of technology and provide important incentives for farmers to adopt wsit bjornlund et al 2009 blanke et al 2007 cremades et al 2015 dinar et al 1992 nikouei et al 2012 wheeler et al 2015 more importantly when subsidies are available for farmers they are more likely to adopt irrigation technologies cremades et al 2015 therefore we assumed that h6 environmental factors will have a significant effect on farmers adoption of wsit 4 empirical model and data sources 4 1 empirical model most of the technology choices that farmers consider for their decision making are of a use or do not use nature mariano et al 2012 in this study responding farmers were asked whether they used wsit or not the advantage of the binary logit choice model was used to analyze the choice between two categories and the model is widely used in the adoption research abdulai et al 2011 chen et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 goswami et al 2012 mariano et al 2012 therefore each farmer s choice is represented by a dummy variable y i 1 if the farmer adopts wsit 0 if the farmer does not adopt wsit to better quantify the influences of different factors on farmer decisions to adopt wsit based on our framework we constructed a binary model as follows 1 ln p i 1 p i α n 1 n β n x n i where the dependent variable pi represents the probability of technology adoption α represents the intercept parameter β represents the vector of regression coefficients and x x 1 xn denotes a vector of n independent variables e g householder family and farm characteristics when the dependent variable is also the categorical variable an ordinary least squares ols estimation method is not effective due to the nonlinearity of the relationship therefore a maximum likelihood estimation mle method is required for the logit regression model mzoughi 2011 pampel 2000 importantly the estimated parameters are not directly tied to the actual magnitude of change but only provide the direction of the effect of independent variables in the logit regression model deressa et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 we determined the marginal effects to analyze the level of contribution of the factors that influence farmers adoption of wsit alam 2015 wang et al 2015 the marginal effect was defined as the effect of a unit change in x while all other factors remained constant on the probability that a farmer chose to adopt wsit mariano et al 2012 it can be shown that 2 δ p i δ x i all other x consant p i x i 4 2 data and definition of variables to meet the objectives of this research and study the behavior of farmers regarding their adoption of wsit as well as the factors that influenced this behavior we designed a structured questionnaire with several aspects first we collected basic characteristics about farmers their family and their farms e g age education income and farm size second data about the adoption of wsit was to be collected as the focus of our data collection furthermore we also recorded other information such as training access to information cost and policy subsidies the data used in this study were collected from one field survey via face to face interview in beijing during 2015 it was conducted in the top seven crop producing districts of beijing including daxing changping fangshan huairou shunyi miyun and tongzhou after approval by the beijing municipal bureau of agriculture each district elected one outstanding agricultural technology extension worker as investigator who was then trained on the questionnaire content and specific considerations from us then stratified random sampling was used in field surveys first villages were chosen from each district via a system sampling technique based on spatial location and their geographical position was dispersed then we chose several farmers in each selected village via simple random sampling method a total of 490 valid samples originated from 121 villages of seven districts the data were widely distributed therefore we considered the data to be representative of the overall population of the entire study area in the remainder of this paper both the descriptive statistical analysis and the econometric analysis refer to this sample of 490 farmers the definitions and descriptive statistics of explanatory variables used for the binary model are provided in table 1 on average farmers were 49 84 years of age had 9 68 years of formal schooling 14 71 years of farm experience and approximately four household members for production specialization most farmers had other jobs and farm income formed only part of their total family income the mean farm size was 0 32 ha the proportion of farmers that belonged to demonstration farmers was 34 4 and 48 6 farmers had joined cooperatives the rate of farmer attendance to training was 88 0 and the mean distance between farm and the nearest market was 5 49 km however perceptions of technology were poor such as access to information was difficult and connected to high input cost only 17 8 of farmers have been members of wuas and 29 1 had access to policy subsidies most fields are prone to drought but had better adoption environment from neighboring farmers 5 results and discussion 5 1 farmers adoption of water saving irrigation technologies the field surveys showed that half of the farmers took water saving action in response to drought for example of the 260 farmers who faced drought during the study period 53 1 adopted wsit table 2 of those farmers who were able to apply wsit in response to water scarcity further analyses indicate that 79 2 adopted ewst this is understandable as the water saving effect of ewst is remarkable the facilities and equipment can be reused for a long period of time and maintenance is simple in addition 52 3 of these farmers adopted awst to make full use of the provided advantages including simple operation and lower cost operating the equipment needed for mwst and bcwst is more difficult and requires a higher level of professionalism which is difficult for many farmers to master this leads to the relatively low adoption of both technologies for example the share of farmers adopting bcwst and mwst accounted for 31 2 and 36 9 respectively further analysis revealed that six technologies were adopted at more than 25 in the survey of 23 specific types of wsit table 3 these are drip irrigation technology 41 9 field coverage technology 39 6 field cultivation technology 36 9 reasonable irrigation system 28 5 on film irrigation technology 28 1 and drought resistant varieties 26 5 the highest rate of adoption of a specific technology in each of the four types of wsit was drip irrigation technology ewst field coverage technology awst drought resistant and water saving varieties bcwst and reasonable irrigation system mwst it is worth noting that the adoption of 10 types of wsit remained below 10 and three types remained below 5 examples of some of these minimally adopted technologies include chemical reagent water saving using impervious membranes and concrete anti seepage technology according to our understanding based on our survey of farmers adoption of wsit adoption of a technology occurs when the technology has reached a high degree of maturity is easy to operate causes low cost and offers obvious benefits in contrast when the technology is high cost complicated to operate requires a high degree of professional knowledge and does not offer an immediate benefit farmers are not likely to adopt them however the water saving effect is a result of the interaction of a number of wsit the results show that a strong negative correlation existed between the number of wsit adopted and the share of adopters fig 4 the share of farmers who adopted two technologies in combination was maximal accounting for 20 8 and 20 4 of adopters who had only used single wsit when the farmers used a small amount of wsit the effect was better with the increasing number of adopted technologies the benefits of wsit gradually decreased while the cost of investment increased this led to a reduction in overall efficiency which caused farmers to abandon the increase of other wsit 5 2 estimation results of the econometric model we used stata 14 0 software to estimate the logit model and marginal effects the results are shown in table 4 the chi squared test statistic was significant at the 1 level implying joint significance of the wsit adoption variables mariano et al 2012 the pseudo r2 values of the logit model were 0 363 which is a reasonably high value for a multivariate analysis based on cross sectional data wang et al 2015 importantly 14 of the 18 selected variables were significant at a 10 level of significance in the logit model therefore the logit model developed in this study was effective and explained the farmers adoption of wsit 5 3 householder characteristics as expected older farmers had a lower probability of wsit adoption for instance a unit increase in age of the householder resulted in a 1 1 decline in the probability of adoption of wsit education is one of the key determinants for adopting wsit results of table 4 indicate that education appeared to have a positive effect on the adoption of wsit according to the calculated results on the marginal effects a one unit year increase of schooling led to a 0 4 increase in the probability of adoption while the effect on the remaining options was negligible as suggested by mariano et al 2012 farmers who are better educated have greater ability to process information and search for technologies that are suitable for their production constraints compared to farmers who are less educated these results reinforced the findings of other studies showing that farmer characteristics were significantly related to the choice of adoption alam 2015 mzoughi 2011 torkamani and shajari 2007 wang et al 2015 5 4 family characteristics the coefficient of the production specialization variable was negative and statistically significant for farmer s adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that each additional unit in production specialization reduced the probability of wsit adoption by 1 4 these results indicate that farmers with higher production specialization were less likely to have the ability to withstand risks arising from the adoption of wsit this finding suggests that reducing risk is an important pathway for promoting the adoption of wsit by farmers barham et al 2015 for adoption of wsit increasing household size did not significantly reduce the probability although the coefficient was negative 5 5 farm characteristics as for control variables results show that farm size had a positive and significant impact on the adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that a unit ha of increase in farm size increased the probability of farmers wsit adoption by 2 as noted by filho et al 1999 and wang et al 2015 farmers with larger farms are more likely to adopt new agricultural technologies compared to those with smaller farms the positive effect of farm size for the adoption is consistent with the findings of this study this is probably because larger farms contribute to highlight a number of shortcomings of traditional irrigation such as time consumption and labor intensity and waste of water resources which drives farmers to pay more attention to save resources and reduce costs via wsit adoption the on farm demonstration variable shows a significantly positive sign in the adoption equation indicating that farmers who participated in on farm demonstrations were more likely to adopt wsit more importantly the marginal effects revealed that if farmers had participated in on farm demonstration their likelihood of adoption of wsit increased by 31 5 similarly results in table 4 indicate a positive and significant correlation between being a member of cooperatives and the likelihood of adoption of wsit to cope with water scarcity marginal effects indicated that if a farmer participated in a cooperative the likelihood of adoption of wsit increased by 31 1 these results imply that on farm demonstration and cooperative tremendously promotes the adoption and diffusion of wsit 5 6 production conditions as predicted by hypothesis h4 some production conditions correlate with farmers decisions to adopt wsit for example results show that attendance at training sessions had a significant positive influence on farmers wsit adoption probability marginal effects indicated that if farmers received training on agricultural technology their probability of adoption of wsit increased by 26 4 moreover the estimated results also showed that the groundwater variable were significantly positive at the 1 level on farmers adoption of wsit marginal effects indicated that compared to other farmers the likelihood of wsit adoption by farmers with groundwater for irrigation increased by 12 1 5 7 perceptions of technology the perceptions of technology significantly influenced the farmers adoption of wsit the coefficient for the access to information was significant and positive suggesting that farmers who have easily access to information of technology were more likely to adopt wsit this result confirms the importance of information for the farmers adoption of agricultural technologies mariano et al 2012 marginal effects suggested that the access to information increased the likelihood of wsit adoption by 7 9 in contrast the results of this analysis reconfirmed that increasing cost significantly decreased the likelihood of wsit adoption the probability of wsit adoption was 8 8 lower when the cost increased by one unit based on farmers small scale production high cost improved the barrier of adoption with respect to capital input mzoughi 2011 suggested that farmers are more likely to adopt technology which reduces production costs this result implies that it is important to reduce the cost of a farmer s initial investment for wsit adoption to effectively promote a technology s popularization and application 5 8 environmental factors as predicted by hypothesis h6 the results show that environmental factors significantly influenced farmers wsit adoption first wuas posed a significant positive influence on farmers adoption of wsit for example a farmer who is a member of wuas is 24 0 more likely to adopt wsit second results indicate that farmers who were exposed to drought were encouraged to use wsit technology adoption in such adverse areas is higher by 2 2 ongoing water scarcity in combination with future anticipated drought conditions increased the likelihood of farmers who use wsit to appreciate water resources and improve irrigation efficiency in addition the variable of neighboring farmers had a significantly positive impact at the 1 level regarding wsit adoption the results for marginal effects indicated that if neighboring farmers adopted wsit the probability of farmer s adoption increased by 18 8 finally we also noted the importance of policy subsidies to farmers decisions to adopt wsit based on estimation results the coefficient of policy subsidies is significantly positive in the model implying that there is a positive relationship between policy subsidies and the adoption of wsit in other words if farmers had access to policy subsidies the possibility that they will adopt wsit increases by 19 5 based on these findings it can be concluded that improving the environments farmers face can help to promote wsit adoption 6 conclusions and policy implications based on field surveys conducted in beijing china this study examined farmers practices when facing water scarcity and identified the major factors that affect farmers decisions on whether or not to adopt wsit to alleviate water scarcity the results show that when facing water scarcity about half of the farmers 53 1 in beijing adopted wsit for those farmers the results of the analysis indicate that 79 2 52 3 31 2 and 36 9 adopted ewst awst mwst and bcwst respectively it is also worth noting that the results show a strong negative correlation between the number of wsit adopted and the share of adopters further analysis from the utilized econometric model indicates that farmers adoption decisions on wsit are a result of common influence of householder characteristics family characteristics farm characteristics production conditions perceptions of technology and environmental factors in detail education farm size participation in on farm demonstration cooperative training groundwater access to information wuas drought prone area neighboring farmers and policy subsidies significantly improved farmers adaption to water scarcity while age production specialization and cost posed a negative effect on famers adoption of wsit the results of this study have several potential policy implications first there is significant room for the government to promote wsit extension against water scarcity based on farmers production demand differential promotion measures will be conducted to help farmers adopt wsit for the sustainable development of agriculture in metropolis suburbs second improving performance increasing the stability and reducing the cost of wsit is a way to help farmers reduce adoption barriers for example farmers were more likely to adopt wsit if the technology had a high degree of maturity and was easy to operate according to field surveys and interviews farmers encountered many wsit problems such as quickly aging equipment and ease of breakdown having a short service life being ineffectual and being complex to operate third the results of this analysis reconfirm that increasing cost significantly decreases the likelihood of wsit adoption results indicate that 54 4 of farmers thought the costs of wsit were high this finding suggests that reducing cost is important to drive farmers to adopt wsit fourth the results indicated a positive relationship between policy subsidies and the adoption of wsit therefore in future local governments may need to continue to expand their policy of supporting farmers to adopt wsit against water scarcity such as subsidies extension policies and technical services lastly the study also reveals that improving farmers social capital and environments for the adoption of wsit can play an important role to help farmers against water scarcity for example policies that aimed at promoting the adoption of wsit need to emphasize the critical role of providing timely and accurate information on improved techniques and water scarcity then the government should encourage and guide farmers to take part in wuas on farm demonstrations and cooperatives through incentives and demonstration measures moreover local governments should also offer education and training programs to help farmers improve their understanding of the necessity to improve water use efficiency and to increase their capacity to use innovative practices or technologies overall the aims of this study have been achieved however it is also worth noting that our study only focused on farmers adoption of wsit and factors influencing whether they adopted wsit against water scarcity factors influencing farmers adoption of different types and number of wsit are also important and provide interesting research topics for future studies finally we also believe that the results and implications of this study are important for the extension of wsit under conditions of water scarcity and drought of other
