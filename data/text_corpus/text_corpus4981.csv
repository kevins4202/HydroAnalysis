24905,ecosystem models are widely advocated for ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm however the use of ecosystem models is still limited in tactical fisheries management due to large uncertainties that undermine the confidence of stakeholders using a monte carlo simulation approach this study quantified the impact of imprecise parameters on performance of a multi species individual based model osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems exploitation in evaluating the status of fish community population and individual uncertainties associated with the following five parameters were considered fishing mortality mfishing additional natural mortality mnatural larval mortality mlarval species specific relative fecundity rf and the proportion of available low trophic level ltl biomass to high trophic level htl groups plank access the imprecise value of mlarval had the highest relative influence on model outputs the imprecision of model outputs were sharply increased when the imprecisions of rf and plank access were high the compound sources resulted in a greater imprecision of model predictions confirming that the hierarchical model structure of osmose facilitated the error diffusion we also investigated the synergetic and antagonistic effects of aforementioned parameter uncertainty on the total biomass of the community biocom and mean trophic level of the community mtlcom both biocom and mtlcom seemed not sensitive to the changes in mnatural the mfishing and mlarval had negative effects on mtlcom and there was a positive relationship between two ecological indicators and last two parameters rf and plank access the mlarval had a dominant impact on biocom and mtlcom increasing mfishing and mlarval could result in a larger decline of biocom and mtlcom compared to that caused by a single parameter similarly there was a larger increase of biocom and mtlcom after increasing rf and plank access there was a small variation of biocom and mtlcom when both mfishing and rf changed suggesting mfishing could offset the effect of rf on biocom and mtlcom this study suggests that the imprecision of model parameters can greatly reduce utility of an ecosystem model we recommend to develop research priority to reduce identified key sources of uncertainty and better understand error diffusion resulting from hierarchical model structures keywords osmose imprecise parameters monte carlo simulation uncertainty analysis 1 introduction overexploitation and large environmental changes have resulted in an increasing number of depleted fish stocks mullon et al 2005 pinsky et al 2011 worm and branch 2012 pedersen et al 2017 coping with crises produced by overfishing a series of harvest control tools including seasonal closures and total allowable catch are implemented to achieve sustainable fisheries as a growing number of reports document ecological regime shift in marine ecosystems levin and möllmann 2015 increasing attentions and efforts have been put towards ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm which emphasizes the trade off between ecosystem impacts and commercial profits pikitch et al 2004 worm et al 2009 hilborn 2011 trochta et al 2018 given the limitation of single species models in accounting for trophic interactions various ecosystem models have been developed fulton et al 2011 stäbler et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 these more holistic models may improve our ecological knowledge and capability to advise fisheries management the ecosystem approaches seem to be feasible to broadly support ebfm as a necessary complement to single species approaches collie et al 2014 dolan et al 2016 unfortunately model based decision making process is often complicated by large uncertainties associated with modeling outputs walker et al 2003 the risk of over confidence in model projections can also lead to executing faulty management strategies that can contribute to a further degraded ecosystem brander et al 2013 accompanying recent advancement in modeling and computer simulation techniques ecosystem models can simulate sophisticated ecological mechanisms and variations but they become increasingly data hungry and complex compared to traditional single species models the predictions are likewise susceptible to uncertainty especially those from input parameters and model structure link et al 2012 thorpe et al 2015 with increasing model complexity quantifiable progress in understanding ecosystem dynamics may deteriorate stakeholder trusts if uncertainties are poorly understood the negative perceptions of uncertainty can further precipitate the distrust between science and management there is a conspicuous developmental imbalance in global fisheries the lack of data restricts the application of ecosystem models for promoting ecosystem based management for sustainable fisheries especially in developing countries costello et al 2012 hamel and bryant 2017 poor data limit our understanding of reference systems and external forces to manipulate simulations closer to observations lehuta et al 2013 not all model parameters can be readily obtained for modelling and calibration data are required to contain sufficient information that allow for uncertainty of calibrated parameters at an adequate level walker et al 2003 plagányi 2007 as a result of imperfect knowledge there are inevitable omission and simplification in the description of modelled processes compared to reality and such conceptual uncertainty likewise affects the accuracy of calibrated parameters anderson 2010 in terms of the nature of uncertainty the errors can result from epistemic uncertainty and variability uncertainty due to the imperfection of our knowledge and inherent variability respectively walker et al 2003 the monte carlo simulation approach is one of the most advocated method for the quantification of uncertainty and often used to explore error propagation caused by partial perceptions of probability distributions and correlations without imposing multiple assumptions refsgaard et al 2007 focusing on the epistemic uncertainty we employed this method to imitate the errors of parameters obtained from model calibration and evaluate the impact of imprecise parameterization on a multi species individual based model osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystem exploitation http www osmose model org shin and cury 2004 this model simulates fish life history and inter species interactions at an individual based level beneficial to developing theory of individual behaviors and explaining observed patterns coupling to hydrological and biogeochemical models as an end to end model the model describes food webs dynamics from low trophic level ltl groups to high trophic level htl groups and provides insights on trophic interactions travers et al 2007 travers trolet et al 2014a however few studies have systematically quantified impacts of imprecise parameters on performance of osmose models xing et al 2017 using the regional ecosystem model osmose jzb developed in jiaozhou bay china this study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of how imprecise parameters affect osmose performance at levels of fish community population and individual the magnitude of imprecise parameterization was investigated at the low medium and high levels of error bounds for different uncertainty scenarios besides the synergetic and antagonistic effects between different parameter combinations in modelling were addressed such a study can provide insights on major sources of uncertainty and their relative importance in ecosystem modeling although the study is based on a particular ecosystem which may result in the results being case specific the general approach used in the study is applicable to other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 osmose jzb the osmose jzb is an end to end model that can analyze trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics in jiaozhou bay china fig a1 xing et al 2017 the calibration s were collected from a stratified random bottom trawl survey which was conducted in february may august and november of 2011 as an end to end model osmose jzb couples two modelling components based on a one way modelling approach to simulate ecosystem dynamics in jiaozhou bay the spatio temporal dynamics of ltl groups are described by fvcom nemuro model which couples a hydrological model fvcom finite volume community ocean model chen et al 2003 2011 to a biogeochemical model nemuro north pacific ecosystem model used for regional oceanography aita et al 2007 kishi et al 2007 the trophic interaction and fish life cycle of htl groups are simulated by the multi species individual based model osmose which assumes the predation is opportunistic and based on the size ratio between prey and predators there are five ltl groups and fourteen htl groups table 1 in the osmose jzb the spatio temporal distributions of ltl groups are the functional prey fields for the htl groups plank access represents the proportion of the available ltl biomass given not all ltl groups are available to htl groups every ltl group is homogeneous over their size range and available to fish predator schools through the predation process individuals in each htl group are grouped into schools and the ecological processes are simulated by a serious of ecological sub models in each time step half a month the schools present randomly in the grid map based on their movement ranges and feed on individuals of ltl and htl groups within suitable sizes halouani et al 2016 individual growth follows the von bertalanffy growth model and log linear weight length relationship and individuals stop growing or starve to death under insufficient food intake travers trolet et al 2014b the number of eggs depends on the relative fecundity rf biomass of female spawning stock and percentages of eggs produced at a given time step grüss et al 2015 fish schools which are the basic units in the osmose model undergo various mortalities as a result of fishing activities i e mfishing the predation of predator schools i e mpredation starvation i e mstarvation and additional natural mortality i e mnatural including other mortalities which are not explicitly represented in the osmose model the larval mortality i e mlarval is considered in the model as additional mortality for eggs and first feeding larvae based on a stochastic algorithm the order of all mortality sources is random and all mortalities compete against each other fu et al 2017 this method avoids the numerical bias in the model outputs species specific migration is considered in this model allowing certain species to move between areas additionally fish schools are harvested when they reach catchable size and fishing efforts are uniformly distributed outside the summer moratorium period from jun 1st to sep 1st detailed parameterization and calibration of the osmose jzb are described in xing et al 2017 2 2 simulation design the following five types of parameters were selected to show the impact of their imprecise estimates on model predictions including fishing mortality mfishing additional natural mortality mnatural larval mortality mlarval species specific relative fecundity rf and the proportion of available ltl biomass to htl groups plank access the values of these parameters need to be estimated in the model calibration and are easily affected by various uncertainties especially resulting from inadequate data and complex model structure a monte carlo method was used to randomly generate error terms drawn from pre specified error distributions han et al 2017 the sum of initial parameter values and error terms represented new parameter values with errors using for the model we assumed that the estimated parameter values used in the model were usually around their true values zhang et al 2015 the error terms were randomly sampled from a defined normal distribution with the mean of zero and pre specified standard deviations table 2 in other words the error range depended on the pre specified standard deviation six scenarios were developed to simulate the imprecise model parameterization fig 1 table 2 the scenarios i v referred to the five types of imprecise parameters identified in the previous paragraph the scenario vi was designed to address compounded effects of parameter errors defined for all these five scenarios the magnitude of parameter errors were divided into low medium and high level which are conducted by setting standard deviations to 5 15 and 30 of initial parameter values respectively each scenario was simulated with 480 different newly generated parameter values and repeated 3 times due to the stochastic feature of the model in all 1440 simulations corresponding to all scenarios for each standard deviation level were tested we assessed whether the amount of newly generated parameter values n 480 was sufficient to describe the pattern of uncertainty resulting from imprecise parameterization appendix b the temporal errors of fishing mortalities were considered in this study meaning that their error terms at different time steps are varied the model was simulated for 120 years and the predictions which were averaged over the last 20 years of model outputs to avoid the bias on account of interannual fluctuations were used to evaluate the uncertainty under the six scenarios the scenario ⅶ was designed to investigate the synergetic and antagonistic effects of different parameters at twelve levels table 2 it was further divided into two sub scenarios which were single parameter and parameter combinations fig 1 table 2 in the sub scenario single parameter we conducted individual sensitivity analyses on the five types of parameters aiming to detect the impact of single parameter on model outputs there were ten parameter combinations in the sub scenario parameter combinations in order to reveal the compound effect of different parameters in each parameter combination we selected two of the above mentioned five types of parameters the parameter values in both two sub scenarios were set from 0 7 to 1 3 times their initial values by a step assigned to 0 05 in other words both two parameters in every parameter combination increased or declined at the same level the model was simulated for 120 years with 40 repetitions the average of 40 simulation replicates over the last 20 years was used to analyze the synergetic and antagonistic effects the initial osmose jzb developed by xing et al 2017 was run for 120 years with 100 repetitions the predicted data of initial model were averaged over the last 20 years and 100 simulation runs and treated as the reference state to compare with outputs under other scenarios the osmose used in this study ver 3 2 is coded in java and available online http www osmose model org 2 3 uncertainty quantification for the scenario ⅰ ⅵ the impact of imprecise parameters on model performance was quantified at the levels of community structure population and individuals as a first step we employed the function metamds which is available in r package vegan to conduct the multidimensional scaling mds approach to investigate the pattern of uncertainty on the composition of species biomass this can help identify causal factors by reducing the dimensions of the prior dataset and provide a multi dimensional map for displaying relations of individual observations hout et al 2013 the statistic value stress was measured as the goodness of fit criterion and a value below 0 2 was considered as a sufficient preservation of information clarke and warwick 1994 the predicted biomass of htl groups under different scenarios were treated as an n dimensional data using for building similarity matrices based on the bray cutis dissimilarity index the patterns of individual simulation runs were exhibited with the first two dimensions of mds outcomes the identified dissimilarity of simulations at different error levels illustrate how parameter errors influences predicted community composition the mean trophic level of the community mtlcom is an ecological indicator commonly used in fisheries management zhang et al 2015 this indicator was used to analyze changes in the trophic structure resulting from imprecise parameters in the scenario ⅰ ⅵ the relative estimation error ree of the htl group annual mean biomass was used to quantify the model sensitivity to imprecise parameters at the level of fish population in the scenario ⅰ ⅵ given particularly high ecological and commercial value three species s schlegelii a hexanema and j belangerii were chosen to show impacts of uncertainty of imprecise parameters on predictions at an individual level the species were aggregated into two age groups where individuals below 1 year old were defined as juveniles and individuals between 1 and 2 years old were considered as adults the annual predation mortality rates in the two age groups were used to show species specific responses to uncertainty at the fish individual level for the scenario ⅶ we made the linear regression analysis between the values of two ecological indicators total biomass of the community and mean trophic level of the community and the imprecision levels of model parameters i e multiplier the ecological indicator and multiplier are the response variable y and explanatory variable x respectively the range of multiplier is from 0 7 to 1 3 step 0 05 the slopes represented increasing rate of the impacts of imprecise parameters moreover the slopes in the scenario single parameter were used to detect a given parameter had the positive or negative impact on two ecological indicators the slopes in the scenario parameter combinations presented the compound effect of each parameter combination the compound effect of parameters was categorized as synergetic effect and antagonistic effect the first one referred to the changes of two parameters resulting in a bigger variation than that was caused by a single parameter the other one referred to the changes of two parameters resulting in a smaller variation than that was caused by a single parameter the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters were determined by comparing the slopes of scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations the calculation of indicators which are not directly obtained from osmose jzb model was conducted in the r programming environment table 3 summarizes the indicators used in this study 3 results 3 1 uncertainty in fish community population and predation mortality the similarity of predicted fish community in terms of biomass composition was visualized by the first two mds dimensions fig 2 the stress value of each scenario was below 0 2 indicating information was preserved well the results showed that increasing uncertainty could result in a greater divergence of model predictions there were diverse impacts of parameter errors on predictions of fish community structure 1 mlarval i e scenario ⅲ had the strongest influence on model outputs compared with other parameters and the impacts of mfishing i e scenario ⅰ and mnatural i e scenario ⅱ were small 2 the amplitude of variation of predictions increased considerably when errors of rf i e scenario ⅳ and plank access i e scenario ⅴ were enhanced and 3 the model outputs were subject to uncertainty of compound sources i e scenario ⅵ relative to a single parameter suggesting the hierarchical model structure intensified the effects of uncertainty fig 2 the trophic structure of fish community had similar responses to uncertainty of parameter errors 1 multiple sources of errors caused non additive changes of model prediction suggesting that the impact of different uncertainty sources could not be simply added up 2 mfishing and mnatural had similar impacts on model outputs that mtlcom mainly distributed below 3 6 3 mlarval was particularly sensitive to uncertainty demonstrating visible deviation under low error scenarios and 4 the uncertainty of rf and plank access raised markedly at a high level of uncertainty compared with other parameters fig 3 increased imprecision of parameters resulted in higher deviations between model outputs and reference state the highest ree was found in scenario vi mlarval scenario ⅲ was the most influential parameter for all htl groups suggesting that its imprecise parameterization influenced predictions of other species not spawned in the simulated area via food webs the sedentary species were disposed to have a greater deviation of model outputs compared to migratory species fig 4 s schlegelii sp6 and j belangerii sp11 were more easily affected by imprecise parameters than other functional groups in all scenarios fig 4 relative mpredation for three fishes s schlegelii a hexanema and j belangerii showed that high level uncertainty increased the deviation of model estimates of predicted predation mortality fig 5 the imprecise parameters resulted in a larger deviation of predation mortality for young individuals of s schlegelii and j belangerii than that for adults in contrast the predation mortality of a hexanema adults seemed to be more sensitive to parameter errors than their juveniles the compound sources scenario ⅵ apparently resulted in a bigger deviation between different scenarios and the reference state than single source mlarval scenario ⅲ had a bigger impact on model outputs compared to other parameters except for the impact of plank access scenario ⅴ on young a hexanema being bigger at the high level uncertainty the impacts of rf scenario ⅳ plank access on a hexanema adults were more than mfishing scenario ⅰ and mnatural scenario ⅱ the predation mortality for both younger and older individuals was more stable in scenarios ⅰ and ⅱ suggesting that trophic interactions were less likely to be affected by errors in fishing mortality and additional natural mortality fig 5 3 2 synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters in general both sub scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations showed striking linearity between variations of ecological indicators and levels of imprecise parameter values table b1 in the sub scenario single parameter the total biomass of the community biocom declined with increasing values of the three mortality events mfishing mnatural and mlarval the slopes of mlarval were much lower than mfishing and mnatural indicating mlarval greatly influenced biocom there were positive relationships between biocom and last two parameters rf and plank access the slope of plank access was higher than rf suggesting that biocom seemed to be susceptible to variations of plank access fig 6 similarly increasing values of mfishing mnatural and mlarval had negative impacts on the mean trophic level of the community mtlcom in contrast to biocom the parameter rf whose slope was high had a bigger impact on mtlcom compared to plank access fig 7 the results of sub scenario parameter combinations showed the synergetic effect of different parameters on biocom and mtlcom fig 6 and 7 for both biocom and mtlcom the slopes of mfishing mlarval i e ⅰ ⅲ and mnatural mlarval i e ⅱ ⅲ were lower than that of mlarval in the sub scenario single parameter the slopes of mfishing mnatural i e ⅰ ⅱ were lower than that of mfishing or mnatural changes in the combinations of two of three mortality rates mfishing mnatural mfishing mlarval and mnatural mlarval resulted in a greater variation than that caused by a single parameter likewise the slope of rf plank access i e ⅳ ⅴ which had a positive relationship with biocom and mtlcom was higher than that of rf or plank access this suggests a synergetic relationship between rf and plank access fig 6 and 7 the two ecological indicators biocom and mtlcom were influenced by antagonistic effects between mnatural and both rf and plank access fig 6 and 7 the slopes in the scenario ⅰ ⅳ were close to zero indicating mfishing could offset effects of rf on biocom and mtlcom although increasing mnatural could result in the decline of biocom and mtlcom the slopes in the scenario mnatural plank access i e ⅱ ⅴ were positive suggesting that plank access competes with mnatural interestingly the slope of mtlcom in the scenario mlarval rf i e ⅲ ⅳ or mlarval plank access i e ⅲ ⅴ approached that of the scenario which only varied mlarval i e ⅲ indicating additive effects of different parameters might not be the sum of impact of single parameter fig 6 and 7 4 discussion osmose models aim to capture interactions of ecological components and identify trade offs between ecosystem and commercial benefit grüss et al 2016a similar to other ecosystem models many applications are still in strategic management and underlying uncertainty is a formidable block to facilitating model usages to move toward tactical management link et al 2010 based on a monte carlo simulation this study demonstrated that uncertainty of imprecise parameters markedly influenced model projections at levels of fish community population and individual number of sampled errors n 480 was sufficient to support the robustness of results using relative ree of species biomass the relative ree for each htl group converged to zero with higher numbers of sampled errors fig b1 suggesting that the outcomes were credible on tracing variances and impacts of uncertainty resulting from imprecise model parameters the composition of fish community and trophic structure was used to indicate ecosystem status shin et al 2005 biased results at fish community level could misguide decisions as a result of inadequate understanding of ecosystem processes fig 2 and 3 our findings showed that species specific characteristics could influence the sensitivity of species to modelling errors the modelling precision of stationary species were more susceptible to associated parameter errors compared to migratory species fig 4 this was mainly attributed to the fluxes of migrating biomass which were assumed to be unchanged in our study the migratory species tended to have more stable recruitment than the stationary species it is also a risk to use the biased predicted biomass to inform fisheries management both bottom up and top down effects are important regulating processes to ecosystem dynamics lynam et al 2017 the predation and fishing mortality predicted by osmose models can provide insights on potential associations of different functional groups grüss et al 2016b the predicted predation mortality was subject to diverse uncertainty sources fig 5 imprecise predictions impeded the model application in testing hypotheses related to ecosystem mechanism moreover the results highlighted the importance of the species specific response in predation mortality thus reducing uncertainty is preferentially considered especially when the model is used as a heuristic fishery management tool uncertainty is influential and ubiquitous in science and management and impossible to completely avoid and eliminate in ecological modelling refsgaard et al 2007 stelzenmüller et al 2015 in the osmose jzb model mlarval i e additional mortality of eggs and first feeding larvae strongly affected recruitment in fish populations but it was difficult to define it because 1 growth of fish larvae were more likely to be influenced by environmental factors especially water temperature mcleod et al 2015 serpetti et al 2017 and their relationships were often difficult to determine and 2 the ratio of fertilized eggs and energy provided by yolk often depended on the condition of spawning individuals that were more difficult to quantify carter et al 2015 species specific relative fecundity rf played a vital role in fish production but several challenges remain to sufficiently eliminate errors in the calculation of relative fecundity e g measurement error and limited sampling mfishing i e fishing mortality which was estimated from catch data was used to reveal the impact of fishing activities on fish populations errors of observed catches could make estimated fishing mortality diverged from the true value although mnatural i e other mortalities which are not explicitly represented in the model was used to offset uncertainty of recognized ignorance on ecosystem its unknown nature was still a risk to modelling ecosystem dynamics plank access i e proportion of the available ltl biomass to htl groups was employed as the interface of two main functional groups this model coupling likely introduced uncertainty into the model since the model partially simplified food webs and biotic processes there was inevitably a gap between estimated values and truth value moreover various parameters were linked by such a hierarchical model that might facilitate the error diffusion fulton 2010 there is a consensus that the evaluation of uncertainty is a necessity to ecosystem models before being used to guide our management policy and strategy schmolke et al 2010 the uncertainty analysis can identify priorities of uncertainty sources which benefits the identification of research priorities reduction of uncertainty and improvement of model based decision efficiency szuwalski and punt 2012 precision of the osmose jzb model was influenced evidently by mlarval and rf at high levels of uncertainty although these two parameters only had a direct effect on species spawned in jiaozhou bay modelers should deliberate about the impact of their imprecise utilizations in modelling the ecosystem dynamic plank access was a secondary candidate for reducing uncertainty there was no need to devote all research efforts to fine tuning the estimates of mfishing and mnatural because of their limited impacts however given the model outputs were more sensitive to mlarval more studies need to be dedicate to better estimate this parameter our findings highlighted the importance of understanding the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters on model outputs the antagonistic effect can make the prediction close to observations despite the values of different types of parameters deviate from their true values we take the scenario mfishing rf e g ⅰ ⅳ as an example it was demonstrated that impacts of mfishing and rf on two indices are opposite fig 6 and 7 interestingly there were small variations of two indices when both of them increased decreased it may result in an irreversible damage to fisheries resource after these imprecise parameter values are used in the decision making process the synergetic effect likewise interferes our decision making by aggravating the bias in the predictions the impact from different parameters cannot be simply added up in the face of challenges from various uncertainties there are no methods that can address all sources of uncertainty in modelling processes refsgaard et al 2007 our study evaluated modeling imprecisions under multilevel of errors from different sources this is far from supporting osmose jzb for accurate forecasts of future states of ecosystem several caveats should be noted in this study not all errors in practice follow a normal distribution francis 2011 and it is essential to know whether error dispersion patterns are influential to quantifying uncertainty in this sense uncertainty patterns should be also assessed under combined multilevel errors regarding the intrinsic sensitivity in the model and the extent varied in reality regardless of model structure every parameter needs to be evaluated for the statistical property of its uncertainty e g location level and nature walker et al 2003 besides it is necessary to quantify the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters on other indicators which are used to advise management furthermore the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters should be evaluated when parameters change in the different direction ecosystem modelling provides an effective approach to understand ecosystem dynamics but their applications are still hampered from uncertainty resulting from natural variability observation error structural complexity inadequate communication unclear management objectives and outcome uncertainty link et al 2010 this study developed a monte carlo simulation approach to show how uncertain model parameters could influence the quality of model predictions although quantifying prediction imprecision is out of the scope of this study this study does demonstrate the necessity of reviewing modeling uncertainty in using the ecosystem model to advise fisheries management such an evaluation can be referred as a complement to uncertainty assessment framework to facilitate the application of ecosystem models declaration of competing interest all of the authors have fully participated in the project and accepted responsibility for the work title evaluating impacts of imprecise parameters on the performance of an ecosystem model osmose jzb all the authors agree to the submission this is an original contribution not submitted elsewhere and there are no other

edits appendix a descriptions of study area the jiaozhou bay is a typical semi closed bay which is located in the southeast of shandong province china fig a1 historically the bay provides nursery and spawning habitat for many commercial fish species and serves as a productive fishing ground however human activities including overfishing industrial pollution and coastal exploitation have a dramatically affected ecological structure and food webs there although there is a summer moratorium of fishing implemented from june 1st to september 1st to recover fish stocks over twenty years it seems to have a limited effect on preventing fisheries resources decay appendix b relative ree of each htl group with different numbers of sampled errors and linear regression of ecological indicators and levels of imprecise parameter values we made a comparison on differences between first six scenarios i vi and reference state with different numbers of sampled errors the relative ree was used to quantify whether selected numbers of sampled errors were enough to trace variations relative ree r e l a t i v e r e e r e e i r e e 480 r e e 480 denoting relative estimation error where i represents the number of sampled errors reei represents the value of ree with sampling i errors the calculation method of ree is the same to that showed in table 3 the results of slope and p value in the scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations were listed in table b1 fig b1 appendix c number of sampled parameters in scenarios i vi and partial input parameters of htl and ltl groups the version 3 2 used in the osmose jzb model provides the function mortality fishing rate bydt bysize file sp that the time series of fishing mortality rate for each species can be read by the model from the csv files the detailed description is presented by the document in the osmose website http www osmose model org using this function we can set the value of fishing mortality rate at each time step in a given simulated year the catch of each species was calculated by the fishing mortality rate the configuration of fishing mortality rate for one species in each simulated year is same in a simulated year the fishing mortality rate of fish is set to zero when fish migrate out of jiaozhou bay or stay there during seasonal closure from jun 1st to sep 1st the fishing mortality rates which are equal to zero will not using for sampling errors in other words they will not be added with an error term and are still equal to zero therefore the number of sampled parameters for all species is 142 in the scenario i at each level similar to the scenario for fishing mortality rate the larval mortality rate mlarval and relative fecundity rf will not be sampled when they are set to null the number of sampled parameters in the scenario ⅵ is equal to the sum of parameters used in the front five scenarios the amount of sampled parameters in each scenario has been shown in table c1 the configuration of initial parameters are summarized in tables c2 and c3 
24905,ecosystem models are widely advocated for ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm however the use of ecosystem models is still limited in tactical fisheries management due to large uncertainties that undermine the confidence of stakeholders using a monte carlo simulation approach this study quantified the impact of imprecise parameters on performance of a multi species individual based model osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems exploitation in evaluating the status of fish community population and individual uncertainties associated with the following five parameters were considered fishing mortality mfishing additional natural mortality mnatural larval mortality mlarval species specific relative fecundity rf and the proportion of available low trophic level ltl biomass to high trophic level htl groups plank access the imprecise value of mlarval had the highest relative influence on model outputs the imprecision of model outputs were sharply increased when the imprecisions of rf and plank access were high the compound sources resulted in a greater imprecision of model predictions confirming that the hierarchical model structure of osmose facilitated the error diffusion we also investigated the synergetic and antagonistic effects of aforementioned parameter uncertainty on the total biomass of the community biocom and mean trophic level of the community mtlcom both biocom and mtlcom seemed not sensitive to the changes in mnatural the mfishing and mlarval had negative effects on mtlcom and there was a positive relationship between two ecological indicators and last two parameters rf and plank access the mlarval had a dominant impact on biocom and mtlcom increasing mfishing and mlarval could result in a larger decline of biocom and mtlcom compared to that caused by a single parameter similarly there was a larger increase of biocom and mtlcom after increasing rf and plank access there was a small variation of biocom and mtlcom when both mfishing and rf changed suggesting mfishing could offset the effect of rf on biocom and mtlcom this study suggests that the imprecision of model parameters can greatly reduce utility of an ecosystem model we recommend to develop research priority to reduce identified key sources of uncertainty and better understand error diffusion resulting from hierarchical

explore error propagation caused by partial perceptions of probability distributions and correlations without imposing multiple assumptions refsgaard et al 2007 focusing on the epistemic uncertainty we employed this method to imitate the errors of parameters obtained from model calibration and evaluate the impact of imprecise parameterization on a multi species individual based model osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystem exploitation http www osmose model org shin and cury 2004 this model simulates fish life history and inter species interactions at an individual based level beneficial to developing theory of individual behaviors and explaining observed patterns coupling to hydrological and biogeochemical models as an end to end model the model describes food webs dynamics from low trophic level ltl groups to high trophic level htl groups and provides insights on trophic interactions travers et al 2007 travers trolet et al 2014a however few studies have systematically quantified impacts of imprecise parameters on performance of osmose models xing et al 2017 using the regional ecosystem model osmose jzb developed in jiaozhou bay china this study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of how imprecise parameters affect osmose performance at levels of fish community population and individual the magnitude of imprecise parameterization was investigated at the low medium and high levels of error bounds for different uncertainty scenarios besides the synergetic and antagonistic effects between different parameter combinations in modelling were addressed such a study can provide insights on major sources of uncertainty and their relative importance in ecosystem modeling although the study is based on a particular ecosystem which may result in the results being case specific the general approach used in the study is applicable to other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 osmose jzb the osmose jzb is an end to end model that can analyze trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics in jiaozhou bay china fig a1 xing et al 2017 the calibration s were collected from a stratified random bottom trawl survey which was conducted in february may august and november of 2011 as an end to end model osmose jzb couples two modelling components based on a one way modelling approach to simulate ecosystem dynamics in jiaozhou bay the spatio temporal dynamics of ltl groups are described by fvcom nemuro model which couples a hydrological model fvcom finite volume community ocean model chen et al 2003 2011 to a biogeochemical model nemuro north pacific ecosystem model used for regional oceanography aita et al 2007 kishi et al 2007 the trophic interaction and fish life cycle of htl groups are simulated by the multi species individual based model osmose which assumes the predation is opportunistic and based on the size ratio between prey and predators there are five ltl groups and fourteen htl groups table 1 in the osmose jzb the spatio temporal distributions of ltl groups are the functional prey fields for the htl groups plank access represents the proportion of the available ltl biomass given not all ltl groups are available to htl groups every ltl group is homogeneous over their size range and available to fish predator schools through the predation process individuals in each htl group are grouped into schools and the ecological processes are simulated by a serious of ecological sub models in each time step half a month the schools present randomly in the grid map based on their movement ranges and feed on individuals of ltl and htl groups within suitable sizes halouani et al 2016 individual growth follows the von bertalanffy growth model and log linear weight length relationship and individuals stop growing or starve to death under insufficient food intake travers trolet et al 2014b the number of eggs depends on the relative fecundity rf biomass of female spawning stock and percentages of eggs produced at a given time step grüss et al 2015 fish schools which are the basic units in the osmose model undergo various mortalities as a result of fishing activities i e mfishing the predation of predator schools i e mpredation starvation i e mstarvation and additional natural mortality i e mnatural including other mortalities which are not explicitly represented in the osmose model the larval mortality i e mlarval is considered in the model as additional mortality for eggs and first feeding larvae based on a stochastic algorithm the order of all mortality sources is random and all mortalities compete against each other fu et al 2017 this method avoids the numerical bias in the model outputs species specific migration is considered in this model allowing certain species to move between areas additionally fish schools are harvested when they reach catchable size and fishing efforts are uniformly distributed outside the summer moratorium period from jun 1st to sep 1st detailed parameterization and calibration of the osmose jzb are described in xing et al 2017 2 2 simulation design the following five types of parameters were selected to show the impact of their imprecise estimates on model predictions including fishing mortality mfishing additional natural mortality mnatural larval mortality mlarval species specific relative fecundity rf and the proportion of available ltl biomass to htl groups plank access the values of these parameters need to be estimated in the model calibration and are easily affected by various uncertainties especially resulting from inadequate data and complex model structure a monte carlo method was used to randomly generate error terms drawn from pre specified error distributions han et al 2017 the sum of initial parameter values and error terms represented new parameter values with errors using for the model we assumed that the estimated parameter values used in the model were usually around their true values zhang et al 2015 the error terms were randomly sampled from a defined normal distribution with the mean of zero and pre specified standard deviations table 2 in other words the error range depended on the pre specified standard deviation six scenarios were developed to simulate the imprecise model parameterization fig 1 table 2 the scenarios i v referred to the five types of imprecise parameters identified in the previous paragraph the scenario vi was designed to address compounded effects of parameter errors defined for all these five scenarios the magnitude of parameter errors were divided into low medium and high level which are conducted by setting standard deviations to 5 15 and 30 of initial parameter values respectively each scenario was simulated with 480 different newly generated parameter values and repeated 3 times due to the stochastic feature of the model in all 1440 simulations corresponding to all scenarios for each standard deviation level were tested we assessed whether the amount of newly generated parameter values n 480 was sufficient to describe the pattern of uncertainty resulting from imprecise parameterization appendix b the temporal errors of fishing mortalities were considered in this study meaning that their error terms at different time steps are varied the model was simulated for 120 years and the predictions which were averaged over the last 20 years of model outputs to avoid the bias on account of interannual fluctuations were used to evaluate the uncertainty under the six scenarios the scenario ⅶ was designed to investigate the synergetic and antagonistic effects of different parameters at twelve levels table 2 it was further divided into two sub scenarios which were single parameter and parameter combinations fig 1 table 2 in the sub scenario single parameter we conducted individual sensitivity analyses on the five types of parameters aiming to detect the impact of single parameter on model outputs there were ten parameter combinations in the sub scenario parameter combinations in order to reveal the compound effect of different parameters in each parameter combination we selected two of the above mentioned five types of parameters the parameter values in both two sub scenarios were set from 0 7 to 1 3 times their initial values by a step assigned to 0 05 in other words both two parameters in every parameter combination increased or declined at the same level the model was simulated for 120 years with 40 repetitions the average of 40 simulation replicates over the last 20 years was used to analyze the synergetic and antagonistic effects the initial osmose jzb developed by xing et al 2017 was run for 120 years with 100 repetitions the predicted data of initial model were averaged over the last 20 years and 100 simulation runs and treated as the reference state to compare with outputs under other scenarios the osmose used in this study ver 3 2 is coded in java and available online http www osmose model org 2 3 uncertainty quantification for the scenario ⅰ ⅵ the impact of imprecise parameters on model performance was quantified at the levels of community structure population and individuals as a first step we employed the function metamds which is available in r package vegan to conduct the multidimensional scaling mds approach to investigate the pattern of uncertainty on the composition of species biomass this can help identify causal factors by reducing the dimensions of the prior dataset and provide a multi dimensional map for displaying relations of individual observations hout et al 2013 the statistic value stress was measured as the goodness of fit criterion and a value below 0 2 was considered as a sufficient preservation of information clarke and warwick 1994 the predicted biomass of htl groups under different scenarios were treated as an n dimensional data using for building similarity matrices based on the bray cutis dissimilarity index the patterns of individual simulation runs were exhibited with the first two dimensions of mds outcomes the identified dissimilarity of simulations at different error levels illustrate how parameter errors influences predicted community composition the mean trophic level of the community mtlcom is an ecological indicator commonly used in fisheries management zhang et al 2015 this indicator was used to analyze changes in the trophic structure resulting from imprecise parameters in the scenario ⅰ ⅵ the relative estimation error ree of the htl group annual mean biomass was used to quantify the model sensitivity to imprecise parameters at the level of fish population in the scenario ⅰ ⅵ given particularly high ecological and commercial value three species s schlegelii a hexanema and j belangerii were chosen to show impacts of uncertainty of imprecise parameters on predictions at an individual level the species were aggregated into two age groups where individuals below 1 year old were defined as juveniles and individuals between 1 and 2 years old were considered as adults the annual predation mortality rates in the two age groups were used to show species specific responses to uncertainty at the fish individual level for the scenario ⅶ we made the linear regression analysis between the values of two ecological indicators total biomass of the community and mean trophic level of the community and the imprecision levels of model parameters i e multiplier the ecological indicator and multiplier are the response variable y and explanatory variable x respectively the range of multiplier is from 0 7 to 1 3 step 0 05 the slopes represented increasing rate of the impacts of imprecise parameters moreover the slopes in the scenario single parameter were used to detect a given parameter had the positive or negative impact on two ecological indicators the slopes in the scenario parameter combinations presented the compound effect of each parameter combination the compound effect of parameters was categorized as synergetic effect and antagonistic effect the first one referred to the changes of two parameters resulting in a bigger variation than that was caused by a single parameter the other one referred to the changes of two parameters resulting in a smaller variation than that was caused by a single parameter the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters were determined by comparing the slopes of scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations the calculation of indicators which are not directly obtained from osmose jzb model was conducted in the r programming environment table 3 summarizes the indicators used in this study 3 results 3 1 uncertainty in fish community population and predation mortality the similarity of predicted fish community in terms of biomass composition was visualized by the first two mds dimensions fig 2 the stress value of each scenario was below 0 2 indicating information was preserved well the results showed that increasing uncertainty could result in a greater divergence of model predictions there were diverse impacts of parameter errors on predictions of fish community structure 1 mlarval i e scenario ⅲ had the strongest influence on model outputs compared with other parameters and the impacts of mfishing i e scenario ⅰ and mnatural i e scenario ⅱ were small 2 the amplitude of variation of predictions increased considerably when errors of rf i e scenario ⅳ and plank access i e scenario ⅴ were enhanced and 3 the model outputs were subject to uncertainty of compound sources i e scenario ⅵ relative to a single parameter suggesting the hierarchical model structure intensified the effects of uncertainty fig 2 the trophic structure of fish community had similar responses to uncertainty of parameter errors 1 multiple sources of errors caused non additive changes of model prediction suggesting that the impact of different uncertainty sources could not be simply added up 2 mfishing and mnatural had similar impacts on model outputs that mtlcom mainly distributed below 3 6 3 mlarval was particularly sensitive to uncertainty demonstrating visible deviation under low error scenarios and 4 the uncertainty of rf and plank access raised markedly at a high level of uncertainty compared with other parameters fig 3 increased imprecision of parameters resulted in higher deviations between model outputs and reference state the highest ree was found in scenario vi mlarval scenario ⅲ was the most influential parameter for all htl groups suggesting that its imprecise parameterization influenced predictions of other species not spawned in the simulated area via food webs the sedentary species were disposed to have a greater deviation of model outputs compared to migratory species fig 4 s schlegelii sp6 and j belangerii sp11 were more easily affected by imprecise parameters than other functional groups in all scenarios fig 4 relative mpredation for three fishes s schlegelii a hexanema and j belangerii showed that high level uncertainty increased the deviation of model estimates of predicted predation mortality fig 5 the imprecise parameters resulted in a larger deviation of predation mortality for young individuals of s schlegelii and j belangerii than that for adults in contrast the predation mortality of a hexanema adults seemed to be more sensitive to parameter errors than their juveniles the compound sources scenario ⅵ apparently resulted in a bigger deviation between different scenarios and the reference state than single source mlarval scenario ⅲ had a bigger impact on model outputs compared to other parameters except for the impact of plank access scenario ⅴ on young a hexanema being bigger at the high level uncertainty the impacts of rf scenario ⅳ plank access on a hexanema adults were more than mfishing scenario ⅰ and mnatural scenario ⅱ the predation mortality for both younger and older individuals was more stable in scenarios ⅰ and ⅱ suggesting that trophic interactions were less likely to be affected by errors in fishing mortality and additional natural mortality fig 5 3 2 synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters in general both sub scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations showed striking linearity between variations of ecological indicators and levels of imprecise parameter values table b1 in the sub scenario single parameter the total biomass of the community biocom declined with increasing values of the three mortality events mfishing mnatural and mlarval the slopes of mlarval were much lower than mfishing and mnatural indicating mlarval greatly influenced biocom there were positive relationships between biocom and last two parameters rf and plank access the slope of plank access was higher than rf suggesting that biocom seemed to be susceptible to variations of plank access fig 6 similarly increasing values of mfishing mnatural and mlarval had negative impacts on the mean trophic level of the community mtlcom in contrast to biocom the parameter rf whose slope was high had a bigger impact on mtlcom compared to plank access fig 7 the results of sub scenario parameter combinations showed the synergetic effect of different parameters on biocom and mtlcom fig 6 and 7 for both biocom and mtlcom the slopes of mfishing mlarval i e ⅰ ⅲ and mnatural mlarval i e ⅱ ⅲ were lower than that of mlarval in the sub scenario single parameter the slopes of mfishing mnatural i e ⅰ ⅱ were lower than that of mfishing or mnatural changes in the combinations of two of three mortality rates mfishing mnatural mfishing mlarval and mnatural mlarval resulted in a greater variation than that caused by a single parameter likewise the slope of rf plank access i e ⅳ ⅴ which had a positive relationship with biocom and mtlcom was higher than that of rf or plank access this suggests a synergetic relationship between rf and plank access fig 6 and 7 the two ecological indicators biocom and mtlcom were influenced by antagonistic effects between mnatural and both rf and plank access fig 6 and 7 the slopes in the scenario ⅰ ⅳ were close to zero indicating mfishing could offset effects of rf on biocom and mtlcom although increasing mnatural could result in the decline of biocom and mtlcom the slopes in the scenario mnatural plank access i e ⅱ ⅴ were positive suggesting that plank access competes with mnatural interestingly the slope of mtlcom in the scenario mlarval rf i e ⅲ ⅳ or mlarval plank access i e ⅲ ⅴ approached that of the scenario which only varied mlarval i e ⅲ indicating additive effects of different parameters might not be the sum of impact of single parameter fig 6 and 7 4 discussion osmose models aim to capture interactions of ecological components and identify trade offs between ecosystem and commercial benefit grüss et al 2016a similar to other ecosystem models many applications are still in strategic management and underlying uncertainty is a formidable block to facilitating model usages to move toward tactical management link et al 2010 based on a monte carlo simulation this study demonstrated that uncertainty of imprecise parameters markedly influenced model projections at levels of fish community population and individual number of sampled errors n 480 was sufficient to support the robustness of results using relative ree of species biomass the relative ree for each htl group converged to zero with higher numbers of sampled errors fig b1 suggesting that the outcomes were credible on tracing variances and impacts of uncertainty resulting from imprecise model parameters the composition of fish community and trophic structure was used to indicate ecosystem status shin et al 2005 biased results at fish community level could misguide decisions as a result of inadequate understanding of ecosystem processes fig 2 and 3 our findings showed that species specific characteristics could influence the sensitivity of species to modelling errors the modelling precision of stationary species were more susceptible to associated parameter errors compared to migratory species fig 4 this was mainly attributed to the fluxes of migrating biomass which were assumed to be unchanged in our study the migratory species tended to have more stable recruitment than the stationary species it is also a risk to use the biased predicted biomass to inform fisheries management both bottom up and top down effects are important regulating processes to ecosystem dynamics lynam et al 2017 the predation and fishing mortality predicted by osmose models can provide insights on potential associations of different functional groups grüss et al 2016b the predicted predation mortality was subject to diverse uncertainty sources fig 5 imprecise predictions impeded the model application in testing hypotheses related to ecosystem mechanism moreover the results highlighted the importance of the species specific response in predation mortality thus reducing uncertainty is preferentially considered especially when the model is used as a heuristic fishery management tool uncertainty is influential and ubiquitous in science and management and impossible to completely avoid and eliminate in ecological modelling refsgaard et al 2007 stelzenmüller et al 2015 in the osmose jzb model mlarval i e additional mortality of eggs and first feeding larvae strongly affected recruitment in fish populations but it was difficult to define it because 1 growth of fish larvae were more likely to be influenced by environmental factors especially water temperature mcleod et al 2015 serpetti et al 2017 and their relationships were often difficult to determine and 2 the ratio of fertilized eggs and energy provided by yolk often depended on the condition of spawning individuals that were more difficult to quantify carter et al 2015 species specific relative fecundity rf played a vital role in fish production but several challenges remain to sufficiently eliminate errors in the calculation of relative fecundity e g measurement error and limited sampling mfishing i e fishing mortality which was estimated from catch data was used to reveal the impact of fishing activities on fish populations errors of observed catches could make estimated fishing mortality diverged from the true value although mnatural i e other mortalities which are not explicitly represented in the model was used to offset uncertainty of recognized ignorance on ecosystem its unknown nature was still a risk to modelling ecosystem dynamics plank access i e proportion of the available ltl biomass to htl groups was employed as the interface of two main functional groups this model coupling likely introduced uncertainty into the model since the model partially simplified food webs and biotic processes there was inevitably a gap between estimated values and truth value moreover various parameters were linked by such a hierarchical model that might facilitate the error diffusion fulton 2010 there is a consensus that the evaluation of uncertainty is a necessity to ecosystem models before being used to guide our management policy and strategy schmolke et al 2010 the uncertainty analysis can identify priorities of uncertainty sources which benefits the identification of research priorities reduction of uncertainty and improvement of model based decision efficiency szuwalski and punt 2012 precision of the osmose jzb model was influenced evidently by mlarval and rf at high levels of uncertainty although these two parameters only had a direct effect on species spawned in jiaozhou bay modelers should deliberate about the impact of their imprecise utilizations in modelling the ecosystem dynamic plank access was a secondary candidate for reducing uncertainty there was no need to devote all research efforts to fine tuning the estimates of mfishing and mnatural because of their limited impacts however given the model outputs were more sensitive to mlarval more studies need to be dedicate to better estimate this parameter our findings highlighted the importance of understanding the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters on model outputs the antagonistic effect can make the prediction close to observations despite the values of different types of parameters deviate from their true values we take the scenario mfishing rf e g ⅰ ⅳ as an example it was demonstrated that impacts of mfishing and rf on two indices are opposite fig 6 and 7 interestingly there were small variations of two indices when both of them increased decreased it may result in an irreversible damage to fisheries resource after these imprecise parameter values are used in the decision making process the synergetic effect likewise interferes our decision making by aggravating the bias in the predictions the impact from different parameters cannot be simply added up in the face of challenges from various uncertainties there are no methods that can address all sources of uncertainty in modelling processes refsgaard et al 2007 our study evaluated modeling imprecisions under multilevel of errors from different sources this is far from supporting osmose jzb for accurate forecasts of future states of ecosystem several caveats should be noted in this study not all errors in practice follow a normal distribution francis 2011 and it is essential to know whether error dispersion patterns are influential to quantifying uncertainty in this sense uncertainty patterns should be also assessed under combined multilevel errors regarding the intrinsic sensitivity in the model and the extent varied in reality regardless of model structure every parameter needs to be evaluated for the statistical property of its uncertainty e g location level and nature walker et al 2003 besides it is necessary to quantify the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters on other indicators which are used to advise management furthermore the synergetic and antagonistic effect of different parameters should be evaluated when parameters change in the different direction ecosystem modelling provides an effective approach to understand ecosystem dynamics but their applications are still hampered from uncertainty resulting from natural variability observation error structural complexity inadequate communication unclear management objectives and outcome uncertainty link et al 2010 this study developed a monte carlo simulation approach to show how uncertain model parameters could influence the quality of model predictions although quantifying prediction imprecision is out of the scope of this study this study does demonstrate the necessity of reviewing modeling uncertainty in using the ecosystem model to advise fisheries management such an evaluation can be referred as a complement to uncertainty assessment framework to facilitate the application of ecosystem models declaration of competing interest all of the authors have fully participated in the project and accepted responsibility for the work title evaluating impacts of

edits appendix a descriptions of study area the jiaozhou bay is a typical semi closed bay which is located in the southeast of shandong province china fig a1 historically the bay provides nursery and spawning habitat for many commercial fish species and serves as a productive fishing ground however human activities including overfishing industrial pollution and coastal exploitation have a dramatically affected ecological structure and food webs there although there is a summer moratorium of fishing implemented from june 1st to september 1st to recover fish stocks over twenty years it seems to have a limited effect on preventing fisheries resources decay appendix b relative ree of each htl group with different numbers of sampled errors and linear regression of ecological indicators and levels of imprecise parameter values we made a comparison on differences between first six scenarios i vi and reference state with different numbers of sampled errors the relative ree was used to quantify whether selected numbers of sampled errors were enough to trace variations relative ree r e l a t i v e r e e r e e i r e e 480 r e e 480 denoting relative estimation error where i represents the number of sampled errors reei represents the value of ree with sampling i errors the calculation method of ree is the same to that showed in table 3 the results of slope and p value in the scenarios single parameter and parameter combinations were listed in table b1 fig b1 appendix c number of sampled parameters in scenarios i vi and partial input parameters of htl and ltl groups the version 3 2 used in the osmose jzb model provides the function mortality fishing rate bydt bysize file sp that the time series of fishing mortality rate for each species can be read by the model from the csv files the detailed description is presented by the document in the osmose website http www osmose model org using this function we can set the value of fishing mortality rate at each time step in a given simulated year the catch of each species was calculated by the fishing mortality rate the configuration of fishing mortality rate for one species in each simulated year is same in a simulated year the fishing mortality rate of fish is set to zero when fish migrate out of jiaozhou bay or stay there during seasonal closure from jun 1st to sep 1st the fishing mortality rates which are equal to zero will not using for sampling errors in other words they will not be added with an error term and are still equal to zero therefore the number of sampled parameters for all species is 142 in the scenario i at each level similar to the scenario for fishing mortality rate the larval mortality rate mlarval and relative fecundity rf will not be sampled when they are set to null the number of sampled parameters in the scenario ⅵ is equal to the sum of parameters used in the front five scenarios the amount of sampled parameters in each scenario has been shown in table c1 the configuration of initial parameters are summarized in tables c2 and c3 
24906,habitat loss and fragmentation continue to drive declines of amphibian populations maintaining connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and across wetlands is critical to amphibian conservation particularly in regions where climate change may exacerbate habitat loss our objective was to study the impact of climate and human driven losses in ephemeral wetlands on functional connectivity for amphibians using the endangered western tiger salamander ambystoma mavortium in british columbia canada as a case study land use data and dispersal characteristics for the western tiger salamander were used to develop a spatially explicit individual based model of amphibian movement the model was configured to explore connectivity under three climate scenarios a wet average and dry year and a land management scenario in which only known breeding sites are conserved we used a spatial network analysis to identify key ephemeral wetlands that connect otherwise isolated sub networks across the landscape and probable movement paths between wetlands and the upland terrestrial habitat our results illustrate the importance of conserving ephemeral wetlands as stepping stones we argue that a landscape approach to wetland conservation rather than just conserving known breeding sites is essential for retaining viable amphibian populations in a context of human induced habitat loss and climate change keywords connectivity graph theory individual based model agent based model amphibian spatial network 1 introduction human and climate driven habitat loss and fragmentation continue to pose a threat to amphibians globally becker et al 2007 cushman 2006 hof et al 2011 many amphibians have complex life cycles and require access to aquatic habitat for breeding larval development and metamorphosis as well as upland terrestrial habitat to facilitate adult life stages thus amphibians are sensitive to a loss or alteration of aquatic and terrestrial habitat as well as connectivity between these features becker et al 2010 the importance of preserving wetlands and their surrounding terrestrial habitat has become well established semlitsch and bodie 2003 trenham and shaffer 2005 and regulations policies and recommendations are in place throughout much of north america to protect these features bauer et al 2010 environment canada 2013 however there is concern that wetland conservation strategies focus narrowly on the individual wetland i e a pond as patch archetype to conservation and fail to safeguard networks of wetlands upland terrestrial habitat and the intervening matrix that collectively support landscape scale processes for aquatic species with complex life cycles baldwin et al 2006 ficetola et al 2009 marsh and trenham 2001 roe and georges 2007 the pond as patch approach to wetland conservation is particularly problematic in dry semi arid landscapes where wetlands are often temporary i e ephemeral vernal or seasonal wetlands and fluctuate in quantity and quality as a result of annual variations in stochastic environmental processes e g precipitation patterns drake et al 2017a consequently wetlands can form networks of wetland complexes that drive natural fluctuations in amphibian breeding patterns across a landscape hecnar and m closkey 1996 trenham et al 2003 werner et al 2007 giving rise to metapopulations gill 1978 hanski 1998 but see smith and green 2005 where habitat patches i e wetlands are linked by dispersal for amphibians that form a metapopulation wetland clusters and intervening connections may be a more meaningful management unit than an individual wetland landscape connectivity or the ability of a landscape to facilitate movement fischer and lindenmayer 2007 taylor et al 1993 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 is fundamental to metapopulation dynamics and amphibian dispersal baguette et al 2013 rothermel 2004 landscape connectivity can be difficult to characterize particularly for cryptic small species such as amphibians modelling techniques provide a mechanism for simulating dispersal characteristics to explore connectivity with limited existing data graph theory is particularly amenable to assessing amphibian connectivity as wetlands can be represented as nodes connected by dispersal events links or edges marsh and trenham 2001 minor and urban 2007 urban and keitt 2001 several studies have used network approaches to explore amphibian populations and wetland connectivity albanese and haukos 2017 bishop taylor et al 2017 drake et al 2016 drake et al 2017b fortuna et al 2006 peterman et al 2016 ribeiro et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2015 however successfully employing a network theory approach requires some knowledge of landscape permeability or dispersal characteristics to represent links between nodes individual based models are emerging as a powerful tool to explore landscape connectivity for wildlife e g aben et al 2014 2016 bocedi et al 2014 girard et al 2015 kanagaraj et al 2013 mcentire and maerz 2019 palmer et al 2011 pe er et al 2011 and are a promising method to quantifying network links by simulating dispersal between habitat patches across a spatially explicit landscape lookingbill et al 2016 in the following study we link a parsimonious yet ecologically realistic individual based model of amphibian movement with a network analyses to identify how a spatially explicit landscape promotes or restricts amphibian movement a series of simulations were developed to explore how varying levels of wetland inundation as well as different land use management actions can impact connectivity the results of these simulations were then analyzed with a graph theory approach to determine how wetlands are linked to form a network as well as to identify key wetlands that are highly important to network topography across the landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 case study location and species the western tiger salamander ambystoma mavortium of the southern okanagan valley british columbia canada was used as a case study for this analysis fig 1 among the driest regions in canada the okanagan is at the northern periphery of the dry shrub steppe grassland ecosystem that extends from the columbia basin in the united states wetlands in the okanagan are highly dynamic and often inundated only during wet years or seasonally after snowmelt further wetland habitats in the okanagan are integrated as part of a multifunctional landscape dominated by human land use due to limited land for urban development there is increasing social and economic pressure to develop into wetland habitats the loss and degradation of wetland breeding sites is repeatedly identified as the greatest factor contributing to declining amphibian populations in this region southern interior reptile and amphibian recovery team 2008 lea 2008 estimates that 84 of low elevation wetlands have been lost as a result of post settlement activities in the okanagan valley similarly coelho 2015 reports a 63 decline in the number of ponds in the semi arid grasslands of the province since the early 1990 s with a concurrent 54 decrease in the surface area of remaining ponds with climate change and increased development pressures it is anticipated that wetland loss will continue throughout this valley it is therefore critical to understand how the okanagan landscape functionally connects amphibian habitat to guide land use management throughout this region the western tiger salamander is provincially red listed as critically imperiled bc conservation data centre 2018 and nationally listed as endangered cosewic 2012 within british columbia the western tiger salamander s range is restricted to the south okanagan and similkameen valleys currently there are 75 known breeding sites distributed throughout the okanagan however these sites show considerable variation in suitability year to year and many have not been used in decades dyer o pers comm 2016 aside from short breeding periods the western tiger salamander is primarily a terrestrial species and will spend much of its life in underground burrows created by small mammals loredo et al 1996 trenham 2001 although semlitsch 1982 suggests that some species within the genus ambystoma may dig their own burrows currently in the okanagan the western tiger salamander range is naturally constrained to low elevation wetlands in the valley bottom with considerable urban development reducing available habitat fig 1 there is clear need to evaluate if and where connectivity exists across terrestrial habitat that can facilitate western tiger salamander dispersal 2 2 wetland analysis an inventory of all wetlands in the study area was obtained from ecoscape environmental consulting limited the risk of drying for each wetland was determined with google earth pro by manually searching through available satellite images for each wetland over the period from 2004 2015 each wetland was classified as one of three visually distinguishable groups permanently inundated contained water across all available imagery variably inundated contained water in some of the available imagery and never inundated never contained water in the available imagery many permanent wetlands in the okanagan valley retain water year round but undergo a considerable reduction in surface area across the summer the footprint of wetlands was therefore divided spatially based on where surface area reductions were visible in satellite imagery and each section of the wetland was then classified accordingly 2 3 modelling framework repast simphony north et al 2013 was used in the following to develop an individual based model of western tiger salamander movement across a spatially explicit landscape as the modelling question is about dispersal and connectivity between wetlands the model only represents dispersal and does not represent other aspects of the western tiger salamander s life cycle or physiology the model is summarized below and a full model description is provided using the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 in appendix a 2 4 individual based model 2 4 1 the landscape the landscape is modeled as a 50 m resolution grid where each grid cell is characterized by its spatial coordinate the presence or absence of roads and major lakes the slope in degrees the presence or absence of wetlands and the risk of each wetland drying a 50 m resolution was used to compromise model runtime efficiency and model detail in addition to a spatial grid a continuous space was used to calculate distances and directions between agents and landscape features 2 4 2 western tiger salamander agents western tiger salamanders are represented as agents that have a location and direction of movement and that move from wetlands into the terrestrial habitat at the beginning of a simulation 1000 agents are created and placed on a grid cell containing a wetland as each wetland is represented as one or several 50 m x 50 m grid cells based on the size of the wetland the number of agents instantiated for each wetland is proportional to the size of that wetland thus maintaining a constant agent density the following variables are initialized a location on the grid and in the continuous space a directional heading of travel and a unique maximum dispersal distance from the initial wetland the maximum dispersal distance for each agent follows an inverse power law wherein a large number of individuals remain in proximity to a wetland and only a small proportion of individuals travel long distances smith and green 2005 in this model we calibrated the rate of decay according to dispersal distance values reported in literature for the closely related california tiger salamander a californiense searcy et al 2013 estimate the euclidean distance travelled by 50 90 and 95 of california tiger salamanders averaged across ponds and years to be 556 1486 and 1849 m respectively a scatter plot was prepared with the values obtained from searcy et al 2013 and fitted with a power law curve the exponent from this relationship was then used in the maximum dispersal distance function finally to prevent the distribution of simulated tiger salamanders from dropping too quickly the minimum dispersal distance was set to 400 m this is consistent with literature that has documented the density of juvenile california tiger salamanders to initially increase with distance from the wetland before dropping off searcy et al 2013 trenham and shaffer 2005 the resulting maximum dispersal function was as follows where u is a pseudo random number in the range of 0 1 m a x i m u m d i s p e r s a l d i s t a n c e 400 1 u 1 1 83 2 4 3 amphibian movement model juvenile amphibian movement from breeding ponds is a complex and multi phase process see review by pittman et al 2014 we attempted to create a parsimonious yet ecologically realistic model of juvenile amphibian movement from aquatic breeding sites and into terrestrial habitat movement was broken into two stages emergence from a wetland and movement into upland terrestrial habitat 1 emergence algorithm previous research suggests amphibians have limited ability to sense the terrestrial habitat surrounding their wetland rothermel 2004 although studies have demonstrated that the overall orientation of emerging juveniles tends to be non random at the pond edge for example walston and mullin 2008 studies that consider multiple years and ponds have shown this bias varies markedly and becomes more uniform over space and time suggesting there is no innate directional bias during emergence jenkins et al 2006 timm et al 2007 moreover the direction of emergence is often not correlated with landscape features past the pond perimeter researchers have therefore hypothesized that although juveniles likely respond to micro habitat at the pond edge overall their direction of dispersal is random semlitsch 2008 rothermel 2004 amphibians will reach suitable habitat or colonize new breeding pools simply by virtue of many juveniles emerging each year we simulated this process by assigning each amphibian agent a unique random initial direction of movement between 0 degrees inclusive and 360 degrees exclusive the agents then emerge from the wetland following that direction 2 dispersal algorithm literature suggests that juveniles will follow a relatively linear trajectory into terrestrial habitat without searching for good habitat categorized as away mode by pittman et al 2014 this behaviour is hypothesized to result from juveniles attempting to move away from the pond edge as quickly as possible to avoid competition and a high rate of predation near the wetland correlated random walks and diffusion models have been suggested as good methods to simulate juvenile dispersal from a wetland pittman and semlitsch 2013 for this model we included a directional persistence function wherein an agent s direction of motion is influenced by its direction of travel agents proceed through a two stage movement algorithm that allows western tiger salamander agents to traverse through their environment 1 their directional heading is randomly deflected a value between plus or minus 45 degrees and 2 the agent moves 1 grid cell following its new directional heading if the agent s new location is on a road there is a 30 chance of mortality as a result of that road also if the agent is on a steep slope greater than 40 degrees or a large lake the agent expires an agent therefore can be removed from a simulation by two mechanisms moving the maximum dispersal distance assigned to that agent during instantiation or encountering a movement barrier roads steep slopes 2 4 4 running the model at the beginning of a simulation series a list is created that stores every grid cell on the landscape containing a wetland an iteration of the model is then run for each wetland grid cell at the beginning of an iteration 1000 western tiger salamander agents are created and placed on a grid cell containing a wetland the following variables are initialized a location on the grid and in the continuous space a directional heading of travel and a maximum dispersal distance from their initial wetland each agent will then emerge from the wetland along their initial directional heading and move following the aforementioned dispersal algorithm agents will continue dispersing across the landscape until either dying as a result of a movement barrier or moving a maximum euclidean dispersal distance from their wetland of emergence 2 4 5 validation and sensitivity analysis local western tiger salamander experts validated that the movement rules and resulting maps were realistic and consistent with how western tiger salamanders are known to interact with their landscape dyer o pers comm 2016 thus providing an expert validation of the landscape level results overall model output was reported to be consistent with expected patterns of western tiger salamander movement on the landscape given the uncertainty with selection of model parameter values a sensitivity analysis was performed to explore how values used in the model influence results see appendix a assumptions about the influence of topography specifically the slope that resulted in mortality as well as the probability of mortality when crossing a road were both found to influence amphibian dispersal by more tightly constraining the size and width of movement corridors areas with high frequency of use for movement appendix a however the overarching pattern of where amphibians moved across the landscape remained relatively unchanged across the sensitivity analysis 2 5 scenarios we developed a series of climate and management scenarios to illustrate how the model can be applied to guide amphibian conservation and land use planning across the study area first to explore how different climatic conditions may influence connectivity we used the individual based model to explore three varying levels of simulated drought hereafter climate scenarios this was accomplished by running scenarios with landscapes that included only permanently inundated wetlands a dry year permanently and variably inundated wetlands an average year and all wetlands a wet year we assumed that under dry conditions ephemeral wetlands are more prone to water level reductions shortened hydroperiods and increased susceptibility to drying than permanent wetlands thus wetlands or nodes are non randomly removed from the simulation according to their historic hydrologic conditions to explore the impact of climate on landscape connectivity and wetland network topography second to explore the contribution of confirmed breeding wetlands to western tiger salamander connectivity hereafter breeding scenario we included only wetlands that are known to support breeding in the simulation and removed all other wetlands a record of known western tiger salamander breeding wetlands was retrieved from the british columbia ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations and rural development pers comm dyer 2016 2 6 analysis of simulation results two forms of output were used to assess landscape connectivity under each scenario a spatial analysis to identify regions on the landscape that promote connectivity and a graph theory analysis to highlight the relative contribution of each wetland to network connectivity as well as the effect of various scenarios on global connectivity indices the individual based model results were interpreted spatially to identify areas that contribute to western tiger salamander connectivity the individual based model was programmed to record the movement path used by dispersing agents every time an agent moved during a simulation its new x and y coordinate was recorded after the simulation terminated the number of times a western tiger salamander used each pixel on the landscape across simulations was aggregated into a map and outputted into arcgis 10 5 to identify regions that contribute to connectivity the relative frequency of use for movement number of times each pixel was used for movement by agents divided by the number of times the most used pixel was crossed was calculated for each output layer under this analysis both successful dispersal events defined herein as agents that disperse from a wetland of origin to a new wetland as well as unsuccessful dispersal events defined herein as agents that do not reach a new wetland were included this was done to represent areas that may promote connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic habitats as well as wetland to wetland connectivity pittman et al 2014 to identify the relative contribution of each wetland to maintaining landscape connectivity the individual based modelling results were analyzed with a graph theory approach for each climate scenario a wetland network was constructed following these rules 1 one node was created for every existing wetland 2 any two nodes were connected by an undirected edge if at least one western tiger salamander successfully traveled from one wetland to the other during simulations 3 edges were given a weight equal to the proportion of western tiger salamanders that successfully dispersed from one node wetland to the other the proportion of successful dispersals from wetland x to wetland y was calculated as a weighted function of the total number of agents that dispersed from wetland x to remove biases resulting from the number of individuals instantiated for each wetland see section 2 4 2 as the proportion of successful dispersals between any two nodes is asymmetrical depending on direction of travel we used the means of these proportions as the weight of edges for each network the node scale betweenness centrality and global efficiency of the network was computed betweenness centrality is a measure of the relative contribution of each node to the overall network connectivity freeman 1978 the frequency distribution of betweenness centrality was calculated to determine the extent to which a given network s connectivity relies on only a few very central wetlands global efficiency is a network scale measure of connectivity latora and marchiori 2001 efficiency is strongly correlated to the average path length of a network the average shortest number of edges separating all pairs of nodes in a network but unlike it it is normalized between 0 and 1 and can be used on fractured networks the network models were programmed in python within the igraph programing environment 3 results 3 1 wetland analysis a total of 439 wetlands were mapped within the study area 32 5 permanently inundated 36 7 variably inundated and 30 8 never inundated fig 2 breeding sites were most commonly permanently inundated 70 and variably inundated 29 only one of the known breeding sites was classified as never inundated this wetland was a small ditch in a cultivated field it is feasible that this ditch does function as breeding habitat during some years and temporal gaps in the google earth imagery excluded our ability to detect water in this feature 3 2 climate scenario the individual based model was applied to simulate three climate scenarios in the okanagan landscape a wet year average year and dry year figs 3 and 4 show two different representations of these model results the frequency with which each pixel on the landscape was used by dispersing agents in the individual based model and the graphic network of the proportion of successful dispersal events between wetlands respectively under wet year conditions 13 510 000 western tiger salamander agents were instantiated and traversed the landscape based on the emergence and dispersal algorithms of these 23 successfully traversed to a wetland other than its wetland of origin resulting in the formation of 3863 edges between the 439 wetlands as wetlands were removed from the model landscape to simulate average and dry year conditions the number of agents that were instantiated also decreased to 9 624 000 and 4 716 000 respectively a corresponding decrease in the percent of successful wetland to wetland dispersals was observed average year 21 dry year 16 as well as the edges within the network topography average year 2172 dry year 662 overall network connectivity was highest in the simulated wet year global efficiency 0 25 and declined considerably in the simulated average global efficiency 0 13 and dry years global efficiency 0 02 fig 4 under dry year conditions a pinch point prevented any successful north south dispersal events fragmenting the network into two major sub networks figs 3 and 4 flooding of ephemeral wetlands in the average and wet year scenarios caused these sub networks to become connected additionally a small sub network on the western edge of the study area was isolated under dry year conditions but supported north south connectivity during average and wet year conditions wetlands with high betweenness values proportional to the node size were distributed throughout the landscape and varied in magnitude and location across the three simulated climate conditions fig 4 3 3 breeding scenario under the breeding scenario the number of dispersing individuals was 2 947 000 9 of which successfully dispersed to a wetland a considerable reduction in the number of edges 223 relative to the three climate scenarios was observed in the breeding scenario simulation figs 3 and 4 resulting in the network fragmenting into three sub networks global efficiency 0 0038 4 discussion faced with unprecedentedly high rates of habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale a shared goal of conservation biology is to maintain existing habitat and biodiversity as well as build resilience within ecosystems to respond to changing environments heller and zavaleta 2009 this is particularly true of amphibians which are facing unprecedented declines globally houlahan et al 2000 and are disproportionately impacted by climate and anthropogenic change ryan et al 2014 because amphibians often persist in landscapes where wetlands are highly dynamic and fluctuate considerably in hydroperiod inundation and suitability preserving landscape level connectivity will be fundamental to population viability under a changing climate semlitsch 2000 however incorporating connectivity into decision making processes and regulatory frameworks requires a nuanced understanding of how amphibians disperse across their landscape the work presented in this study demonstrates the utility of coupling a graph theory approach with an individual based model to explore how connectivity changes across a mosaic of temporary and permanent wetlands under various climate conditions and land use management decisions our model predicts that western tiger salamander breeding pools in the okanagan valley become increasingly isolated as conditions dry and that intermittent temporary wetlands may provide key stepping stones between populations during wet years as the level of drought increased and the number of wetlands on the landscape decreased connectivity also decreased figs 3 and 4 periods of drought may thus effectively isolate western tiger salamanders into small clusters across the landscape then during sporadic wet years critical temporary wetlands may become inundated and facilitate the exchange of individuals between these clusters bishop taylor et al 2015 if such stepping stone wetlands are lost as a result of climate change or human land use changes amphibian populations may become isolated into discrete clusters across a functionally fragmented landscape conserving temporary wetlands that act as stepping stones between wetland clusters could therefore be critical to maintaining amphibian connectivity and ultimately population viability saura et al 2014 zetterberg et al 2010 we simulated a future where only breeding sites are protected and all other wetlands are lost i e breeding scenario this results in a catastrophic decline in connectivity effectively isolating the population into three clusters with no opportunity for dispersal across clusters figs 3 and 4 although this simulation is somewhat unrealistic it does serve two purposes first the fact that amphibians are distributed across the entire study area suggests that either there were historically breeding sites that link the clusters observed in fig 4 that have already been lost or some of the existing wetlands for which breeding has not been observed do in fact support amphibian breeding this may be valuable information for guiding future amphibian survey work as well as wetland restoration creation initiatives second this simulation highlights the implications of considerable wetland losses to amphibians only 20 percent of the existing wetlands were included in this simulation although we cannot predict the extent of future wetland losses this simulation demonstrates the potential broad reaching and cumulative impacts of human and climate changes to amphibian connectivity while conservation efforts that focus on protecting known breeding areas are important these results suggest that this will not be an effective strategy for maintaining connectivity across a landscape our results are comparable to those of zamberletti et al 2018 who developed a theoretical amphibian population dynamics model that included a probability of dispersal from a wetland in a network to connected wetlands based on the distance between wetlands unlike the model developed by zamberletti et al 2018 however our approach does not prescribe network structure but allows it to emerge from individual movement and interaction with the landscape despite the different modelling approaches the fact that both result in similar conclusions and recommendations for conservation of wetland networks is an interesting cross validation of techniques indeed a simple graphical analysis that identifies the number of wetlands within the maximum western tiger salamander dispersal range could have illustrated similar results the individual based model however incorporates the interplay between landscape structure and species specific movement behaviour into dispersal distances the individual based modelling approach we have applied here also identifies probable movement paths within the physical constraints of the landscape topography and clearly illustrates regions that facilitate connectivity without requiring any knowledge of the underlying model or network theory we believe this approach is highly amenable to land use planning and regulatory processes increasing uptake by decision makers further the individual based modelling results shown in fig 3 illustrate both successful and unsuccessful dispersal paths unsuccessful dispersal events may provide insight into important migratory routes between wetland and terrestrial habitat pittman et al 2014 by conducting a network topography analysis of the individual based model results we have highlighted several bottlenecks to dispersal where connectivity was effectively fragmented and identified key wetlands that play a large role in maintaining landscape level connectivity under a range of climate scenarios these results were not readily apparent in the individual based model results alone coupling individual based models with a network analysis may provide insight into the role of landscape structure in connectivity for complex ecological systems lookingbill et al 2010 thus enabling more informed land use decision making processes we feel the modelling approach presented herein is highly adaptable to other species with complex life cycles or for systems where landscape variability is an important driver of metapopulation dynamics future extensions of this work could explore the effect of random noise on network topography i e by adding breeding sites randomly to understand how unexpected dispersal events might impact landscape level connectivity accidental non native tiger salamander introductions have been documented in the united states as a consequence of the sport fishing bait industry johnson et al 2011 although to our knowledge tiger salamanders are not used as fishing bait in the okanagan valley accidental translocations from larvae stowaways or as a result of bucket biologists may occur this model could be adopted to explore how such unintended translocations may impact landscape level connectivity 5 conclusions amphibian population vitality is dependent upon the availability of wetlands across a landscape wetlands are dynamic features that form spatio temporal networks that are intricately linked across a landscape bishop taylor et al 2018 cui et al 2012 and which respond and adapt to perturbations including climate or anthropogenic change not unsurprising the results of this work emphasize that wetland losses will not only decrease the availability of amphibian breeding sites but will also degrade and fragment connectivity networks across a landscape maintaining a functionally connected wetland ecosystem may become critical to safeguarding amphibian populations within changing climates current regulatory frameworks often focus on the pond as patches archetype to amphibian conservation which can overlook the broader context and function of a wetland there is a clear need to expand management strategies from the scale of a single patch i e wetland to a nuanced view of how patches are integrated and interact with a landscape lindenmayer et al 2008 in the absence of strategies that take a landscape level approach to amphibian conservation it is likely that human and climate induced wetland losses will continue to fragment amphibian populations in our study area

24906,habitat loss and fragmentation continue to drive declines of amphibian populations maintaining connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and across wetlands is critical to amphibian conservation particularly in regions where climate change may exacerbate habitat loss our objective was to study the impact of climate and human driven losses in ephemeral wetlands on functional connectivity for amphibians using the endangered western tiger salamander ambystoma mavortium in british columbia canada as a case study land use data and dispersal characteristics for the western tiger salamander were used to develop a spatially explicit individual based model of amphibian movement the model was configured to explore connectivity under three climate scenarios a wet average and dry year and a land management scenario in which only known breeding sites are conserved we used a spatial network analysis to identify key ephemeral wetlands that connect otherwise isolated sub networks across the landscape and probable movement paths between wetlands and the upland terrestrial habitat our results illustrate the importance of conserving ephemeral wetlands as stepping stones we argue that a landscape approach to wetland conservation rather than just conserving known breeding sites is essential for retaining viable amphibian populations in a context of human induced habitat loss and climate change keywords connectivity graph theory individual based model agent based model amphibian spatial network 1 introduction human and climate driven habitat loss and fragmentation continue to pose a threat to amphibians globally becker et al 2007 cushman 2006 hof et al 2011 many amphibians have complex life cycles and require access to aquatic habitat for breeding larval development and metamorphosis as well as upland terrestrial habitat to facilitate adult life stages thus amphibians are sensitive to a loss or alteration of aquatic and terrestrial habitat as well as connectivity between these features becker et al 2010 the importance of preserving wetlands and their surrounding terrestrial habitat has become well established semlitsch and bodie 2003 trenham and shaffer 2005 and regulations policies and recommendations are in place throughout much of north america to protect these features bauer et al 2010 environment canada 2013 however there is concern that wetland conservation strategies focus narrowly on the individual wetland i e a pond as patch archetype to conservation and fail to safeguard networks of wetlands upland terrestrial habitat and the intervening matrix that collectively support landscape scale processes for aquatic species with complex life cycles baldwin et al 2006 ficetola et al 2009 marsh and trenham 2001 roe and georges 2007 the pond as patch approach to wetland conservation is particularly problematic in dry semi arid landscapes where wetlands are often temporary i e ephemeral vernal or seasonal wetlands and fluctuate in quantity and quality as a result of annual variations in stochastic environmental processes e g precipitation patterns drake et al 2017a consequently wetlands can form networks of wetland complexes that drive natural fluctuations in amphibian breeding patterns across a landscape hecnar and m closkey 1996 trenham et al 2003 werner et al 2007 giving rise to metapopulations gill 1978 hanski 1998 but see smith and green 2005 where habitat patches i e wetlands are linked by dispersal for amphibians that form a metapopulation wetland clusters and intervening connections may be a more meaningful management unit than an individual wetland landscape connectivity or the ability of a landscape to facilitate movement fischer and lindenmayer 2007 taylor et al 1993 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 is fundamental to metapopulation dynamics and amphibian dispersal baguette et al 2013 rothermel 2004 landscape connectivity can be difficult to characterize particularly for cryptic small species such as amphibians modelling techniques provide a mechanism for simulating dispersal characteristics to explore connectivity with limited existing data graph theory is particularly amenable to assessing amphibian connectivity as wetlands can be represented as nodes connected by dispersal events links or edges marsh and trenham 2001 minor and urban 2007 urban and keitt 2001 several studies have used network approaches to explore amphibian populations and wetland connectivity albanese and haukos 2017 bishop taylor et al 2017 drake et al 2016 drake et al 2017b fortuna et al 2006 peterman et al 2016 ribeiro et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2015 however successfully employing a network theory approach requires some knowledge of landscape permeability or dispersal characteristics to represent links between nodes individual based models are emerging as a powerful tool to explore landscape connectivity for wildlife e g aben et al 2014 2016 bocedi et al 2014 girard et al 2015 kanagaraj et al 2013 mcentire and maerz 2019 palmer et al 2011 pe er et al 2011 and are a promising method to quantifying network links by simulating dispersal between habitat patches across a spatially explicit landscape lookingbill et al 2016 in the following study we link a parsimonious yet ecologically realistic individual based model of amphibian movement with a network analyses to identify how a spatially explicit landscape promotes or restricts amphibian movement a series of simulations were developed to explore how varying levels of wetland inundation as well as different land use management actions can impact connectivity the results of these simulations were then analyzed with a graph theory approach to determine how wetlands are linked to form a network as well as to identify key wetlands that are highly important to network topography across the landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 case study location and species the western tiger salamander ambystoma mavortium of the southern okanagan valley british columbia canada was used as a case study for this analysis fig 1 among the driest regions in canada the okanagan is at the northern periphery of the dry shrub steppe grassland ecosystem that extends from the columbia basin in the united states wetlands in the okanagan are highly dynamic and often inundated only during wet years or seasonally after snowmelt further wetland habitats in the okanagan are integrated as part of a multifunctional landscape dominated by human land use due to limited land for urban development there is increasing social and economic pressure to develop into wetland habitats the loss and degradation of wetland breeding sites is repeatedly identified as the greatest factor contributing to declining amphibian populations in this region southern interior reptile and amphibian recovery team 2008 lea 2008 estimates that 84 of low elevation wetlands have been lost as a result of post settlement activities in the okanagan valley similarly coelho 2015 reports a 63 decline in the number of ponds in the semi arid grasslands of the province since the early 1990 s with a concurrent 54 decrease in the surface area of remaining ponds with climate change and increased development pressures it is anticipated that wetland loss will continue throughout this valley it is therefore critical to understand how the okanagan landscape functionally connects amphibian habitat to guide land use management throughout this region the western tiger salamander is provincially red listed as critically imperiled bc conservation data centre 2018 and nationally listed as endangered cosewic 2012 within british columbia the western tiger salamander s range is restricted to the south okanagan and similkameen valleys currently there are 75 known breeding sites distributed throughout the okanagan however these sites show considerable variation in suitability year to year and many have not been used in decades dyer o pers comm 2016 aside from short breeding periods the western tiger salamander is primarily a terrestrial species and will spend much of its life in underground burrows created by small mammals loredo et al 1996 trenham 2001 although semlitsch 1982 suggests that some species within the genus ambystoma may dig their own burrows currently in the okanagan the western tiger salamander range is naturally constrained to low elevation wetlands in the valley bottom with considerable urban development reducing available habitat fig 1 there is clear need to evaluate if and where connectivity exists across terrestrial habitat that can facilitate western tiger salamander dispersal 2 2 wetland analysis an inventory of all wetlands in the study area was obtained from ecoscape environmental consulting limited the risk of drying for each wetland was determined with google earth pro by manually searching through available satellite images for each wetland over the period from 2004 2015 each wetland was classified as one of three visually distinguishable groups permanently inundated contained water across all available imagery variably inundated contained water in some of the available imagery and never inundated never contained water in the available imagery many permanent wetlands in the okanagan valley retain water year round but undergo a considerable reduction in surface area across the summer the footprint of wetlands was therefore divided spatially based on where surface area reductions were visible in satellite imagery and each section of the wetland was then classified accordingly 2 3 modelling framework repast simphony north et al 2013 was used in the following to develop an individual based model of western tiger salamander movement across a spatially explicit landscape as the modelling question is about dispersal and connectivity between wetlands the model only represents dispersal and does not represent other aspects of the western tiger salamander s life cycle or physiology the model is summarized below and a full model description is provided using the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 in appendix a 2 4 individual based model 2 4 1 the landscape the landscape is modeled as a 50 m resolution grid where each grid cell is characterized by its spatial coordinate the presence or absence of roads and major lakes the slope in degrees the presence or absence of wetlands and the risk of each wetland drying a 50 m resolution was used to compromise model runtime efficiency and model detail in addition to a spatial grid a continuous space was used to calculate distances and directions between agents and landscape features 2 4 2 western tiger salamander agents western tiger salamanders are represented as agents that have a location and direction of movement and that move from wetlands into the terrestrial habitat at the beginning of a simulation 1000 agents are created and placed on a grid cell containing a wetland as each wetland is represented as one or several 50 m x 50 m grid cells based on the size of the wetland the number of agents instantiated for each wetland is proportional to the size of that wetland thus maintaining a constant agent density the following variables are initialized a location on the grid and in the continuous space a directional heading of travel and a unique maximum dispersal distance from the initial wetland the maximum dispersal distance for each agent follows an inverse power law wherein a large number of individuals remain in proximity to a wetland and only a small proportion of individuals travel long distances smith and green 2005 in this model we calibrated the rate of decay according to dispersal distance values reported in literature for the closely related california tiger salamander a californiense searcy et al 2013 estimate the euclidean distance travelled by 50 90 and 95 of california tiger salamanders averaged across ponds and years to be 556 1486 and 1849 m respectively a scatter plot was prepared with the values obtained from searcy et al 2013 and fitted with a power law curve the exponent from this relationship was then used in the maximum dispersal distance function finally to prevent the distribution of simulated tiger salamanders from dropping too quickly the minimum dispersal distance was set to 400 m this is consistent with literature that has documented the density of juvenile california tiger salamanders to initially increase with distance from the wetland before dropping off searcy et al 2013 trenham and shaffer 2005 the resulting maximum dispersal function was as follows where u is a pseudo random number in the range of 0 1 m a x i m u m d i s p e r s a l d i s t a n c e 400 1 u 1 1 83 2 4 3 amphibian movement model juvenile amphibian movement from breeding ponds is a complex and multi phase process see review by pittman et al 2014 we attempted to create a parsimonious yet ecologically realistic model of juvenile

algorithm literature suggests that juveniles will follow a relatively linear trajectory into terrestrial habitat without searching for good habitat categorized as away mode by pittman et al 2014 this behaviour is hypothesized to result from juveniles attempting to move away from the pond edge as quickly as possible to avoid competition and a high rate of predation near the wetland correlated random walks and diffusion models have been suggested as good methods to simulate juvenile dispersal from a wetland pittman and semlitsch 2013 for this model we included a directional persistence function wherein an agent s direction of motion is influenced by its direction of travel agents proceed through a two stage movement algorithm that allows western tiger salamander agents to traverse through their environment 1 their directional heading is randomly deflected a value between plus or minus 45 degrees and 2 the agent moves 1 grid cell following its new directional heading if the agent s new location is on a road there is a 30 chance of mortality as a result of that road also if the agent is on a steep slope greater than 40 degrees or a large lake the agent expires an agent therefore can be removed from a simulation by two mechanisms moving the maximum dispersal distance assigned to that agent during instantiation or encountering a movement barrier roads steep slopes 2 4

maximum euclidean dispersal distance from their wetland of emergence 2 4 5 validation and sensitivity analysis local western tiger salamander experts validated that the movement rules and resulting maps were realistic and consistent with how western tiger salamanders are known to interact with their landscape dyer o pers comm 2016 thus providing an expert validation of the landscape level

we developed a series of climate and management scenarios to illustrate how the model can be applied to guide amphibian conservation and land use planning across the study area first to explore how different climatic conditions may influence connectivity we used the individual based model to explore three varying levels of simulated drought hereafter climate scenarios this was accomplished by

under dry conditions ephemeral wetlands are more prone to water level reductions shortened hydroperiods and increased susceptibility to drying than permanent wetlands thus wetlands or nodes are non randomly removed from the simulation according to their historic hydrologic conditions to explore the impact of climate on landscape connectivity and wetland network topography second to explore the contribution of confirmed breeding wetlands to western tiger salamander connectivity hereafter breeding scenario we included only wetlands that are known to support breeding in the simulation and removed all other wetlands a record of known western tiger salamander breeding wetlands was retrieved from the british columbia ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations and rural development pers comm dyer 2016 2 6 analysis of simulation results two forms of output were used to assess landscape connectivity under each scenario a spatial analysis to identify regions on the landscape that promote connectivity and a graph theory analysis to highlight the relative contribution of each wetland to network connectivity as well as the effect of various scenarios on global connectivity indices the individual based model results were interpreted spatially to identify areas that contribute to western tiger salamander connectivity the individual based model was programmed to record the movement path used by dispersing agents every time an agent moved during a simulation its new x and y coordinate was recorded after the simulation terminated the number of times a western tiger salamander used each pixel on the landscape across simulations was aggregated into a map and outputted into arcgis 10 5 to identify regions that contribute to connectivity the relative frequency of use for movement number of times each pixel was used for movement by agents divided by the number of times the most used pixel was crossed was calculated for each output layer under this analysis both successful dispersal events defined herein as agents that disperse from a wetland of origin to a new wetland as well as unsuccessful dispersal events defined herein as agents that do not reach a new wetland were included this was done to represent areas that may promote connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic habitats as well as wetland to wetland connectivity pittman et al 2014 to identify the relative contribution of each wetland to maintaining landscape connectivity the individual based modelling results were analyzed with a graph theory approach for each climate scenario a wetland network was constructed following these rules 1 one node was created for every existing wetland 2 any two nodes were connected by an undirected edge if at least one western tiger salamander successfully traveled from one wetland to the other during simulations 3 edges were given a weight equal to the proportion of western tiger salamanders that successfully dispersed from one node wetland to the other the proportion of successful dispersals from wetland x to wetland y was calculated as a weighted function of the total number of agents that dispersed from wetland x to remove biases resulting from the number of individuals instantiated for each wetland see section 2 4 2 as the proportion of successful dispersals between any two nodes is asymmetrical depending on direction of travel we used the means of these proportions as the weight of edges for each network the node scale betweenness centrality and global efficiency of the network was computed betweenness centrality is a measure of the relative contribution of each node to the overall network connectivity freeman 1978 the frequency distribution of betweenness centrality was calculated to determine the extent to which a given network s connectivity relies on only a few very central wetlands global efficiency is a network scale measure of connectivity latora and marchiori 2001 efficiency is strongly correlated to the average path length of a network the average shortest number of edges separating all pairs of nodes in a network but unlike it it is normalized between 0 and 1 and can be used on fractured networks the network models were programmed in python within the igraph programing environment 3 results 3 1 wetland analysis a total of 439 wetlands were mapped within the study area 32 5 permanently inundated 36 7 variably inundated and 30 8 never inundated fig 2 breeding sites were most commonly permanently inundated 70 and variably inundated 29 only one of the known breeding sites was classified as never inundated this wetland was a small ditch in a cultivated field it is feasible that this ditch does function as breeding habitat during some years and temporal gaps in the google earth imagery excluded our ability to detect water in this feature 3 2 climate scenario the individual based model was applied to simulate three climate scenarios in the okanagan landscape a wet year average year and dry year figs 3 and 4 show two different representations of these model results the frequency with which each pixel on the landscape was used by dispersing agents in the individual based model and the graphic network of the proportion of successful dispersal events between wetlands respectively under wet year conditions 13 510 000 western tiger salamander agents were instantiated and traversed the landscape based on the emergence and dispersal algorithms of these 23 successfully traversed to a wetland other than its wetland of origin resulting in the formation of 3863 edges between the 439 wetlands as wetlands were removed from the model landscape to simulate average and dry year conditions the number of agents that were instantiated also decreased to 9 624 000 and 4 716 000 respectively a corresponding decrease in the percent of successful wetland to wetland dispersals was observed average year 21 dry year 16 as well as the edges within the network topography average year 2172 dry year 662 overall network connectivity was highest in the simulated wet year global efficiency 0 25 and declined considerably in the simulated average global efficiency 0 13 and dry years global efficiency 0 02 fig 4 under dry year conditions a pinch point prevented any successful north south dispersal events fragmenting the network into two major sub networks figs 3 and 4 flooding of ephemeral wetlands in the average and wet year scenarios caused these sub networks to become connected additionally a small sub network on the western edge of the study area was isolated under dry year conditions but supported north south connectivity during average and wet year conditions wetlands with high betweenness values proportional to the node size were distributed throughout the landscape and varied in magnitude and location across the three simulated climate conditions fig 4 3 3 breeding scenario under the breeding scenario the number of dispersing individuals was 2 947 000 9 of which successfully dispersed to a wetland a considerable reduction in the number of edges 223 relative to the three climate scenarios was observed in the breeding scenario simulation figs 3 and 4 resulting in the network fragmenting into three sub networks global efficiency 0 0038 4 discussion faced with unprecedentedly high rates of habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale a shared goal of conservation biology is to maintain existing habitat and biodiversity as well as build resilience within ecosystems to respond to changing environments heller and zavaleta 2009 this is particularly true of amphibians which are facing unprecedented declines globally houlahan et al 2000 and are disproportionately impacted by climate and anthropogenic change ryan et al 2014 because amphibians often persist in landscapes where wetlands are highly dynamic and fluctuate considerably in hydroperiod inundation and suitability preserving landscape level connectivity will be fundamental to population viability under a changing climate semlitsch 2000 however incorporating connectivity into decision making processes and regulatory frameworks requires a nuanced understanding of how amphibians disperse across their landscape the work presented in this study demonstrates the utility of coupling a graph theory approach with an individual based model to explore how connectivity changes across a mosaic of temporary and permanent wetlands under various climate conditions and land use management decisions our model predicts that western tiger salamander breeding pools in the okanagan valley become increasingly isolated as conditions dry and that intermittent temporary wetlands may provide key stepping stones between populations during wet years as the level of drought increased and the number of wetlands on the landscape decreased connectivity also decreased figs 3 and 4 periods of drought may thus effectively isolate western tiger salamanders into small clusters across the landscape then during sporadic wet years critical temporary wetlands may become inundated and facilitate the exchange of individuals between these clusters bishop taylor et al 2015 if such stepping stone wetlands are lost as a result of climate change or human land use changes amphibian populations may become isolated into discrete clusters across a functionally fragmented landscape conserving temporary wetlands that act as stepping stones between wetland clusters could therefore be critical to maintaining amphibian connectivity and ultimately population viability saura et al 2014 zetterberg et al 2010 we simulated a future where only breeding sites are protected and all other wetlands are lost i e breeding scenario this results in a catastrophic decline in connectivity effectively isolating the population into three clusters with no opportunity for dispersal across clusters figs 3 and 4 although this simulation is somewhat unrealistic it does serve two purposes first the fact that amphibians are distributed across the entire study area suggests that either there were historically breeding sites that link the clusters observed in fig 4 that have already been lost or some of the existing wetlands for which breeding has not been observed do in fact support amphibian breeding this may be valuable information for guiding future amphibian survey work as well as wetland restoration creation initiatives second this simulation highlights the implications of considerable wetland losses to amphibians only 20 percent of the existing wetlands were included in this simulation although we cannot predict the extent of future wetland losses this simulation demonstrates the potential broad reaching and cumulative impacts of human and climate changes to amphibian connectivity while conservation efforts that focus on protecting known breeding areas are important these results suggest that this will not be an effective strategy for maintaining connectivity across a landscape our results are comparable to those of zamberletti et al 2018 who developed a theoretical amphibian population dynamics model that included a probability of dispersal from a wetland in a network to connected wetlands based on the distance between wetlands unlike the model developed by zamberletti et al 2018 however our approach does not prescribe network structure but allows it to emerge from individual movement and interaction with the landscape despite the different modelling approaches the fact that both result in similar conclusions and recommendations for conservation of wetland networks is an interesting cross validation of techniques indeed a simple graphical analysis that identifies the number of wetlands within the maximum western tiger salamander dispersal range could have illustrated similar results the individual based model however incorporates the interplay between landscape structure and species specific movement behaviour into dispersal distances the individual based modelling approach we have applied here also identifies probable movement paths within the physical constraints of the landscape topography and clearly illustrates regions that facilitate connectivity without requiring any knowledge of the underlying model or network theory we believe this approach is highly amenable to land use planning and regulatory processes increasing uptake by decision makers further the individual based modelling results shown in fig 3 illustrate both successful and unsuccessful dispersal paths unsuccessful dispersal events may provide insight into important migratory routes between wetland and terrestrial habitat pittman et al 2014 by conducting a network topography analysis of the individual based model results we have highlighted several bottlenecks to dispersal where connectivity was effectively fragmented and identified key wetlands that play a large role in maintaining landscape level connectivity under a range of climate scenarios these results were not readily apparent in the individual based model results alone coupling individual based models with a network analysis may provide insight into the role of landscape structure in connectivity for complex ecological systems lookingbill et al 2010 thus enabling more informed land use decision making processes we feel the modelling approach presented herein is highly adaptable to other species with complex life cycles or for systems where landscape variability is an important driver of metapopulation dynamics future extensions of this work could explore the effect of random noise on network topography i e by adding breeding sites randomly to understand how unexpected dispersal events might impact landscape level connectivity accidental non native tiger salamander introductions have been documented in the united states as a consequence of the sport fishing bait industry johnson et al 2011 although to our knowledge tiger salamanders are not used as fishing bait in the okanagan valley accidental translocations from larvae stowaways or as a result of bucket biologists may occur this model could be adopted to explore how such unintended translocations may impact landscape level connectivity 5 conclusions amphibian population vitality is dependent upon the availability of wetlands across a landscape wetlands are dynamic features that form spatio temporal networks that are intricately linked across a landscape bishop taylor et al 2018 cui et al 2012 and which respond and adapt to perturbations including climate or anthropogenic change not unsurprising the results of this work emphasize that wetland losses will not only decrease the availability of amphibian breeding sites but will also degrade and fragment connectivity networks across a landscape maintaining a functionally connected wetland ecosystem may become critical to safeguarding amphibian populations within changing climates current regulatory frameworks often focus on the pond as patches archetype to amphibian conservation which can overlook the broader context and function of a wetland there is a clear need to expand management strategies from the scale of a single patch i e wetland to a nuanced view of how patches are integrated and interact with a landscape lindenmayer et al 2008 in the absence of strategies that take a landscape level approach to amphibian conservation it is likely that human and climate induced wetland losses will continue to fragment amphibian populations in our study area

24907,remote sensing of forest environments through sound holds promise for a renewed and extended effort in monitoring vegetation distribution and associated characteristics here we introduce a new acoustic sensing approach that exploits the geometric phase of ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves resulting from their scattering by trees in forest environments using a simulated model forest with different spatial arrangements of trees as a testbed we numerically calculate the geometric phase of acoustic waves and show that it is exquisitely sensitive to the spatial pattern of trees this topological acoustic sensing modality provides a novel quantitative insightful way to characterize global properties of tree spatial distribution which is fundamental to forest management sound has virtually never been used to support quantitative forest monitoring and here we elaborate on the wider implications and applications of topological acoustic sensing in remote landscapes as a very promising concept keywords acoustic seismic waves sensing geometric phase landscape density 1 introduction in natural forests trees are not uniformly distributed but instead form spatially heterogeneous patterns and distinct clusters shaped by endogeneous and exogeneous processes such as fires larson and churchill 2012 or resource distribution larson and churchill 2012 for instance describe tree spatial patterning in terms of clumps individuals and openings a clump is a group of trees of similar size clustered together individuals are well separated trees forming random patterns and openings are gaps in the forest that are not occupied by trees the spatial distribution of trees in forests influences many metrics as well as dynamic processes such as timber volume future fires nutrient distributions and forest regeneration given the importance of spatial distribution there is a need for quantitative descriptions for classifying distributions of ecological elements greig smith 1952 1983 while forests are not well monitored specifically for inaccessible locations detection of tree spatial patterns in real world landscapes is an important component of forest monitoring needed to inform forecasts and scenarios for sustainable forest management carrer et al 2018 natural and human activities combine to produce sound that propagate through forests mullet et al 2016 sound can reveal dimensions and structures of landscapes that are otherwise easily overlooked and not accessible measured or considered in conventional studies sharma 2018 sahin and ince 2009 turner et al 2018 acoustic sensing and soundscape analysis yield novel insights with promising applications acoustic sensing provides indicators of forest structural changes which inform about the intensity direction and modalities of these changes acoustic sounding systems can provide data about forest environmental change and measures of the intensity of human activities and their impact sharma 2018 turner et al 2018 acoustic sensing can also be used to detect early warnings of forest fires sahin and ince 2009 conventionally soundscape data have been analyzed in the frequency domain using the power spectral density as a central concept turner et al 2018 such analyses however do not provide direct information on the nature and dynamics of heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of trees in recent years though topological acoustics has become a powerful approach to describe sound waves that now includes geometrical attributes as an additional source of information for the analysis and applications of sound waves deymier and runge 2017 zhang et al 2018 topological acoustics exploits the complete range of acoustic wave properties to extend beyond the traditional canonical attributes of sound wave frequency ω and wave vector k and now embrace the geometric domains of amplitude a and phase η topological acoustics exploits the geometrical characteristics of sound amplitude and phase imparted by the symmetry breaking that results when an environment such as a forest scatters an acoustic wave as a result the geometrical phase of the sound is a sensitive measure of sound environment interactions the power of topological acoustic sensing resides in this geometric phase being a global metric of the sound scattering environment thus topological acoustics paves the way for novel analytical strategies that extend acoustic sensing and provide a more complete sound based characterization of forest structure this sound based method would allow for continuous regular monitoring over long periods of time and may help address issues of transferability associated with expensive traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellite imaging díaz delgado et al 2017 additionally due to its topological nature this method may aid in developing grid based atlases of vegetal density for a variety of grid sizes franklin 2010 long wavelength ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves stein and wysession 2009 are pertinent probes for applications of topological acoustic to sensing forest environments this has been shown recently by the strong interaction that occurs between seismic waves of a few tens of hz and trees from a forest colombi et al 2016 maurel et al 2018 here we investigate whether and how ground supported long wavelength acoustic waves such as seismic waves that can propagate over great distances at the interface between ground and above ground forest cover provide us with information about the tree spatial pattern based on our previous work deymier and runge 2017 we introduce a new approach for acoustic sensing that utilizes the geometric phase of scattered ground supported acoustic waves as a highly sensitive measure of the global properties of forest spatial patterns thus providing a useful tool for for instance forest inventories on a landscape scale in the following section we introduce a numerical model that can be used to calculate the geometric phase of acoustic waves resulting from the scattering of ground supported waves by a model forest with different spatial tree distributions the numerical model is based on the green s function formalism of acoustic waves and implemented utilizing the matlab computing environment in section 3 we consider a gradient of model forest structure from a random spatial distribution of individual trees to a single clump of trees the geometric phase of ground supported acoustic waves is shown to be very sensitive to the spatial distribution of the trees demonstrating that topological acoustic sensing can provide a global sensing modality of forest spatial patterns conclusions from these results are drawn in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 method conventional acoustic sensing provides spatial temporal and spectral data on an environment s sound field phase information and more specifically the geometric phase η has traditionally remained outside of conventional sensing methodology instead here we introduce a new approach for acoustic sensing that actually utilizes the geometric phase of scattered acoustic waves as a measure of the global properties of the scattering environment we establish the important relation between an acoustic wave s η and its green s function deymier and runge 2017 see appendix a the acoustic green s function represents the acoustic field supported by some environment resulting from a tap like mechanical stimulus applied at some location within this environment for a given environment the green s function depends on 1 a position variable describing the field 2 a position variable describing the location of the stimulus and 3 the eigenvalue which is effectively the square of the frequency of the acoustic wave e ω 2 the green s function is a complex function we first consider a normalized green s function g ˆ g g g where g is the complex conjugate of g we have g ˆ e e i η e we calculate the derivative of this normalized function with respect to the eigenvalue e 1 d g ˆ e d e 1 g g d g d e g 2 g g 3 2 d g g d e from this derivative we can obtain the berry connection bc berry 1984 in the space of eigenvalues bc is defined as the following quantity 2 b c e i t r g ˆ e d g ˆ e d e where tr is the trace over the spatial domain spanned by the green s function tr sums the quantity in parenthesis of eq 2 over the entire spatial domain the berry connection relates to a change in the η of the acoustic wave field as a whole a global measure of the environment supporting the acoustic field the function b c e can then be understood to describe the variation of the η of the green s function along a path in the space of eigenvalues i e on the space of frequencies using well established green s functions identities related to the properties of the green s function in the space of its eigenvalues see appendix a for details it is possible to show that 3 b c e d η e d e i m t r g eq 3 relates η to a scattering problem i e the scattering of acoustic waves by the environment the η as a function of frequency is an experimentally measurable quantity which is the phase accumulated by an acoustic wave due to scattering by the environment topographical and structural features of the scattering environment such as the spatial distribution of trees in a forest are reflected in the green s function the value of the geometric phase is not sensitive to details or local features of the tree arrangement but is a more global measure we can utilize the geometric phase to classify the environment in terms of global characteristics relative for example to the spatial distribution of constitutive elements such as trees this approach is introduced in more details below 2 2 model we develop an elastic model of a forest including ground and tree cover that can be used to calculate numerically the acoustic green s function for given tree distributions and the corresponding phase η the method is detailed in appendix b this model forest is used to numerically investigate the correlation between tree distribution and η we model the forest landscape as a semi infinite elastic medium ground supporting trees distributed in various patterns in essence each ground anchored tree acts as an elastic resonator here four resonances which scatters ground propagating acoustic waves for this each tree is discretized into a one dimensional 1d linear chain of four masses connected by elastic springs fig 1 a the spacing between masses is denoted by a all trees have the same height and constitution i e the same characteristic vibrational resonances the ground is discretized into a three dimensional simple cubic lattice of masses connected via elastic springs fig 1 a the discrete cubic lattice is cleaved along the 001 plane i e a plane perpendicular to the vertical axis to create the surface of the ground the masses in the cubic lattice are all identical and connected via harmonic springs along the edges of the cubic lattice the spacing of masses in the cubic lattice is also equal to a the trees are elastically anchored to the surface of the semi infinite lattice through another elastic spring for the sake of mathematical and numerical ease we assume that the masses and spring stiffnesses of the trees and tree anchor are identical to those of the ground there is therefore no irregular spatial variability in the ground density or composition for the sake of tractability the dynamic equations of the elastic system composed of discrete trees distributed on the discrete elastic ground are limited to displacements of masses in one single direction the direction of the displacement is unspecified and could be representing either transverse shear or longitudinal pressure polarization of the sound wave the interface response theory irt dobrzynski 1988 1987 enables us to calculate the elastic green s function more specifically the diffusion matrix of the composite elastic medium composed of trees anchored on the ground surface the diffusion matrix is then used to calculate the phase of the scattered wave as a function of the frequency the method of calculation of the green s function diffusion matrix and the phase η is detailed in appendix b and in deymier and runge 2018 once the spectral dependency of the geometric phase η ω is determined for a given environment we aim at evaluating how the phase varies as the spatial structure of the environment changes for instance let us focus on a forest system composed of n c mass spring chain like trees with a spatial distribution described by the 2 n c dimensional vector m on the discrete cleaved surface of the cubic lattice i e ground this vector contains the 2d coordinates of every tree this vector spans the subspace r of m the space of the possible locations of tree anchors for the system defined in the appendix b as see eq b13 r p 1 0 0 0 p 2 x 1 x 2 0 p 3 x 1 x 2 0 p n c x 1 n c 1 x 2 n c 1 0 where p i x 1 i x 2 i 0 defines a 2d position on the 001 surface of the cubic lattice the x i i are integer multiples of the grid spacing of the cubic lattice a following appendix b the phase difference normalized to π between acoustic waves supported by the coupled system trees elastically anchored to the ground and by the uncoupled system trees not anchored is then obtained from the relation η r ε m ω 1 π i m l n d e t δ m m where δ m m is the diffusion matrix the diffusion matrix relates the green s function of the coupled system g m m to that of the uncoupled system g m m via g m m δ m m g m m in the space m it is then clear that since ln d e t δ m m ln d e t g m m ln d e t g m m η r ε m ω stands for the phase difference between the coupled and uncoupled system we can now consider two possible spatial patterns of trees namely r and r the quantity δ η η r ω η r ω represents the difference between the geometric phase of pattern r and r the phase associated with the uncoupled system is independent of the spatial arrangement of the uncoupled mass spring chains and therefore cancels out in the expression of δ η one can consequently calculate the change in geometric phase along chosen paths in the space of all tree spatial patterns here we consider a path that takes the forest landscape from a random but uniform distribution of trees fig 1 b to a clustered spatial distribution of trees fig 1 c the forest spatial pattern evolves from individuals to a single clump we fix the total number of trees to n c 30 located on a 20a 20a area of the ground surface a tree was randomly selected from the starting pattern of individual trees as the center of the clump trees are subsequently removed randomly from elsewhere in the model among the remaining individuals forming gaps the selected trees are added to the clump to maintain the total number of trees constant to limit the space of possible configurations of trees in a clump trees were added in an anticlockwise manner beginning from the top of the central tree the final cluster contains 29 trees therefore there are 29 steps in the development of the clump this process is illustrated in fig 2 3 results in fig 3 we report the calculated variation in density of states δ n ω of the randomly distributed pattern of individual trees as a function of reduced frequency the frequency is reduced by the dimensional multiplicative factor β m where β is the stiffness of the springs and m is the mass of the elements in our discrete ground forest model the reduced frequency spans the interval 0 2 this figure shows the four resonances associated with the four mass spring model of the trees since the trees are separated by distances which prevent them from interacting through the elastic ground the resonance frequencies are degenerate we calculate the phase η numerically as a function of reduced frequency between 0 2 and 0 4 about the first resonance of the trees since the phase can only be determined to within multiple of 2π the plot of η versus frequency of fig 4 has been corrected for these inconsequential 2π jumps the numerically calculated values of η were parsed through and multiples of 2π were added manually resulting in a continuous function of η as a function of reduced frequency the corrected phase accumulates π each time the wave encounters a resonance i e the wave is scattered by a tree since they are 30 degenerate tree resonances at the reduced frequency of 0 327 the total accumulated phase approaches the value of 30 π a similar calculation of the corrected phase η ω was done for each stage of the formation of the clump of 29 trees the initial distribution of randomly distributed individuals is used as a reference for each clump of trees the corrected η for the configuration of individuals is subtracted from the corrected η for each stage of the clump the resulting function is a difference in corrected phase δ η ω for each clump size in fig 5 we clearly see the delineation by the resonant frequency away and below resonance the difference on corrected phases only weakly increases with the number of trees in the clump away and above resonance the difference in corrected phase decreases monotonously as a function of clump size approaching the value of 30 π as we remove individual trees from the forest to form the clump the most remarkable effect resides in the vicinity of the resonant frequency where significant structure in the phase difference can be observed to reveal these effects more clearly fig 6 shows the difference in corrected phase as a function of the number of trees in the clump at four frequencies more specifically we consider the two frequencies 0 3 and 0 323 below resonance and the two frequencies 0 3344 and 0 35 above resonance we note the slow but monotonous increase in phase difference for the lowest frequency above resonance the difference in phase appears to decrease by steps slightly below resonance the phase difference shows highly nonlinear behavior for some ranges of clump size the difference in phase decreases monotonously however these ranges are separated by discontinuities these discontinuities are not multiples of 2π they take on values that are fractions of π they occur between 7 8 9 trees as well as 14 15 18 19 and 22 23 trees in the cluster in fig 7 we report the change in difference in corrected phase between clusters of increasing size as discussed before this difference is effectively the geometric phase to shed more light on the cause of the discontinuities in the difference in corrected phase or the change in geometric phase we focus on the jump occurring for a clump of 19 trees the tree distribution for this clump results from adding trees 14 through 19 to a cluster of 13 trees see fig 2 these trees are located in an octogonal shell 5 a away from the center of the cluster that shell can accommodate up to 8 trees therefore for the clump of 19 trees there are two gaps i e sites not occupied by trees in that shell we analyse the clump of 19 trees by fixing one of the gaps the one that would eventually accommodate tree 20 and rotating the other gap the site that would accommodate tree 21 counter clockwise about the center of the clump this process is illustrated in fig 8 at the reduced frequency of 0 323 the discontinuity in difference of corrected phase remains however the symmetry of the clump affects the value in the difference in corrected phase in table 1 we classify the n c 19 clumps into two classes depending on the value of the difference in corrected phase the difference in corrected phase takes on values of approximately 0 6π for configurations 1 3 4 5 7 and approximately 0 54π for configurations 2 and 6 the two gaps in configurations 1 2 5 and 7 are related by mirror symmetry perpendicular to faces of the octagonal shell hence they belong to the same class the gaps in configurations 2 4 and 6 are related by mirror symmetry passing through vertices of the octagonal shell however the separation distance between the gaps in configuration 4 exceeds the cut off distance for the green s function of 5 a configurations 2 and 6 have gaps separated by a distance shorter or equal to the cut off distance these two configurations belong to the same class these observations indicate that while the relation between phase difference and tree distribution may be quite complex the difference in corrected phase and or the corresponding geometric phase is not only a signature of the number of trees in a clump but also of the symmetry characteristics of a specific clump 4 conclusions understanding how environmental conditions shape vegetation distributions is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to global change here we have introduced an acoustic based sensing method that may provide unique signatures of tree spatial patterning in forests this method relies on the scattering of long wavelength ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves by trees using an elastic model of a ground covered by trees we demonstrate numerically that the phase of ground supported acoustic waves resulting from scattering by trees can provide information about their spatial distribution we show that the scattered phase or equivalently the geometric phase of acoustic waves may provide a highly sensitive measure of the global properties of the tree spatial patterns for instance the scattered phase can be used to quantify the global change in the distribution of trees from randomly spread individual trees to a forest composed of tree clumps and gaps it can provide crucial but lacking rapid assessment further it can also be used as a quantitative measure of tree density and abundance in addition in the case of a forest composed of clumps we have shown that the geometric phase is significantly affected by the symmetry of tree clumps the model presented here was limited to trees with identical geometrical height and elastic properties trees of varying height would result in the appearance of resonant frequencies associated with each height if these frequencies are sufficiently far apart from each other they will not affect the change in geometric phase associated with one another we expect that the resonant frequency may be chosen to distinguish spatial patterns in the distribution of trees of different size age or species this is specifically the case when using advanced methods of data mining and machine learning that can extract signals from noisy data additionally the model lacks the variation in mechanical properties of the ground that would arise from differing mineral water and biomass content variations in ground composition and varying tree heights is the subject of future work even though the example presented here focused on a single scale we also expect the detection of spatial patterns at different scales to be possible through the topological acoustic sensing approach from a practical point of view when probing real landscapes two approaches may be used for the implementation of a topological acoustic sensing experiment used to monitor the changes of a forest overtime the first approach is active and relies on the conventional direct pulse echo method it requires the use of a source of ground supported waves a single seismic detector can then be used to relate changes of the geometric phase of the emitted seismic wave to changes in the structure of the above ground environment a second passive approach relies on retrieving the green s function of the ground forest scattering medium from cross correlations of the acoustic fields received by two passive seismic sensors derode et al 2003 sanchez sesma and campillo 2006 campillo 2006 the green s function between two sensors and more specifically its phase is reconstructed by averaging the cross correlation of waves produced by ambient seismic noise the topological acoustic sensing method we introduced here may be able to serve as a new modality for detecting variations in spatial patterns of trees in forest subjected to global changes over time by adding a new dimension and metrics of topological sound this new and innovative tool may be useful in meeting the needs for inventorying and assessing the state and evolution of remote and vast forestry landscapes as well as generating the data necessary for modeling and developing forest management strategies in a cost effective fashion

24907,remote sensing of forest environments through sound holds promise for a renewed and extended effort in monitoring vegetation distribution and associated characteristics here we introduce a new acoustic sensing approach that exploits the geometric phase of ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves resulting from their scattering by trees in forest environments using a simulated model forest with different spatial arrangements of trees as a testbed we numerically calculate the geometric phase of acoustic waves and show that it is exquisitely sensitive to the spatial pattern of trees this topological acoustic sensing modality provides a novel quantitative insightful way to characterize global properties of tree spatial distribution which is fundamental to forest management sound has virtually never been used to support quantitative forest monitoring and here we elaborate on the wider implications and applications of topological acoustic sensing in remote landscapes as a very promising concept keywords acoustic seismic waves sensing geometric phase landscape density 1 introduction in natural forests trees are not uniformly distributed but instead form spatially heterogeneous patterns and distinct clusters shaped by endogeneous and exogeneous processes such as fires larson and churchill 2012 or resource distribution larson and churchill 2012 for instance describe tree spatial patterning in terms of clumps individuals and openings a clump is a group of trees of similar size clustered together individuals are well separated trees forming random patterns and openings are gaps in the forest that are not occupied by trees the spatial distribution of trees in forests influences many metrics as well as dynamic processes such as timber volume future fires nutrient distributions and forest regeneration given the importance of spatial distribution there is a need for quantitative descriptions for classifying distributions of ecological elements greig smith 1952 1983 while forests are not well monitored specifically for inaccessible locations detection of tree spatial patterns in real world landscapes is an important component of forest monitoring needed to inform forecasts and scenarios for sustainable forest management carrer et al 2018 natural and human activities combine to produce sound that propagate through forests mullet et al 2016 sound can reveal dimensions and structures of landscapes that are otherwise easily overlooked and not accessible measured or considered in conventional studies sharma 2018 sahin and ince 2009 turner et al 2018 acoustic sensing and soundscape analysis yield novel insights with promising applications acoustic sensing provides indicators of forest structural changes which inform about the intensity direction and modalities of these changes acoustic sounding systems can provide data about forest environmental change and measures of the intensity of human activities and their impact sharma 2018 turner et al 2018 acoustic sensing can also be used to detect early warnings of forest fires sahin and ince 2009 conventionally soundscape data have been analyzed in the frequency domain using the power spectral density as a central concept turner et al 2018 such analyses however do not provide direct information on the nature and dynamics of heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of trees in recent years though topological acoustics has become a powerful approach to describe sound waves that now includes geometrical attributes as an additional source of information for the analysis and applications of sound waves deymier and runge 2017 zhang et al 2018 topological acoustics exploits the complete range of acoustic wave properties to extend beyond the traditional canonical attributes of sound wave frequency ω and wave vector k and now embrace the geometric domains of amplitude a and phase η topological acoustics exploits the geometrical characteristics of sound amplitude and phase imparted by the symmetry breaking that results when an environment such as a forest scatters an acoustic wave as a result the geometrical phase of the sound is a sensitive measure of sound environment interactions the power of topological acoustic sensing resides in this geometric phase being a global metric of the sound scattering environment thus topological acoustics paves the way for novel analytical strategies that extend acoustic sensing and provide a more complete sound based characterization of forest structure this sound based method would allow for continuous regular monitoring over long periods of time and may help address issues of transferability associated with expensive traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellite imaging díaz delgado et al 2017 additionally due to its topological nature this method may aid in developing grid based atlases of vegetal density for a variety of grid sizes franklin 2010 long wavelength ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves stein and wysession 2009 are pertinent probes for applications of topological acoustic to sensing forest environments this has been shown recently by the strong interaction that occurs between seismic waves of a few tens of hz and trees from a forest colombi et al 2016 maurel et al 2018 here we investigate whether and how ground supported long wavelength acoustic waves such as seismic waves that can propagate over great distances at the interface between ground and above ground forest cover provide us with information about the tree spatial pattern based on our previous work deymier and runge 2017 we introduce a new approach for acoustic sensing that utilizes the geometric phase of scattered ground supported acoustic waves as a highly sensitive measure of the global properties of forest spatial patterns thus providing a useful tool for for instance forest inventories on a landscape scale in the following section we introduce a numerical model that can be used to calculate the geometric phase of acoustic waves resulting from the scattering of ground supported waves by a model forest with different spatial tree distributions the numerical model is based on the green s function formalism of acoustic waves and implemented utilizing the matlab computing environment in section 3 we consider a gradient of model forest structure from a random spatial distribution of individual trees to a single clump of trees the geometric phase of ground supported acoustic waves is shown to be very sensitive to the spatial distribution of the trees demonstrating that topological acoustic sensing can provide a global sensing modality of forest spatial patterns conclusions from these results are drawn in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 method conventional acoustic sensing provides spatial temporal and spectral data on an environment s sound field phase information and more specifically the geometric phase η has traditionally remained outside of conventional sensing methodology instead here we introduce a new approach for acoustic sensing that actually utilizes the geometric phase of scattered acoustic waves as a measure of the global properties of the scattering environment we establish the important relation between an acoustic wave s η and its green s function deymier and runge 2017 see appendix a the acoustic green s function represents the acoustic field supported by some environment resulting from a tap like mechanical stimulus applied at some location within this environment for a given environment the green s function depends on 1 a position variable describing the field 2 a position variable describing the location of the stimulus and 3 the eigenvalue which is effectively the square of the frequency of the acoustic wave e ω 2 the green s function is a complex function we first consider a normalized green s function g ˆ g g g where g is the complex conjugate of g we have g ˆ e e i η e we calculate the derivative of this normalized function with respect to the eigenvalue e 1 d g ˆ e d e 1 g g d g d e g 2 g g 3 2 d g g d e from this derivative we can obtain the berry connection bc berry 1984 in the space of eigenvalues bc is defined as the following quantity 2 b c e i t r g ˆ e d g ˆ e d e where tr is the trace over the spatial domain spanned by the green s function tr sums the quantity in parenthesis of eq 2 over the entire spatial domain the berry connection relates to a change in the η of the acoustic wave field as a whole a global measure of the environment supporting the acoustic field the function b c e can then be understood to describe the variation of the η of the green s function along a path in the space of eigenvalues i e on the space of frequencies using well established green s functions identities related to the properties of the green s function in the space of its eigenvalues see appendix a for details it is possible to show that 3 b c e d η e d e i m t r g eq 3 relates η to a scattering problem i e the scattering of acoustic waves by the environment the η as a function of frequency is an experimentally measurable quantity which is the phase accumulated by an acoustic wave due to scattering by the environment topographical and structural features of the scattering environment such as the spatial distribution of trees in a forest are reflected in the green s function the value of the geometric phase is not sensitive to details or local features of the tree arrangement but is a more global measure we can utilize the geometric phase to classify the environment in terms of global characteristics relative for example to the spatial distribution of constitutive elements such as trees this approach is introduced in more details below 2 2 model we develop an elastic model of a forest including ground and tree cover that can be used to calculate numerically the acoustic green s function for given tree distributions and the corresponding phase η the method is detailed in appendix b this model forest is used to numerically investigate the correlation between tree distribution and η we model the forest landscape as a semi infinite elastic medium ground supporting trees distributed in various patterns in essence each ground anchored tree acts as an elastic resonator here four resonances which scatters ground propagating acoustic waves for this each tree is discretized into a one dimensional 1d linear chain of four masses connected by elastic springs fig 1 a the spacing between masses is denoted by a all trees have the same height and constitution i e the same characteristic vibrational resonances the ground is discretized into a three dimensional simple cubic lattice of masses connected via elastic springs fig 1 a the discrete cubic lattice is cleaved along the 001 plane i e a plane perpendicular to the vertical axis to create the surface of the ground the masses in the cubic lattice are all identical and connected via harmonic springs along the edges of the cubic lattice the spacing of masses in the cubic lattice is also equal to a the trees are elastically anchored to the surface of the semi infinite lattice through another elastic spring for the sake of mathematical and numerical ease we assume that the masses and spring stiffnesses of the trees and tree anchor are identical to those of the ground there is therefore no irregular spatial variability in the ground density or composition for the sake of tractability the dynamic equations of the elastic system composed of discrete trees distributed on the discrete elastic ground are limited to displacements of masses in one single direction the direction of the displacement is unspecified and could be representing either transverse shear or longitudinal pressure polarization of the sound wave the interface response theory irt dobrzynski 1988 1987 enables us to calculate the elastic green s function more specifically the diffusion matrix of the composite elastic medium composed of trees anchored on the ground surface the diffusion matrix is then used to calculate the phase of the scattered wave as a function of the frequency the method of calculation of the green s function diffusion matrix and the phase η is detailed in appendix b and in deymier and runge 2018 once the spectral dependency of the geometric phase η ω is determined for a given environment we aim at evaluating how the phase varies as the spatial structure of the environment changes for instance let us focus on a forest system composed of n c mass spring chain like trees with a spatial distribution described by the 2 n c dimensional vector m on the discrete cleaved surface of the cubic lattice i e ground this vector contains the 2d coordinates of every tree this vector spans the subspace r of m the space of the possible locations of tree anchors for the system defined in the appendix b as see eq b13 r p 1 0 0 0 p 2 x 1 x 2 0 p 3 x 1 x 2 0 p n c x 1 n c 1 x 2 n c 1 0 where p i x 1 i x 2 i 0 defines a 2d position on the 001 surface of the cubic lattice the x i i are integer multiples of the grid spacing of the cubic lattice a following appendix b the phase difference normalized to π between acoustic waves supported by the coupled system trees elastically anchored to the ground and by the uncoupled system trees not anchored is then obtained from the relation η r ε m ω 1 π i m l n d e t δ m m where δ m m is the diffusion matrix the diffusion matrix relates the green s function of the coupled system g m m to that of the uncoupled system g m m via g m m δ m m g m m in the space m it is then clear that since ln d e t δ m m ln d e t g m m ln d e t g m m η r ε m ω stands for the phase difference between the coupled and uncoupled system we can now consider two possible spatial patterns of trees namely r and r the quantity δ η η r ω η r ω represents the difference between the geometric phase of pattern r and r the phase associated with the uncoupled system is independent of the spatial arrangement of the uncoupled mass spring chains and therefore cancels out in the expression of δ η one can consequently calculate the change in geometric phase along chosen paths in the space of all tree spatial patterns here we consider a path that takes the forest landscape from a random but uniform distribution of trees fig 1 b to a clustered spatial distribution of trees fig 1 c the forest spatial pattern evolves from individuals to a single clump we fix the total number of trees to n c 30 located on a 20a 20a area of the ground surface a tree was randomly selected from the starting pattern of individual trees as the center of the clump trees are subsequently removed randomly from elsewhere in the model among the remaining individuals forming gaps the selected trees are added to the clump to maintain the total number of trees constant to limit the space of possible configurations of trees in a clump trees were added in an anticlockwise manner beginning from the top of the central tree the final cluster contains 29 trees therefore there are 29 steps in the development of the clump this process is illustrated in fig 2 3 results in fig 3 we report the calculated variation in density of states δ n ω of the randomly distributed pattern of individual trees as a function of reduced frequency the frequency is reduced by the dimensional multiplicative factor β m where β is the stiffness of the springs and m is the mass of the elements in our discrete ground forest model the reduced frequency spans the interval 0 2 this figure shows the four resonances associated with the four mass spring model of the trees since the trees are separated by distances which prevent them from interacting through the elastic ground the resonance frequencies are degenerate we calculate the phase η numerically as a function of reduced frequency between 0 2 and 0 4 about the first resonance of the trees since the phase can only be determined to within multiple of 2π the plot of η versus frequency of fig 4 has been corrected for these inconsequential 2π jumps the numerically calculated values of η were parsed through and multiples of 2π were added manually resulting in a continuous function of η as a function of reduced frequency the corrected phase accumulates π each time the wave encounters a resonance i e the wave is scattered by a tree since they are 30 degenerate tree resonances at the reduced frequency of 0 327 the total accumulated phase approaches the value of 30 π a similar calculation of the corrected phase η ω was done for each stage of the formation of the clump of 29 trees the initial distribution of randomly distributed individuals is used as a reference for each clump of trees the corrected η for the configuration of individuals is subtracted from the corrected η for each stage of the clump the resulting function is a difference in corrected phase δ η ω for each clump size in fig 5 we clearly see the delineation by the resonant frequency away and below resonance the difference on corrected phases only weakly increases with the number of trees in the clump away and above resonance the difference in corrected phase decreases monotonously as a function of clump size approaching the value of 30 π as we remove individual trees from the forest to form the clump the most remarkable effect resides in the vicinity of the resonant frequency where significant structure in the phase difference can be observed to reveal these effects more clearly fig 6 shows the difference in corrected phase as a function of the number of trees in the clump at four frequencies more specifically we consider the two frequencies 0 3 and 0 323 below resonance and the two frequencies 0 3344 and 0 35 above resonance we note the slow but monotonous increase in phase difference for the lowest frequency above resonance the difference in phase appears to decrease by steps slightly below resonance the phase difference shows highly nonlinear behavior for some ranges of clump size the difference in phase decreases monotonously however these ranges are separated by discontinuities these discontinuities are not multiples of 2π they take on values that are fractions of π they occur between 7 8 9 trees as well as 14 15 18 19 and 22 23 trees in the cluster in fig 7 we report the change in difference in corrected phase between clusters of increasing size as discussed before this difference is effectively the geometric phase to shed more light on the cause of the discontinuities in the difference in corrected phase or the change in geometric phase we focus on the jump occurring for a clump of 19 trees the tree distribution for this clump results from adding trees 14 through 19 to a cluster of 13 trees see fig 2 these trees are located in an octogonal shell 5 a away from the center of the cluster that shell can accommodate up to 8 trees therefore for the clump of 19 trees there are two gaps i e sites not occupied by trees in that shell we analyse the clump of 19 trees by fixing one of the gaps the one that would eventually accommodate tree 20 and rotating the other gap the site that would accommodate tree 21 counter clockwise about the center of the clump this process is illustrated in fig 8 at the reduced frequency of 0 323 the discontinuity in difference of corrected phase remains however the symmetry of the clump affects the value in the difference in corrected phase in table 1 we classify the n c 19 clumps into two classes depending on the value of the difference in corrected phase the difference in corrected phase takes on values of approximately 0 6π for configurations 1 3 4 5 7 and approximately 0 54π for configurations 2 and 6 the two gaps in configurations 1 2 5 and 7 are related by mirror symmetry perpendicular to faces of the octagonal shell hence they belong to the same class the gaps in configurations 2 4 and 6 are related by mirror symmetry passing through vertices of the octagonal shell however the separation distance between the gaps in configuration 4 exceeds the cut off distance for the green s function of 5 a configurations 2 and 6 have gaps separated by a distance shorter or equal to the cut off distance these two configurations belong to the same class these observations indicate that while the relation between phase difference and tree distribution may be quite complex the difference in corrected phase and or the corresponding geometric phase is not only a signature of the number of trees in a clump but also of the symmetry characteristics of a specific clump 4 conclusions understanding how environmental conditions shape vegetation distributions is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to global change here we have introduced an acoustic based sensing method that may provide unique signatures of tree spatial patterning in forests this method relies on the scattering of long wavelength ground supported acoustic waves such as seismic waves by trees using an elastic model of a ground covered by trees we demonstrate numerically that the phase of ground supported acoustic waves resulting from scattering by trees can provide information about their spatial distribution we show that the scattered phase or equivalently the geometric phase of acoustic waves may provide a highly sensitive measure of the global properties of the tree spatial patterns for instance the scattered phase can be used to quantify the global change in the distribution of trees from randomly spread individual trees to a forest composed of tree clumps and gaps it can provide crucial but lacking rapid assessment further it can also be used as a quantitative measure of tree density and abundance in addition in the case of a forest composed of clumps we have shown that the geometric phase is significantly affected by the symmetry of tree clumps the model presented here was limited to trees with identical geometrical height and elastic properties trees of varying height would result in the appearance of resonant frequencies associated with each height if these frequencies are sufficiently far apart from each other they will not affect the change in geometric phase associated with one another we expect that the resonant frequency may be chosen to distinguish spatial patterns in the distribution of trees of different size age or species this is specifically the case when using advanced methods of data mining and machine learning that can extract signals from noisy data additionally the model lacks the variation in mechanical properties of the ground that would arise from differing mineral water and biomass content variations in ground composition and varying tree heights is the subject of future work even though the example presented here focused on a single scale we also expect the detection of spatial patterns at different scales to be possible through the topological acoustic sensing approach from a practical point of view when probing real landscapes two approaches may be used for the implementation of a topological acoustic sensing experiment used to monitor the changes of a forest overtime the first approach is active and relies on the conventional direct pulse echo method it requires the use of a source of ground supported waves a single seismic detector can then be used to relate changes of the geometric phase of the emitted seismic wave to changes in the structure of the above ground environment a second passive approach relies on retrieving the green s function of the ground forest scattering medium from cross correlations of the acoustic fields received by two passive seismic sensors derode et al 2003 sanchez sesma and campillo 2006 campillo 2006 the green s function between two sensors and more specifically its phase is reconstructed by averaging the cross correlation of waves produced by ambient seismic noise the topological acoustic sensing method we introduced here may be able to serve as a new modality for detecting variations in spatial patterns of trees in forest subjected to global changes over time by adding a new dimension and metrics of topological sound this new and innovative tool may be useful in meeting the needs for inventorying and assessing the state and evolution of remote and vast forestry landscapes as well as generating the data necessary for modeling and developing forest management strategies in a cost effective fashion

24908,for decades nuisance algal growth has wreaked havoc in systems across the world it has been particularly problematic in the laurentian great lakes although managing nutrient loads has resulted in some mitigation ecosystem perturbations in the last two decades have resulted in favorable conditions for a cladophora resurgence this paper reports on improvements to the great lakes cladophora model which has been used to inform management of great lakes nuisance algal growth since it was first developed over 30 years ago auer et al 1982 auer and canale 1982 canale and auer 1982a b like earlier versions this recent configuration of the model glcm v3 simulates algal biomass density g dry mass m 2 and stored or cellular phosphorus content p as dry mass over the spring summer and fall growth cycle two major advances over previous versions of the model are presented a an improved characterization of the light and temperature response surfaces driving gross growth and respiration and b the development and implementation of a segmented system canopy approach for simulating the impact of self shading carrying capacity on growth prior versions of the glcm treated the algal mat as a lumped system utilizing the logistic model to simulate the carrying capacity effect in that approach a carrying capacity coefficient xmax maximum biomass density placed a ceiling on biomass accrual however that approach was not mechanistic i e physiologically supported and empirical specification of the coefficient is undermined by significant intra and inter site variability this uncertainty places too much emphasis on xmax as a tuning parameter the signal contribution of this work to the development of the glcm v3 is the replacement of the lumped system approach with a vertically segmented mechanistic treatment of self shading the canopy effect here biomass accrual is mechanistically governed by light attenuation through the canopy as quantified by kalg the vertical extinction coefficient for light passing through the mat this coefficient may be determined by direct in situ measurement and offers much less freedom for use as a tuning parameter the advances in cladophora growth modeling provided here and embodied in the glcm v3 offer a more mechanistic and robust tool than previous versions strengthening its credibility for the management of nuisance algal growth such as that mandated by the great lakes water quality agreement of 2012 further the vertical determination of net growth provides a more mechanistic basis for future modeling of other key processes such as sloughing detachment in both the great lakes and other natural waterbodies keywords algae canopy effect self shading light mechanistic modeling water quality 1 introduction the filamentous green alga cladophora glomerata grows attached to solid substrate throughout the littoral zone in the lower four laurentian great lakes michigan huron erie and ontario native to these waters growth of the alga reaches nuisance levels fig 1 in response to the phosphorus p enrichment associated with urban development and intensification of agricultural practices cladophora has been a subject of concern since the mid 1950s accumulating on beaches undergoing decay and generating unpleasant odors great lakes research advisory board et al 1975 initially identified in locally enriched areas at the time of peak nutrient enrichment nuisance growth was later reported lakewide with the alga colonizing all suitable substrate great lakes research advisory board et al 1975 the great lakes water quality agreement glwqa as amended in 1978 imposed a ban limits on phosphorus in soaps and detergents and placed regulations on phosphorus discharged from wastewater treatment plants international joint commission ijc 1978 the resulting reduction in p loading led to a decline in phosphorus levels lakewide dove and chapra 2015 and the biomass and stored p content of cladophora painter and kamaitis 1987 kuczynski et al 2016 this increased degree of nutrient limitation resulted in a decline in incidences of nuisance cladophora growth indicating management success however before the effect of p management could be fully understood in the context of cladophora growth the nearshore ecosystem of the great lakes was altered by the introduction of invasive zebra and quagga mussels dreissenids hebert et al 1991 through discharges of ballast water carried by ships sailing from europe mussels are filter feeders increasing light penetration by removing particles from the water column and enhancing p cycling hecky et al 2004 by converting particulate phosphorus pp present as terrigenous solids and phytoplankton to soluble reactive phosphorus srp orthophosphate the form of phosphorus fully and freely available to support algal growth correll 1999 reynolds 2006 although p management had successfully reduced the stored p content of cladophora kuczynski et al 2016 a resurgence in nuisance algal growth accompanied the mussel invasion with greater transparency sunlight now penetrated more deeply into the water column increasing the maximum colonizable depth of cladophora by a factor of five and ultimately resulting in a six fold increase in cladophora production potential kuczynski et al 2016 the great lakes cladophora model glcm v1 developed by canale and auer 1982a represented the first effort to make available a mechanistic tool focusing on nuisance growth of the alga the model consists of mass balances for srp and cladophora stored p and biomass and simulates algal growth as a function of phosphorus loading mass transport and the mediating effects of light and temperature the model was calibrated and confirmed for a site on lake huron impacted by a point source of phosphorus and applied in testing phosphorus management strategies canale and auer 1982b canale et al 1983 tomlinson et al 2010 updated the model s biokinetics e g p uptake and light and temperature as driving forces for growth in developing the glcm v2 this second version of the glcm was validated for the lake huron dataset of canale and auer 1982a and a new data set collected in 2006 on lake michigan renewed attention to the need for an updated standardized mechanistic growth model supporting phosphorus management has accompanied the post dreissenid cladophora resurgence bootsma et al 2015 2 objectives and approach both previous versions of the glcm v1 and v2 employ the logistic model to simulate carrying capacity limitation of algal growth while the use of the logistic growth model has a long tradition and is mathematically straightforward it is not sufficiently grounded in biophysical mechanisms our primary objective is to replace the overly prescriptive logistic carrying capacity term used in the glcm v1 and v2 with a conceptually sound mechanistic self shading algorithm simulating light attenuation through the cladophora mat and associated reduction in the growth rate because self shading serves to define the boundary or threshold between positive and negative net photosynthesis we re examined the performance of the light and temperature mediation functions for gross growth and light enhanced respiration defining this threshold in the glcm v1 and v2 our goal for this secondary yet crucial objective was to re fit the original experimental results of graham et al 1982 to develop more accurate mathematical representations of the light and temperature mediation functions especially at the low light threshold of the canopy environment to redefine those functions we applied the relationship of platt et al 1980 to establish light dependent functions for gross growth and light enhanced respiration at discrete temperatures next we identified relationships for the coefficients embedded within the platt equation with respect to temperature the result was new 3d response surfaces for mediation of gross growth and light enhanced respiration by light and temperature finally to meet our primary objective we replaced the logistic model algorithm with a segmented system framework here light is attenuated and net growth is calculated through the algal mat at 1 cm intervals in an iterative fashion for each time step of the simulation to yield a more realistic time series of biomass accumulation 3 modeling methods 3 1 modeling self shading the fundamental basis for modeling population size p is the exponential model presented in a generalized fashion as 1 d p d t k p where the rate of growth is proportional to population size as determined by a constant k the specific growth rate coefficient in the exponential model the value of k does not change as p increases and unlimited growth is predicted this approach is well recognized as being unrealistic as resources including space are limited in nature and may support only a finite population the logistic growth model accommodates the potential for negative feedback as population size increases by introducing a carrying capacity term again presented in a generalized fashion as 2 d p d t k 1 p p m a x p where pmax is the maximum achievable population size here the population growth rate does not remain constant but is attenuated as the population size increases in its application to attached algae the feedback function of eq 2 serves to represent the self shading phenomenon with the realized growth rate asymptotically approaching zero as p approaches p m a x the canopy may be defined as the aboveground or above bottom portion of a plant community we use the term canopy synonymously with bed mat and stand descriptive terms widely used in attached algae modeling in cladophora the canopy extends from a basal holdfast attached to solid substrate upward to the tips of the filaments suspended in the water column fig 2 light is attenuated with passage through the water column and through the canopy becoming less available if available at all to support photosynthesis deeper in the stand this canopy effect is well described for forests givnish 1988 and has been studied in periphyton hill and boston 1991 dodds et al 1999 and macroalgae and macrophytes in freshwater and marine environments binzer et al 2006 it has been noted that determination of biomass and photosynthetic characteristics of phytoelements plant parts are insufficient to describe community production where three dimensional bed structure and distribution of light in the canopy also contribute to mediation of growth binzer et al 2006 self shading has been described in cladophora where light attenuation through the canopy impacts the balance of photosynthesis and respiration potentially compromising the condition of algal cells near the canopy bottom and leading to senescence and detachment sloughing higgins et al 2008 in previous versions of the glcm the self shading phenomenon was implicitly modeled using a lumped system approach where the algal mat is considered as one homogeneous layer in our work we develop a segmented canopy approach and redefine experimentally derived light temperature response surfaces driving photosynthesis and respiration to more realistically simulate self shading within the algal mat 3 2 growth model framework the great lakes cladophora model v3 calculates the rate of change in biomass density as the net of the gain through gross growth and loss to respiration in a form analogous to that presented for the generalized exponential growth model in eq 1 3 d x d t μ g r o s s r x where x is population size cladophora biomass density in grams dry mass per unit area gdm m 2 t is time d and μ g r o s s and r are the specific rate constants d 1 for gross growth and respiration respectively in applications to algal field populations an additional first order loss term sloughing l is added to eq 3 to account for physical detachment the term is not required in the laboratory based applications considered here the term μ g r o s s r in eq 3 is thus equivalent to a net specific growth rate coefficient μ n e t d 1 the next step is to add functions that accommodate the role of light and temperature f i t nutrients in our case phosphorus f q and carrying capacity f x in mediating the specific rate coefficients in eq 3 4 μ g r o s s μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q f x where μ g r o s s m a x is the maximum specific gross growth rate coefficient d 1 the light and temperature mediation function f μ g r o s s i t is represented as a three dimensional μ g r o s s i t response surface described in detail in section 3 3 the phosphorus mediation function f q is based on the relationship of droop 1968 5 f q 1 q m i n q where q is the stored or cellular p content of the alga gp gdm 1 as and q m i n is the minimum stored p required to sustain cell structure and basal metabolism taken here as 0 04 rounded from 0 035 as used by tomlinson et al 2010 this function yields a rectangular hyperbola where f q approaches 0 as q approaches q m i n and f q approaches 1 when q q m i n the carrying capacity term f x introduced in generalized form in eq 2 and applied in the development of glcm v1 and v2 is given by 6 f x 1 x x m a x where x m a x gdm m 2 is the maximum achievable biomass density the carrying capacity term is eliminated in glcm v3 consistent with our objective to follow a conceptually sound mechanistic self shading approach as the means of regulating the negative feedback of population growth described in section 3 4 this leaves eq 4 as 7 μ g r o s s μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q the approach continues in a similar fashion for respiration which is partitioned into light enhanced r l e d 1 and basal r b d 1 components 8 r r l e r b with 9 r l e r l e m a x f r l e i t f q where r l e m a x is the maximum specific light enhanced respiration rate coefficient d 1 and f r l e i t and f q are as for μ g r o s s and described in more detail in sections 3 3 and 3 4 basal respiration r b d 1 is independent of light 10 r b r b 20 f r b t where r b 20 is the basal respiration rate coefficient at 20 c d 1 and f r b t is the temperature mediation function for r b as described in more detail in section 3 3 the net rate of change in biomass density is thus given by 11 d x d t μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q r l e m a x f r l e i t f q r b 20 f r b t x 3 3 parameterizing coefficients and algorithms for light and temperature mediation values for the user defined coefficients μ g r o s s m a x r l e m a x r b 20 and q m i n are selected from the literature based on field and laboratory measurements and or model calibration the dimensionless functions mediating growth f μ g r o s s i t f r l e i t and f r b t are characterized by fitting algorithms to laboratory measurements of gross photosynthesis and total basal plus light enhanced respiration made by graham et al 1982 on a lake huron isolate of cladophora over an i t matrix of 10 1235 μe m 2 s 1 and 1 35 c we separate basal and light enhanced respiration in the graham et al 1982 data set by adopting the light threshold for cladophora growth 27 μe m 2 s 1 proposed by lorenz et al 1991 as the intensity below which light enhanced respiration is negligible r l e approaches 0 and basal respiration becomes the dominant process thus respiration rates measured by graham et al 1982 at 10 and 25 μe m 2 s 1 are taken as representing basal respiration and subtracted from measured total respiration to obtain values for light enhanced respiration the rate of light enhanced respiration depends on light and temperature while basal respiration only depends on temperature i e occurring both in the light and in the dark measured rates of gross photosynthesis and light enhanced and basal respiration go2 m 3 d 1 were converted to specific rates of gross growth and respiration d 1 using an assumed photosynthetic quotient of 1 i e 12 gc mol per 32 go2 mol and the mean carbon content for cladophora 37 5 mgc 100 mg dm auer and canale 1982 for the glcm v1 and v2 polynomial functions were fit to each of the full i t matrices for measured specific rates of gross growth and light enhanced respiration to generate three dimensional response surfaces tomlinson et al 2010 fit new polynomials to the data of graham et al 1982 eliminating mid curve minima apparent in otherwise continuous functions we found that these fits performed for full i t matrices do not serve well near the edges or boundaries of the light and temperature domains thus in developing the glcm v3 we constructed new three dimensional functions for the rates of gross specific growth and specific light enhanced respiration over the range of light intensities 6 8 values 0 1200 μe m 2 s 1 and for the discrete temperatures 8 values 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c used by graham et al 1982 we fitted 8 individual equations one for each discrete temperature slice for rates of gross growth and light enhanced respiration we then interpolated between slices across the temperature gradient to develop bivariate i e depending on light and temperature equations describing growth and respiration response surfaces and normalized those functions given temperature and light inputs the equations return dimensionless values ranging from 0 to 1 for the i t mediating functions for the gross specific growth rate f μ g r o s s i t and the light enhanced respiration rate f r l e i t the temperature mediation function for the basal respiration rate f r b t was defined using a simplified version of the arrhenius equation see section 3 5 2 two coefficients were developed by fitting this equation to the respiration rates measured by graham et al 1982 at 10 and 25 μe m 2 s 1 representing basal respiration 3 4 modeling the canopy effect the canopy model is implemented by solving eq 11 first specifying an initial condition for cladophora biomass x and then dividing that value by a constant layer specific areal biomass density x l a y e r 9 gdm m 2 cm 1 derived from unpublished data by s malkin to determine the number of 1 cm layers comprising the algal canopy height at the start of the growing season any fraction of the specified initial condition remaining is added to a layer at the top of the canopy environmental forcing conditions temperature incident light and the stored p content of the alga are specified as daily and hourly light time series the light environment is mediated by attenuation through the water column and attenuation through the canopy itself i e self shading as depicted in fig 2 light at the canopy bottom or any position within the canopy can be calculated from the incident light at the water surface the light attenuation coefficient through the water column above the canopy and the light attenuation coefficient through the canopy higgins 2005 higgins et al 2006 mathematically this is expressed as 12 i z m a t i 0 e k e z e k a l g z m a t where i z m a t photosynthetically active radiation at a position z within the algal mat μe m 2 s 1 i 0 photosynthetically active radiation at the water surface μe m

algal mat thickness m water column light attenuation coefficients k e are regularly determined in lake and river environments but such measurements through the algal canopy k a l g are less common and vary considerably higgins 2005 malkin personal communication higgins 2005 used a power fit to describe k a l g as a function of biomass density k a l g 7 84 x 0 24 yielding a range of 9 34 m 1 and averaging 21 4 5 9 standard deviation m 1 for areal biomass densities of 13 119 gdm m 2 malkin 2007 proposed a constant mean value of k a l g 24 1 3 3 standard deviation m 1 i e the coefficient does not vary with biomass density these observations correspond with those reported by higgins et al 2006 k a l g 20 30 m 1 when x 50 gdm m 2 flynn 2014 measured k a l g values for river cladophora ranging from 4 3 150 7 m 1 and averaging 47 34 standard deviation m 1 at various biomass densities and shear velocities dodds et al 1999 measured k a l g ranging from 71 1791 m 1 in various new zealand stream periphyton assemblages it must be noted that while many processes such as nutrient uptake can be assumed to be the same in rivers and lakes self shading in riverine cladophora is manifested differently than in lacustrine cladophora conceptually filaments are longer and pushed tightly together for a mat lying flat in the downstream direction in fast flowing rivers whereas lacustrine filaments can stand upright and be moved about gently by lake currents and wave induced turbulence recognizing this fact we use k a l g 21 4 5 9 for cladophora in the great lakes consistent with the mean standard deviation values of higgins 2005 and on the order of values measured by malkin 2007 we first test the canopy effect in the glcm v3 using forcing conditions for temperature and incident light specified as daily time series this initial testing is designed to focus on the mediating effect of fμ gross i t on canopy modeling thus the roles of nutrient limitation and sloughing are not included f q 1 l 0 these processes are restored in our final simulation where the canopy model is examined for its ability to track field observations of biomass density over the season the calculation is made as a family of nested loops first calculating biomass accrual in each layer for each hour and then summing over the canopy to provide an initial condition for the next hourly step the process is repeated for 24 h and summed to yield a daily time series of cladophora biomass for the entire simulation period more specifically the model builds the algal canopy layer by layer filling each 1 cm layer with a constant biomass xlayer 9 gdm m 2 cm 1 the remaining biomass equaling xtot number of layers xlayer is captured separately in the topmost canopy layer for each layer the light intensity is calculated by attenuating the light at the canopy surface down to the depth of the layer within the canopy eq 12 with the layer number substituted for zmat which also equals the mat thickness in cm divided by 100 in order to be expressed in meters and then the growth attenuation factors f q f μ g r o s s i t f r l e i t and f r b t are calculated and used to determine the incremental growth of each biomass layer for each time step the cumulative change in biomass is the sum of the change in biomass in each layer and a new total biomass is calculated at the end of each time step this new total biomass becomes the starting point for the next time step which redistributes the total biomass over the whole canopy and thus calculates a new canopy height similarly where stored phosphorus mediation of growth is included changes in stored phosphorus are calculated for each biomass layer for each time step 3 5 fitting light and temperature mediation functions 3 5 1

and late summer period when senescence and attendant sloughing occur malkin et al 2010 higgins et al 2008 and the negative net growth expected for the well shaded portions of the canopy 4 results the primary objective of this work was to model the self shading carrying capacity phenomenon in cladophora by moving from a lumped system to a segmented canopy approach given that the light and temperature response surfaces of the glcm v1 and v2 were inadequately defined for simulations at low light intensities the secondary objective of this work was to develop new light and temperature growth and respiration mediation functions for the glcm v3 in the cladophora growth model cgm higgins 2005b simultaneously used both the logistic growth model based carrying capacity term xmax eqs 2 and 6 and light attenuation through the canopy using both approaches at the same time over parameterizes negative feedback via self shading in the glcm v3 the overly deterministic logistic growth term

yields the highest gross growth rates in the 13 20 c and 200 μe m 2 s 1 regions while the lowest rates occur at low light intensities at very low 2 c and high 30 c temperatures and at high light intensities combined with high temperatures top right region of the top right panel in fig 9 the newly fitted light enhanced respiration mediation function f r l e i t yields the highest rates at high 30 c temperatures the glcm v1 and v2 surfaces show increasing respiration rates with increasing light intensity while the glcm v3 surface is almost insensitive to changes in light above 200 μe m 2 s 1 fig 9 middle row panels the maximum specific gross growth rate μgross and the maximum light enhanced respiration rate rle max are user defined in the model here values of 1 08 d 1 and 0 44 d 1 respectively originally used in the glcm v1 auer and canale 1982 were applied to yield μnet surfaces using the response surfaces employed in each of the three glcm versions fig 9 bottom row panels two major differences emerge in the glcm v3 treatment of cladophora growth the first of these is that the revised light and temperature growth mediation functions fig 9 provide an improved fit of the threshold effect at low light intensities this improvement is critical to simulating the growth rates characteristic of the diminished light environment deep within the algal mat the canopy effect additionally the glcm v3 response surfaces fig 9 move away conceptually from the metabolic imbalance explanation photorespiration glcm v1 and v2 for initiation of sloughing finding conceptual consistency with the cgm higgins et al 2005a 2005b in recognizing that the canopy effect drives detachment we compare model output for the lumped carrying capacity simulated using xmax and the segmented canopy system approaches by using a common set of model inputs coefficients and environmental forcing conditions and excluding sloughing table 2 we apply constant water column and algal mat light attenuation coefficients and eliminate phosphorus mediation by setting f q 1 light conditions were taken as a smoothed function for hourly incident light intensity based on a 5 year data set obtained at muskegon mi daily temperatures were taken as a smoothed function based on an 11 year data set of remotely sensed surface water temperature for lake michigan at milwaukee wi the initial biomass was specified as 10 gdm m 2 and an initial stored phosphorus content as 0 06 in the lumped system application using the logistic growth model simulation set 1 the rate of biomass accrual is initially high x x m a x see slope of dashed lines in fig 10 then becomes attenuated and eventually asymptotically approaches zero the maximum achievable biomass is fixed by a user specified value of x m a x example simulations are shown for x m a x values of 300 400 and 500 gdm m 2 fig 10 dashed lines we see the use of this type of model with a broad range of available x m a x values as being overly deterministic or prescriptive rather than biophysically based the segmented canopy simulation set 2 produced a biomass density curve similar in shape to that resulting from the lumped system approach the range of realized maximum biomass is constrained by the light extinction coefficient through the algal mat kalg which is based on measurements gray shading in fig 10 here the rate of biomass accrual and the realized maximum biomass approximately match those for the lumped system approach with x m a x 400 gdm m 2 but reflect self regulation and the interplay of the alga with its environment rather than the result of a prescribed model coefficient and model tuning all simulations using the lumped system approach show a rapid increase in biomass over time accrual rate while simulations using the segmented system approach show slower biomass accrual it is important to note that the time at which seasonal maximum biomass is achieved is influenced by the applied approach a vertically detailed determination of net specific growth rates μnet in the segmented canopy over the growing season simulation set 3 was performed using the same conditions as before see table 2 but with constant values of light 600 μe m 2 s 1 temperature 15 c and light extinction through the mat 24 1 m 1 simulation results are compared in fig 11 in all cases μnet is positive in layers near the mat surface declines with depth in the canopy and is negative from a distance of 15 cm below the canopy surface for these model forcing conditions the mat depth integrated canopy layer average net growth rate bold font values in fig 11 decreases with increasing canopy thickness due to self shading as the mat depth integrated value of μnet approaches 0 biomass accrual is reduced and the canopy biomass asymptotically approaches its maximum value fig 10 here the canopy model simulates the maximum biomass density in a self regulating mechanistic manner to validate the canopy shading algorithm we applied it to the glcm v2 including time variable q mediation and the previously excluded sloughing process in this simulation set 4 we used observational data rather than idealized smoothed curves for light and temperature conditions and evaluated model performance using biomass measurements made at atwater beach milwaukee wi on lake michigan in 2006 refer to tomlinson et al 2010 for data sources and model coefficients implementation of the revised growth and respiration response surfaces and the canopy shading algorithm with kalg 10 m 1 in the glcm v2 resulted in a good fit when comparing model output with biomass measurements fig 12 a this calibration required a low kalg value when all other model coefficient values as calibrated by tomlinson et al 2010 are retained the canopy height or mat thickness z m a t varies throughout the season and tracks the biomass curve fig 12b the attendant net growth rate at different locations within the canopy fluctuates with natural variability in forcing conditions such as light and temperature during the growth season fig 12c we conclude that the canopy model effectively simulates cladophora biomass accrual over the season while meeting our objective to eliminate the overly deterministic specification of maximum biomass density although results achieved with the canopy shading algorithm are similar to those obtained using the lumped system glcm v2 we note that the success of this model upgrade cannot be assessed simply by comparing an earlier version s output with that of this version because the modeler has the ability to influence the output by simply tuning xmax in the glcm v1 and v2 it must be emphasized that the improvement lies in advancing the conceptual integrity of the model by reducing the degrees of freedom available to the modeler and mechanistically representing ecological processes 5 discussion in their two volume treatise engineering approaches for lake management chapra and reckhow 1983 and reckhow and chapra 1983 recognize two distinctly different approaches to the modelling and management of lakes one empirical data based the other mechanistic process based the treatment of carrying capacity used in the first v1 canale and auer 1982a b and second v2 tomlinson et al 2010 versions of the great lakes cladophora model glcm was partially mechanistic based on the logistic growth model and partially empirical specification of the maximum achievable biomass coefficient xmax there are two fundamental problems with the use of the logistic growth model eqs 2 and 6 to treat the impact of self shading on growth in the glcm v1 and v2 first the calculation treats the canopy as a lumped system i e growth proceeds uniformly over the entire height of the canopy clearly this cannot be the case given the observed attenuation of light with increasing depth through the canopy second a globally constant value for the carrying capacity term x m a x is assumed which is problematic given the broad range of maximum biomass levels observed across the great lakes e g 0 1000 gdm m 2 canale and auer 1982a higgins et al 2005a malkin et al 2008 and tomlinson et al 2010 the first problem uniform growth throughout the canopy a lumped system leads to tuning the maximum specific growth rate coefficient to meet a poorly defined canopy average light condition that changes as canopy height increases the second problem a global x m a x potentially requires the modeler to adjust contributions to net growth maximum rates of growth and respiration beyond accepted coefficient ranges to constrain the rate of biomass increase as applied in the glcm v1 and v2 selection of a value for x m a x has no mechanistic basis and leaves the modeler with a solely empirical means of forcing a fit to a particular model dataset in calibration and confirmation e g top panel of fig 10 interest in modeling cladophora grew following publication of the glcm v1 canale and auer 1982a and efforts were made to address prevailing modeling problems higgins et al 2005b recognized that maximum achievable biomass would vary with the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation par reaching the canopy and developed an empirical relationship between maximum observed biomass and mean daily par at the canopy surface metabolic imbalance was recognized as the cause of sloughing detachment of an algal mat with experimental work by higgins 2005a and malkin 2007 supporting the concept that light attenuation through an algal canopy compromises algal cells at the base of the canopy mat that process was incorporated into the cladophora growth model cgm higgins et al 2005b for application to lake erie providing negative feedback from self shading higgins et al 2006 retained the lumped system approach of the cgm higgins et al 2005b for characterization of the canopy but took a step towards a segmented approach by calculating net specific growth rates offline at the canopy surface and bottom to explore and successfully describe metabolic imbalance as a trigger for sloughing events in a subsequent application of the cgm higgins et al 2005b to lake ontario malkin et al 2008 retained the lumped system approach and chose not to use a par driven x m a x returning to the fixed x m a x treatment of canale and auer 1982a the transition to a fully segmented approach was made by higgins et al 2008 who combined in vitro measurements photosynthesis irradiance curves and numerical experiments offline of the cgm to further examine the significance of a canopy effect on initiation of sloughing a critical algal density i e the maximum algal density allowing sufficient light to maintain positive metabolism to reach the base of the canopy was determined experimentally and described as a function of par reaching the canopy surface these results conclusively demonstrated the potential for self shading to prevent cells at the base of the canopy from maintaining a positive metabolism the findings further provided support for the sloughing trigger algorithm offered by higgins et al 2006 a treatment which has both mechanistic light mediation of metabolic balance at the base of the bed and empirical degree and duration of a negative metabolic balance features in contrast to previous versions the glcm v3 employs a layer by layer canopy shading algorithm without invoking a carrying capacity term while this treatment of self shading is mathematically more complex than using a simple xmax coefficient eqs 2 and 6 this segmented approach is based on mechanistic principles that do not require a location specific often ill defined xmax term this significant advancement in the glcm is based on concepts originally discussed by higgins 2005 and malkin 2007 here a segmented canopy algorithm inhibits cladophora growth in a manner that is mechanistically sound and an improvement over the empirically derived carrying capacity constant xmax the work presented in our manuscript details the canopy algorithm that was developed and incorporated in the glcm v3 the canopy algorithm serves to recognize a local environmental friction i e self shading within the algal mat which brakes μmax to result in the maximum realized biomass global sources of environmental friction mediating μmax are temperature incident light and its attenuation through the water column and nutrient availability in this model algal growth does not cease as biomass approaches an empirically derived user specified value of x m a x instead as growth extends the algal canopy above the bottom net growth continues at the canopy surface but an increasing proportion of the canopy becomes self shaded and lies within a sub optimal light environment where basal respiration predominates eventually as more and more of the canopy experiences near or complete darkness respiration in the lower canopy balances positive net photosynthesis near the canopy surface and net canopy growth ceases a maximum realized biomass is achieved no longer a prescribed constant carrying capacity x m a x the maximum realized biomass varies with local canopy and global features incident light temperature nutrients depth that differ within a site with depth among sites nutrients and vertical light extinction and seasonally for the more commonly observed case in which light and temperature conditions are less than ideal the domain of robust growth is markedly attenuated across the light temperature matrix for μ n e t it is this interplay of i and t together and nutrient availability as f q that forms the foundation for transition from an overly deterministic growth modeling approach the logistic model to the mechanistic canopy based approach where growth is governed by environmental forcing conditions and the inherent response of the alga to those conditions the work of higgins et al 2005b 2006 2008 provides a strong foundation and valuable guidance in addressing the two fundamental problems we have identified in the initial effort to model cladophora growth glcm v1 canale and auer 1982a lumped versus segmented treatment of the canopy and a global value for the self shading coefficient x m a x after developing new light and temperature mediation functions for growth and respiration we fulfilled the main objective of this work to develop a mechanistic model that does not require such a user specified upper limit to cladophora growth x m a x but rather employs a fully organic approach where the natural interplay between environmental forcing conditions light temperature and phosphorus supply and the physiological response of the alga serve to limit the maximum achievable biomass this is accomplished by applying a segmented framework where net growth is calculated at specified intervals over the canopy and the result is then integrated to represent biomass accrual for the entire bed to our knowledge this effort represents the first time that the canopy effect has been fully and explicitly included in a cladophora growth model data availability statement the growth and respiration data for which light and temperature response surfaces were

24908,for decades nuisance algal growth has wreaked havoc in systems across the world it has been particularly problematic in the laurentian great lakes although managing nutrient loads has resulted in some mitigation ecosystem perturbations in the last two decades have resulted in favorable conditions for a cladophora resurgence this paper reports on improvements to the great lakes cladophora model which has been used to inform management of great lakes nuisance algal growth since it was first developed over 30 years ago auer et al 1982 auer and canale 1982 canale and auer 1982a b like earlier versions this recent configuration of the model glcm v3 simulates algal biomass density g dry mass m 2 and stored or cellular phosphorus content p as dry mass over the spring summer and fall growth cycle two major advances over previous versions of the model are presented a an improved characterization of the light and temperature response surfaces driving gross growth and respiration and b the development and implementation of a segmented system canopy approach for simulating the impact of self shading carrying capacity on growth prior versions of the glcm treated the algal mat as a lumped system utilizing the logistic model to simulate the carrying capacity effect in that approach a carrying capacity coefficient xmax maximum biomass density placed a ceiling on biomass accrual however that approach was not mechanistic i e physiologically supported and empirical specification of the coefficient is undermined by significant intra and inter site variability this uncertainty places too much emphasis on xmax as a tuning parameter the signal contribution of this work to the development of the glcm v3 is the replacement of the lumped system approach with a vertically segmented mechanistic treatment of self shading the canopy effect here biomass accrual is mechanistically governed by light attenuation through the canopy as quantified by kalg the vertical extinction coefficient for light passing through the mat this coefficient may be determined by direct in situ measurement and offers much less freedom for use as a tuning parameter the advances in cladophora growth modeling provided here and embodied in the glcm v3 offer a more mechanistic and robust tool than previous versions strengthening its credibility for the management of nuisance algal growth such as that mandated by the great lakes water quality agreement of 2012 further the vertical determination of net growth provides a more mechanistic basis for future modeling of other key processes such as sloughing detachment in both the great lakes and other natural waterbodies keywords algae canopy effect self shading light mechanistic modeling water quality 1 introduction the filamentous green

since the mid 1950s accumulating on beaches undergoing decay and generating unpleasant odors great lakes research advisory board et al 1975 initially identified in locally enriched areas at the time of peak nutrient enrichment nuisance growth was later reported lakewide with the alga colonizing all suitable substrate great lakes research advisory board et al 1975 the great lakes water quality

nuisance algal growth accompanied the mussel invasion with greater transparency sunlight now penetrated more deeply into the water column increasing the maximum colonizable depth of cladophora by a

represented the first effort to make available a mechanistic tool focusing on nuisance growth of the alga the model consists of mass balances for srp and cladophora stored p and biomass and simulates algal growth as a function of phosphorus loading mass transport and the mediating effects of light and temperature the model was calibrated and confirmed for a site on lake huron impacted by a point

temperature as driving forces for growth in developing the glcm v2 this second version of the glcm was validated for the lake huron dataset of canale and auer 1982a and a new data set collected in 2006 on lake michigan renewed attention to the need for an updated standardized mechanistic growth model supporting phosphorus management has accompanied the post dreissenid cladophora resurgence bootsma et al 2015 2 objectives and approach both previous versions of the glcm v1 and v2 employ the logistic model to simulate carrying capacity limitation of algal growth while the use of the logistic growth model has a long tradition and is mathematically straightforward it is not sufficiently grounded in biophysical mechanisms our primary objective is to replace the overly prescriptive logistic carrying capacity term used in the glcm v1 and v2 with a conceptually sound mechanistic self shading algorithm simulating light attenuation through the cladophora mat and associated reduction in the growth rate because self shading serves to define the boundary or threshold between positive and negative net photosynthesis we re examined the performance of the light and temperature mediation functions for gross growth and light enhanced respiration defining this threshold in the glcm v1 and v2 our goal for this secondary yet crucial objective was to re fit the original experimental results of graham et al 1982 to develop more accurate mathematical representations of the light and temperature mediation functions especially at the low light threshold of the canopy environment to redefine those functions we applied the relationship of platt et al 1980 to establish light dependent functions for gross growth and light enhanced respiration at discrete temperatures next we identified relationships for the coefficients embedded within the platt equation with respect to temperature the result was new 3d response surfaces for mediation of gross growth and light enhanced respiration by light and temperature finally to meet our primary objective we replaced the logistic model algorithm with a segmented system framework here light is attenuated and net growth is calculated through the algal mat at 1 cm intervals in an iterative fashion for each time step of the simulation to yield a more realistic time series of biomass accumulation 3 modeling methods 3 1 modeling self shading the fundamental basis for modeling population size p is the exponential model presented in a generalized fashion as 1 d p d t k p where the rate of growth is proportional to population size as determined by a constant k the specific growth rate coefficient in the exponential model the value of k does not change as p increases and unlimited growth is predicted this approach is well recognized as being unrealistic as resources including space are limited in nature and may support only a finite population the logistic growth model accommodates the potential for negative feedback as population size increases by introducing a carrying capacity term again presented in a generalized fashion as 2 d p d t k 1 p p m a x p where pmax is the maximum achievable population size here the population growth rate does not remain constant but is attenuated as the population size increases in its application to attached algae the feedback function of eq 2 serves to represent the self shading phenomenon with the realized growth rate asymptotically approaching zero as p approaches p m a x the canopy may be defined as the aboveground or above bottom portion of a plant community we use the term canopy synonymously with bed mat and stand descriptive terms widely used in attached algae modeling in cladophora the canopy extends from a basal holdfast attached to solid substrate upward to the tips of the filaments suspended in the water column fig 2 light is attenuated with passage through the water column and through the canopy becoming less available if available at all to support photosynthesis deeper in the stand this canopy effect is well described for forests givnish 1988 and has been studied in periphyton hill and boston 1991 dodds et al 1999 and macroalgae and macrophytes in freshwater and marine environments binzer et al 2006 it has been noted that determination of biomass and photosynthetic characteristics of phytoelements plant parts are insufficient to describe community production where three dimensional bed structure and distribution of light in the canopy also contribute to mediation of growth binzer et al 2006 self shading has been described in cladophora where light attenuation through the canopy impacts the balance of photosynthesis and respiration potentially compromising the condition of algal cells near the canopy bottom and leading to senescence and detachment sloughing higgins et al 2008 in previous versions of the glcm the self shading phenomenon was implicitly modeled using a lumped system approach where the algal mat is considered as one homogeneous layer in our work we develop a segmented canopy approach and redefine experimentally derived light temperature response surfaces driving photosynthesis and respiration to more realistically simulate self shading within the algal mat 3 2 growth model framework the great lakes cladophora model v3 calculates the rate of change in biomass density as the net of the gain through gross growth and loss to respiration in a form analogous to that presented for the generalized exponential growth model in eq 1 3 d x d t μ g r o s s r x where x is population size cladophora biomass density in grams dry mass per unit area gdm m 2 t is time d and μ g r o s s and r are the specific rate constants d 1 for gross growth and respiration respectively in applications to algal field populations an additional first order loss term sloughing l is added to eq 3 to account for physical detachment the term is not required in the laboratory based applications considered here the term μ g r o s s r in eq 3 is thus equivalent to a net specific growth rate coefficient μ n e t d 1 the next step is to add functions that accommodate the role of light and temperature f i t nutrients in our case phosphorus f q and carrying capacity f x in mediating the specific rate coefficients in eq 3 4 μ g r o s s μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q f x where μ g r o s s m a x is the maximum specific gross growth rate coefficient d 1 the light and temperature mediation function f μ g r o s s i t is represented as a three dimensional μ g r o s s i t response surface described in detail in section 3 3 the phosphorus mediation function f q is based on the relationship of droop 1968 5 f q 1 q m i n q where q is the stored or cellular p content of the alga gp gdm 1 as and q m i n is the minimum stored p required to sustain cell structure and basal metabolism taken here as 0 04 rounded from 0 035 as used by tomlinson et al 2010 this function yields a rectangular hyperbola where f q approaches 0 as q approaches q m i n and f q approaches 1 when q q m i n the carrying capacity term f x introduced in generalized form in eq 2 and applied in the development of glcm v1 and v2 is given by 6 f x 1 x x m a x where x m a x gdm m 2 is the maximum achievable biomass density the carrying capacity term is eliminated in glcm v3 consistent with our objective to follow a conceptually sound mechanistic self shading approach as the means of regulating the negative feedback of population growth described in section 3 4 this leaves eq 4 as 7 μ g r o s s μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q the approach continues in a similar fashion for respiration which is partitioned into light enhanced r l e d 1 and basal r b d 1 components 8 r r l e r b with 9 r l e r l e m a x f r l e i t f q where r l e m a x is the maximum specific light enhanced respiration rate coefficient d 1 and f r l e i t and f q are as for μ g r o s s and described in more detail in sections 3 3 and 3 4 basal respiration r b d 1 is independent of light 10 r b r b 20 f r b t where r b 20 is the basal respiration rate coefficient at 20 c d 1 and f r b t is the temperature mediation function for r b as described in more detail in section 3 3 the net rate of change in biomass density is thus given by 11 d x d t μ g r o s s m a x f μ g r o s s i t f q r l e m a x f r l e i t f q r b 20 f r b t x 3 3 parameterizing coefficients and algorithms for light and temperature mediation values for the user defined coefficients μ g r o s s m a x r l e m a x r b 20 and q m i n are selected from the literature based on field and laboratory measurements and or model calibration the dimensionless functions mediating growth f μ g r o s s i t f r l e i t and f r b t are characterized by fitting algorithms to laboratory measurements of gross photosynthesis and total basal plus light enhanced respiration made by graham et al 1982 on a lake huron isolate of cladophora over an i t matrix of 10 1235 μe m 2 s 1 and 1 35 c we separate basal and light enhanced respiration in the graham et al 1982 data set by adopting the light threshold for cladophora growth 27 μe m 2 s 1 proposed by lorenz et al 1991 as the intensity below which light enhanced respiration is negligible r l e approaches 0 and basal respiration becomes the dominant process thus respiration rates measured by graham et al 1982 at 10 and 25 μe m 2 s 1 are taken as representing basal respiration and subtracted from measured total respiration to obtain values for light enhanced respiration the rate of light enhanced respiration depends on light and temperature while basal respiration only depends on temperature i e occurring both in the light and in the dark measured rates of gross photosynthesis and light enhanced and basal respiration go2 m 3 d 1 were converted to specific rates of gross growth and respiration d 1 using an assumed photosynthetic quotient of 1 i e 12 gc mol per 32 go2 mol and the mean carbon content for cladophora 37 5 mgc 100 mg dm auer and canale 1982 for the glcm v1 and v2 polynomial functions were fit to each of the full i t matrices for measured specific rates of gross growth and light enhanced respiration to generate three dimensional response surfaces tomlinson et al 2010 fit new polynomials to the data of graham et al 1982 eliminating mid curve minima apparent in otherwise continuous functions we found that these fits performed for full i t matrices do not serve well near the edges or boundaries of the light and temperature domains thus in developing the glcm v3 we constructed new three dimensional functions for the rates of gross specific growth and specific light enhanced respiration over the range of light intensities 6 8 values 0 1200 μe m 2 s 1 and for the discrete temperatures 8 values 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c used by graham et al 1982 we fitted 8 individual equations one for each discrete temperature slice for rates of gross growth and light enhanced respiration we then interpolated between slices across the temperature gradient to develop bivariate i e depending on light and temperature equations describing growth and respiration response surfaces and normalized those functions given temperature and light inputs the equations return dimensionless values ranging from 0 to 1 for the i t mediating functions for the gross specific growth rate f μ g r o s s i t and the light enhanced respiration rate f r l e i t the temperature mediation function for the basal respiration rate f r b t was defined using a simplified version of the arrhenius equation see section 3 5 2 two coefficients were developed by fitting this equation to the respiration rates measured by graham et al 1982 at 10 and 25 μe m 2 s 1 representing basal respiration 3 4 modeling the canopy effect the canopy model is implemented by solving eq 11 first specifying an initial condition for cladophora biomass x and then dividing that value by a constant layer specific areal biomass density x l a y e r 9 gdm m 2 cm 1 derived from unpublished data by s malkin to determine the number of 1 cm layers comprising the algal canopy height at the start of the growing season any fraction of the specified initial condition remaining is added to a layer at the top of the canopy environmental forcing conditions temperature incident light and the stored p content of the alga are specified as daily and hourly light time series the light environment is mediated by attenuation through the water column and attenuation through the canopy itself i e self shading as depicted in fig 2 light at the canopy bottom or any position within the canopy can be calculated from the incident light at the water surface the light

algal mat thickness m water column light attenuation coefficients k e are regularly determined in lake and river environments but such measurements through the algal canopy k a l g are less common and vary considerably higgins 2005 malkin personal communication higgins 2005 used a power fit to describe k a l g as a function of biomass density k a l g 7 84 x 0 24 yielding a range of 9 34 m 1 and averaging 21 4 5 9 standard deviation m 1 for areal biomass densities of 13 119 gdm m 2 malkin 2007 proposed a constant mean value of k a l g 24 1 3 3 standard deviation m 1 i e the coefficient does not vary with biomass density these observations correspond with those reported by higgins et al 2006 k a l g 20 30 m 1 when x 50 gdm m 2 flynn 2014 measured k a l g values for river cladophora ranging from 4 3 150 7 m 1 and averaging 47 34 standard deviation m 1 at various biomass densities and shear velocities dodds et al 1999 measured k a l g ranging from 71 1791 m 1 in various new zealand stream periphyton assemblages it must be noted that while many processes such as nutrient uptake can be assumed to be the same in rivers and lakes self shading in riverine cladophora is manifested differently than in lacustrine cladophora conceptually filaments are longer and pushed tightly together for a mat lying flat in the downstream direction in fast flowing rivers whereas lacustrine filaments can stand upright and be moved about gently by lake currents and wave induced turbulence recognizing this fact we use k a l g 21 4 5 9 for cladophora in the great lakes consistent with the mean standard deviation values of higgins 2005 and on the order of values measured by malkin 2007 we first test the canopy effect in the glcm v3 using forcing conditions for temperature and incident light specified as daily time series this initial testing is designed to focus on the mediating effect of fμ gross i t on canopy modeling thus the roles of nutrient limitation and sloughing are not included f q 1 l 0 these processes are restored in our final simulation where the canopy model is examined for its ability to track field observations of biomass density over the season the calculation is made as a family of nested loops first calculating biomass accrual in each layer for each hour and then summing over the canopy to provide an initial condition for the next hourly step the process is repeated for 24 h and summed to yield a daily time series of cladophora biomass for the entire simulation period more specifically the model builds the algal canopy layer by layer filling each 1 cm layer with a constant biomass xlayer 9 gdm m 2 cm 1 the remaining biomass equaling xtot number of layers xlayer is captured separately in the topmost canopy layer for each layer the light intensity is calculated by attenuating the light at the canopy surface down to the depth of the layer within the canopy eq 12 with the layer number substituted for zmat which also equals the mat thickness in cm divided by 100 in order to be expressed in meters and then the growth attenuation factors f q f μ g r o s s i t f r l e i t and f r b t are calculated and used to determine the incremental growth of each biomass layer for each time step the cumulative change in biomass is the sum of the change in biomass in each layer and a new total biomass is calculated at the end of each time step this new total biomass becomes the starting point for the next time step which redistributes the total biomass over the whole canopy and thus calculates a new canopy height similarly where stored phosphorus mediation of growth is included changes in stored phosphorus are calculated for each biomass layer for each time step 3 5 fitting light and temperature mediation functions 3 5 1

and late summer period when senescence and attendant sloughing occur malkin et al 2010 higgins et al 2008 and the negative net growth expected for the well shaded portions of the canopy 4 results the primary objective of this work was to model the self shading carrying capacity phenomenon in cladophora by moving from a lumped system to a segmented canopy approach given that the light and temperature response surfaces of the glcm v1 and v2 were inadequately defined for simulations at low light intensities the secondary objective of this work was to develop new light and temperature growth and respiration mediation functions for the glcm v3 in the cladophora growth model cgm higgins 2005b simultaneously used both the logistic growth model based carrying capacity term xmax eqs 2 and 6 and light attenuation through the canopy using both approaches at the same time over parameterizes negative feedback via self shading in the glcm v3 the overly deterministic logistic growth term employed in the lumped system approach eq 6 has been eliminated and the maximum achievable biomass determined in a self regulating mechanistic manner through feedback from the mediation factors f the mass balance performed on the segmented canopy includes a source term gross growth μ g r o s s two sink terms light enhanced and basal respiration r l e and r b and factors that represent mediation by environmental forcing conditions light and temperature f i t for growth and respiration and phosphorus f q as developed in eqs 7 9 and 10 the newly fitted growth mediation function f μ g r o s s i t yields the highest gross growth rates in the 13 20 c and 200 μe m 2 s 1 regions while the lowest rates occur at low light intensities at very low 2 c and high 30 c temperatures and at high light intensities combined with high temperatures top right region of the top right panel in fig 9 the newly fitted light enhanced respiration mediation function f r l e i t yields the highest rates at high 30 c temperatures the glcm v1 and v2 surfaces show increasing respiration rates with increasing light intensity while the glcm v3 surface is almost insensitive to changes in light above 200 μe m 2 s 1 fig 9 middle row panels the maximum specific gross growth rate μgross and the maximum light enhanced respiration rate rle max are user defined in the model here values of 1 08 d 1 and 0 44 d 1 respectively originally used in the glcm v1 auer and canale 1982 were applied to yield μnet surfaces using the response surfaces employed in each of the three glcm versions fig 9 bottom row panels two major differences emerge in the glcm v3 treatment of cladophora growth the first of these is that the revised light and temperature growth mediation functions fig 9 provide an improved fit of the threshold effect at low light intensities this improvement is critical to simulating the growth rates characteristic of the diminished light environment deep within the algal mat the canopy effect additionally the glcm v3 response surfaces fig 9 move away conceptually from the metabolic imbalance explanation photorespiration glcm v1 and v2 for initiation of sloughing finding conceptual consistency with the cgm higgins et al 2005a 2005b in recognizing that the canopy effect drives detachment we compare model output for the lumped carrying capacity simulated using xmax and the segmented canopy system approaches by using a common set of model inputs coefficients and environmental forcing conditions and excluding sloughing table 2 we apply constant water column and algal mat light attenuation coefficients and eliminate phosphorus mediation by setting f q 1 light conditions were taken as a smoothed function for hourly incident light intensity based on a 5 year data set obtained at muskegon mi daily temperatures were taken as a smoothed function based on an 11 year data set of remotely sensed surface water temperature for lake michigan at milwaukee wi the initial biomass was specified as 10 gdm m 2 and an initial stored phosphorus content as 0 06 in the lumped system application using the logistic growth model simulation set 1 the rate of biomass accrual is initially high x x m a x see slope of dashed lines in fig 10 then becomes attenuated and eventually asymptotically approaches zero the maximum achievable biomass is fixed by a user specified value of x m a x example simulations are shown for x m a x values of 300 400 and 500 gdm m 2 fig 10 dashed lines we see the use of this type of model with a broad range of available x m a x values as being overly deterministic or prescriptive rather than biophysically based the segmented canopy simulation set 2 produced a biomass density curve similar in shape to that resulting from the lumped system approach the range of realized maximum biomass is constrained by the light extinction coefficient through the algal mat kalg which is based on measurements gray shading in fig 10 here the rate of biomass accrual and the realized maximum biomass approximately match those for the lumped system approach with x m a x 400 gdm m 2 but reflect self regulation and the interplay of the alga with its environment rather than the result of a prescribed model coefficient and model tuning all simulations using the lumped system approach show a rapid increase in biomass over time accrual rate while simulations using the segmented system approach show slower biomass accrual it is important to note that the time at which seasonal maximum biomass is achieved is influenced by the applied approach a vertically detailed determination of net specific growth rates μnet in the segmented canopy over the growing season simulation set 3 was performed using the same conditions as before see table 2 but with constant values of light 600 μe m 2 s 1 temperature 15 c and light extinction through the mat 24 1 m 1 simulation results are compared in fig 11 in all cases μnet is positive in layers near the mat surface declines with depth in the canopy and is negative from a distance of 15 cm below the canopy surface for these model forcing conditions the mat depth integrated canopy layer average net growth rate bold font values in fig 11 decreases with increasing canopy thickness due to self shading as the mat depth integrated value of μnet approaches 0 biomass accrual is reduced and the canopy biomass asymptotically approaches its maximum value fig 10 here the canopy model simulates the maximum biomass density in a self regulating mechanistic manner to validate the canopy shading algorithm we applied it to the glcm v2 including time variable q mediation and the previously excluded sloughing process in this simulation set 4 we used observational data rather than idealized smoothed curves for light and temperature conditions and evaluated model performance using biomass measurements made at atwater beach milwaukee wi on lake michigan in 2006 refer to tomlinson et al 2010 for data sources and model coefficients implementation of the revised growth and respiration response surfaces and the canopy shading algorithm with kalg 10 m 1 in the glcm v2 resulted in a good fit when comparing model output with biomass measurements fig 12 a this calibration required a low kalg value when all other model coefficient values as calibrated by tomlinson et al 2010 are retained the canopy height or mat thickness z m a t varies throughout the season and tracks the biomass curve fig 12b the attendant net growth rate at different locations within the canopy fluctuates with natural variability in forcing conditions such as light and temperature during the growth season fig 12c we conclude that the canopy model effectively simulates cladophora biomass accrual over the season while meeting our objective to eliminate the overly deterministic specification of maximum biomass density although results achieved with the canopy shading algorithm are similar to those obtained using the lumped system glcm v2 we note that the success of this model upgrade cannot be assessed simply by comparing an earlier version s output with that of this version because the modeler has the ability to influence the output by simply tuning xmax in the glcm v1 and v2 it must be emphasized that the improvement lies in advancing the conceptual integrity of the model by reducing the degrees of freedom available to the modeler and mechanistically representing ecological processes 5 discussion in their two volume treatise engineering approaches for lake management chapra and reckhow 1983 and reckhow and chapra 1983 recognize two distinctly different approaches to the modelling and management of lakes one empirical data based the other mechanistic process based the treatment of carrying capacity used in the first v1 canale and auer 1982a b and second v2 tomlinson et al 2010 versions of the great lakes cladophora model glcm was partially mechanistic based on the logistic growth model and partially empirical specification of the maximum achievable biomass coefficient xmax there are two fundamental problems with the use of the logistic growth model eqs 2 and 6 to treat the impact of self shading on growth in the glcm v1 and v2 first the calculation treats the canopy as a lumped system i e growth proceeds uniformly over the entire height of the canopy clearly this cannot be the case given the observed attenuation of light with increasing depth through the canopy second a globally constant value for the carrying capacity term x m a x is assumed which is problematic given the broad range of maximum biomass levels observed across the great lakes e g 0 1000 gdm m 2 canale and auer 1982a higgins et al 2005a malkin et al 2008 and tomlinson et al 2010 the first problem uniform growth throughout the canopy a lumped system leads to tuning the maximum specific growth rate coefficient to meet a poorly defined canopy average light condition that changes as canopy height increases the second problem a global x m a x potentially requires the modeler to adjust contributions to net growth maximum rates of growth and respiration beyond accepted coefficient ranges to constrain the rate of biomass increase as applied in the glcm v1 and v2 selection of a value for x m a x has no mechanistic basis and leaves the modeler with a solely empirical means of forcing a fit to a particular model dataset in calibration and confirmation e g top panel of fig 10 interest in modeling cladophora grew following publication of the glcm v1 canale and auer 1982a and efforts were made to address prevailing modeling problems higgins et al 2005b recognized that maximum achievable biomass would vary with the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation par reaching the canopy and developed an empirical relationship between maximum observed biomass and mean daily par at the canopy surface metabolic imbalance was recognized as the cause of sloughing detachment of an algal mat with experimental work by higgins 2005a and malkin 2007 supporting the concept that light attenuation through an algal canopy compromises algal cells at the base of the canopy mat that process was incorporated into the cladophora growth model cgm higgins et al 2005b for application to lake erie providing negative feedback from self shading higgins et al 2006 retained the lumped system approach of the cgm higgins et al 2005b for characterization of the canopy but took a step towards a segmented approach by calculating net specific growth rates offline at the canopy surface and bottom to explore and successfully describe metabolic imbalance as a trigger for sloughing events in a subsequent application of the cgm higgins et al 2005b to lake ontario malkin et al 2008 retained the lumped system approach and chose not to use a par driven x m a x returning to the fixed x m a x treatment of canale and auer 1982a the transition to a fully segmented approach was made by higgins et al 2008 who combined in vitro measurements photosynthesis irradiance curves and numerical experiments offline of the cgm to further examine the significance of a canopy effect on initiation of sloughing a critical algal density i e the maximum algal density allowing sufficient light to maintain positive metabolism to reach the base of the canopy was determined experimentally and described as a function of par reaching the canopy surface these results conclusively demonstrated the potential for self shading to prevent cells at the base of the canopy from maintaining a positive metabolism the findings further provided support for the sloughing trigger algorithm offered by higgins et al 2006 a treatment which has both mechanistic light mediation of metabolic balance at the base of the bed and empirical degree and duration of a negative metabolic balance features in contrast to previous versions the glcm v3 employs a layer by layer canopy shading algorithm without invoking a carrying capacity term while this treatment of self shading is mathematically more complex than using a simple xmax coefficient eqs 2 and 6 this segmented approach is based on mechanistic principles that do not require a location specific often ill defined xmax term this significant advancement in the glcm is based on concepts originally discussed by higgins 2005 and malkin 2007 here a segmented canopy algorithm inhibits cladophora growth in a manner that is mechanistically sound and an improvement over the empirically derived carrying capacity constant xmax the work presented in our manuscript details the canopy algorithm that was developed and incorporated in the glcm v3 the canopy algorithm serves to recognize a local environmental friction i e self shading within the algal mat which brakes μmax to result in the maximum realized biomass global sources of environmental friction mediating μmax are temperature incident light and its attenuation through the water column and nutrient availability in this model algal growth does not cease as biomass approaches an empirically derived user specified value of x m a x instead as growth extends the algal canopy above the bottom net growth continues at the canopy surface but an increasing proportion of the canopy becomes self shaded and lies within a sub optimal light environment where basal respiration predominates eventually as more and more of the canopy experiences near or complete darkness respiration in the lower canopy balances positive net photosynthesis near the canopy surface and net canopy growth ceases a maximum realized biomass is achieved no longer a prescribed constant carrying capacity x m a x the maximum realized biomass varies with local canopy and global features incident light temperature nutrients depth that differ within a site with depth among sites nutrients and vertical light extinction and seasonally for the more commonly observed case in which light and temperature conditions are less than ideal the domain of robust growth is markedly attenuated across the light temperature matrix for μ n e t it is this interplay of i and t together and nutrient availability as f q that forms the foundation for transition from an overly deterministic growth modeling approach the logistic model to the mechanistic canopy based approach where growth is governed by environmental forcing conditions and the inherent response of the alga to those conditions the work of higgins et al 2005b 2006 2008 provides a strong foundation and valuable guidance in addressing the two fundamental problems we have identified in the initial effort to model cladophora growth glcm v1 canale and auer 1982a lumped versus segmented treatment of the canopy and a global value for the self shading coefficient x m a x after developing new light and temperature mediation functions for growth and respiration we fulfilled the main objective of this work to develop a mechanistic model that does not require such a user specified upper limit to cladophora growth x m a x but rather employs a fully organic approach where the natural interplay between environmental forcing conditions light temperature and phosphorus supply and the physiological response of the alga serve to limit the maximum achievable biomass this is accomplished by applying a segmented framework where net growth is calculated at specified intervals over the canopy and the result is then integrated to represent biomass accrual for the entire bed to our knowledge this effort represents the first time that the canopy effect has been fully and explicitly included in a cladophora growth model data availability statement the growth and respiration data for which light and temperature response surfaces were

that sqb is a net sink of phytoplankton imported from the ocean in particular during the upwelling periods farfán and álvarez borrego 1983 phytoplankton in sqb typically decreases from the mouth toward the inner arms of the lagoon and during the intense upwelling season the phytoplankton community composition is very dynamic with diatoms dominating early in an upwelling event and dinoflagellates dominating after the diatom bloom millan nuñez et al 1982 gracia escobar et al 2014 the dominant primary producers apart from microalgae include the seagrass zostera marina and the macroalgae ulva spp zertuche gonzález et al 2009 the eelgrass covers 40 of the lagoon and forms particularly dense meadows in the inner arms ward et al 2003 ibarra obando et al 2007 reported an average annual foliar biomass of zostera marina in sqb of 75 g dw m 2 with annual maxima ranging from 80 to 350 g dw m 2 and an average in the summer autumn maxima of 150 g dw m 2 ulva spp is present all year around but its biomass shows a seasonal variation with a spring maximum ward et al 2003 zertuche gonzález et al 2009 reported biomasses of 350 g dw m 2 of ulva spp in sqb in spring summer 2004 and 2005 and 65 g dw m 2 in late winter 2005 ulvaspp biomass has increased in recent years zertuche gonzález et al 2009 competing with zostera marina in particular close to the sqb inlet ward et al 2003 3 materials and methods 3 1 the model implementation in the san quintin bay the water quality model hereon called sqbfeem finite element ecological model for the san quintin bay has been developed coupling the finite element hydrodynamical model already successfully applied to the sqb in a 2d version melaku canu et al 2016 to a biogeochemical model by significantly expanding the work already made in veelfem the finite element ecological model for the lagoon of venice umgiesser et al 2003 melaku canu et al 2003 in order to incorporate major ecological processes that were not included in velfeem but are needed for a proper representation of the sqb biogeochemistry in particular we added three new modules for nitrogen n carbon c and phosphorus p cycling through macroalgal mats oyster culture farms and the detritus stock in the sediment following the velfeem approach we used an operator splitting technique as described in umgiesser et al 2003 accordingly the overall variation of any state variable is split into the sum of two contributions the physical driven term and the biological driven term the hydrodynamic model resolves the momentum and continuity equation to update the current velocities and water levels then the physical temperature and salinity and biogeochemical variables i e nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton detritus are transported advected and diffused all the variables including ulva and oysters which are not transported are then updated performing biogeochemical and ecological transformations the shyfem model uses a finite element discretization to solve the hydrodynamic equations and a semi implicit time stepping algorithm and therefore it is suitable for the hydrodynamic characterization of shallow basins with a complex morphology including channels and tidal flats umgiesser et al 2003 2004 2014 melaku canu et al 2003 2012 solidoro et al 2004 adopting a staggered approach the water levels are described by linear form functions defined on the nodes intersections of the grid while the velocities are described by constant form functions over each element which corresponds to the definition of the velocities in the centre of the elements umgiesser et al 2004 the sqb domain has been represented by a finite element grid made of 1481 nodes vertices and 2633 triangular elements varying in shape and dimension from 7 m along the channels and at the inlet to 35 m in the shallower areas fig 1 melaku canu et al 2016 the water column is discretized into 8 vertical layers with uniform thickness of 2 m the sqbfeem model follows the evolution of a set of variables which characterize the state of the water column and of the surface of sediments which hosts the benthic communities the state of the water and sediment is defined by ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 phosphate po4 dissolved organic nitrogen don particulate organic nitrogen pon dissolved organic phosphorus dop particulate organic phosphorus pop carbonaceous biogeochemical oxygen demand cbod dissolved oxygen do phytoplankton zooplankton crassostrea gigas and ulva spp fig 2 in the present work the model is refined by introducing a sedimentation module representing the dynamics of organic matter that settles from the water column to the bottom layer where it is mineralised and eventually resuspended the inclusion of these processes into the parameterization of biogeochemical cycles is of great importance since this bay is a shallow environment and both re suspension of sediment and release of nutrients from the sediment can be high and significantly affect the water quality aveytua alcázar et al 2008 ávila lópez et al 2016 the limiting factors are computed following the standard formulations the michaelis menten monod for nutrient limitation the steele formulation for the limitation due to light intensity and an exponential relation for temperature since oyster aquaculture of crassostrea gigas may significantly contribute to the nutrient dynamics in the sqb ecosystem sandoval gil et al 2016 the new module representing the oysters stock has been introduced fig 2 individual filtration assimilation excretion and ingestion were introduced as functions of body size temperature and food quantity solidoro et al 2000 chapelle et al 2000 pastres et al 2001 melaku canu et al 2011 the model was initialized introducing the 25 in m 2 of an average size of 20 mm distributed across bfa fig 1 and introducing a growth term and an exponential death rate according to zertuche gonzález et al 2009 ulva spp became quite invasive in the last decade in sqb having also replaced extensive surfaces of eelgrass beds its presence was hypothesized to have been triggered by the introduction of oyster cultivations according to the same authors ulva may play an important role as temporary sink and source of c n and p in sqb due to its large biomass and to its capacity to capture these elements and to release them during the degradation phase ávila lópez et al 2017 aveytua alcázar et al 2008 report that no3 concentrations in the water column are more sensitive to ulva variations than zostera in sqb on the other hand the temporal variability of zostera marina biomass is more sensitive to light availability than no3 and ulva spp is more sensitive to no3 availability than light this suggests that it is more important to included ulva in our model therefore we introduced a new ulva spp module fig 2 dynamically simulating the temporal evolution of biomass and of the intratissual n in ulva spp based on the formulations given in solidoro et al 1997 the module parameterization is listed in table a1 the model results have been statistically tested by calculating an index of performance allen et al 2007 which takes into account the explained variance r2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency me the percentage bias model pbias and the ratio between the standard deviation of the data and the standard deviation of the model rsd the index of performance identifies 4 levels which are categorized as excellent me 0 65 pbias 10 very good me 0 65 0 5 pbias 10 20 good me 0 5 0 2 pbias 20 40 and poor me 0 2 pbias 40 3 2 model set up a 1 year run with a time step of 5 min was performed for 2004 in order to test the model and to tune the model parameters in addition in order to explore the effect of variation in upwelling intensity on the sqb biogeochemistry we performed two additional runs for two years 2005 and 2016 characterized respectively by intense high and weak low upwelling conditions we therefore focused the comparative analysis on the effects of upwelling changes on the n budget of sqb in spring when the upwelling intensification occurs these three years were selected based on nutrient data

temperature and salinity values measured at the sqb mouth at station c fig 1 sea level values collected at 30 min intervals were measured using a rdi acoustic doppler current profiler because a one year long time series of nutrients is not available for sqb nutrient boundary conditions were obtained by using data measured at stations 1 and 2 fig 1 in may june and september october 2004 and with monthly measurements of pennington and chavez 2000 data were interpolated following a seasonal upwelling zooplankton boundary conditions were set using the imecocal data http calcofi org affiliates

year 2004 given in aveytua alcázar et al 2008 due to the lack of data of nutrients in sqb throughout the whole year winter nutrient concentrations were set at the mid intensity upwelling observed values 4 μm for no3 4 μm for nh4 1 μm for po4 the initial biomass of ulva spp was set to 40 gdw m 2 distributed across an area of 431 ha fig 1 in agreement with reported observations zertuche et al 2009 aveytua alcázar et al 2008 the oyster module was initialized in agreement with garcía esquivel et al 2004 3 3 2 the high upwelling scenario high the high scenario was based on hydrodynamic thermohaline and biogeochemical setting for 2005 aveytua alcázar et al 2008 ribas ribas et al 2011 and on 2005 data of wind speed air temperature humidity irradiance and atmospheric pressure collected at the aandera weather station fig 1 the average wind speed in the spring 2005 was more intense in comparison to ref scenario with a mean of 4 30 2 02 ms 1 table 1 3 3 2 1 high boundary conditions were set using data of 2005 and adopting the same approach applied for the computation of the ref boundary conditions sea level water temperature and salinity values were measured at the sqb mouth at station c fig 1 concentrations of nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton were obtained by using data measured at stations 1 and 2 fig 1 in may june and adopting the same approach used for the ref

discussion 4 1 the ref scenario results and comparison with available data the ref scenario model outputs were compared with in situ observations of water levels rdi acoustic doppler current profiler seawater temperature salinity and nutrient concentration fig 1 available for 10 days in spring may june and 14 days in summer september october 2004 physical variables are consistent with those obtained with the validated 2 d model melaku canu et al 2016 the modeled currents show satisfactory agreement with adcp data already presented in melaku canu et al 2016 measured at stations a and d shown in fig 1 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 87 and 0 8 respectively for the two stations a and d in spring water temperature and salinity fields presented the expected pattern with a positive gradient from the mouth toward the internal area at the heads of bfa and brazo sq with a difference of 4 c for temperature and 0 8 for salinity between these two extremes the comparison of modelled and observed vertical profiles confirms the occurrence of well mixed profiles structure in the bay a weak spring vertical structure less than 10 of variation was observed at station 6 close to the mouth of the bay which is the deepest part of the system the mixed vertical structure of the sqb was already reported by other authors millan nuñez et al 1982 and ribas ribas et al 2011 as expected the simulated annual evolution of nutrients no3 nh4 and po4 phytoplankton and zooplankton shows a maximum in late spring and early summer and a minimum in winter and early spring in accordance with the typical biogeochemical dynamics governed by upwelling observed in central california chenillat et al 2013 and pennington and chavez 2000 an example of such annual evolution is shown for station 28 in fig 3 having a residence time of 4 days melaku canu et al 2016 this station is quite rapidly responding to the ocean physical dynamics and nutrient supply but is still influenced by the local dynamics of oyster macroalgae and phytoplankton growth all of which are abundant during upwelling events which occur through the year but are more intense during spring and early summer upwelled water from the ccs is transported from the shelf into sqb the penetration of upwelled water into the arms varies according to the combination of upwelling intensity and tidal amplitude melaku canu et al 2016 ribas ribas et al 2011 the simulations show that when upwelling events occur tidal pumping fig 3 induces a large injection of no3 into sqb this induces in station 28 higher nutrient concentration during the spring tide when no3 reaches maximum values of 7 μm and lower concentration during the neap tide when the no3 maximum reaches only 4 μm fig 3 the spatial and temporal comparison fig 4 a b c and d show good agreement between averaged observed and simulated values the tendency of no3 to decrease towards the interior of the lagoon in both seasons fig 4a indicates that no3 is consumed within sqb no3 average values in bfa were slightly lower than at the mouth of the bay due to the limited exchange with the ocean computed with the average water residence times of 4 days in brazo sq where the average water residence time is 11 days the decrease in no3 concentration with respect to the mouth of the bay is even higher confirming previous results camacho ibar et al 2003 and 2007 ribas ribas et al 2011 po4 fig 4d shows a different pattern than no3 increasing from the mouth to the inner parts of the bay confirming that this system is a net generator of this nutrient as a result of its addition from remineralization of imported organic matter over its consumption by the local primary producers camacho ibar et al 2003 and 2007 in summer the persistence of nh4 in the water column which is already depleted in no3 st 28 fig 3 is explained by the remineralization of the organic matter mainly occurring in the sediments ibarra obando et al 2004 report that sediments of sqb can provide nh4 to the water column at rates as high as 2 7 mmol nh4 m 2d 1 as a result of the first step of organic matter degradation the model reproduces the net increase of don in the inner parts of sqb fig 4d in agreement with observations reported by rodriguez cardozo 2004 that found in the internal arms average values of don of 16 μm the index of performance has been computed by comparing the average values of salinity water temperature no3 nh4 po4 don and phytoplankton measured at the 14 stations of the bay in 2004 fig 1 with their corresponding average modeled values extracted for the corresponding sampling stations at the corresponding sampling times a large gradient between the ocean stations and the inner arms of the bay is observed in agreement with the observations camacho ibar et al 2003 table 3 summarizes the statistics for each variable calculated on spatial variability over the observed data period may june 2004 as indicated by the r2 values more than 70 of spatial variability of all variables salinity seawater temperature no3 nh4 po4 don and phytoplankton can be reproduced by the model indicating that the model captures the general trends in these variables the me values indicate that the model performance was excellent to simulate salinity and water temperature 0 65 very good to simulate po4 no3 and nh4 and good to simulate don and phytoplankton the model performance based on pbias was excellent for salinity water temperature po4 and don very good for nh4 and phytoplankton and good for no3 the global model performance was explored by plotting r2 vs rsd r2 and rsd should be close to one of the values used to calculate the index of performance confirming a good skill for all the variables with the exception of don for which more accurate boundary data are required to adequately validate the model in the eastern arm water exchange time is longer dissolved inorganic nitrogen din supply from upwelled waters is very limited thus phytoplankton and ulva spp are little abundant and zostera marina biomass is dominant thus internal recycling in this area must be more intense then sqbfeem requires an explicit module of seagrass which should increase don concentrations to more realistic values salinity and water temperature followed by concentration of po4 and no3 show the best skill data limit did not allow us to further tune the model parameters to improve model calibration the model slightly underestimates the variance of don and nh4 while overestimates the phytoplankton and no3 fig 5 this is possibly related to the higher uncertainty and variability in the open boundary data of phytoplankton respect to the nutrients which are less variable model outputs of no3 have been compared with the available data collected at 14 stations 3 30 fig 1 sampled in spring 22 26 30 of may and 2 5 8 of june and autumn 14 17 19 22 24 28 of september and 1 4 11 14 of october the model was also able to reproduce the short term variability showing a good agreement with the measured values of no3 as shown for the 3 stations 22 26 and 19 located respectively close to the sea inlet st 22 in bfa st 26 and brazo sq st 19 fig 6 the short term evolution of spring and autumn is clearly influenced by upwelling conditions that presented a stronger pulse in the first part of the spring days between 22 of may and 12 of june and less variable upwelling conditions during the autumn 4 2 response to upwelling variability the response of n cycling and of the primary and secondary producers to an increase and decrease in ocean derived n loading induced by upwelling was explored by comparing the results of the ref simulation with the low and high scenarios in ref scenario no3 is the dominant nutrient at the mouth of the lagoon in may june average concentration of 6 28 0 68 μm and september october average concentration of 1 36 0 20 μm fig 4a while nh4 and don are dominant in particular during spring and summer in the inner part of the lagoon fig 4b d nh4 concentrations are in average 2 70 0 18 and 2 40 0 23 μm in bfa and 2 09 0 08 and 2 42 0 23 μm in brazo sq in may june and september october respectively the average of don concentrations in may june and september october 2004 are respectively 8 0 0 63 and 7 0 0 45 μm in bfa and 9 40 1 10 and 11 40 0 50 μm in brazo sq mcglathery et al 2007 indicate that it is common for don content to be greater than the din content in semi enclosed coastal ecosystems and berman and bronk 2003 results also indicate that the observed don concentrations of sqb typically greater than 5 μm and often greater than 15 μm rodriguez cardozo 2004 unpublished results are similar to those observed in this type of coastal systems fig 7 presents the time averaged values of no3 modeled results at the samplings stations fig 1 for the three scenarios during the spring upwelling conditions no3 concentrations at the mouth of the bay st 3 to st 8 are in agreement with the boundary inputs of respectively 3 6 7 0 and 11 0 μm for ref low and high scenarios no3 boundary concentration in high scenario is three times that of low scenario indicating that the supply of nutrients from the ocean to estuarine systems along the ne pacific coast of america can have intense interannual variations camacho ibar et al 2003 ribas ribas et al 2011 the spatial gradient of no3 highlights its ocean origins as also confirmed by its inverse relationship with salinity box in fig 7 in the high scenario no3 concentrations at the mouth of the bay were in average persistently above 10 μm from st 3 22 abruptly decreasing towards the inner end of brazo sq the low scenario presents a lower no3 gradient from the mouth of the bay with average concentration of no3 of 3 6 μm fig 7 indicating that the no3 fluxes are minimum during weak upwelling these results are also in agreement with previous analysis and measurements conducted during weak upwelling farfán and álvarez borrego 1983 camacho ibar et al 2003 maps in fig 8 show the spring average values of no3 fig 8a and phytoplankton fig 8b of ref scenario and their corresponding anomalies in respect to low fig 8c d and high spring upwelling scenarios fig 8e f average values have been computed by averaging the model outputs between 1 april and 30 june 2004 the anomalies have been calculated at each point of the domain as the difference between the values of the scenario low or high in respect to the corresponding ref value the anomaly shown in fig 8e for the high scenario highlights an increase in no3 concentration associated to the increasing upwelling intensity due to the stronger alongshore winds in the ocean adjacent to sqb registered during 2005 table 1 the anomaly is higher at the inlet decreasing slightly toward the farther end of the bfa and brazo sq with values at the inlets up to 14 μm 30 higher than the maximum concentrations of 10 μm observed in ref scenario the opposite feature is observed in the low scenario which presents a negative no3 anomaly of low scenario fig 7c throughout the lagoon with highest values at the inlet associated to the decreased upwelling intensity and lowest towards the brazo sq smith and hollibaugh 1997 mention that the contributions of organic carbon from the adjacent ocean to tomales bay california control the seasonality of the net production of the ecosystem the phytoplankton primary production due to upwelling in the ccs supplies labile organic carbon that is oxidized within the bay which induces a net heterotrophic condition similar to tomales bay sqb is also a net heterotrophic system where excess respiration is subsidized by the supply of particulate organic carbon from the adjacent sea camacho ibar et al 2003 the ref scenario simulation shows a decrease of phytoplankton from the mouth to brazo sq fig 8b in agreement with millan nuñez et al 1982 observing for chl a a decrease from 5 mg m 3 at the mouth to around 1 mg m 3 at the inner ends of the lagoon the phytoplankton anomaly of low scenario fig 8d is negative throughout the lagoon with highest values toward the brazo sq and around the oyster farming area in bfa fig 8b accordingly in high scenario fig 8f a positive phytoplankton anomaly throughout the lagoon is observed and gradually decreasing at the farther ends of brazo sq the positive phytoplankton anomaly in high scenario fig 8f exhibits a correlated response to increased nutrient input in the mouth area st 3 22 in agreement with observations ribas ribas et al 2011 predicted biomass of ulva and oyster are sensitive to the upwelling scenarios ulva spp and oyster biomass increase respectively about 35 and 20 under high upwelling scenario compared to the low one 4 3 nitrogen mass budget a n mass budget was carried out by computing the n fluxes and stocks of the sqbfeem model variables fig 2 under ref low and high upwelling scenarios for the spring period during upwelling events sensitivity tests were made to explore how the model responds when using the same physical forcing of the ref scenario but the boundary conditions of the high scenario the analysis showed that 35 of the total variation of no3 stock was related to changes in physical forcing n stocks and fluxes were computed by daily averaging the model outputs of no3 nh4 don phytoplankton zooplankton ulva spp and oysters and of their internal fluxes the stock estimation was done by using stoichiometric relationships atkinson and smith 1983 dame et al 1989 hecky et al 1993 to convert the model variables into n units while fluxes were obtained by computing and aggregating the source sink terms of the model variables fig 9 shows the average values over the spring period of the n stocks of the 8 aggregated variables and of their fluxes n is imported into sqb from the ocean in different forms n no3 n nh4 n don n phytoplankton and n zooplankton fig 9 n no3 is the biggest source of n increasing with the increase in upwelling intensity total n no3 loading from the ocean into the lagoon increased by a factor of 1 5 from low to high and 1 2 from ref to high scenario ranging from 2 0 3 5 mmol n m 2 d 1 fig 9 n no3 contributes 65 and 80 respectively of the total inputs of n in the low and high scenarios in the ref scenario n phytoplankton represents 10 of the total imports of n this value decreases when upwelling intensifies 6 high the decrease in the contribution of phytoplankton import with upwelling intensification is due to the fact that phytoplankton biomass in the coastal upwelling waters is not only controlled by upwelling intensity but by a combination of upwelling intensity and the duration of relaxation periods after upwelling events according to wilkerson et al 2006 the ideal conditions for biomass accumulation are a combination of medium intensity upwelling and 4 to 5 days of relaxation in other words intense and persistent upwelling conditions such as those represented by our high scenario may allow for high amounts of no3 to be advected but physically damps the aggregation of phytoplankton cells the total fluxes of ocean n loading into the sqb considering all sources i e phytoplankton zooplankton don no3 nh4 ranges from 3 50 to 4 40 mmol n m 2 d 1 in the low and high scenarios thus increasing by a factor of 1 30 total n exports increase by a factor of 1 50 from 2 00 3 20 mmol n m 2 d 1 between low and high scenarios and thus the imbalance between imports and exports increases with upwelling intensification moreover advective n ocean loading exceeds the exports to the ocean and the lost through denitrification as upwelling intensifies n availability increases and a larger fraction of internal productivity is sustained by external inputs fig 9 the gross total imports of n no3 into sqb estimated in this study are similar to the oceanic inputs into other estuarine systems influenced by upwelling along the california current domain brown and ozretich 2009 reported an average gross input of n no3 into yaquina bay oregon usa of 3 3 105 mol d 1 during the dry season in the 1997 2003 period an estimate of gross import of no3 1 0 105 mol d 1 is obtained for elkhorn slough using the tidal prism volume 5 7 106 m3 and the average n no3 concentration in water during flooding tide 18 8 μm reported by chapin et al 2004 when gross imports are normalized to the corresponding surface area even the highest rate of oceanic n no3 supply into sqb 3 50 mmol m 2 d 1 is 3 and 4 times lower than the loading into elkhorn slough 11 mmol m 2 d 1 and yaquina bay 18 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively despite the absence of direct terrestrial loadings loadings of n no3 from the ocean to sqb are similar or even higher than loadings of n from land to some other shallow coastal lagoons subjected to low or moderate anthropogenic eutrophication for example other lagoons of similar size such as ria formosa portugal 58 km2 golfe de fos france 42 km2 and bassin d arcachon france 155 km2 receive n no3 loadings of 0 50 1 50 mmol m 2 d 1 tett et al 2003 de wit et al 2001 which is smaller than the oceanic n no3 loading to sqb being double in the low scenario and 4 times higher during the high scenario this natural high loading of n from the ocean to sqb explains its high productivity and is a good example of the strong control of upwelling on primary productivity of coastal lagoons and estuaries along the ccs particularly during the dry season despite the difference in gross loading the net din loading estimated for the high conditions in sqb 3 50 mmol m 2 d 1 was similar to the average net loading of 4 0 mmol m 2 d 1 reported for elkhorn slough chapin et al 2004 indicating that the retention of the oceanic din input in sqb is more efficient than the retention in elkhorn slough n retention efficiency usually increases with residence time almroth rosell et al 2016 therefore the difference in retention efficiency is likely due to the fact that water residence time is larger in sqb because of its larger dimensions the ratio of the surface areas being 4 6 as compared to elkhorn slough with residence time of 5 days and surface area of 9 10 km2 largier et al 1997 n don imports decrease with upwelling intensification since deep waters that are upwelled to the surface are depleted in don letscher et al 2013 its contribution ranges between 17 under low to 9 and 10 respectively under high and ref scenarios fig 9 during low scenario upwelling strength is limited and upwelled waters are enriched in don inputs linked to the contribution of detritus rich waters produced locally letscher et al 2013 the western arm bfa is an area of oyster aquaculture fig 1 where the activity of this bivalve likely plays a significant role on n cycling through phytoplankton ingestion faeces and pseudofaeces pon production and din nh4 excretion sandoval gil et al 2016 in contrast in brazo sq where water exchange time is longer din supply from upwelled waters is very limited and so phytoplankton are scarce internal recycling in bfa and brazo sq is expected to be more intense it is possible that the decomposing macroalgal mats fig 1 contribute significant amounts of organic matter to the sediments ávila lópez et al 2017 tyler et al 2001 mentioned that in lagoonal systems with little riverine input the majority of new don most likely comes from autochthonous macroalgae production or from enriched groundwater in the three scenarios of simulation more than 50 70 of the primary production in the system is sustained by internal recycling of n fig 9 this percentage was comparable to that found in other studies for example flint et al 1986 indicated that 90 of the dissolved n supply for phytoplankton production is derived from sediments in the upper estuary of corpus christi whereas benthic regeneration supplies only 33 of the dissolved n required for primary production outside the barrier island in coastal waters tyler et al 2001 calculated that don was an important component 52 98 of the total dissolved n pool in hog island bay waters and made up the majority of the sediment n flux to the water column in the case of sqb residence time may be relatively low therefore the contribution of the n external supply tends to be higher compared to systems with higher residence times as expected phytoplankton and ulva spp respond to n availability increasing their n uptake when n availability increases during upwelling intensification high scenario n uptake rates for phytoplankton ranges between 2 70 3 50 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low and high scenario fig 9 within the range found by lara lara et al 1980 of 8 0 and 76 mmol c m 2 d 1 equivalent to variations of n incorporation rates between 1 20 and 12 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 zooplankton n uptake rates through phytoplankton grazing was 1 30 1 40 and 1 50 mmol n m 2 d 1 in the low ref and high scenarios respectively fig 9 in agreement with the values observed by olivieri and chavez 2000 of 1 30 mmol n m 2 d 1 at 5 m depth in monterey bay california nevertheless we do not have direct measurements of n zooplankton dynamics in sqb and our model was parameterized using values from the literature for other sites the availability of direct measurements would provide results that are more robust the ratio between n demand by n phytoplankton and n zooplankton was 2 2 and 2 3 under ref and high respectively indicating that consumers are limited by primary productivity the slight increase ratio with increasing upwelling suggests that consumers require more n than is supplied by primary productivity thus partially relying on recycling to fulfill their n uptake demand n uptakes rates for ulva ranges between 2 90 to 3 60 mmol m 2 d 1 observations show that under upwelling conditions increasing din inputs favour the accumulation of ulva spp zertuche gonzález et al 2009 that presents in sqb the common behaviour of opportunistic macroalgae mcglathery et al 2007 viaroli et al 2010 camacho ibar et al 2007 report values of 180 mmol n m 2 for ulva spp measured in spring early summer 2004 during the upwelling season when ulva spp biomass reaches its annual maximum aveytua alcázar et al 2008 our model confirms this response showing stocks of n ulva spp of 92 9 120 18 and 140 13 mmol n m 2 in low ref and high scenarios respectively fig 9 thus showing the influence of the oceanic nutrient inputs on its biomass confirming that ulva spp is a temporary n sink in agreement with observations by zertuche gonzález et al 2009 the n oysters stock shows a slight positive response to increasing n oceanic inputs in agreement with the results by emery et al 2016 who report no strong seasonal effects due to upwelling in fact the n oysters stock increasing by a factor of 1 3 in high scenario compared to low scenario fig 9 the model reproduces the effect of oyster filtration activity showing a decreasing phytoplankton concentration in bfa compared to brazo sq fig 8b and compared to the simulation performed without the oyster farm not shown recently a study of resource use of cultured oysters in sqb indicated that phytoplankton were most important as a food source at the oceanic site and its role decreased up the lagoon where ulva represented up to 50 of their diet emery et al 2016 the total n phytoplankton demand by oysters was 0 70 0 80 and 1 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low ref and high respectively fig 9 these rates are of the same order in other sites 1 0 5 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 as those reported by dumbauld et al 2009 removing oyster farms n accumulates in n phytoplankton and n zooplankton in our model the total n loading is balanced by exportation denitrification and biomass accumulation in primary producers denitrification accounts for a significant fraction of the n imbalance 43 under low and ref and 46 under high denitrification rates increase 1 5 2 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low and high respectively as n loading increases fig 9 so the sediments play an important role in the total n losses from the system 5 conclusions in this work an ecological model simulating the 3 d hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry was implemented in sqb a coastal lagoon located in the ccs the model reproduces the spatial and temporal evolution of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton oysters and ulva spp an n budget is calculated under different upwelling conditions also analysing how the variation in the oceanic exchanges and in particular changes in upwelling intensity and frequency also related to an scenario of climate change alters the biogeochemical processes of the sqb comparison with available data and observations confirm the model capability to reproduce the main features and variability within daily seasonal and interannual scales of both physical excellent capabilities and biogeochemical very good capabilities processes the model shows that upwelling intensity has a large influence on n availability and consumption within the bay and the response of primary and secondary producers the contribution of upwelling is of particular importance for systems like sqb which have limited inputs of nutrient of terrigenous origin and mainly rely on the oceanic inputs of organic matter and nutrients upwelled waters rich in phytoplankton and nutrients particularly no3 stimulate the autochthonous production which is limited by n availability in fact the differences between average value of major parameters observed in high and low upwelling conditions of about 25 for phytoplankton 20 for oyster and more than 40 for zooplankton this result can be used to set a range of expected variability in oyster production related to the expected variability in upwelling regimes thus contributing to a science based management of this important socio economic activity this can in turn be used to support the valuation of the ecosystem services related to the range of upwelling variability by relating the impacts of changes in upwelling regimes and n inputs to the local productivity in sqb and on the economic activities relying on it acknowledgments this work was

24909,san quintín bay sqb is a coastal lagoon fertilized with cold nutrient rich marine water that sustains the high productivity within the bay in particular during upwelling events the variations in the oceanic exchanges and in particular changes in upwelling intensity and frequency also related to climate change are expected to alter the biogeochemical processes in sqb and in the other coastal systems along the california current domain with possible impacts on the trophic state the extent of this influence is tested here developing and applying a 3 d coupled physical ecological model shyfem sqbfeem contrasted with data simulations included a reference scenario ref of typical upwelling conditions observed in spring 2004 and two scenarios of low low and high high upwelling conditions observed respectively during spring 2016 and 2005 we calculated the n budget for the three scenarios highlighting the response of primary and secondary producers including oyster potential production to the changes in upwelling intensity the model shows that upwelling intensity has a large influence on n availability and consumption within the bay and on the response of primary and secondary producers differences of the nitrogen stocks of primary and secondary producers under high and low upwelling conditions are of around 25 for phytoplankton 20 for oyster and more than 40 for zooplankton keywords nitrogen modelling coastal lagoon upwelling regimes shyfem sqbfeem 1 introduction eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus are biologically productive marine regions covering 1 of the ocean area but providing up to 20 of the world s capture fisheries see references in garcía reyes et al 2015 these systems i e california humboldt canary iberian and benguela currents provide ecosystem economic and recreational services to people living along their coasts and in their immediate hinterlands garcía reyes et al 2015 ecosystem productivity in coastal upwelling systems along with the goods and services they provide is threatened by global climate change bakun et al 2015 although the driving mechanism is still being actively debated previous studies appear to consistently predict that the upwelling in ebus has intensified and that the increasing trend will continue bakun et al 2015 xiu et al 2018 recent studies have suggested that the timing of upwelling has trended toward delayed and shorter upwelling seasons in the northern portion of the california current system ccs and longer upwelling seasons in the southern portion garcía reyes et al 2015 ibarra obando et al 2001 reported that the variability of biogeochemical dynamics in the southern region of the ccs along the baja california peninsula might change from year to year depending on inter annual processes such as el niño phenomenon during which changes occur such as the reduction in nutrient concentration and the delay of phytoplankton blooms variability in the biogeochemical properties of upwelled waters will influence the ecology and productivity in coastal systems during upwelling events which are particularly strong in the ccs in spring and summer nutrient rich shelf waters are transported by tidal advection into adjacent semi enclosed coastal ecosystems supplying dissolved inorganic nutrients hickey and banas 2003 brown and ozretich 2009 during relaxation periods after upwelling events shelf waters may also supply upwelling generated phytoplankton banas et al 2007 once the upwelling generated phytoplankton goes through remineralization it becomes an additional indirect source of nutrients for the estuarine primary producers camacho ibar et al 2003 and an additional energy source for the estuarine secondary producers including commercially produced species ruesink et al 2003 banas et al 2007 oceanic nutrient supply can be the most significant source of nutrients during the upwelling season in the ne pacific coast estuaries e g willapa bay yaquina bay tillamook bay and tomales bay where terrestrial supply of nutrients occurs throughout the year chapin et al 2004 hickey and banas 2003 brown and ozretich 2009 colbert and mcmanus 2003 smith and hollibaugh 1997 upwelling is the main source of nutrient supply for the baja california coastal lagoons located in the southern region of the california current domain e g san quintín bay ojo de liebre lagoon and magdalena bay that receive intermittent terrigenous supply as streams are completely dry except during heavy rains ibarra obando et al 2001 these systems are highly productive ibarra obando et al 2001 and strongly rely on nutrient supply from the ocean not only during the season of upwelling intensification but throughout the year probably through the internal recycling of nutrients when upwelling is at its minimum or absent even though ebus have been extensively studied for nearly a century and there is a vast body of literature examining climate impacts on upwelling ecosystems garcía reyes et al 2015 xiu et al 2018 studies addressing the impact of climate change on coastal lagoons and estuaries are scarce models are useful tools to address the pressing question of how natural systems will respond to future changes in climate chavez 2012 physical biogeochemical models have been used in ccs to understand the links between upwelling intensity and physical forcing wind and circulation variability fiechter et al 2018 arellano and rivas 2019 recently investigated the response of coastal upwelling to climate in ccs along the western coast of the baja california peninsula by modeling the effect of the variation in surface warming that increases the stratification of the water column and intensification of coastal alongshore winds previous model applications in the ccs also highlight the ecosystem sensitivity to changes in the onset of upwelling spring transition an early spring transition resulted in increasing vertical nutrient flux at the coast that propagates spatially and through the food web chenillat et al 2013 the objective of the present study is to assess the response of different upwelling regimes in san quintin bay sqb a coastal lagoon located in the ccs on the northwest coast of baja california peninsula mexico our understanding of local feedbacks between local biological production and biogeochemical properties of upwelling waters in coastal systems is scarce and needs to be addressed in order to highlight the possible impacts on the ecology and socio economic components at the local level site specific high resolution models are needed to address the specificity of restricted and shallow water environments previous model applications in sqb focused on the 2 d water circulation melaku canu et al 2016 and on the biogeochemistry exploring the upwelling effect in 1 d aveytua alcazar et al 2008 but a fully coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model was missing here we explored the spatial temporal variability of the trophic properties of the bay computing the nutrient stocks and nutrient fluxes among the components of the lower trophic web in order to perform this analysis we adapted a finite element ecological model which was originally developed for the lagoon of venice the venice lagoon finite element ecological model velfeem umgiesser et al 2003 melaku canu et al 2001 2003 by integrating an ecological water quality module and a fine element 3 d hydrodynamic model based shallow water hydrodynamic finite element model shyfem umgiesser et al 2004 more in detail in order to capture relevant trophic features of the sqb here we added new modules to velfeem for simulation of the hereafter called sqbfeem san quintin bay finite element ecological model 2 study area san quintin bay is a coastal lagoon of mediterranean type largier et al 1997 located in the ccs on the northwest coast of the baja california peninsula mexico 30 27 n and 116 00 w fig 1 sqb is a moderately hypersaline system throughout the year camacho ibar et al 2003 and 2007 with salinity levels increasing from the ocean inlet toward the inner regions this lagoon is y shaped and covers an area of approximately 42 km2 with an eastern arm known as brazo san quintin brazo sq and a western arm known as bahia falsa bfa narrow channels running in the bay have a maximum depth of 5 15 m while the rest of the area has an average depth of 2 m this temperate region of the baja california peninsula has a mean annual precipitation of 150 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 1400 mm rainfall is restricted to the period of november march aguirre muñoz et al 2001 inputs of water and other terrigenous materials from the san simon stream to the lagoon only occur in years of above average rainfall most of the inhabitants of the catchment which is a rural area live away from the sqb tourism is one of the main economic activities in the area but it is still limited and represents a minor indirect source of nutrients to the bay an important economic activity in sqb is aquaculture of the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas this activity is restricted by regulation to bfa fig 1 where it presently covers around the 300 ha of the shoal areas 7 of the total bay area and represents a relevant export of organic production therefore of nutrients from sqb camacho ibar et al 2003 pointed out that sqb is a net sink of phytoplankton imported from the ocean in particular during the upwelling periods farfán and álvarez borrego 1983 phytoplankton in sqb typically decreases from the mouth toward the inner arms of the lagoon and during the intense upwelling season the phytoplankton community composition is very dynamic with diatoms dominating early in an upwelling event and dinoflagellates dominating after the diatom bloom millan nuñez et al 1982 gracia escobar et al 2014 the dominant primary producers apart from microalgae include the seagrass zostera marina and the macroalgae ulva spp zertuche gonzález et al 2009 the eelgrass covers 40 of the lagoon and forms particularly dense meadows in the inner arms ward et al 2003 ibarra obando et al 2007 reported an average annual foliar biomass of zostera marina in sqb of 75 g dw m 2 with annual maxima ranging from 80 to 350 g dw m 2 and an average in the summer autumn maxima of 150 g dw m 2 ulva spp is present all year around but its biomass shows a seasonal variation with a spring maximum ward et al 2003 zertuche gonzález et al 2009 reported biomasses of 350 g dw m 2 of ulva spp in sqb in spring summer 2004 and 2005 and 65 g dw m 2 in late winter 2005 ulvaspp biomass has increased in recent years zertuche gonzález et al 2009 competing with zostera marina in particular close to the sqb inlet ward et al 2003 3 materials and methods 3 1 the model implementation in the san quintin bay the water quality model hereon called sqbfeem finite element ecological model for the san quintin bay has been developed coupling the finite element hydrodynamical model already successfully applied to the sqb in a 2d version melaku canu et al 2016 to a biogeochemical model by significantly expanding the work already made in veelfem the finite element ecological model for the lagoon of venice umgiesser et al 2003 melaku canu et al 2003 in order to incorporate major ecological processes that were not included in velfeem but are needed for a proper representation of the sqb biogeochemistry in particular we added three new modules for nitrogen n carbon c and phosphorus p cycling through macroalgal mats oyster culture farms and the detritus stock in the sediment following the velfeem approach we used an operator splitting technique as described in umgiesser et al 2003 accordingly the overall variation of any state variable is split into the sum of two contributions the physical driven term and the biological driven term the hydrodynamic model resolves the momentum and continuity equation to update the current velocities and water levels then the physical temperature and salinity and biogeochemical variables i e nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton detritus are transported advected and diffused all the variables including ulva and oysters which are not transported are then updated performing biogeochemical and ecological transformations the shyfem model uses a finite element discretization to solve the hydrodynamic equations and a semi implicit time stepping algorithm and therefore it is suitable for the hydrodynamic characterization of shallow basins with a complex morphology including channels and tidal flats umgiesser et al 2003 2004 2014 melaku canu et al 2003 2012 solidoro et al 2004 adopting a staggered approach the water levels are described by linear form functions defined on the nodes intersections of the grid while the velocities are described by constant form functions over each element which corresponds to the definition of the velocities in the centre of the elements umgiesser et al 2004 the sqb domain has been represented by a finite element grid made of 1481 nodes vertices and 2633 triangular elements varying in shape and dimension from 7 m along the channels and at the inlet to 35 m in the shallower areas fig 1 melaku canu et al 2016 the water column is discretized into 8 vertical layers with uniform thickness of 2 m the sqbfeem model follows the evolution of a set of variables which characterize the state of the water column and of the surface of sediments which hosts the benthic communities the state of the water and sediment is defined by ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 phosphate po4 dissolved organic nitrogen don particulate organic nitrogen pon dissolved organic phosphorus dop particulate organic phosphorus pop carbonaceous biogeochemical oxygen demand cbod dissolved oxygen do phytoplankton zooplankton crassostrea gigas and ulva spp fig 2 in the present work the model is refined by introducing a sedimentation module representing the dynamics of organic matter that settles from the water column to the bottom layer where it is mineralised and eventually resuspended the inclusion of these processes into the parameterization of biogeochemical cycles is of great importance since this bay is a shallow environment and both re suspension of sediment and release of nutrients from the sediment can be high and significantly affect the water quality aveytua alcázar et al 2008 ávila lópez et al 2016 the limiting factors are computed following the standard formulations the michaelis menten monod for nutrient limitation the steele formulation for the limitation due to light intensity and an exponential relation for temperature since oyster aquaculture of crassostrea gigas may significantly contribute to the nutrient dynamics in the sqb ecosystem sandoval gil et al 2016 the new module representing the oysters stock has been introduced fig 2 individual filtration assimilation excretion and ingestion were introduced as functions of body size temperature and food quantity solidoro et al 2000 chapelle et al 2000 pastres et al 2001 melaku canu et al 2011 the model was initialized introducing the 25 in m 2 of an average size of 20 mm distributed across bfa fig 1 and introducing a growth term and an exponential death rate according to zertuche gonzález et al 2009 ulva spp became quite invasive in the last decade in sqb having also replaced extensive surfaces of eelgrass beds its presence was hypothesized to have been triggered by the introduction of oyster cultivations according to the same authors ulva may play an important role as temporary sink and source of c n and p in sqb due to its large biomass and to its capacity to capture these elements and to release them during the degradation phase ávila lópez et al 2017 aveytua alcázar et al 2008 report that no3 concentrations in the water column are more sensitive to ulva variations than zostera in sqb on the other hand the temporal variability of zostera marina biomass is more sensitive to light availability than no3 and ulva spp is more sensitive to no3 availability than light this suggests that it is more important to included ulva in our model therefore we introduced a new ulva spp module fig 2 dynamically simulating the temporal evolution of biomass and of the intratissual n in ulva spp based on the formulations given in solidoro et al 1997 the module parameterization is listed in table a1 the model results have been statistically tested by calculating an index of performance allen et al 2007 which takes into account the explained variance r2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency me the percentage bias model pbias and the ratio between the standard deviation of the data and the standard deviation of the model rsd the index of performance identifies 4 levels which are categorized as excellent me 0 65 pbias 10 very good me 0 65 0 5 pbias 10 20 good me 0 5 0 2 pbias 20 40 and poor me 0 2 pbias 40 3 2 model set up a 1 year run with a time step of 5 min was performed for 2004 in order to test the model and to tune the model parameters in addition in order to explore the effect of variation in upwelling intensity on the sqb biogeochemistry we performed two additional runs for two years 2005 and 2016 characterized respectively by intense high and weak low upwelling conditions we therefore focused the comparative analysis on the effects of upwelling changes on the n budget of sqb in spring when the upwelling intensification occurs these three years were selected based on nutrient data

seawater temperature salinity and nutrient concentration fig 1 available for 10 days in spring may june and 14 days in summer september october 2004 physical variables are consistent with those obtained with the validated 2 d model melaku canu et al 2016 the modeled currents show satisfactory agreement with adcp data already presented in melaku canu et al 2016 measured at stations a and d shown in fig 1 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 87 and 0 8 respectively for the two stations a and d in spring water temperature and salinity fields presented the expected pattern with a positive gradient from the mouth toward the internal area at the heads of bfa and brazo sq with a difference of 4 c for temperature and 0 8 for salinity between these two extremes the comparison of modelled and observed vertical profiles confirms the occurrence of well mixed profiles structure in the bay a weak spring vertical structure less than 10 of variation was observed at station 6 close to the mouth of the bay which is the deepest part of the system the mixed vertical structure of the sqb was already reported by other authors millan nuñez et al 1982 and ribas ribas et al 2011 as expected the simulated annual evolution of nutrients no3 nh4 and po4 phytoplankton and zooplankton shows a maximum in late spring and early summer and a minimum in winter and early spring in accordance with the typical biogeochemical dynamics governed by upwelling observed in central california chenillat et al 2013 and pennington and chavez 2000 an example of such annual evolution is shown for station 28 in fig 3 having a residence time of 4 days melaku canu et al 2016 this station is quite rapidly responding to the ocean physical dynamics and nutrient supply but is still influenced by the local dynamics of oyster macroalgae and phytoplankton growth all of which are abundant during upwelling events which occur through the year but are more intense during spring and early summer upwelled water from the ccs is transported from the shelf into sqb the penetration of upwelled water into the arms varies according to the combination of upwelling intensity and tidal amplitude melaku canu et al 2016 ribas ribas et al 2011 the simulations show that when upwelling events occur tidal pumping fig 3 induces a large injection of no3 into sqb this induces in station 28 higher nutrient concentration during the spring tide when no3 reaches maximum values of 7 μm and lower concentration during the neap tide when the no3 maximum reaches only 4 μm fig 3 the spatial and temporal comparison fig 4 a b c and d show good agreement between averaged observed and simulated values the tendency of no3 to decrease towards the interior of the lagoon in both seasons fig 4a indicates that no3 is consumed within sqb no3 average values in bfa were slightly lower than at the mouth of the bay due to the limited exchange with the ocean computed with the average water residence times of 4 days in brazo sq where the average water residence time is 11 days the decrease in no3 concentration with respect to the mouth of the bay is even higher confirming previous results camacho ibar et al 2003 and 2007 ribas ribas et al 2011 po4 fig 4d shows a different pattern than no3 increasing from the mouth to the inner parts of the bay confirming that this system is a net generator of this nutrient as a result of its addition from remineralization of imported organic matter over its consumption by the local primary producers camacho ibar et al 2003 and 2007 in summer the persistence of nh4 in the water column which is already depleted in no3 st 28 fig 3 is explained by the remineralization of the organic matter mainly occurring in the sediments ibarra obando et al 2004 report that sediments of sqb can provide nh4 to the water column at rates as high as 2 7 mmol nh4 m 2d 1 as a result of the first step of organic matter degradation the model reproduces the net increase of don in the inner parts of sqb fig 4d in agreement with observations reported by rodriguez cardozo 2004 that found in the internal arms average values of don of 16 μm the index of performance has been computed by comparing the average values of salinity water temperature no3 nh4 po4 don and phytoplankton measured at the 14 stations of the bay in 2004 fig 1 with their corresponding average modeled values extracted for the corresponding sampling stations at the corresponding sampling times a large gradient between the ocean stations and the inner arms of the bay is observed in agreement with the observations camacho ibar et al 2003 table 3 summarizes the statistics for each variable calculated on spatial variability over the observed data period may june 2004 as indicated by the r2 values more than 70 of spatial variability of all variables salinity seawater temperature no3 nh4 po4 don and phytoplankton can be reproduced by the model indicating that the model captures the general trends in these variables the me values indicate that the model performance was excellent to simulate salinity and water temperature 0 65 very good to simulate po4 no3 and nh4 and good to simulate don and phytoplankton the model performance based on pbias was excellent for salinity water temperature po4 and don very good for nh4 and phytoplankton and good for no3 the global model performance was explored by plotting r2 vs rsd r2 and rsd should be close to one of the values used to calculate the index of performance confirming a good skill for all the variables with the exception of don for which more accurate boundary data are required to adequately validate the model in the eastern arm water exchange time is longer dissolved inorganic nitrogen din supply from upwelled waters is very limited thus phytoplankton and ulva spp are little abundant and zostera marina biomass is dominant thus internal recycling in this area must be more intense then sqbfeem requires an explicit module of seagrass which should increase don concentrations to more realistic values salinity and water temperature followed by concentration of po4 and no3 show the best skill data limit did not allow us to further tune the model parameters to improve model calibration the model slightly underestimates the variance of don and nh4 while overestimates the phytoplankton and no3 fig 5 this is possibly related to the higher uncertainty and variability in the open boundary data of phytoplankton respect to the nutrients which are less variable model outputs of no3 have been compared with the available data collected at 14 stations 3 30 fig 1 sampled in spring 22 26 30 of may and 2 5 8 of june and autumn 14 17 19 22 24 28 of september and 1 4 11 14 of october the model was also able to reproduce the short term variability showing a good agreement with the measured values of no3 as shown for the 3 stations 22 26 and 19 located respectively close to the sea inlet st 22 in bfa st 26 and brazo sq st 19 fig 6 the short term evolution of spring and autumn is clearly influenced by upwelling conditions that presented a stronger pulse in the first part of the spring days between 22 of may and 12 of june and less variable upwelling conditions during the autumn 4 2 response to upwelling variability the response of n cycling and of the primary and secondary producers to an increase and decrease in ocean derived n loading induced by upwelling was explored by comparing the results of the ref simulation with the low and high scenarios in ref scenario no3 is the dominant nutrient at the mouth of the lagoon in may june average concentration of 6 28 0 68 μm and september october average concentration of 1 36 0 20 μm fig 4a while nh4 and don are dominant in particular during spring and summer in the inner part of the lagoon fig 4b d nh4 concentrations are in average 2 70 0 18 and 2 40 0 23 μm in bfa and 2 09 0 08 and 2 42 0 23 μm in brazo sq in may june and september october respectively the average of don concentrations in may june and september october 2004 are respectively 8 0 0 63 and 7 0 0 45 μm in bfa and 9 40 1 10 and 11 40 0 50 μm in brazo sq mcglathery et al 2007 indicate that it is common for don content to be greater than the din content in semi enclosed coastal ecosystems and berman and bronk 2003 results also indicate that the observed don concentrations of sqb typically greater than 5 μm and often greater than 15 μm rodriguez cardozo 2004 unpublished results are similar to those observed in this type of coastal systems fig 7 presents the time averaged values of no3 modeled results at the samplings stations fig 1 for the three scenarios during the spring upwelling conditions no3 concentrations at the mouth of the bay st 3 to st 8 are in agreement with the boundary inputs of respectively 3 6 7 0 and 11 0 μm for ref low and high scenarios no3 boundary concentration in high scenario is three times that of low scenario indicating that the supply of nutrients from the ocean to estuarine systems along the ne pacific coast of america can have intense interannual variations camacho ibar et al 2003 ribas ribas et al 2011 the spatial gradient of no3 highlights its ocean origins as also confirmed by its inverse relationship with salinity box in fig 7 in the high scenario no3 concentrations at the mouth of the bay were in average persistently above 10 μm from st 3 22 abruptly decreasing towards the inner end of brazo sq the low scenario presents a lower no3 gradient from the mouth of the bay with average concentration of no3 of 3 6 μm fig 7 indicating that the no3 fluxes are minimum during weak upwelling these results are also in agreement with previous analysis and measurements conducted during weak upwelling farfán and álvarez borrego 1983 camacho ibar et al 2003 maps in fig 8 show the spring average values of no3 fig 8a and phytoplankton fig 8b of ref scenario and their corresponding anomalies in respect to low fig 8c d and high spring upwelling scenarios fig 8e f average values have been computed by averaging the model outputs between 1 april and 30 june 2004 the anomalies have been calculated at each point of the domain as the difference between the values of the scenario low or high in respect to the corresponding ref value the anomaly shown in fig 8e for the high scenario highlights an increase in no3 concentration associated to the increasing upwelling intensity due to the stronger alongshore winds in the ocean adjacent to sqb registered during 2005 table 1 the anomaly is higher at the inlet decreasing slightly toward the farther end of the bfa and brazo sq with values at the inlets up to 14 μm 30 higher than the maximum concentrations of 10 μm observed in ref scenario the opposite feature is observed in the low scenario which presents a negative no3 anomaly of low scenario fig 7c throughout the lagoon with highest values at the inlet associated to the decreased upwelling intensity and lowest towards the brazo sq smith and hollibaugh 1997 mention that the contributions of organic carbon from the adjacent ocean to tomales bay california control the seasonality of the net production of the ecosystem the phytoplankton primary production due to upwelling in the ccs supplies labile organic carbon that is oxidized within the bay which induces a net heterotrophic condition similar to tomales bay sqb is also a net heterotrophic system where excess respiration is subsidized by the supply of particulate organic carbon from the adjacent sea camacho ibar et al 2003 the ref scenario simulation shows a decrease of phytoplankton from the mouth to brazo sq fig 8b in agreement with millan nuñez et al 1982 observing for chl a a decrease from 5 mg m 3 at the mouth to around 1 mg m 3 at the inner ends of the lagoon the phytoplankton anomaly of low scenario fig 8d is negative throughout the lagoon with highest values toward the brazo sq and around the oyster farming area in bfa fig 8b accordingly in high scenario fig 8f a positive phytoplankton anomaly throughout the lagoon is observed and gradually decreasing at the farther ends of brazo sq the positive phytoplankton anomaly in high scenario fig 8f exhibits a correlated response to increased nutrient input in the mouth area st 3 22 in agreement with observations ribas ribas et al 2011 predicted biomass of ulva and oyster are sensitive to the upwelling scenarios ulva spp and oyster biomass increase respectively about 35 and 20 under high upwelling scenario compared to the low one 4 3 nitrogen mass budget a n mass budget was carried out by computing the n fluxes and stocks of the sqbfeem model variables fig 2 under ref low and high upwelling scenarios for the spring period during upwelling events sensitivity tests were made to explore how the model responds when using the same physical forcing of the ref scenario but the boundary conditions of the high scenario the analysis showed that 35 of the total variation of no3 stock was related to changes in physical forcing n stocks and fluxes were computed by daily averaging the model outputs of no3 nh4 don phytoplankton zooplankton ulva spp and oysters and of their internal fluxes the stock estimation was done by using stoichiometric relationships atkinson and smith 1983 dame et al 1989 hecky et al 1993 to convert the model variables into n units while fluxes were obtained by computing and aggregating the source sink terms of the model variables fig 9 shows the average values over the spring period of the n stocks of the 8 aggregated variables and of their fluxes n is imported into sqb from the ocean in different forms n no3 n nh4 n don n phytoplankton and n zooplankton fig 9 n no3 is the biggest source of n increasing with the increase in upwelling intensity total n no3 loading from the ocean into the lagoon increased by a factor of 1 5 from low to high and 1 2 from ref to high scenario ranging from 2 0 3 5 mmol n m 2 d 1 fig 9 n no3 contributes 65 and 80 respectively of the total inputs of n in the low and high scenarios in the ref scenario n phytoplankton represents 10 of the total imports of n this value decreases when upwelling intensifies 6 high the decrease in the contribution of phytoplankton import with upwelling intensification is due to the fact that phytoplankton biomass in the coastal upwelling waters is not only controlled by upwelling intensity but by a combination of upwelling intensity and the duration of relaxation periods after upwelling events according to wilkerson et al 2006 the ideal conditions for biomass accumulation are a combination of medium intensity upwelling and 4 to 5 days of relaxation in other words intense and persistent upwelling conditions such as those represented by our high scenario may allow for high amounts of no3 to be advected but physically damps the aggregation of phytoplankton cells the total fluxes of ocean n loading into the sqb considering all sources i e phytoplankton zooplankton don no3 nh4 ranges from 3 50 to 4 40 mmol n m 2 d 1 in the low and high scenarios thus increasing by a factor of 1 30 total n exports increase by a factor of 1 50 from 2 00 3 20 mmol n m 2 d 1 between low and high scenarios and thus the imbalance between imports and exports increases with upwelling intensification moreover advective n ocean loading exceeds the exports to the ocean and the lost through denitrification as upwelling intensifies n availability increases and a larger fraction of internal productivity is sustained by external inputs fig 9 the gross total imports of n no3 into sqb estimated in this study are similar to the oceanic inputs into other estuarine systems influenced by upwelling along the california current domain brown and ozretich 2009 reported an average gross input of n no3 into yaquina bay oregon usa of 3 3 105 mol d 1 during the dry season in the 1997 2003 period an estimate of gross import of no3 1 0 105 mol d 1 is obtained for elkhorn slough using the tidal prism volume 5 7 106 m3 and the average n no3 concentration in water during flooding tide 18 8 μm reported by chapin et al 2004 when gross imports are normalized to the corresponding surface area even the highest rate of oceanic n no3 supply into sqb 3 50 mmol m 2 d 1 is 3 and 4 times lower than the loading into elkhorn slough 11 mmol m 2 d 1 and yaquina bay 18 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively despite the absence of direct terrestrial loadings loadings of n no3 from the ocean to sqb are similar or even higher than loadings of n from land to some other shallow coastal lagoons subjected to low or moderate anthropogenic eutrophication for example other lagoons of similar size such as ria formosa portugal 58 km2 golfe de fos france 42 km2 and bassin d arcachon france 155 km2 receive n no3 loadings of 0 50 1 50 mmol m 2 d 1 tett et al 2003 de wit et al 2001 which is smaller than the oceanic n no3 loading to sqb being double in the low scenario and 4 times higher during the high scenario this natural high loading of n from the ocean to sqb explains its high productivity and is a good example of the strong control of upwelling on primary productivity of coastal lagoons and estuaries along the ccs particularly during the dry season despite the difference in gross loading the net din loading estimated for the high conditions in sqb 3 50 mmol m 2 d 1 was similar to the average net loading of 4 0 mmol m 2 d 1 reported for elkhorn slough chapin et al 2004 indicating that the retention of the oceanic din input in sqb is more efficient than the retention in elkhorn slough n retention efficiency usually increases with residence time almroth rosell et al 2016 therefore the difference in retention efficiency is likely due to the fact that water residence time is larger in sqb because of its larger dimensions the ratio of the surface areas being 4 6 as compared to elkhorn slough with residence time of 5 days and surface area of 9 10 km2 largier et al 1997 n don imports decrease with upwelling intensification since deep waters that are upwelled to the surface are depleted in don letscher et al 2013 its contribution ranges between 17 under low to 9 and 10 respectively under high and ref scenarios fig 9 during low scenario upwelling strength is limited and upwelled waters are enriched in don inputs linked to the contribution of detritus rich waters produced locally letscher et al 2013 the western arm bfa is an area of oyster aquaculture fig 1 where the activity of this bivalve likely plays a significant role on n cycling through phytoplankton ingestion faeces and pseudofaeces pon production and din nh4 excretion sandoval gil et al 2016 in contrast in brazo sq where water exchange time is longer din supply from upwelled waters is very limited and so phytoplankton are scarce internal recycling in bfa and brazo sq is expected to be more intense it is possible that the decomposing macroalgal mats fig 1 contribute significant amounts of organic matter to the sediments ávila lópez et al 2017 tyler et al 2001 mentioned that in lagoonal systems with little riverine input the majority of new don most likely comes from autochthonous macroalgae production or from enriched groundwater in the three scenarios of simulation more than 50 70 of the primary production in the system is sustained by internal recycling of n fig 9 this percentage was comparable to that found in other studies for example flint et al 1986 indicated that 90 of the dissolved n supply for phytoplankton production is derived from sediments in the upper estuary of corpus christi whereas benthic regeneration supplies only 33 of the dissolved n required for primary production outside the barrier island in coastal waters tyler et al 2001 calculated that don was an important component 52 98 of the total dissolved n pool in hog island bay waters and made up the majority of the sediment n flux to the water column in the case of sqb residence time may be relatively low therefore the contribution of the n external supply tends to be higher compared to systems with higher residence times as expected phytoplankton and ulva spp respond to n availability increasing their n uptake when n availability increases during upwelling intensification high scenario n uptake rates for phytoplankton ranges between 2 70 3 50 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low and high scenario fig 9 within the range found by lara lara et al 1980 of 8 0 and 76 mmol c m 2 d 1 equivalent to variations of n incorporation rates between 1 20 and 12 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 zooplankton n uptake rates through phytoplankton grazing was 1 30 1 40 and 1 50 mmol n m 2 d 1 in the low ref and high scenarios respectively fig 9 in agreement with the values observed by olivieri and chavez 2000 of 1 30 mmol n m 2 d 1 at 5 m depth in monterey bay california nevertheless we do not have direct measurements of n zooplankton dynamics in sqb and our model was parameterized using values from the literature for other sites the availability of direct measurements would provide results that are more robust the ratio between n demand by n phytoplankton and n zooplankton was 2 2 and 2 3 under ref and high respectively indicating that consumers are limited by primary productivity the slight increase ratio with increasing upwelling suggests that consumers require more n than is supplied by primary productivity thus partially relying on recycling to fulfill their n uptake demand n uptakes rates for ulva ranges between 2 90 to 3 60 mmol m 2 d 1 observations show that under upwelling conditions increasing din inputs favour the accumulation of ulva spp zertuche gonzález et al 2009 that presents in sqb the common behaviour of opportunistic macroalgae mcglathery et al 2007 viaroli et al 2010 camacho ibar et al 2007 report values of 180 mmol n m 2 for ulva spp measured in spring early summer 2004 during the upwelling season when ulva spp biomass reaches its annual maximum aveytua alcázar et al 2008 our model confirms this response showing stocks of n ulva spp of 92 9 120 18 and 140 13 mmol n m 2 in low ref and high scenarios respectively fig 9 thus showing the influence of the oceanic nutrient inputs on its biomass confirming that ulva spp is a temporary n sink in agreement with observations by zertuche gonzález et al 2009 the n oysters stock shows a slight positive response to increasing n oceanic inputs in agreement with the results by emery et al 2016 who report no strong seasonal effects due to upwelling in fact the n oysters stock increasing by a factor of 1 3 in high scenario compared to low scenario fig 9 the model reproduces the effect of oyster filtration activity showing a decreasing phytoplankton concentration in bfa compared to brazo sq fig 8b and compared to the simulation performed without the oyster farm not shown recently a study of resource use of cultured oysters in sqb indicated that phytoplankton were most important as a food source at the oceanic site and its role decreased up the lagoon where ulva represented up to 50 of their diet emery et al 2016 the total n phytoplankton demand by oysters was 0 70 0 80 and 1 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low ref and high respectively fig 9 these rates are of the same order in other sites 1 0 5 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 as those reported by dumbauld et al 2009 removing oyster farms n accumulates in n phytoplankton and n zooplankton in our model the total n loading is balanced by exportation denitrification and biomass accumulation in primary producers denitrification accounts for a significant fraction of the n imbalance 43 under low and ref and 46 under high denitrification rates increase 1 5 2 0 mmol n m 2 d 1 under low and high respectively as n loading increases fig 9 so the sediments play an important role in the total n losses from the system 5 conclusions in this work an ecological model simulating the 3 d hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry was implemented in sqb a coastal lagoon located in the ccs the model reproduces the spatial and temporal evolution of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton oysters and ulva spp an n budget is calculated under different upwelling conditions also analysing how the variation in the oceanic exchanges and in particular changes in upwelling intensity and frequency also related to an scenario of climate change alters the biogeochemical processes of the sqb comparison with available data and observations confirm the model capability to reproduce the main features and variability within daily seasonal and interannual scales of both physical excellent capabilities and biogeochemical very good capabilities processes the model shows that upwelling intensity has a large influence on n availability and consumption within the bay and the response of primary and secondary producers the contribution of upwelling is of particular importance for systems like sqb which have limited inputs of nutrient of terrigenous origin and mainly rely on the oceanic inputs of organic matter and nutrients upwelled waters rich in phytoplankton and nutrients particularly no3 stimulate the autochthonous production which is limited by n availability in fact the differences between average value of major parameters observed in high and low upwelling conditions of about 25 for phytoplankton 20 for oyster and more than 40 for zooplankton this result can be used to set a range of expected variability in oyster production related to the expected variability in upwelling regimes thus contributing to a science based management of this important socio economic activity this can in turn be used to support the valuation of the ecosystem services related to the range of upwelling variability by relating the impacts of changes in upwelling regimes and n inputs to the local productivity in sqb and on the economic activities relying on it acknowledgments this work was
