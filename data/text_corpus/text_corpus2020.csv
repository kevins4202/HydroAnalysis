10100,the study proposed a new crop water stress indicator the mean value of gaussian distribution of excess green index for maize canopy mgdexg within an rgb image a series of rgb images were collected in a maize field under varying levels of deficit irrigation during 2013 2015 and 2016 growth seasons in northern colorado to evaluate the sensitivity of mgdexg to maize water status canopy temperature canopy to air temperature difference crop water stress index cwsi leaf water potential and sap flow were used as water status references the results show that mgdexg distinguished different levels of deficit irrigation treatments well and responded to the release and reimposition of deficit irrigation the mgdexg showed a significant correlation p 0 01 to different water stress references especially the coefficient of determination r2 with cwsi was 0 63 n 59 for 2013 0 80 n 90 for 2015 and 0 80 n 50 for 2016 in addition among the three tc based water stress indicators the relationship between mgdexg and cwsi was the most robust with the least annual changes of slope and intercept the robust relationship between mgdexg and cwsi could also show that mgdexg was resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field significant correlations p 0 01 were found between mgdexg and leaf water potential with r2 of 0 85 and 0 87 for 2013 and 2015 and between mgdexg and sap flow in 2015 r2 0 62 mgdexg relies only on the distribution of crop pixels within an rgb image and could be calculated easily so it could be cheaper or easier to popularize than other crop water stress indicators in practice overall our results show that mgdexg could be successfully used as a maize water stress indicator in the future more field experiments are needed to further explore the changes of mgdexg with different scale and spatial resolution of rgb images and to evaluate mgdexg for specific climate and crop varieties keywords rgb images canopy temperature crop water stress index deficit irrigation expectation maximization algorithm 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the major water user at global scale accounting for about 70 of the total water withdrawal dubois 2011 garrido rubio et al 2020 about 40 of the world s food supply is produced from only 20 of the arable land garces restrepo et al 2007 currently world population is projected to increase from 6 9 to 9 1 billion in 2050 united nations 2009 global food security is endangered due to the accelerated population growth and long periods of drought with decreasing projected rainfall banerjee and krishnan 2020 ruilin 2013 leading to the requirement for informed irrigation management while maintaining or improving quality and yield of crop gautam and pagay 2020 the timely and precise assessment of crop water status could help us to achieve these goals the traditional soil and crop physiological parameter based water status detecting methods have the disadvantages of time consuming laborious and restricted because of the heterogeneous conditions within the field ben gal et al 2009 li et al 2010 because it is closely related to transpiration rate canopy temperature tc has long been used as the indirect crop water stress indicator tanner 1963 when crop is suffering from water stress it will reduce transpiration rate resulting in the higher temperature compared to non stressed crop gates 1968 however except for the water supply the field micro meteorological condition also has influence on tc clawson et al 1989 gerhards et al 2018 the empirical crop water stress index cwsi was first established by idso et al 1981 to quantify crop water status based on tc shortly afterward jackson et al 1981 proposed the theoretical cwsi method based on energy balance both of the two cwsi calculation methods have been successfully used to relate leaf water potential lwp costa et al 2020 and sap flow han et al 2018 and to schedule irrigation emekli et al 2007 osroosh et al 2015 the key of calculating cwsi is the establishment of two baselines of canopy to air temperature difference tc ta the non water stressed baseline nwsb and the non transpiration baseline ntb compared to the theoretical method the empirical cwsi method has the advantage of simple calculation and requires only two other parameters air temperature and relative humidity specifically the nwsb of the empirical method is relationship between tc ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd estimated by linear regression analysis likewise the ntb is the relationship between tc ta and vapor pressure gradient estimated by linear regression analysis gardner et al 1981a gardner et al 1981b give details about development of these two baselines however the additional parameters required by the calculation of cwsi baselines may restrict its application by farmers testi et al 2008 to simplify the calculation of cwsi a method was proposed to use wet and dry reference surfaces according to jones 1999 maes and steppe 2012 petroleum jelly is adopted to cover one or both sides of crop leaf surface for about 30 min to obtain the dry reference target as for the wet target a thin layer of water is sprayed on one or both sides of crop leaf surface before measuring the locations of reference surfaces within the canopy and field need to be selected and designed carefully because of these challenges in calculating cwsi some researchers propose to estimate crop water stress solely based on tc for example degrees above non stressed index which is the tc difference between stressed and non stressed crop was proposed by taghvaeian et al 2014 the limitation of the index is the requirement of a well irrigated treatment instead of using tc of non stressed plant the 28 c maize was used as the non stressed tc threshold in the calculation of degrees above canopy threshold dejonge et al 2015 standard deviation of canopy temperature ctsd is a crop water stress indicator based on the distribution of tc within a thermal image han et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 it is based on the principle that crop transpiration rate has influence on the differences between temperature of sunlit and shaded leaves within the canopy more direct radiation should be received by sunlit leaves than shaded leaves resulting in higher temperature for sunlit leaves when non transpiration occurs the maximum temperature difference between sunlit and shaded leaves will be observed when water is available for transpiration sunlit leaves of the canopy will have higher transpiration rate than shaded leaves irmak et al 2008 therefore with the increase of transpiration rate the temperature difference between sunlit and shaded canopy portions will decrease because of more cooling effect on sunlit leaves to assess the performance of abovementioned indices for estimating water stress dejonge et al 2015 han et al 2016 taghvaeian et al 2014 cwsi lwp and other classical water stress indicators were adopted as crop water stress references significant correlations were found between degrees above non stressed and lwp with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 66 n 20 and between ctsd and cwsi with r2 of 0 54 n 48 instead of using tc alone to measure water stress other stress symptoms e g leaf wilting and the decrease in chlorophyll concentration could be detected by using spectral characteristics ballester et al 2018 in several studies the photochemical reflectance index gamon et al 1992 has been successfully tested as a crop water stress indicator berni et al 2009 rossini et al 2015 zarco tejada et al 2013 in addition the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index haboudane et al 2002 zarco tejada et al 2004 and green normalized difference vegetation index gitelson and merzlyak 1998 have also been successfully used to measure crop water stress related physiological characteristics baluja et al 2012 espinoza et al 2017 since the distribution of temperature within crop canopy and the spectral changes of crop in certain bands e g vegetation indices could be successfully used to estimate crop water status the distribution of vegetation index within crop canopy could also be used as a crop water status indicator to verify the above assumption choosing the appropriate vegetation index and estimation method of crop distribution are two prerequisites rgb images can capture a great variety of situations especially in field conditions philipp and rath 2002 the segmentation of crop from background is often accomplished based on a vegetation index which is derived from rgb images among these vegetation indices the excessive green index exg has been widely used to segment crop from background guerrero et al 2012 m woebbecke et al 1995 similar to ctsd based on the assumption that the temperature distribution of crop and background follow the gaussian mixture model gmm han et al 2016 the exg distribution of crop and background could also be assumed as a gmm with two components liu et al 2012 the combination of vegetation index and gmm has been successfully employed to estimate crop canopy cover li et al 2018 song et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge there is no report on estimating crop water status by the combination of exg and gmm the goal of this study was to investigate the potential of using rgb images to estimate water status based on the distribution of vegetation index of maize canopy it was hypothesized that exg distribution extracted from rgb images follows gmm with two components one is gaussian distribution of background and the other is gaussian distribution of maize canopy the mean value of gaussian distribution of exg for maize canopy mgdexg could be used to estimate water status three specific objectives were 1 to analyze the response of mgdexg to different levels of deficit irrigation 2 to analyze the relationship between mgdexg and tc based water stress indicators tc tc ta and cwsi and 3 to analyze the relationship between mgdexg and maize physiological water stress parameters lwp and sap flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and management the study was conducted during 2013 2016 maize growth seasons at the usda ars limited irrigation research farm in greeley colorado usa 40 26 57 n 104 38 12 w elevation 1427 m the soil types are predominantly sandy and fine sandy loam of olney and otero series due to sufficient rainfall no effective data for different water stress levels were observed in 2014 therefore only data collected in 2013 2015 and 2016 were presented in this study the maize zea mays l was planted on may 14 day of year doy 134 june 3 doy 154 and may 5 doy 126 in 2013 2015 and 2016 respectively the dates of the beginning of late vegetative v8 reproductive r1 and maturation stages r4 were july 1 doy 182 july 29 doy 210 and august 19 doy 231 in 2013 respectively in 2015 these dates were july 6 doy 187 august 3 doy 215 and august 24 doy 236 respectively in 2016 these dates were june 27 doy 179 july 25 doy 207 and august 9 doy 222 respectively during each growth season drip irrigation tubing with 16 mm internal diameter placed next to each row of maize was used to apply water turbine flow meters badger record all turbo 160 with rtr transmitters were used to measure irrigation amount for each treatment campbell scientific cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used to record irrigation data the 12 treatments table 1 were arranged in a randomized block design 9 m wide by 43 m long with 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing with four replications to avoid nutrient deficiencies fertilizers were applied to all treatments each treatment targeted a percent of maximum non stressed crop et during late vegetative and maturation stages however water was fully applied during the early vegetative planting to v8 and sensitive reproductive r1 to r3 stages if 80 and 40 of maximum non stressed crop et are respectively applied to a treatment during late vegetative and maturation stages this treatment is noted as 80 40 table 1 shows the sum of actual net irrigation amounts and precipitation for each treatment details about field operations could be found in trout and bausch 2017 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 maize canopy temperature and meteorological data measurements infrared thermal radiometers irt model si 121 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were used to capture maize tc the view angle is 36 and the measuring accuracy over the temperature range of 10 65 c is 0 2 c to make sure maize canopy was primarily included in the field of view the irt sensors were installed on telescoping posts with 23 below horizon and 45 from north and were kept at a height of 0 8 m above the top of canopy during the vegetative stage the height of irt sensors was adjusted twice per week with the growth of maize the total viewing area of an irt sensor is 13 35 m2 the tc data measured by irt sensors were recorded by cr1000 data loggers campbell scientific inc logan utah usa and averaged on hourly intervals in 2015 and 2016 irt sensors were installed for all treatments except for trt4 80 65 and trt6 80 40 however in 2013 irt sensors were installed for six of the twelve treatments trt1 100 100 trt2 100 50 trt3 80 80 trt6 80 40 trt8 65 65 and trt12 40 40 to obtain more data in 2013 thermal images collected for all treatments by an infrared camera flir a655sc flir systems inc portland usa were used to extract maize tc the resolution spectral range and accuracy are 640 480 pixels 7 5 13 0 µm and 2 of reading thermal camera was installed on a boom mounted on a high clearance tractor nadir view thermal images were collected on a height of 7 m above the ground details about the thermal camera and the extraction procedure of maize tc could be found in han et al 2016 meteorological data were collected by an on site standard weather station which is belong to colorado agricultural meteorological network specifically hourly precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed taken at 2 m above a grass reference surface were collected table 2 shows the main mean daily meteorological data during each maize growth season 2 2 2 rgb images aquisition a canon eos 50d dslr camera canon inc tokyo japan camera with the sensor size of 22 3 mm 14 9 mm was also installed on the boom on the high clearance tractor nadir view rgb images were collected near solar noon from all of the 12 water treatments across 2013 2015 and 2016 growth seasons the target view of the ground was about 5 7 m 3 8 m at the center rows of each plot due to the adoption of the small resolution mode 2352 pixels 1568 pixels the pixel size of images was about 0 24 cm the rgb images collection dates are shown in table 3 2 2 3 plant measurements leaf water potential lwp mpa was measured by a scholander type pressure chamber model 3005 series plant water status console with 18 cm long chamber soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa within two hours past solar noon at the same dates as rgb images collection lwp were measured on doy 227 and 247 in 2013 for all treatments and on doy 204 in 2015 for trt1 2 3 8 11 and 12 table 3 four maize leaves collected from different plants were chosen to measure lwp data for each plot details about the lwp measurements could be found in han et al 2016 two plants from each plot were chosen to collect sap flow data by using sap flow exo sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa for each plant sensors were installed on stem internodes to prevent moisture from stems from entering the sensors plastic wrap was used to cover stem internodes see detailed information in han et al 2018 sap flow mm h 1 was measured for trt1 8 12 and 13 on doy 209 218 233 237 244 and 253 in 2015 table 3 the average value of sap flow data collected within two hours past solar noon were used to represent maize water status 2 3 rgb images processing 2 3 1 gaussian mixture model gmm for maize water status due to the high spatial resolution no mixed ensemble of crop and soil pixels exist in proximally sensed rgb images the bimodal gmm could be adopted to depict the distributions of crop and background liu et al 2012 therefore gmm function f x could be given by 1 f x w v n μ v σ v 2 w b n μ b σ b 2 where w μ and σ represent weight mean value and standard deviation respectively subscript v and b represent vegetation and background respectively n μ σ represents the gaussian distribution function x is the exg value for example fig 1b the vegetation distribution in exg obtained on doy 209 in 2015 for trt1 could be described by gaussian distribution with weight mean value and standard deviation of 0 92 0 31 and 0 14 respectively the weight mean value and standard deviation for background are 0 08 0 06 and 0 03 respectively as shown in fig 1 mgdexg the black dashed line of maize would shift to the left along with the degree of deficit irrigation with values of 0 31 0 16 and 0 13 for trt1 100 100 trt8 65 65 and trt12 40 40 respectively therefore we assumed that mgdexg was a new maize water stress indicator 2 3 2 estimation method of maize gaussian distribution to estimate weight mean value and standard deviation for vegetation and background gaussian distributions expectation maximization algorithm was applied the detailed steps which were implemented using mixtools package benaglia et al 2009 in the r language r core team 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 specifically in this study the initial mean values were set as 0 25 and 0 00 for vegetation and background gaussian distributions respectively the initial values of weight were randomly chosen from a uniform dirichlet distribution benaglia et al 2009 the initial values of standard deviation were the reciprocal of the square root of a vector of random exponential distribution values whose means are determined according to a binning method convergence is declared when the change in the observed data log likelihood increases by less than 1e 08 the maximum number of iterations was set as 1000 2 4 crop water stress index cwsi as one of the most important crop water stress indicators the empirical cwsi is defined in eq 2 idso et al 1981 2 cwsi d t m d t l l d t u l d t l l where dt m is the measured tc ta dt ll and dt ul are the lower and upper limits of tc ta namely the nwsb and ntb respectively the cwsi values of 0 and 1 represent no stress and maximum water stress conditions respectively the actual cwsi could be slightly greater than 1 due to measured dt m values could be occasionally greater than the upper baseline dejonge et al 2015 in this study 5 c was used as the ntb in the previous studies within the same research field nwsbs have been established for 2013 dejonge et al 2015 and 2015 han et al 2018 therefore only nwsb for 2016 was established in this study fig 3 specifically the nwsb for 2013 2015 and 2016 could be found in eqs 3 4 and 5 respectively 3 d t l l 1 79 v p d 2 34 4 d t l l 1 97 v p d 3 43 5 d t l l 2 76 v p d 4 98 where vpd represents vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa is related to air temperature and relative humidity and could be calculated by the eq 6 walter et al 2000 6 v p d 0 6108 exp 17 27 t a t a 237 3 100 r h 100 where ta represents air temperature c rh represents relative humidity 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of mgdexg to different water treatments to clearly show the differences of crop water stress indices among water treatments five typical treatments with significant water applied differences were chosen to depict the seasonal trends of mgdexg and cwsi namely trt1 100 100 trt3 80 80 trt8 65 65 trt11 50 50 and trt12 40 40 as shown in fig 4 in 2015 there were clear differences among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 with average mgdexg values of 0 27 0 22 0 16 0 13 and 0 12 during the late vegetation stage the corresponding average cwsi values for the five treatments were 0 06 0 23 0 69 0 76 and 0 90 respectively with the release of deficit irrigation during the reproductive stage the average mgdexg values for the deficit irrigation treatments trt3 8 11 and 12 clearly increased to 0 28 0 31 0 29 and 0 29 which were close to the mean mgdexg value of trt1 of 0 28 correspondingly the average cwsi values for trt1 3 8 11 and 12 decreased to 0 01 0 02 0 15 0 14 and 0 18 with the reimposition of deficit irrigation during the maturation stage clear differences among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 showed again with the average mgdexg values of 0 25 0 24 0 22 0 20 and 0 19 and with the average cwsi values of 0 09 0 26 0 47 0 43 and 0 51 respectively at the same time the differences of mgdexg became more obvious as the extension of deficit treatment similar to 2015 in 2013 and 2016 clear differences of mgdexg among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 were also found during the late vegetation and maturation stages in addition the opposite trend was shown for mgdexg compared to cwsi for example during the late vegetation stage in 2013 there was an increasing trend of mgdexg compared to the decreasing trend of cwsi however in 2016 both mgdexg and cwsi could not effectively distinguish between trt1 and trt3 trt3 had larger average mgdexg value of 0 33 and smaller average cwsi value of 0 10 compared to the trt1 of 0 32 and 0 16 respectively 3 2 relationships between mgdexg and canopy temperature based water stress indicators fig 5 shows the relationships between mgdexg and canopy temperature based water stress indicators tc tc ta and cwsi using data collected in 2013 2015 2016 and all three years in 2013 2015 and 2016 mgdexg showed significant p 0 001 negative correlations with all three indicators r2 values for tc were 0 66 0 71 and 0 73 for tc ta were 0 47 0 69 and 0 80 and for cwsi were 0 63 0 80 and 0 80 respectively among three indicators mgdexg had the most robust relationship with cwsi and the least robust relationship with tc the changes of slope and intercept of relationship between mgdexg and cwsi were 8 and 22 for 2015 and 2 and 9 for 2016 compared to 2013 a robust relationship could be described by eq 7 using data collected in all three years 7 c w s i 4 00 m g d e x g 1 36 r 2 0 64 n 199 the relationship between mgdexg and tc changed considerably from a slope of 52 42 in 2013 to 37 45 29 increase in 2015 and to 20 97 60 increase in 2016 the corresponding intercept deceased from 42 38 to 37 88 11 and 34 82 19 respectively as for tc ta the changes of slope and intercept were 7 and 23 for 2015 and 28 and 17 for 2016 compared to 2013 the robust relationship between mgdexg and cwsi also shows that the ability of mgdexg to estimate maize water stress was resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field although tc is closely related to transpiration rate and could be used as an indirect water stress indicator it is influenced by the micro meteorological conditions within the field so tc ta was proposed to eliminate the influence of air temperature a main drawback of tc ta is that it is influenced by air humidity clawson et al 1989 to further eliminate the influence of air humidity the empirical cwsi model was established and has been successfully used to quantify crop water stress virnodkar et al 2020 as shown in table 2 and fig 5 although different micro meteorological patterns were found for 2013 2015 and 2016 there was a relatively stable range of cwsi specifically there was a higher average vpd value for 2015 of 1 29 kpa compared to 1 15 kpa and 1 18 kpa of 2013 and 2016 the higher vpd meant a relatively drier meteorological condition in 2015 compared to the large fluctuation of the range of tc stable range was found for cwsi fig 5 for example tc had a narrower range of 26 5 32 0 c in 2016 and was almost the half of 2015 24 0 36 0 c however a closer range of cwsi was found for 2015 0 02 to 1 06 and 2016 0 03 to 1 17 3 3 comparison with maize physiological parameters to further verify the performance of mgdexg on maize water stress linear regression analyses were carried out for mgdexg compared to lwp and sap flow measured in 2013 and 2015 growth seasons fig 6 mgdexg had significant positive correlations with both lwp p 0 01 and sap flow p 0 001 in 2013 r2 of the relationship between mgdexg and lwp was 0 85 as for 2015 lwp data were only collected on doy 204 for trt1 2 3 8 11 and 12 the r2 of relationship between mgdexg and lwp was 0 87 as for sap flow data were collected on six days for trt1 8 12 and 13 with a total of 24 sample the mgdexg data had a similar range 0 10 0 33 fig 6b with data of the whole 2015 implying a reasonable water stress gradient was covered r2 value of the relationship between mgdexg and sap flow was 0 62 in addition mgdexg data collected in the reproductive stage for all the treatments were great than 0 25 since water was fully applied to all treatments during this stage same observation was shown in fig 4b 3 4 advantages and limitations overall mgdexg the new crop water stress indicator proposed in this study had the ability to estimate maize water status as indicated by significant positive correlations with water stress related physiological parameters lwp and sap flow and robust significant negative correlation with cwsi the functional basis of the reason why mgdexg could indicate crop water status may be the response of chlorophyll content to water stress to cope with water stress crop canopy will reduce the light absorption by decreasing chlorophyll content ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 with the decreased chlorophyll content the reflectance in green band of crop canopy will decrease consequently lower exg values will be observed for crop suffering from water stress resulting in mgdexg the black dashed line will shift to the left along with the degree of water stress fig 1 compared to the widely used empirical cwsi method mgdexg has two major advantages firstly mgdexg requires only rgb imagery making it easier to calculate and it is cheaper making it easier to popularize although compared to the theoretical method the empirical cwsi is simple and requires less data it still needs three parameters tc ta and rh or the careful selection and design of locations of the wet and dry reference surfaces cohen et al 2005 wang et al 2005 in this study to monitor tc under various deficit irrigation treatments forty irt sensors 689 each were set for ten treatments four replications each treatment block had the width of 9 m and length of 43 m with 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing due to the heterogeneity of soil and crop within the large field campbell and campbell 1982 li et al 2010 more than one irt sensor quantity depends on area and heterogeneity condition should be carefully set to satisfactorily represent the heterogeneous conditions as contrast mgdexg only requires one digital camera canon eos 50d dslr camera used in this study was discontinued a used one costs about 500 when trying to obtain tc based on the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle uav platforms except for the higher price e g only one flir vue pro r camera costs 4849 compared to the uav rgb platforms e g phantom 4 pro v2 0 1599 the low resolution of thermal cameras is still a great restriction of accurately extracting tc messina and modica 2020 zhang et al 2019a secondly mgdexg is resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field the sensitivity of the empirical nwsb to the changes of locations and climate variables has been criticized by many researchers gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 for example the slopes values of 1 10 to 3 77 c kpa 1 were observed at different locations for maize nwsb and the corresponding intercept range was 0 42 3 11 c zhang et al 2019b what s more in this study annual change of nwsb was also observed during 2013 2015 and 2016 within the same research field compared to 2015 there was a greater absolute slope for 2016 implying a higher changing speed of the canopy to air temperature difference along with vpd fig 3 the higher daily mean vpd implied that the meteorological condition in 2015 was drier than 2016 table 2 these phenomenon shows that although the empirical cwsi model has a relatively stable range 0 1 to quantify crop water stress it is site and climate specific and could change annually due to the different micro meteorological conditions within the same field as for the limitations similar to ctsd mgdexg is a crop water stress indicator based on the distribution of crop within the rgb image which means it is a statistical description to calculate mgdexg one should make sure the rgb image includes enough pixels of crop and has fine spatial resolution so that the gaussian distribution of crop could be accurately estimated by the em algorithm future field experiment is needed to further explore the influence of scale and spatial resolution of rgb images on mgdexg although a robust relationship has been found between mgdexg and cwsi during 2013 2015 and 2016 maize growth seasons the correlation between mgdexg and crop water stress for specific climate and crop varieties still need to be evaluated in the future in addition to control irrigation management and scheduling in practice timing of irrigation could be determined by using crop water stress indices which represent crop water status bozkurt colak et al 2020 however the critical threshold value of mgdexg beyond which there will be yield reduction indicating the timing of irrigation still need to be tested in the future study 4 conclusions significant negative correlations p 0 001 were found for mgdexg with tc tc ta and cwsi compared to tc and tc ta the relationship between mgdexg and cwsi was more robust with small changes of both intercept and slope in 2015 and 2016 than those in 2013 mgdexg was also highly related to maize lwp p 0 01 and sap flow p 0 001 compared to cwsi mgdexg relies only on the distribution of crop pixels within an rgb image and have two advantages firstly mgdexg has the advantages of cheaper and being easier to popularize secondly mgdexg is resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field overall these findings show that mgdexg could be successfully used as a maize water stress indicator in the future more field experiments are needed to further explore the influences of scale and spatial resolution of rgb images on mgdexg and to evaluate mgdexg for specific climate and crop varieties declaration of competing interest the

10100,the study proposed a new crop water stress indicator the mean value of gaussian distribution of excess green index for maize canopy mgdexg within an rgb image a series of rgb images were collected in a maize field under varying levels of deficit irrigation during 2013 2015 and 2016 growth seasons in northern colorado to evaluate the sensitivity of mgdexg to maize water status canopy temperature canopy to air temperature difference crop water stress index cwsi leaf water potential and sap flow were used as water status references the results show that mgdexg distinguished different levels of deficit irrigation treatments well and responded to the release and reimposition of deficit irrigation the mgdexg showed a significant correlation p 0 01 to different water stress references especially the coefficient of determination r2 with cwsi was 0 63 n 59 for 2013 0 80 n 90 for 2015 and 0 80 n 50 for 2016 in addition among the three tc based water stress indicators the relationship between mgdexg and cwsi was the most robust with the least annual changes of slope and intercept the robust relationship between mgdexg and cwsi could also show that mgdexg was resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field significant correlations p 0 01 were found between mgdexg and leaf water potential with r2 of 0 85 and 0 87 for 2013 and 2015 and between mgdexg and sap flow in 2015 r2 0 62 mgdexg relies only on the distribution of crop pixels within an rgb image and could be calculated easily so it could be cheaper or easier to popularize than other crop water stress indicators in practice overall our results show that mgdexg could be successfully used as a maize water stress indicator in the future more field experiments are needed to further explore the changes of mgdexg with different scale and spatial resolution of rgb images and to evaluate mgdexg for specific climate and crop varieties keywords rgb images canopy temperature crop water stress index deficit irrigation expectation maximization algorithm 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the major water user at global scale accounting for about 70 of the total water withdrawal dubois 2011 garrido rubio et al 2020 about 40 of the world s food supply is produced from only 20 of the arable land garces restrepo et al 2007 currently world population is projected to increase from 6 9 to 9 1 billion in 2050 united nations 2009 global food security is endangered due to the accelerated population growth and long periods of drought with decreasing projected rainfall banerjee and krishnan 2020 ruilin 2013 leading to the requirement for informed irrigation management while maintaining or improving quality and yield of crop gautam and pagay 2020 the timely and precise assessment of crop water status could help us to achieve these goals the traditional soil and crop physiological parameter based water status detecting methods have the disadvantages of time consuming laborious and restricted because of the heterogeneous conditions within the field ben gal et al 2009 li et al 2010 because it is closely related to transpiration rate canopy temperature tc has long been used as the indirect crop water stress indicator tanner 1963 when crop is suffering from water stress it will reduce transpiration rate resulting in the higher temperature compared to non stressed crop gates 1968 however except for the water supply the field micro meteorological condition also has influence on tc clawson et al 1989 gerhards et al 2018 the empirical crop water stress index cwsi was first established by idso et al 1981 to quantify crop water status based on tc shortly afterward jackson et al 1981 proposed the theoretical cwsi method based on energy balance both of the two cwsi calculation methods have been successfully used to relate leaf water potential lwp costa et al 2020 and sap flow han et al 2018 and to schedule irrigation emekli et al 2007 osroosh et al 2015 the key of calculating cwsi is the establishment of two baselines of canopy to air temperature difference tc ta the non water stressed baseline nwsb and the non transpiration baseline ntb compared to the theoretical method the empirical cwsi method has the advantage of simple calculation and requires only two other parameters air temperature and relative humidity specifically the nwsb of the empirical method is relationship between tc ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd estimated by linear regression analysis likewise the ntb is the relationship between tc ta and vapor pressure gradient estimated by linear regression analysis gardner et al 1981a gardner et al 1981b give details about development of these two baselines however the additional parameters required by the calculation of cwsi baselines may restrict its application by farmers testi et al 2008 to simplify the calculation of cwsi a method was proposed to use wet and dry reference surfaces according to jones 1999 maes and steppe 2012 petroleum jelly is adopted to cover one or both sides of crop leaf surface for about 30 min to obtain the dry reference target as for the wet target a thin layer of water is sprayed on one or both sides of crop leaf surface before measuring the locations of reference surfaces within the canopy and field need to be selected and designed carefully because of these challenges in calculating cwsi some researchers propose to estimate crop water stress solely based on tc for example degrees above non stressed index which is the tc difference between stressed and non stressed crop was proposed by taghvaeian et al 2014 the limitation of the index is the requirement of a well irrigated treatment instead of using tc of non stressed plant the 28 c maize was used as the non stressed tc threshold in the calculation of degrees above canopy threshold dejonge et al 2015 standard deviation of canopy temperature ctsd is a crop water stress indicator based on the distribution of tc within a thermal image han et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 it is based on the principle that crop transpiration rate has influence on the differences between temperature of sunlit and shaded leaves within the canopy more direct radiation should be received by sunlit leaves than shaded leaves resulting in higher temperature for sunlit leaves when non transpiration occurs the maximum temperature difference between sunlit and shaded leaves will be observed when water is available for transpiration sunlit leaves of the canopy will have higher transpiration rate than shaded leaves irmak et al 2008 therefore with the increase of transpiration rate the temperature difference between sunlit and shaded canopy portions will decrease because of more cooling effect on sunlit leaves to assess the performance of abovementioned indices for estimating water stress dejonge et al 2015 han et al 2016 taghvaeian et al 2014 cwsi lwp and other classical water stress indicators were adopted as crop water stress references significant correlations were found between degrees above non stressed and lwp with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 66 n 20 and between ctsd and cwsi with r2 of 0 54 n 48 instead of using tc alone to measure water stress other stress symptoms e g leaf wilting and the decrease in chlorophyll concentration could be detected by using spectral characteristics ballester et al 2018 in several studies the photochemical reflectance index gamon et al 1992 has been successfully tested as a crop water stress indicator berni et al 2009 rossini et al 2015 zarco tejada et al 2013 in addition the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index haboudane et al 2002 zarco tejada et al 2004 and green normalized difference vegetation index gitelson and merzlyak 1998 have also been successfully used to measure crop water stress related physiological characteristics baluja et al 2012 espinoza et al 2017 since the distribution of temperature within crop canopy and the spectral changes of crop in certain bands e g vegetation indices could be successfully used to estimate crop water status the distribution of vegetation index within crop canopy could also be used as a crop water status indicator to verify the above assumption choosing the appropriate vegetation index and estimation method of crop distribution are two prerequisites rgb images can capture a great variety of situations especially in field conditions philipp and rath 2002 the segmentation of crop from background is often accomplished based on a vegetation index which is derived from rgb images among these vegetation indices the excessive green index exg has been widely used to segment crop from background guerrero et al 2012 m woebbecke et al 1995 similar to ctsd based on the assumption that the temperature distribution of crop and background follow the gaussian mixture model gmm han et al 2016 the exg distribution of crop and background could also be assumed as a gmm with two components liu et al 2012 the combination of vegetation index and gmm has been successfully employed to estimate crop canopy cover li et al 2018 song et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge there is no report on estimating crop water status by the combination of exg and gmm the goal of this study was to investigate the potential of using rgb images to estimate water status based on the distribution of vegetation index of maize canopy it was hypothesized that exg distribution extracted from rgb images follows gmm with two components one is gaussian distribution of background and the other is gaussian distribution of maize canopy the mean value of gaussian distribution of exg for maize canopy mgdexg could be used to estimate water status three specific objectives were 1 to analyze the response of mgdexg to different levels of deficit irrigation 2 to analyze the relationship between mgdexg and tc based water stress indicators tc tc ta and cwsi and 3 to analyze the relationship between mgdexg and maize physiological water stress parameters lwp and sap flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and management the study was conducted during 2013 2016 maize growth seasons at the usda ars limited irrigation research farm in greeley colorado usa 40 26 57 n 104 38 12 w elevation 1427 m the soil types are predominantly sandy and fine sandy loam of olney and otero series due to sufficient rainfall no effective data for different water stress levels were observed in 2014 therefore only data collected in 2013 2015 and 2016 were presented in this study the maize zea mays l was planted on may 14 day of year doy 134 june 3 doy 154 and may 5 doy 126 in 2013 2015 and 2016 respectively the dates of the beginning of late vegetative v8 reproductive r1 and maturation stages r4 were july 1 doy 182 july 29 doy 210 and august 19 doy 231 in 2013 respectively in 2015 these dates were july 6 doy 187 august 3 doy 215 and august 24 doy 236 respectively in 2016 these dates were june 27 doy 179 july 25 doy 207 and august 9 doy 222 respectively during each growth season drip irrigation tubing with 16 mm internal diameter placed next to each row of maize was used to apply water turbine flow meters badger record all turbo 160 with rtr transmitters were used to measure irrigation amount for each treatment campbell scientific cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used to record irrigation data the 12 treatments table 1 were arranged in a randomized block design 9 m wide by 43 m long with 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing with four replications to avoid nutrient deficiencies fertilizers were applied to all treatments each treatment targeted a percent of maximum non stressed crop et during late vegetative and maturation stages however water was fully applied during the early vegetative planting to v8 and sensitive reproductive r1 to r3 stages if 80 and 40 of maximum non stressed crop et are respectively applied to a treatment during late vegetative and maturation stages this treatment is noted as 80 40 table 1 shows the sum of actual net irrigation amounts and precipitation for each treatment details about field operations could be found in trout and bausch 2017 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 maize canopy temperature and meteorological data measurements infrared thermal radiometers irt model si 121 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were used to capture maize tc the view angle is 36 and the measuring accuracy over the temperature range of 10 65 c is 0 2 c to make sure maize canopy was primarily included in the field of view the irt sensors were installed on telescoping posts with 23 below horizon and 45 from north and were kept at a height of 0 8 m above the top of canopy during the vegetative stage the height of irt sensors was adjusted twice per week with the growth of maize the total viewing area of an irt sensor is 13 35 m2 the tc data measured by irt sensors were recorded by cr1000 data loggers campbell scientific inc logan utah usa and averaged on hourly intervals in 2015 and 2016 irt sensors were installed for all treatments except for trt4 80 65 and trt6 80 40 however in 2013 irt sensors were installed for six of the twelve treatments trt1 100 100 trt2 100 50 trt3 80 80 trt6 80 40 trt8 65 65 and trt12 40 40 to obtain more data in 2013 thermal images collected for all treatments by an infrared camera flir a655sc flir systems inc portland usa were used to extract maize tc the resolution spectral range and accuracy are 640 480 pixels 7 5 13 0 µm and 2 of reading thermal camera was installed on a boom mounted on a high clearance tractor nadir view thermal images were collected on a height of 7 m above the ground details about the thermal camera and the extraction procedure of maize tc could be found in han et al 2016 meteorological data were collected by an on site standard weather station which is belong to colorado agricultural meteorological network specifically hourly precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed taken at 2 m above a grass reference surface were collected table 2 shows the main mean daily meteorological data during each maize growth season 2 2 2 rgb images aquisition a canon eos 50d dslr camera canon inc tokyo japan camera with the sensor size of 22 3 mm 14 9 mm was also installed on the boom on the high clearance tractor nadir view rgb images were collected near solar noon from all of the 12 water treatments across 2013 2015 and 2016 growth seasons the target view of the ground was about 5 7 m 3 8 m at the center rows of each plot due to the adoption of the small resolution mode 2352 pixels 1568 pixels the pixel size of images was about 0 24 cm the rgb images collection dates are shown in table 3 2 2 3 plant measurements leaf water potential lwp mpa was measured by a scholander type pressure chamber model 3005 series plant water status console with 18 cm long chamber soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa within two hours past solar noon at the same dates as rgb images collection lwp were measured on doy 227 and 247 in 2013 for all treatments and on doy 204 in 2015 for trt1 2 3 8 11 and 12 table 3 four maize leaves collected from different plants were chosen to measure lwp data for each plot details about the lwp measurements could be found in han et al 2016 two plants from each plot were chosen to collect sap flow data by using sap flow exo sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa for each plant sensors were installed on stem internodes to prevent moisture from stems from entering the sensors plastic wrap was used to cover stem internodes see detailed information in han et al 2018 sap flow mm h 1 was measured for trt1 8 12 and 13 on doy 209 218 233 237 244 and 253 in 2015 table 3 the average value of sap flow data collected within two hours past solar noon were used to represent maize water status 2 3 rgb images processing 2 3 1 gaussian mixture model gmm for maize water status due to the high spatial resolution no mixed ensemble of crop and soil pixels exist in proximally sensed rgb images the bimodal gmm could be adopted to depict the distributions of crop and background liu et al 2012 therefore gmm function f x could be given by 1 f x w v n μ v σ v 2 w b n μ b σ b 2 where w μ and σ represent weight mean value and standard deviation respectively subscript v and b represent vegetation and background respectively n μ σ represents the gaussian distribution function x is the exg value for example fig 1b the vegetation distribution in exg obtained on doy 209 in 2015 for trt1 could be described by gaussian distribution with weight mean value and standard deviation of 0 92 0 31 and 0 14 respectively the weight mean value and standard deviation for background are 0 08 0 06 and 0 03 respectively as shown in fig 1 mgdexg the black dashed line of maize would shift to the left along with the degree of deficit irrigation with values of 0 31 0 16 and 0 13 for trt1 100 100 trt8 65 65 and trt12 40 40 respectively therefore we assumed that mgdexg was a new maize water stress indicator 2 3 2 estimation method of maize gaussian distribution to estimate weight mean value and standard deviation for vegetation and background gaussian distributions expectation maximization algorithm was applied the detailed steps which were implemented using mixtools package benaglia et al 2009 in the r language r core team 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 specifically in this study the initial mean values were set as 0 25 and 0 00 for vegetation and background gaussian distributions respectively the initial values of weight were randomly chosen from a uniform dirichlet distribution benaglia et al 2009 the initial values of standard deviation were the reciprocal of the square root of a vector of random exponential distribution values whose means are determined according to a binning method convergence is declared when the change in the observed data log likelihood increases by less than 1e 08 the maximum number of iterations was set as 1000 2 4 crop water stress index cwsi as one of the most important crop water stress indicators the empirical cwsi is defined in eq 2 idso et al 1981 2 cwsi d t m d t l l d t u l d t l l where dt m is the measured tc ta dt ll and dt ul are the lower and upper limits of tc ta namely the nwsb and ntb respectively the cwsi values of 0 and 1 represent no stress and maximum water stress conditions respectively the actual cwsi could be slightly greater than 1 due to measured dt m values could be occasionally greater than the upper baseline dejonge et al 2015 in this study 5 c was used as the ntb in the previous studies within the same research field nwsbs have been established for 2013 dejonge et al 2015 and 2015 han et al 2018 therefore only nwsb for 2016 was established in this study fig 3 specifically the nwsb for 2013 2015 and 2016 could be found in eqs 3 4 and 5 respectively 3 d t l l 1 79 v p d 2 34 4 d t l l 1 97 v p d 3 43 5 d t l l 2 76 v p d 4 98 where vpd represents vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa is related to air temperature and relative humidity and could be calculated by the eq 6 walter et al 2000 6 v p d 0 6108 exp 17 27 t a t a 237 3 100 r h 100 where ta represents air temperature c rh represents relative humidity 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of mgdexg to different water treatments to clearly show the differences of crop water stress indices among water treatments five typical treatments with significant water applied differences were chosen to depict the seasonal trends of mgdexg and cwsi namely trt1 100 100 trt3 80 80 trt8 65 65 trt11 50 50 and trt12 40 40 as shown in fig 4 in 2015 there were clear differences among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 with average mgdexg values of 0 27 0 22 0 16 0 13 and 0 12 during the late vegetation stage the corresponding average cwsi values for the five treatments were 0 06 0 23 0 69 0 76 and 0 90 respectively with the release of deficit irrigation during the reproductive stage the average mgdexg values for the deficit irrigation treatments trt3 8 11 and 12 clearly increased to 0 28 0 31 0 29 and 0 29 which were close to the mean mgdexg value of trt1 of 0 28 correspondingly the average cwsi values for trt1 3 8 11 and 12 decreased to 0 01 0 02 0 15 0 14 and 0 18 with the reimposition of deficit irrigation during the maturation stage clear differences among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 showed again with the average mgdexg values of 0 25 0 24 0 22 0 20 and 0 19 and with the average cwsi values of 0 09 0 26 0 47 0 43 and 0 51 respectively at the same time the differences of mgdexg became more obvious as the extension of deficit treatment similar to 2015 in 2013 and 2016 clear differences of mgdexg among trt1 3 8 11 and 12 were also found during the late vegetation and maturation stages in addition the opposite trend was shown for mgdexg compared to cwsi for example during the late vegetation stage in 2013 there was an increasing trend of mgdexg compared to the decreasing trend of cwsi however in 2016 both mgdexg and cwsi could not effectively distinguish between trt1 and trt3 trt3 had larger average mgdexg value of 0 33 and smaller average cwsi value of 0 10 compared to the trt1 of 0 32 and 0 16 respectively 3 2 relationships between mgdexg and canopy temperature based water stress indicators fig 5 shows the relationships between mgdexg and canopy temperature based water stress indicators tc tc ta and cwsi using data collected in 2013 2015 2016 and all three years in 2013 2015 and 2016 mgdexg showed significant p 0 001 negative correlations with all three indicators r2 values for tc were 0 66 0 71 and 0 73 for tc ta were 0 47 0 69 and 0 80 and for cwsi were 0 63 0 80 and 0 80 respectively among three indicators mgdexg had the most robust relationship with cwsi and the least robust relationship with tc the changes of slope and intercept of relationship between mgdexg and cwsi were 8 and 22 for 2015 and 2 and 9 for 2016 compared to 2013 a robust relationship could be described by eq 7 using data collected in all three years 7 c w s i 4 00 m g d e x g 1 36 r 2 0 64 n 199 the relationship between mgdexg and tc changed considerably from a slope of 52 42 in 2013 to 37 45 29 increase in 2015 and to 20 97 60 increase in 2016 the corresponding intercept deceased from 42 38 to 37 88 11 and 34 82 19 respectively as for tc ta the changes of slope and intercept were 7 and 23 for 2015 and 28 and 17 for 2016 compared to 2013 the robust relationship between mgdexg and cwsi also shows that the ability of mgdexg to estimate maize water stress was resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field although tc is closely related to transpiration rate and could be used as an indirect water stress indicator it is influenced by the micro meteorological conditions within the field so tc ta was proposed to eliminate the influence of air temperature a main drawback of tc ta is that it is influenced by air humidity clawson et al 1989 to further eliminate the influence of air humidity the empirical cwsi model was established and has been successfully used to quantify crop water stress virnodkar et al 2020 as shown in table 2 and fig 5 although different micro meteorological patterns were found for 2013 2015 and 2016 there was a relatively stable range of cwsi specifically there was a higher average vpd value for 2015 of 1 29 kpa compared to 1 15 kpa and 1 18 kpa of 2013 and 2016 the higher vpd meant a relatively drier meteorological condition in 2015 compared to the large fluctuation of the range of tc stable range was found for cwsi fig 5 for example tc had a narrower range of 26 5 32 0 c in 2016 and was almost the half of 2015 24 0 36 0 c however a closer range of cwsi was found for 2015 0 02 to 1 06 and 2016 0 03 to 1 17 3 3 comparison with maize physiological parameters to further verify the performance of mgdexg on maize water stress linear regression analyses were carried out for mgdexg compared to lwp and sap flow measured in 2013 and 2015 growth seasons fig 6 mgdexg had significant positive correlations with both lwp p 0 01 and sap flow p 0 001 in 2013 r2 of the relationship between mgdexg and lwp was 0 85 as for 2015 lwp data were only collected on doy 204 for trt1 2 3 8 11 and 12 the r2 of relationship between mgdexg and lwp was 0 87 as for sap flow data were collected on six days for trt1 8 12 and 13 with a total of 24 sample the mgdexg data had a similar range 0 10 0 33 fig 6b with data of the whole 2015 implying a reasonable water stress gradient was covered r2 value of the relationship between mgdexg and sap flow was 0 62 in addition mgdexg data collected in the reproductive stage for all the treatments were great than 0 25 since water was fully applied to all treatments during this stage same observation was shown in fig 4b 3 4 advantages and limitations overall mgdexg the new crop water stress indicator proposed in this study had the ability to estimate maize water status as indicated by significant positive correlations with water stress related physiological parameters lwp and sap flow and robust significant negative correlation with cwsi the functional basis of the reason why mgdexg could indicate crop water status may be the response of chlorophyll content to water stress to cope with water stress crop canopy will reduce the light absorption by decreasing chlorophyll content ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 with the decreased chlorophyll content the reflectance in green band of crop canopy will decrease consequently lower exg values will be observed for crop suffering from water stress resulting in mgdexg the black dashed line will shift to the left along with the degree of water stress fig 1 compared to the widely used empirical cwsi method mgdexg has two major advantages firstly mgdexg requires only rgb imagery making it easier to calculate and it is cheaper making it easier to popularize although compared to the theoretical method the empirical cwsi is simple and requires less data it still needs three parameters tc ta and rh or the careful selection and design of locations of the wet and dry reference surfaces cohen et al 2005 wang et al 2005 in this study to monitor tc under various deficit irrigation treatments forty irt sensors 689 each were set for ten treatments four replications each treatment block had the width of 9 m and length of 43 m with 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing due to the heterogeneity of soil and crop within the large field campbell and campbell 1982 li et al 2010 more than one irt sensor quantity depends on area and heterogeneity condition should be carefully set to satisfactorily represent the heterogeneous conditions as contrast mgdexg only requires one digital camera canon eos 50d dslr camera used in this study was discontinued a used one costs about 500 when trying to obtain tc based on the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle uav platforms except for the higher price e g only one flir vue pro r camera costs 4849 compared to the uav rgb platforms e g phantom 4 pro v2 0 1599 the low resolution of thermal cameras is still a great restriction of accurately extracting tc messina and modica 2020 zhang et al 2019a secondly mgdexg is resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field the sensitivity of the empirical nwsb to the changes of locations and climate variables has been criticized by many researchers gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 for example the slopes values of 1 10 to 3 77 c kpa 1 were observed at different locations for maize nwsb and the corresponding intercept range was 0 42 3 11 c zhang et al 2019b what s more in this study annual change of nwsb was also observed during 2013 2015 and 2016 within the same research field compared to 2015 there was a greater absolute slope for 2016 implying a higher changing speed of the canopy to air temperature difference along with vpd fig 3 the higher daily mean vpd implied that the meteorological condition in 2015 was drier than 2016 table 2 these phenomenon shows that although the empirical cwsi model has a relatively stable range 0 1 to quantify crop water stress it is site and climate specific and could change annually due to the different micro meteorological conditions within the same field as for the limitations similar to ctsd mgdexg is a crop water stress indicator based on the distribution of crop within the rgb image which means it is a statistical description to calculate mgdexg one should make sure the rgb image includes enough pixels of crop and has fine spatial resolution so that the gaussian distribution of crop could be accurately estimated by the em algorithm future field experiment is needed to further explore the influence of scale and spatial resolution of rgb images on mgdexg although a robust relationship has been found between mgdexg and cwsi during 2013 2015 and 2016 maize growth seasons the correlation between mgdexg and crop water stress for specific climate and crop varieties still need to be evaluated in the future in addition to control irrigation management and scheduling in practice timing of irrigation could be determined by using crop water stress indices which represent crop water status bozkurt colak et al 2020 however the critical threshold value of mgdexg beyond which there will be yield reduction indicating the timing of irrigation still need to be tested in the future study 4 conclusions significant negative correlations p 0 001 were found for mgdexg with tc tc ta and cwsi compared to tc and tc ta the relationship between mgdexg and cwsi was more robust with small changes of both intercept and slope in 2015 and 2016 than those in 2013 mgdexg was also highly related to maize lwp p 0 01 and sap flow p 0 001 compared to cwsi mgdexg relies only on the distribution of crop pixels within an rgb image and have two advantages firstly mgdexg has the advantages of cheaper and being easier to popularize secondly mgdexg is resistant to the micro meteorological conditions within the field overall these findings show that mgdexg could be successfully used as a maize water stress indicator in the future more field experiments are needed to further explore the influences of scale and spatial resolution of rgb images on mgdexg and to evaluate mgdexg for specific climate and crop varieties declaration of competing interest the

10101,characterizing the soil moisture environment in the plantation ecosystems may provide substantial information for judging the stability of forests in relation to climate change in this study we explored the level and the variations of water availability as well as their influence on tree water use in the long term this was achieved by monitoring in particular the volumetric soil water content θ the groundwater level the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd and the sap flux based forest transpiration tr in a sand fixation plantation of mongolian scots pine in northern china the results showed a significant inter and intra annual variability of annual precipitation pr for an average standard deviation of 476 139 mm over the past 16 year study period the inter annual variations of the groundwater level showed a general downward trend decreasing from 4 82 to 6 13 m the relative extractable soil water rew between 0 1 m and between 1 2 m depth along soil profile was only 0 29 0 14 and 0 16 0 08 respectively indicating a decreasing of soil moisture capacity and of the moisture depletion patterns with depth the statistics relative to the past seven years between 2013 2019 indicate an average tr of 193 59 mm for mongolian scots pines notably their transpiration capability tr vpd declined with the decrease of rew0 1 m the boundary curve showed a clear exponential decline the threshold value of rew0 1 m deduced from an abrupt decrease of tr vpd was 0 41 and 0 35 at the daily and monthly timescales respectively the average tr pr value was 0 42 maximum 0 60 and tr accounted on average for 55 of the total evapotranspiration maximum 77 soil drought prevailed at the study site however we did not notice a heavy use of soil water resources by mongolian scots pine the results overall underlined the causes rather than the consequences of the observed soil moisture conditions which are leading to the degradation of mongolian scots pine forest management measures causing moderate disturbance are hence recommended for mitigating the water competition between mongolian scots pine and sub canopy vegetation keywords soil moisture sap flow groundwater table mongolian scots pine drought 1 introduction climate change is expected to induce serious negative impacts on the water availability and therefore to greatly intensify regional scale droughts cook et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2018 in arid and semi arid areas the most obvious effects of climate change besides an air temperature increase closely related to the atmospheric water demand i e vapor pressure deficit vpd is a great variability in the total annual amounts and in the monthly distribution of precipitation a reduction of the water holding capacity and organic matter content of soils may exacerbates this climatic drought effects pereira et al 2004 climate change related droughts have globally led to abrupt changes in the attributes of various ecosystems causing declines in plant productivity and soil fertility as well as in vegetation coverage and richness choat et al 2018a berdugo et al 2020 soil droughts have also significantly affected the physiological activity of plants from different points of view and even induced tree mortality under extreme conditions anderegg et al 2015 drought induced tree mortality has been observed worldwide across multiple forest

distribution areas giuggiola et al 2010 2013 sanchez costa et al 2015 especially in the iberian peninsula areas martinezvilalta and pinol 2002 morán lópez et al 2014 in northeastern spain poyatos et

pichler and oberhuber 2007 weber et al 2007 giuggiola et al 2010 2013 swidrak et al 2011 leo et al 2013 wieser et al 2014 in siberia urban et al 2019 and in mongolia dulamsuren et al 2009 scots pine is characterized by a superficial root system with a strong first pivot and more lateral roots than most broadleaved species which is conducive to capture precipitation efficiently but also makes the trees prone to drought stress čermák and nadezhdina 2008 merlin et al 2015 presently scots pine is being affected by a drought induced decline of water use and growth in most of its distribution areas morán lópez et al 2014 previous studies have indicated that the summer droughts of varying duration and intensity and specifically extreme drought episodes are causing severe tree defoliation and increasing the mortality rates of scots pine and other tree species pichler and oberhuber 2007 sanchez costa et al 2015 water use by transpiration is one of the most basic physiological processes of plants and the dominant variables in the regional hydrological cycle for many ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions reduced precipitation is the most direct cause of reduced transpiration productivity and weakened growth in trees all together these processes potentially can hinder the survival and growth of trees he et al 2020 more than 40 of the resistance to water transportation between the soil and the canopy top of the scots pine is located in the rhizosphere perämäki et al 2001 therefore soil water availability apparently plays a great role in determining the growing and the survival of plants together with their adaptability to changing environmental conditions galiano et al 2011 brinkmann et al 2016 horqin sandy land is the largest sandy land in china with an area of 5 23 106 hm2 yan et al 2014 to effectively prevented the development of land desertification in the context of the chinese large scale planting project named three north shelter forest program or great green wall sandy land mainly occupied by mongolian scots pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica has been afforested since the 1950s the total area of the mongolian scots pine plantation in horqin sand land is 11 7 104 hm2 yan 2014 the creation of mongolian scots pine sand fixing forests not only provided strong protection to farm and or pasture fields from wind and sand hazards but has also significantly improved the soil habitat by inducing higher soil c n and c p ratios than in grasslands and in the chinese elm savanna zeng et al 2009 however more than 30 years later after the tree planting the degradation and mortality of mongolian scots pine forests in this area started to occur worsening over time song et al 2015 at present the great green wall has attracted widespread attention not only for its great contribution in the mitigation of climate change chen et al 2019 but also due to worries about the possible hydrological consequences of its establishment zastrow 2019 the main concern is the possible over consumption of local water resources by the mongolian scots pine this derives from the comparison between the hydrothermal conditions in the natural distribution area of this tree species in china at 47 n and in its introduction area at 42 n some studies have inferred that the high atmospheric evaporation demand in the introduction area brought by the over consumption of water by the mongolian scots pine would cause a water imbalance in the ecosystem song et al 2020 for this reason it has been suggested to convert these pine plantations into chinese savanna song et al 2018 other studies have instead suggested that the mongolian scots pine just like the scots pine is a typical isohydric species capable of avoiding excessive water losses through its sensitive stoma regulation which operates when a soil water deficit occurs leo et al 2013 meanwhile several studies have reported that in mongolian scots pine specimens 85 of the roots are distributed in the upper 60 cm of soil zhu et al 2008 while 98 of them are distributed within the uppermost meter of soil zhu et al 2005 meng et al 2018 therefore the claim that mongolian scots pine plantations deteriorate the regional water environment especially the deep soil water reservoir or the groundwater level lacks convincing evidences zheng et al 2012 generally local environmental conditions can considerably influence the adaptation ability of trees the soil properties control the stomatal response of plants to droughts rather than their xylem vulnerability in medium wet to dry soils carminati and javaux 2020 statistics on data collected over past 34 years have shown a climate change related decreasing trend in the annual precipitation and an increasing trend in the air temperature at our study site dang et al 2019a these results suggest that the impacts of dramatic inter and intra annual changes in precipitation on vegetation have become more serious over time in this context the analysis of soil moisture quantity and quality which are tightly linked to soil attributes and precipitation may provide deep insights into the drought resistance of mongolian scots pines and allow the prediction of succession dynamics under various climate change scenarios this study tried to answer the following questions are the sites in horqin sandy land amenable for the establishment of mongolian scots pine forests is the environment threatening the survival of mongolian scots pine or the reverse we hence aimed to 1 clarifying the basic water resource characteristics allowing tree transpiration 2 determining the tree response in terms of water use to different degrees of soil drought and possible threshold values 3 clarifying the characteristics of the plantation water balance for future forest management through the long term continuous monitoring of precipitation soil moisture groundwater level and sap flux based transpiration we provided robust evidence that clarifies the interaction mechanisms between the tree water use and the soil water environment moreover we explored the potential for drought mitigation via forest management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site experiments were conducted at the zhanggutai national desertification control experimental station which is located at the southern edge of the horqin sandy land area liaoning province china 122 22 e 42 43 n at 226 5 m a s l between 2004 and 2019 we selected a 40 ha section of a 26 year old mongolian scots pine shelterbelt forest as the object of this study the inter row

of 30 years between 1983 and 2012 the annual mean air temperature was 7 9 c with a frost free period of 155 days the annual pan evaporation 1553 mm and the annual precipitation 475 mm about 92 of precipitation fell from may to september during the main growing season the soil was characterized by an aeolian sand texture it consisted of sand particles 0 05 mm 84 silt particles between 0 05 and

density measurements the sap flux density js in cm s in the outer 0 3 cm of the xylem in a sample tree was measured continuously by using thermal dissipation sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa we installed the sensors at a 1 3 m height on the north side of the stems the probe spacing of these sensors was 0 04 m notably the sensors were shielded with a reflective foil that extended down to 1 m

2002 lu et al 2004 to estimate the average sap flux density along the whole sapwood thickness in total eleven trees were installed each year in a 400 m2 plot for the monitoring of js in 2013 the trees

study area were collected from 2004 while the sap flow was measured from 2013 therefore the calculations of the transpiration tr annual soil water capacity within the upper 2 m c0 2 m and other related variables were done based on data collected between 2013 and 2019 based on the annual precipitation pr data collected between 2004 and 2019 and a series of classification levels barros et al 2017 we identified four types of years wet pr mean 0 5 sd normal pr mean 0 5 sd moderately dry pr mean 0 5 sd severely dry pr mean 1 0 sd sd means the standward deviation the rew values for the soil layers between 0 and 1 m rew0 1 m and 1 2 m rew1 2 m were calculated at daily and monthly timescales the soil moisture conditions at the daily timescales were described by referring to a detailed classification already available for this site dang et al 2019b no drought rew 0 31 mildly drought 0 2 rew 0 31 moderately drought 0 08 rew 0 2 and severely drought rew 0 08 close relationships were noticed between the vpd and canopy transpiration of both scots granier et al 1996 wieser et al 2014 and mongolian scots song et al 2018 2020 dang et al 2019a pines notable the vpd and soil moisture interacted determining seasonal variations in transpiration therefore relative indexes i e js vpd and tr vpd were adopted to eliminate the effects of atmospheric factors and correctly describe the response of transpiration to variable soil moisture tognetti et al 2004 hernandez santana et al 2016 the relationship between js vpd and rew was fitted by a widely reported exponential equation poyatos et al 2013 sanchez costa et al 2015 the daily average vpd for values 0 6 kpa was computed instead from time ewers and oren 2000 an analysis of variance anova analysis was finally performed using originpro 2020 originlan inc northampton ma usa for all analyses differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 annual precipitation soil moisture and groundwater table variations in the long term series the statistics for the 16 year study period 2004 2019 revealed that multiple year pr in the study area was 476 mm 139 mm of which 94 occurred during the growing season from april to october the pr value varied significantly between different years p 0 05 with a coefficient variation cv of 0 29 the highest and lowest pr values were 772 6 mm registered in 2012 and 285 9 mm registered in 2009 respectively by comparing the annual pr values with the multiple year averages we identified 2005 2010 2012 2013 and 2016 as wet years characterized by significant positive precipitation anomalies meanwhile 2008 2018 and 2019 were normal years with pr values close to the mean moreover 2006 2007 2009 2011 2014 2015 and 2017 were dry years with high negative precipitation anomalies of these two were severely dry 2009 and 2017 with pr values of 285 9 and 337 0 mm respectively and the remaining five were moderately dry the dry years accounted for 43 8 of the total fig 1a the soil moisture statistics for the 16 year study period 2004 2019 showed that the forest land had a low water holding capacity the multi year average of the volumetric soil water content within the uppermost meter of the soil profile θ0 1 m was 6 7 2 1 while that for the soil layer between 1 and 2 m θ1 2 m was 4 7 1 2 the soil moisture in each profile varied greatly between different years the cv values for θ0 1 m and θ1 2 m were 0 31 and 0 26 respectively basically the inter annual variations of θ0 1 m were consistent but it did not always correspond exactly with those of pr for example the soil water content in the severely dry year 2009 was the lowest registered during the whole period θ0 1 m and θ1 2 m were 3 7 and 3 2 respectively the pr value in 2012 was higher than in 2013 i e 772 6 mm vs 554 2 mm however the θ0 1 m values were higher in 2013 than in 2012 10 3 and 5 5 respectively similar relationships were noted between the parameters calculated for 2017 and 2018 θ0 1 m was higher in a typical severely dry year than that in a normal year due to a higher amount of precipitation in 2016 fig 1b in fact a sufficient amount of precipitation in the previous year kept the soil moisture at a relative high level at the beginning of the successive year improving the overall level of soil moisture the level of relative extractable soil water was low during the 16 year study period average rew0 1 m 0 29 0 14 in the first nine years 2004 2012 the rew0 1 m values were always lower than the soil drought threshold value 0 31 except in 2005 in the driest year of this period 2009 the average rew0 1 m reached its minimum value 0 09 whereas in the wettest year 2013 it reached its maximum 0 53 notably the mean rew0 1 m in 2006 the year with the highest groundwater level over the whole study period was only 0 16 fig 1c during the whole period considered the annual rew1 2 m was always 0 31 except in 2016 moreover the multi year average was 0 16 0 08 and the minimum value registered was 0 06 in 2009 in the wettest year 2012 the mean rew1 2 m was only 0 19 far lower than the threshold value of 0 31 notably the mean rew1 2 m was only 0 09 in 2006 when the highest groundwater level of the 16 year study period was recorded during four years i e between 2007 and 2009 and in 2014 the average annual rew1 2 m was 0 08 corresponding to 20 of the field water holding capacity and to a volumetric soil water content of 3 5 fig 1c the roots distributed in the deepest part of the soil profiles were in a serious water deficit state during these years over the 16 year study period the groundwater level showed relatively gentle peak valley variations for a multi year average of 5 47 0 37 m and a cv of 0 07 two groundwater level peaks corresponded to years 2006 4 82 m and 2013 5 00 m while the two valleys corresponded to years 2009 5 81 m and 2018 6 13 m fig 1d although the inter annual variations of groundwater level were generally consistent with those of annual precipitation there was a certain degree of non correspondence e g obvious hysteresis phenomena for example the highest groundwater level 4 82 m of the whole study period was observed in 2006 but the pr in the last year 567 6 mm was higher than that in the current year 346 6 mm another peak of groundwater level 5 00 m occurred in 2013 and again but the pr in the last year 772 6 mm was higher than that in the current year 554 2 mm the occurrence of two valleys of groundwater level in 2009 and 2018 was consistent with the low precipitation levels registered in the preceding 3 4 years rather than with the precipitation levels registered in the year before 2008 and 2017 respectively or in 2009 and 2018 3 2 seasonal dynamics of pr rew0 1 m ta and vpd the statistics for the 16 year study period showed a normal intra annual distribution of precipitation in the study area a rapid increasing period occurred from january to july with monthly averages comprised between 1 23 1 82 and 145 2 78 5 mm fig 2 from then on the monthly precipitation rapidly decreased reaching an average value of 2 2 2 8 mm in december notably the seasonal variations of rew0 1 m were inconsistent with the seasonal precipitation dynamics the lowest average soil moisture rew0 1 m 0 25 0 12 occurred in june during the growing season from then on with the rainy season approaching the average soil moisture rose rapidly in august the rew0 1 m value reached 0 34 0 16 after that it began to decline reaching 0 26 0 16 at the end of the growing season in april at the beginning of the growing season the soil moisture conditions were better than in june rew0 1 m 0 30 0 20 in april this was likely mainly due to snow melting the seasonal temperature dynamics also displayed a typical normal distribution the average temperature which in march was 0 61 1 89 c reached its maximum 24 2 0 6 c in july and then gradually dropped reaching 10 0 1 7 c in december fig 2 the seasonal distribution of vpd was characterized instead by a sharply left skewed normal distribution fig 2 the average monthly vpd values rapidly increased from january to may reaching a maximum of 0 97 0 15 kpa in the latter month showing a downward trend afterward during the entire growing season from april to june the vpd values were relatively high 0 66 kpa then they decreased slightly and remained relatively stable from july to september between 0 55 and 0 58 kpa finally dropping to 0 44 0 08 kpa in october the monthly vpd averages during the growing season between 0 44 and 0 97 kpa were significantly higher than during the non growing season between 0 11 and 0 35 kpa in summary the temperature rose rapidly from april to june in concomitance with high vpd values and low precipitation and soil moisture levels hindering vegetation growth in june the survival of mongolian scots pines in the study area seemed to be particularly at risk according to the pr rew0 1 m and vpd levels droughts were particularly frequent in this month 3 3 limitations in the replenishment of the soil moisture storage capacity by precipitation the recent seven year sub period including typical dry and wet years from 2013 to 2019 were selected to calculate the soil storage capacity within 2 m soil profile c0 2 m during the main growing seasons first we calculated the available storage capacity of the upper 2 m of soil profile with rew 0 31 c0 2 m ava which was equal to 140 24 mm between 2013 and 2019 the annual average c0 2 m varied greatly from 148 7 to 99 0 116 6 175 5 135 4 136 9 and lastly 157 6 mm on most days the c0 2 m values were lower than the c0 2 m ava values but they were larger than those during a few rainy months during the 344 day period comprised between september 13 2013 and august 19 2015 the c0 2 m values were always lower than the c0 2 m ava values except on 12 days when they were slightly higher than the c0 2 m ava values a similar situation occurred during the 264 day perid comprised between may 25 2017 and august 12 2018 in this case the c0 2 m values were slightly higher than the c0 2 m ava values only on 34 days fig 3 this situation led to a serious soil deficit our statistics showed that during the main growing season precipitation could be well supplemented by the storage capacity of the upper 2 m of soil the fitting of the monthly data indicated that the replenishment ratio of the average soil storage capacity by precipitation the sum of positive c0 2 m values calculated by daily comparisons and as a percentage of the total precipitation over the same period was 77 7 for the whole year and that it increased to 79 6 during the growing season this implied that the interception loss of precipitation was 20 the statistics of the soil moisture content levels categorized according to the soil drought classification standard showed that generally days in which the rew0 1 m values indicated mildly moderately or severely drought conditions accounted for 33 of the total study period notably drought conditions were verified for 62 of the days in 2014 and for 50 of those in 2015 more specifically 33 of days in 2014 were characterized by moderately drought conditions while only 10 of them were characterized by severely drought conditions in that year within the 1 2 m soil layer drought conditions were verified for 83 of the days between 2013 and 2019 notably the rew1 2 m values for years 2014 and 2018 indicated the occurrence of drought conditions throughout the growing season specifically the rew1 2 m values suggested the occurrence of severely drought conditions for 86 of the days in 2014 fig 4 three days about one month apart in the moderately dry year 2015 i e june 11 july 11 and august 11 were selected to highlight a decline of soil moisture over time as well as in the soil water retention capacity on june 11 2015 the soil was fully wetted by the cumulated total precipitation 139 mm and the rew values were between 0 89 and 0 97 in the upper 40 cm of soil while below that level they dropped with increasing soil depth reaching 0 06 0 11 below 120 cm depth on july 11 2015 the cumulated total precipitation was 35 4 mm and the rew in the upper 40 cm of soil dropped by 68 83 on average moreover the deep soil moisture significantly diminished as well on august 11 2015 the cumulated total precipitation was 29 8 mm and the rew values in the upper 40 cm dropped by 81 87 on average while below 120 cm they declined to 0 0 03 a level close to the wilt soil water point fig 5 these data indicate that even after a full re saturation of the soil the soil moisture along the root profile could quickly drop below the threshold value 0 31 in less than one month 3 4 tr pr and tr et the statistics of the sapflux based transpiration tr by mongolian scots pine during the main growing season showed that the annual transpiration of the forest between 2013 and 2019 varied from 275 1 to 230 8 141 7 153 6 156 6 138 4 and 258 2 mm tr in 2015 decreased by 48 5 than that in 2013 during the experiment the average annual ratio of total transpiration to total precipitation in the growing season tr pr was 0 42 0 12 the highest value 0 60 was observed for year 2014 while the lowest for year 2016 0 25 the total evapotranspiration et was calculated by summing the absolute values of all negative values that were previously obtained by subtracting the c0 2 m of consecutive days the results showed that between the et values varied from 391 5 to 368 9 294 0 379 3 416 0 289 3 and 335 8 mm meanwhile the average ratio of total transpiration to evapotranspiration tr et was 0 55 0 15 the maximum value 0 77 was identified in year 2019 while the minimum value 0 38 was identified in year 2017 fig 6 3 5 tr vpd variations with soil moisture to further clarify the influence of soil moisture condition on the daily transpiration capability of mongolian scots pine the relationship between the deduced variable tr vpd and rew0 1 m were analyzed at daily monthly and annual scales fig 7 at the daily timescale we identified a clear boundary that fitted with an exponential function although the relationship between tr vpd and rew0 1 m was complicated fig 7a the highest tr vpd value identified for the study period was 3 30 mm day kpa on july 17 2013 at the monthly timescale a clear boundary was noticed between tr vpd and rew0 1 m fig 7b additionally the highest monthly average value was 79 mm month kpa in july 2013 between 2013 and 2015 the annual average values of tr vpd varied from 359 9 to 265 7 and 154 4 mm yr kpa while the tr vpd values declined with decreasing rew0 1 m afterward the relationship between tr vpd and rew0 1 m became unclear fig 7c from 2015 2016 the tr vpd value 174 2 mm yr kpa in 2016 increased by only 12 8 while the rew0 1 m values increased by 83 from 2017 2018 the tr vpd values decreased from 190 6 to 176 3 mm yr kpa while the rew0 1 m values declined by 11 finally in 2019 the tr vpd reached 292 1 mm yr kpa due to an increase in soil moisture and the average rew0 1 m grew to 0 49 the boundary fitted equations are

fitted functions from eqs 6 and 7 showed that the soil moisture thresholds associated with rapid changes in the transpiration of mongolian scots pine were following rew 0 35 at the daily timescale and rew 0 41 at the monthly timescale no boundary fitting was conducted at the annual scale due to sparse data available for this analysis 4 discussion 4 1 sand texture determined vulnerability of soil water capacity in this study the vulnerability of soil moisture in a mongolian scots pine plantation ecosystem was examined based on three aspects the rew the variability of precipitation and the effectiveness of the groundwater level relative to the root distribution our results provided basic quantitative information about these indictors which together can explain the vulnerability of soil water capacity the soil at the study site had a relatively low water holding capacity with multi year average rew0 1 m and rew1 2 m values of 0 29 0 14 and 0 16 0 08 respectively both considerably lower than 0 4 a value that has been widely reported for several ecosystems triggering water stress bréda et al 1995 granier et al 1999 bernier et al 2002 poyatos et al 2005 a 3 5 week period with no rain when the soil extractable water reaches 25 of its maximum value can induce the stomatal regulation of water use in scots pine specimens growing on sandy soil in the humid temperate belgian campine region vincke and thiry 2008 at our study site precipitation fell mainly in the form of short and intense events notably the occurrence of intense precipitation for 10 mm per day is ineffective for the replenishment of soil moisture due to canopy interception loss han et al 2012 ineffective rainfall periods lasting for 1 month occurred frequently during the growing season likely providing a harsh growing habitat for trees gymnosperm and conifer dominated ecosystems have often exhibited an increased vulnerability under multiple droughts choat et al 2018a anderegg et al 2020 hence we infer that the frequent severe soil droughts observed between 2014 and 2015 at our study site might have caused the deterioration of the mongolian scots pine dominated ecosystem the water required for the growth of mongolian scots pine seemed hence highly dependent on the occurrence of relatively seasonal and uniformly distributed effective precipitation rather than on the historical water stored in soil the habitat of mongolian scots pine ecosystem at the study site was characterized by relatively poor precipitation for arbor forests with a great inter annual variability 2 7 times and a pulsed storm pattern during the rainy season these characteristics were all unfavorable to the maintenance of an environment with ideal soil moisture conditions during the growing season notably wet multi year climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought induced mortality by stimulating shifts in their hydraulic architecture effectively predisposing them to water stress mcdowell et al 2008 another major factor was the canopy interception loss rate which amounted to 16 25 of the total precipitation at the study site han et al 2012 and significantly reduced the amount of soil moisture harvested from precipitation however the sandy texture of the soil greatly increased the partition of the soil moisture flux moving back to the atmosphere or to groundwater hindering the maintenance of soil moisture to good levels and leading to longer periods of exhausted soil water availability for mongolian scots pine although the contribution of groundwater to et through vertical capillary transportation in the rooted soil has been hypothesized in many ecosystems vincke and thiry 2008 its effect seems to be mostly negligible for the mongolian scots pine stands at our study site the shallow rootedness of mongolian scots pine is similar to that of scots pines for which the tree rooting depth in a sandy loam soil in the russian boreal forest was 1 m urban et al 2019 the groundwater level at our site was generally low during the 16 year study period with multi year averages of 5 47 0 37 m close to the maximum root depths of 5 2 m jiao 1989 and 5 7 m zhu et al 2005 reported by previous scholars specifically there were five years in 2009 2010 2016 2017 and 2018 in which the groundwater level was below 5 7 m reaching a minimum of 6 13 m in 2018 meanwhile the height of the water vapor rising through capillary transportation from sandy soils with particle sizes 0 05 mm was far less than 1 m vincke and thiry 2008 this information supports our conclusion that the influence of mongolian scotch pine on the groundwater level is negligible or at least minimal notably this conclusion seems to contradict the results of previous studies based on stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope methods which have reported a 10 14 contribution of mongolian scots pine to the transport of groundwater and its release through transpiration song et al 2016a 2016b the weak water holding capability of the sand textured soil the scarce water resources derived from the pulsed storm pattern and the low groundwater level all contributed to increase the vulnerability of the abiotic environment strategies for deep soil water acquisition have been critical for the adaptation of several plant species to drought conditions breshears et al 2009 millard and way 2011 anderegg et al 2015 but are difficult to apply for the adaptation of mongolian scots pine at our site the continuous decline of the groundwater level in fact aggravated the degradation of the mongolian scots pine ecosystem which was already inherently fragile in its water environment zhu et al 2005 the mongolian scots pine specimens in our study area underwent a more serious water stress than the scots pine specimens investigated in europe llorens et al 2010 vincke and thiry 2008 which had at their disposition shallower groundwater resources and or less sandy soil 4 2 tr et land surface models and stand level measurements have revealed that terrestrial tr et values usually vary between 0 57 and 0 80 evaristo et al 2015 wei et al 2017 scots pine has been considered as a typical water saving tree species which has demonstrated a strong adaptation to soil drought during periods of high evaporative demands leo et al 2013 wieser et al 2014 for example in the belgian campine region characterized by a humid temperate climate a scots pine specimen with dbh 28 96 cm and stand density 359 trees ha was associated to a tr et value of 0 25 vincke and thiry 2008 whereas a 49 year old scots pine with dbh 25 cm and leaf area index lai 2 67 located in central siberia subjected to an annual precipitation of 431 mm was associated to a tr et value of 0 67 urban et al 2019 these data suggest that the tr et value of scots pine tends to be higher in areas characterized by a semi arid climate rather than by a humid one our seven year measurements revealed that the average tr et value of mongolian scots pine individuals in sandy soil subjected to a semi arid temperate climate and having dbh 17 2 cm and stand density 625 trees ha was 0 55 maximum 0 77 and minimum 0 38 apart from geographical and climatic factors the tr et values was mainly determined by the stands traits it was relatively low between 0 06 and 0 08 for young 20 year old and small dbh 10 6 cm and sparse mongolian scots pines stands density 104 trees ha song et al 2018 4 3 tr pr during the seven year period considered in this study the total transpiration of mongolian scots pine during the growing season varied between 138 4 and 275 1 mm the average ratio of total transpiration to total precipitation during the growing season tr pr was 0 42 0 12 the highest ratio 0 60 was registered during a typical moderately dry year 2014 while the smallest ratio 0 25 was noticed during a wet year 2016 the above values are obviously lower than the tr pr value obtained for a 49 year old scots pine in the russian boreal forest 0 67 urban et al 2019 but significantly higher than those obtained from a sparse wood grassland ecosystem with mongolian scots pine at a density of 104 trees ha near our study site 0 045 0 066 song et al 2018 overall these results indicate that the transpiration of mongolian scots pine plantations basically matches the amount of local precipitation during a two year drought period between 2014 and 2015 the tree transpiration diminished by 49 7 this reduction is considerably higher than that reported for 60 year old scots pine stands after the famous drought that occurred in europe during the summer of 2003 25 poyatos et al 2005 after the occurrence of the serious 2014 2015 drought in 2016 the year with the highest precipitation registered during the whole study period the tr increased by 56 then after another severely dry year and a normal year the tr increased by 94 in 2019 concerning the water use capacity of forests the process of restoration after long term droughts tends to be much slower than that of reduction during droughts martin gomez et al 2017 mcdowell et al 2008 the main reason for this likely is the death of a large number of fine roots and or the occurrence of defoliation rather than xylem embolism which would lead to a decrease in water absorption and assimilation irvine et al 1998 eilmann et al 2013 additionally severe drought events may induce long term physiological disorders which would lead to a prolonged recovery time for surviving individuals galiano et al 2011 the climax community of the semiarid sandy regions in the study area has been considered as a sparse wood grassland or meadow steppe the tr pr values in the actual forest stand with a density of 625 trees ha never exceeded 0 6 this tr pr value was lower than that calculated for nearby natural shrubs ecosystem dominated by caragana microphylla 0 66 yue et al 2008 suggesting that the transpiration use of the mongolian scots pine forest was not the main reason for the deterioration of soil moisture in the study area interestingly agricultural land and broadleaved forests together accounted for 60 of the total water consumption in this area while mongolian scots pine plantations accounted for 12 zheng et al 2012 based on this information it would be better to strengthen arbor tree dominated shelterbelts on sandy land rather than replace them nevertheless the management of pine forest ecosystems with low total tree population density and wide line spacing is a promising adaptive strategy for mitigating the adverse impacts of drought on forest growth bottero et al 2017 4 4 tr vpd vpd is the major variable deduced from the meteorological factors that determine tree transpiration in conifer forests the canopy conductance tends to be much smaller than the aerodynamic conductance hence a high degree of coupling is expected between conifer canopies and the atmosphere jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 transpiration clearly changes in response to vpd variations novick et al 2016 thereby tr vpd values reflect most of the information on canopy conductance that can calculated through penman monteith s equation including its modified or simplified form jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 köstner et al 1992 through the analysis of derived indexes e g the canopy conductance in scots pine it was found that scots pine usually has a strong ability to regulate water and stabilize water relations due to its isohydric behavior and water saving strategy poyatos et al 2008 leo et al 2013 in fact this tree species can effectively reduce canopy water loss according to changes in the environmental conditions and avoid permanent xylem embolism irvine et al 1998 poyatos et al 2005 urban et al 2019 a sensitive response of water use on vpd has also been reported for mongolian scots pine dang et al 2019a song et al 2020 in this study the threshold value of soil moisture rew that induced a sharply reduction of tr vpd at the monthly scale was found to be at 0 41 although this value is nearly equal to that previously reported for several ecosystems 0 4 bréda et al 1995 granier et al 1999 bernier et al 2002 poyatos et al 2005 based on the boundary analyses we considered it valid only under ideal soil texture conditions under sandy soil conditions it should actually be smaller the threshold point rew 0 35 derived from our field observations at the daily scale was slightly 0 31 dang et al 2019b interestingly the transpiration of scots pine stops has been reported to stop when rew 0 2 or 0 25 lagergren and lindroth 2002 vincke and thiry 2008 during the growing season we usually found rew 0 2 our data do not support the idea of a null sap flux based transpiration even during severely drought days when rew0 1 m was as low as 0 03 overall this indicates a strong adaptation of the investigated mongolian scots pine specimens to a low soil moisture habitat through for example stem water storage after a long lasting drought in the wettest year of our study period 2016 the tr vpd did not show a strong recovery but it did so two years later this fact agrees with the supposed limited recovery of pine species e g scots pine over short periods of time guada et al 2016 4 5 water budgets balance water consumption in the studied mongolian scots pine dominated ecosystem did not seem to rely on groundwater during the growing season the et deduced from the variation of soil moisture within the upper 2 m of soil profile generally did not exceeded the precipitation amount however it did so in 2017 a dry year when et p 1 this might be explained by a considerable soil water storage derived from abundant precipitation in 2016 and is consistent with a previous study in which the soil moisture necessary for et during non successional droughts was inferred to be provided by antecedent precipitation diao et al 2021 our study in which tr pr 0 6 and the average groundwater level 5 47 m supports the idea that mongolian scots pine plantations do not contribute much to water resource consumption or in particular to the decline of the groundwater level zheng et al 2012 in fact these plants tend to use soil water which does not contribute to groundwater recharge or streamflow evaristo et al 2015 the degradation of mongolian scots pine and poplar trees within the great green wall in northern china has been proven to be a consequence of climate change and anthropogenic induced declines in groundwater rather than their cause as long as kept a proper magnitude sun et al 2018 a fragile habitat rather than the simple water requirement of trees seems to have tightened the hydrological budget of the mongolian scots pine ecosystem besides keeping a proper tree density practical management measures for the decrease of under canopy et should aim at diversifying the forest structure and composition moreover a reduction of the water quotient dedicated to agriculture is recommended for mitigating the drought effects 5 conclusion the soil moisture conditions in a sandy land located in a semi arid area characterized by low soil water capacity great inter and intra annual variabilities in precipitation vertical soil moisture depletion patterns and a declining groundwater level over time provide a harsh habitat for trees the low water availability at the study site tightened the tree water relationships of mongolian scots pines that were planted to create a shelterbelt forest for wind breaking and sand fixing the transpiration of the mongolian scots pine specimens never exceeded 60 of the annual precipitation and never exceeded 77 of the evapotranspiration in the ecosystem these results refute the over consumption of local water resources by this tree species as long as there is a proper density of specimens the experimentally deduced relative extractable soil water threshold that triggered the reduction of transpiration capability was 0 41 at the daily timescale and 0 35 at the monthly timescale highlighting the strong drought resistance of mongolian scots pine overall our results underline how soil moisture conditions represent a cause rather than a consequence of the degradation of mongolian scots pine moreover they emphasize the importance of combatting climate change related impacts on water use by forest management during the prevalence of unfavorable

10101,characterizing the soil moisture environment in the plantation ecosystems may provide substantial information for judging the stability of forests in relation to climate change in this study we explored the level and the variations of water availability as well as their influence on tree water use in the long term this was achieved by monitoring in particular the volumetric soil water content θ the groundwater level the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd and the sap flux based forest transpiration tr in a sand fixation plantation of mongolian scots pine in northern china the results showed a significant inter and intra annual variability of annual precipitation pr for an average standard deviation of 476 139 mm over the past 16 year study period the inter annual variations of the groundwater level showed a general downward trend decreasing from 4 82 to 6 13 m the relative extractable soil water rew between 0 1 m and between 1 2 m depth along soil profile was only 0 29 0 14 and 0 16 0 08 respectively indicating a decreasing of soil moisture capacity and of the moisture depletion patterns with depth the statistics relative to the past seven years between 2013 2019 indicate an average tr of 193 59 mm for mongolian scots pines notably their transpiration capability tr vpd declined with the decrease of rew0 1 m the boundary curve showed a clear exponential decline the threshold value of rew0 1 m deduced from an abrupt decrease of tr vpd was 0 41 and 0 35 at the daily and monthly timescales respectively the average tr pr value was 0 42 maximum 0 60 and tr accounted on average for 55 of the total evapotranspiration maximum 77 soil drought prevailed at the study site however we did not notice a heavy use of soil water resources by mongolian scots pine the results overall underlined the causes rather than the consequences of the observed soil moisture conditions which are leading to the degradation of mongolian scots pine forest management measures causing moderate disturbance are hence recommended for mitigating the water competition between mongolian scots pine and sub canopy vegetation keywords soil moisture sap flow groundwater table mongolian scots pine drought 1 introduction climate change is expected to induce serious negative impacts on the water availability and therefore to greatly intensify regional scale droughts cook et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2018 in arid and semi arid areas the most obvious effects of climate change besides an air temperature increase closely related to the atmospheric water demand i e vapor pressure deficit vpd is a great variability in the total annual amounts and in the monthly distribution of precipitation a reduction of the water holding capacity and organic matter content of soils may exacerbates this climatic drought effects pereira et al 2004 climate change related droughts have globally led to abrupt changes in the attributes of various ecosystems causing declines in plant productivity and soil fertility as well as in vegetation coverage and richness choat et al 2018a berdugo et al 2020 soil droughts have also significantly affected the physiological activity of plants from different points of view and even induced tree mortality under extreme conditions anderegg et al 2015 drought induced tree mortality has been observed worldwide across multiple forest biomes mueller et al 2005 allen et al 2010 buras et al 2018 choat et al 2018a for example scots pine pinus sylvestris l a species widely distributed across europe is experiencing degradation in many distribution areas giuggiola et al 2010 2013 sanchez costa et al 2015 especially in the iberian peninsula areas martinezvilalta and pinol 2002 morán lópez et al 2014 in northeastern spain poyatos et al 2008 llorens et al 2010 in southeastern spain guada et al 2016 martin gomez et al 2017 in the french alps barros et al 2017 in the scottish highlands wang et al 2019 in inner alpine dry valleys pichler and oberhuber 2007 weber et al 2007 giuggiola et al 2010 2013 swidrak et al 2011 leo et al 2013 wieser et al 2014 in siberia urban et al 2019 and in mongolia dulamsuren et al 2009 scots pine is characterized by a superficial root system with a strong first pivot and more lateral roots than most broadleaved species which is conducive to capture precipitation efficiently but also makes the trees prone to drought stress čermák and nadezhdina 2008 merlin et al 2015 presently scots pine is being affected by a drought induced decline of water use and growth in most of its distribution areas morán lópez et al 2014 previous studies have indicated that the summer droughts of varying duration and intensity and specifically extreme drought episodes are causing severe tree defoliation and increasing the mortality rates of scots pine and other tree species pichler and oberhuber 2007 sanchez costa et al 2015 water use by transpiration is one of the most basic physiological processes of plants and the dominant variables in the regional hydrological cycle for many ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions reduced precipitation is the most direct cause of reduced transpiration productivity and weakened growth in trees all together these processes potentially can hinder the survival and growth of trees he et al 2020 more than 40 of the resistance to water transportation between the soil and the canopy top of the scots pine is located in the rhizosphere perämäki et al 2001 therefore soil water availability apparently plays a great role in determining the growing and the survival of plants together with their adaptability to changing environmental conditions galiano et al 2011 brinkmann et al 2016 horqin sandy land is the largest sandy land in china with an area of 5 23 106 hm2 yan et al 2014 to effectively prevented the development of land desertification in the context of the chinese large scale planting project named three north shelter forest program or great green wall sandy land mainly occupied by mongolian scots pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica has been afforested since the 1950s the total area of the mongolian scots pine plantation in horqin sand land is 11 7 104 hm2 yan 2014 the creation of mongolian scots pine sand fixing forests not only provided strong protection to farm and or pasture fields from wind and sand hazards but has also significantly improved the soil habitat by inducing higher soil c n and c p ratios than in grasslands and in the chinese elm savanna zeng et al 2009 however more than 30 years later after the tree planting the degradation and mortality of mongolian scots pine forests in this area started to occur worsening over time song et al 2015 at present the great green wall has attracted widespread attention not only for its great contribution in the mitigation of climate change chen et al 2019 but also due to worries about the possible hydrological consequences of its establishment zastrow 2019 the main concern is the possible over consumption of local water resources by the mongolian scots pine this derives from the comparison between the hydrothermal conditions in the natural distribution area of this tree species in china at 47 n and in its introduction area at 42 n some studies have inferred that the high atmospheric evaporation demand in the introduction area brought by the over consumption of water by the mongolian scots pine would cause a water imbalance in the ecosystem song et al 2020 for this reason it has been suggested to convert these pine plantations into chinese savanna song et al 2018 other studies have instead suggested that the mongolian scots pine just like the scots pine is a typical isohydric species capable of avoiding excessive water losses through its sensitive stoma regulation which operates when a soil water deficit occurs leo et al 2013 meanwhile several studies have reported that in mongolian scots pine specimens 85 of the roots are distributed in the upper 60 cm of soil zhu et al 2008 while 98 of them are distributed within the uppermost meter of soil zhu et al 2005 meng et al 2018 therefore the claim that mongolian scots pine plantations deteriorate the regional water environment especially the deep soil water reservoir or the groundwater level lacks convincing evidences zheng et al 2012 generally local environmental conditions can considerably influence the adaptation ability of trees the soil properties control the stomatal response of plants to droughts rather than their xylem vulnerability in medium wet to dry soils carminati and javaux 2020 statistics on data collected over past 34 years have shown a climate change related decreasing trend in the annual precipitation and an increasing trend in the air temperature at our study site dang et al 2019a these results suggest that the impacts of dramatic inter and intra annual changes in precipitation on vegetation have become more serious over time in this context the analysis of soil moisture quantity and quality which are tightly linked to soil attributes and precipitation may provide deep insights into the drought resistance of mongolian scots pines and allow the prediction of succession dynamics under various climate change scenarios this study tried to answer the following questions are the sites in horqin sandy land amenable for the establishment of mongolian scots pine forests is the environment threatening the survival of mongolian scots pine or the reverse we hence aimed to 1 clarifying the basic water resource characteristics allowing tree transpiration 2 determining the tree response in terms of water use to different degrees of soil drought and possible threshold values 3 clarifying the characteristics of the plantation water balance for future forest management through the long term continuous monitoring of precipitation soil moisture groundwater level and sap flux based transpiration we provided robust evidence that clarifies the interaction mechanisms between the tree water use and the soil water environment moreover we explored the potential for drought mitigation via forest management 2 materials and methods 2 1 site experiments were conducted at the zhanggutai national desertification control experimental station which is located at the southern edge of the horqin sandy land area liaoning province china 122 22 e 42 43 n at 226 5 m a s l between 2004 and 2019 we selected a 40 ha section of a 26 year old mongolian scots pine shelterbelt forest as the object of this study the inter row and in row spacings in the sample forest were both 4 m resulting in a stem density of 625 stems ha notably the study area was characterized by a semi arid and continental monsoon climate over a period of 30 years between 1983 and 2012 the annual mean air temperature was 7 9 c with a frost free period of 155 days the annual pan evaporation 1553 mm and the annual precipitation 475 mm about 92 of precipitation fell from may to september during the main growing season the soil was characterized by an aeolian sand texture it consisted of sand particles 0 05 mm 84 silt particles between 0 05 and 0 002 mm 9 and clay particles 0 002 mm 7 the soil bulk density was 1 61 g cm3 and the capillary porosity 33 furthermore the soil was barren with a mean organic matter content of 0 65 g kg in the uppermost meter zheng et al 2012 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 meteorological data micrometeorological data i e radiation air temperature ta relative humidity rh wind speed and precipitation were measured by an automatic weather station ar5 avalon scientific inc nj usa located in an open area 50 m away from the experimental plot the above variables were recorded every 10 min by a data logger and

ec 5 probes meter group inc pullman wa usa this type of data was collected at 10 min intervals and averaged at hourly or daily scales site specific calibrations were conducted before the experiments by installing the ech2o ec 5 probes along the soil profiles at the three above mentioned sites and by analyzing samples of soils through the core oven drying method the samples were dried for more

density measurements the sap flux density js in cm s in the outer 0 3 cm of the xylem in a sample tree was measured continuously by using thermal dissipation sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa we installed the sensors at a 1 3 m height on the north side of the stems the probe spacing of these sensors was 0 04 m notably the sensors were shielded with a reflective foil that extended down to 1 m

water the temperature difference between the two probes was measured at 10 min intervals and recorded every hour by using sq2040 data loggers grant instruments ltd cambridge uk only the upper needle of a probe was supplied with a constant power of 0 15 0 2 w the measurements continued during the entire growing season each year at the end of this season each year we removed all probes from the trees then we re installed them at the beginning of the successive growing season in early april to minimize the possibility of signal dampening moore et al 2010 js was calculated from the measured temperature differences between the two probes by using granier s original equation granier 1987 3 j s 119 10 4 δ t 0 δ t δ t 1 231 where δt is the measured temperature difference between the heated

the sapwood area as in cm2 at the probe installation section 4 q t j s 0 56 a s 3600 the sap flux density in the inner layers decreased sharply with the increasing of the sapwood thickness due to the relative inactivity of the inner xylem therefore considering the radial velocity profile and the typical radius of scots pine specimens we adopted a correct coefficient value of 0 56 nadezhdina et al 2002 lu et al 2004 to estimate the average sap flux density along the whole sapwood thickness in total eleven trees were installed each year in a 400 m2 plot for the monitoring of js in 2013 the trees

study area were collected from 2004 while the sap flow was measured from 2013 therefore the calculations of the transpiration tr annual soil water capacity within the upper 2 m c0 2 m and other related variables were done based on data collected between 2013 and 2019 based on the annual precipitation pr data collected between 2004 and 2019 and a series of classification levels barros et al

interacted determining seasonal variations in transpiration therefore relative indexes i e js vpd and tr vpd were adopted to eliminate the effects of atmospheric factors and correctly describe the response of transpiration to variable soil moisture tognetti et al 2004 hernandez santana et al 2016 the relationship between js vpd and rew was fitted by a widely reported exponential equation poyatos et al 2013 sanchez costa et al 2015 the daily average vpd for values 0 6 kpa was computed instead from time ewers and oren 2000 an analysis of variance anova analysis was finally performed

variations in the long term series the statistics for the 16 year study period 2004 2019 revealed that multiple year pr in the study area was 476 mm 139 mm of which 94 occurred during the growing season from april to october the pr value varied significantly between different years p 0 05 with a coefficient variation cv of 0 29 the highest and lowest pr values were 772 6 mm registered in 2012 and 285 9 mm registered in 2009 respectively by comparing the annual pr values with the multiple year averages we identified 2005 2010 2012 2013 and 2016 as wet years characterized by significant positive precipitation anomalies meanwhile 2008 2018 and 2019 were normal years with pr values close to the mean moreover 2006 2007 2009 2011 2014 2015 and 2017 were dry years with high negative precipitation anomalies of these two were severely dry 2009 and 2017 with pr values of 285 9 and 337 0 mm respectively and the remaining five were moderately dry the dry years accounted for 43 8 of the total fig 1a the soil moisture statistics for the 16 year study period 2004 2019 showed that the forest land had a low water holding capacity the multi year average of the volumetric soil water content within the uppermost meter of the soil profile θ0 1 m was 6 7 2 1 while that for the soil layer between 1 and 2 m θ1 2 m was 4 7 1 2 the soil moisture in each profile varied greatly between different years the cv values for θ0 1 m and θ1 2 m were 0 31 and 0 26 respectively basically the inter annual variations of θ0 1 m were consistent but it did not always correspond exactly with those of pr for example the soil water content in the severely dry year 2009 was the lowest registered during the whole period θ0 1 m and θ1 2 m were 3 7 and 3 2 respectively the pr value in 2012 was higher than in 2013 i e 772 6 mm vs 554 2 mm however the θ0 1 m values were higher in 2013 than in 2012 10 3 and 5 5 respectively similar relationships were noted between the parameters calculated for 2017 and 2018 θ0 1 m was higher in a typical severely dry year than that in a normal year due to a higher amount of precipitation in 2016 fig 1b in fact a sufficient amount of precipitation in the previous year kept the soil moisture at a relative high level at the beginning of the successive year improving the overall level of soil moisture the level of relative extractable soil water was low during the 16 year study period average rew0 1 m 0 29 0 14 in the first nine years 2004 2012 the rew0 1 m values were always lower than the soil drought threshold value 0 31 except in 2005 in the driest year of this period 2009 the average rew0 1 m reached its minimum value 0 09 whereas in the wettest year 2013 it reached its maximum 0 53 notably the mean rew0 1 m in 2006 the year with the highest groundwater level over the whole study period was only 0 16 fig 1c during the whole period considered the annual rew1 2 m was always 0 31 except in 2016 moreover the multi year average was 0 16 0 08 and the minimum value registered was 0 06 in 2009 in the wettest year 2012 the mean rew1 2 m was only 0 19 far lower than the threshold value of 0 31 notably the mean rew1 2 m was only 0 09 in 2006 when the highest groundwater level of the 16 year study period was recorded during four years i e between 2007 and 2009 and in 2014 the average annual rew1 2 m was 0 08 corresponding to 20 of the field water holding capacity and to a volumetric soil water content of 3 5 fig 1c the roots distributed in the deepest part of the soil profiles were in a serious water deficit state during these years over the 16 year study period the groundwater level showed relatively gentle peak valley variations for a multi year average of 5 47 0 37 m and a cv of 0 07 two groundwater level peaks corresponded to years 2006 4 82 m and 2013 5 00 m while the two valleys corresponded to years 2009 5 81 m and 2018 6 13 m fig 1d although the inter annual variations of groundwater level were generally consistent with those of annual precipitation there was a certain degree of non correspondence e g obvious hysteresis phenomena for example the highest groundwater level 4 82 m of the whole study period was observed in 2006 but the pr in the last year 567 6 mm was higher than that in the current year 346 6 mm another peak of groundwater level 5 00 m occurred in 2013 and again but the pr in the last year 772 6 mm was higher than that in the current year 554 2 mm the occurrence of two valleys of groundwater level in 2009 and 2018 was consistent with the low precipitation levels registered in the preceding 3 4 years rather than with the precipitation levels registered in the year before 2008 and 2017 respectively or in 2009 and 2018 3 2 seasonal dynamics of pr rew0 1 m ta and vpd the statistics for the 16 year study period showed a normal intra annual distribution of precipitation in the study area a rapid increasing period occurred from january to july with monthly averages comprised between 1 23 1 82 and 145 2 78 5 mm fig 2 from then on the monthly precipitation rapidly decreased reaching an average value of 2 2 2 8 mm in december notably the seasonal variations of rew0 1 m were inconsistent with the seasonal precipitation dynamics the lowest average soil moisture rew0 1 m 0 25 0 12 occurred in june during the growing season from then on with the rainy season approaching the average soil moisture rose rapidly in august the rew0 1 m value reached 0 34 0 16 after that it began to decline reaching 0 26 0 16 at the end of the growing season in april at the beginning of the growing season the soil moisture conditions were better than in june rew0 1 m 0 30 0 20 in april this was likely mainly due to snow melting the seasonal temperature dynamics also displayed a typical normal distribution the average temperature which in march was 0 61 1 89 c reached its maximum 24 2 0 6 c in july and then gradually dropped reaching 10 0 1 7 c in december fig 2 the seasonal distribution of vpd was characterized instead by a sharply left skewed normal distribution fig 2 the average monthly vpd values rapidly increased from january to may reaching a maximum of 0 97 0 15 kpa in the latter month showing a downward trend afterward during the entire growing season from april to june the vpd values were relatively high 0 66 kpa then they decreased slightly and remained relatively stable from july to september between 0 55 and 0 58 kpa finally dropping to 0 44 0 08 kpa in october the monthly vpd averages during the growing season between 0 44 and 0 97 kpa were significantly higher than during the non growing season between 0 11 and 0 35 kpa in summary the temperature rose rapidly from april to june in concomitance with high vpd values and low precipitation and soil moisture levels hindering vegetation growth in june the survival of mongolian scots pines in the study area seemed to be particularly at risk according to the pr rew0 1 m and vpd levels droughts were particularly frequent in this month 3 3 limitations in the replenishment of the soil moisture storage capacity by precipitation the recent seven year sub period including typical dry and wet years from 2013 to 2019 were selected to calculate the soil storage capacity within 2 m soil profile c0 2 m during the main growing seasons first we calculated the available storage capacity of the upper 2 m of soil profile with rew 0 31 c0 2 m ava which was equal to 140 24 mm between 2013 and 2019 the annual average c0 2 m varied greatly from 148 7 to 99 0 116 6 175 5 135 4 136 9 and lastly 157 6 mm on most days the c0 2 m values were lower than the c0 2 m ava values but they were larger than those during a few rainy months during the 344 day period comprised between september 13 2013 and august 19 2015 the c0 2 m values were always lower than the c0 2 m ava values except on 12 days when they were slightly higher than the c0 2 m ava values a similar situation occurred during the 264 day perid comprised between may 25 2017 and august 12 2018 in this case the c0 2 m values were slightly higher than the c0 2 m ava values only on 34 days fig 3 this situation led to a serious soil deficit our statistics showed that during the main growing season precipitation could be well supplemented by the storage capacity of the upper 2 m of soil the fitting of the monthly data indicated that the replenishment ratio of the average soil storage capacity by precipitation the sum of positive c0 2 m values calculated by daily comparisons and as a percentage of the total precipitation over the same period was 77 7 for the whole year and that it increased to 79 6 during the growing season this implied that the interception loss of precipitation was 20 the statistics of the soil moisture content levels categorized according to the soil drought classification standard showed that generally days in which the rew0 1 m values indicated mildly moderately or severely drought conditions accounted for 33 of the total study period notably drought conditions were verified for 62 of the days in 2014 and for 50 of those in 2015 more specifically 33 of days in 2014 were characterized by moderately drought conditions while only 10 of them were characterized by severely drought conditions in that year within the 1 2 m soil layer drought conditions were verified for 83 of the days between 2013 and 2019 notably the rew1 2 m values for years 2014 and 2018 indicated the occurrence of drought conditions throughout the growing season specifically the rew1 2 m values suggested the occurrence of severely drought conditions for 86 of the days in 2014 fig 4 three days about one month apart in the moderately dry year 2015 i e june 11 july 11 and august 11 were selected to highlight a decline of soil moisture over time as well as in the soil water retention capacity on june 11 2015 the soil was fully wetted by the cumulated total precipitation 139 mm and the rew values were between 0 89 and 0 97 in the upper 40 cm of soil while below that level they dropped with increasing soil depth reaching 0 06 0 11 below 120 cm depth on july 11 2015 the cumulated total precipitation was 35 4 mm and the rew in the upper 40 cm of soil dropped by 68 83 on average moreover the deep soil moisture significantly diminished as well on august 11 2015 the cumulated total precipitation was 29 8 mm and the rew values in the upper 40 cm dropped by 81 87 on average while below 120 cm they declined to 0 0 03 a level close to the wilt soil water point fig 5 these data indicate that even after a full re saturation of the soil the soil moisture along the root profile could quickly drop below the threshold value 0 31 in less than one month 3 4 tr pr and tr et the statistics of the sapflux based transpiration tr by mongolian scots pine during the main growing season showed that the annual transpiration of the forest between 2013 and 2019 varied from 275 1 to 230 8 141 7 153 6 156 6 138 4 and 258 2 mm tr in 2015 decreased by 48 5 than that in 2013 during the experiment the average annual ratio of total transpiration to total precipitation in the growing season tr pr was 0 42 0 12 the highest value 0 60 was observed for year 2014 while the lowest for year 2016 0 25 the total evapotranspiration et was calculated by summing the absolute values of all negative values that were previously obtained by subtracting the c0 2 m of consecutive days the results showed that between the et values varied from 391 5 to 368 9 294 0 379 3 416 0 289 3 and 335 8 mm meanwhile the average ratio of total transpiration to evapotranspiration tr et was 0 55 0 15 the maximum value 0 77 was identified in year 2019 while the minimum value 0 38 was identified in year 2017 fig 6 3 5 tr vpd variations with soil moisture to further clarify the influence of soil moisture condition on the daily transpiration capability of mongolian scots pine the relationship between the deduced variable tr vpd and rew0 1 m were analyzed at daily monthly and annual scales fig 7 at the daily timescale we identified a clear boundary that fitted with an exponential function although the relationship between tr vpd and rew0 1 m was complicated fig 7a the highest tr vpd value identified for the study period was 3 30 mm day kpa on july 17 2013 at the monthly timescale a clear boundary was noticed between tr vpd and rew0 1 m fig 7b additionally the highest monthly average value was 79 mm month kpa in july 2013 between 2013 and 2015 the annual average values of tr vpd varied from 359 9 to 265 7 and 154 4 mm yr kpa while the tr vpd values declined with decreasing rew0 1 m afterward the relationship between tr vpd and rew0 1 m became unclear fig 7c from 2015 2016 the tr vpd value 174 2 mm yr kpa in 2016 increased by only 12 8 while the rew0 1 m values increased by 83 from 2017 2018 the tr vpd values decreased from 190 6 to 176 3 mm yr kpa while the rew0 1 m values declined by 11 finally in 2019 the tr vpd reached 292 1 mm yr kpa due to an increase in soil moisture and the average rew0 1 m grew to 0 49 the boundary fitted equations are listed below 6 t r v p d d a i l y 3 27092 1 e 11 33336 r e w 0 1 m 0 17496 r adj 2 0 92 7 t r v p d m o n t h l y 79 5497 1 e 18 72839 r e w 0 1 m 0 18991 r adj 2 0 96 the derivation of the boundary fitted functions from eqs 6 and 7 showed that the soil moisture thresholds associated with rapid changes in the transpiration of mongolian scots pine were following rew 0 35 at the daily timescale and rew 0 41 at the monthly timescale no boundary fitting was conducted at the annual scale due to sparse data available for this analysis 4 discussion 4 1 sand texture determined vulnerability of soil water capacity in this study the vulnerability of soil moisture in a mongolian scots pine plantation ecosystem was examined based on three aspects the rew the variability of precipitation and the effectiveness of the groundwater level relative to the root distribution our results provided basic quantitative information about these indictors which together can explain the vulnerability of soil water capacity the soil at the study site had a relatively low water holding capacity with multi year average rew0 1 m and rew1 2 m values of 0 29 0 14 and 0 16 0 08 respectively both considerably lower than 0 4 a value that has been widely reported for several ecosystems triggering water stress bréda et al 1995 granier et al 1999 bernier et al 2002 poyatos et al 2005 a 3 5 week period with no rain when the soil extractable water reaches 25 of its maximum value can induce the stomatal regulation of water use in scots pine specimens growing on sandy soil in the humid temperate belgian campine region vincke and thiry 2008 at our study site precipitation fell mainly in the form of short and intense events notably the occurrence of intense precipitation for 10 mm per day is ineffective for the replenishment of soil moisture due to canopy interception loss han et al 2012 ineffective rainfall periods lasting for 1 month occurred frequently during the growing season likely providing a harsh growing habitat for trees gymnosperm and conifer dominated ecosystems have often exhibited an increased vulnerability under multiple droughts choat et al 2018a anderegg et al 2020 hence we infer that the frequent severe soil droughts observed between 2014 and 2015 at our study site might have caused the deterioration of the mongolian scots pine dominated ecosystem the water required for the growth of mongolian scots pine seemed hence highly dependent on the occurrence of relatively seasonal and uniformly distributed effective precipitation rather than on the historical water stored in soil the habitat of mongolian scots pine ecosystem at the study site was characterized by relatively poor precipitation for arbor forests with a great inter annual variability 2 7 times and a pulsed storm pattern during the rainy season these characteristics were all unfavorable to the maintenance of an environment with ideal soil moisture conditions during the growing season notably wet multi year climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought induced mortality by stimulating shifts in their hydraulic architecture effectively predisposing them to water stress mcdowell et al 2008 another major factor was the canopy interception loss rate which amounted to 16 25 of the total precipitation at the study site han et al 2012 and significantly reduced the amount of soil moisture harvested from precipitation however the sandy texture of the soil greatly increased the partition of the soil moisture flux moving back to the atmosphere or to groundwater hindering the maintenance of soil moisture to good levels and leading to longer periods of exhausted soil water availability for mongolian scots pine although the contribution of groundwater to et through vertical capillary transportation in the rooted soil has been hypothesized in many ecosystems vincke and thiry 2008 its effect seems to be mostly negligible for the mongolian scots pine stands at our study site the shallow rootedness of mongolian scots pine is similar to that of scots pines for which the tree rooting depth in a sandy loam soil in the russian boreal forest was 1 m urban et al 2019 the groundwater level at our site was generally low during the 16 year study period with multi year averages of 5 47 0 37 m close to the maximum root depths of 5 2 m jiao 1989 and 5 7 m zhu et al 2005 reported by previous scholars specifically there were five years in 2009 2010 2016 2017 and 2018 in which the groundwater level was below 5 7 m reaching a minimum of 6 13 m in 2018 meanwhile the height of the water vapor rising through capillary transportation from sandy soils with particle sizes 0 05 mm was far less than 1 m vincke and thiry 2008 this information supports our conclusion that the influence of mongolian scotch pine on the groundwater level is negligible or at least minimal notably this conclusion seems to contradict the results of previous studies based on stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope methods which have reported a 10 14 contribution of mongolian scots pine to the transport of groundwater and its release through transpiration song et al 2016a 2016b the weak water holding capability of the sand textured soil the scarce water resources derived from the pulsed storm pattern and the low groundwater level all contributed to increase the vulnerability of the abiotic environment strategies for deep soil water acquisition have been critical for the adaptation of several plant species to drought conditions breshears et al 2009 millard and way 2011 anderegg et al 2015 but are difficult to apply for the adaptation of mongolian scots pine at our site the continuous decline of the groundwater level in fact aggravated the degradation of the mongolian scots pine ecosystem which was already inherently fragile in its water environment zhu et al 2005 the mongolian scots pine specimens in our study area underwent a more serious water stress than the scots pine specimens investigated in europe llorens et al 2010 vincke and thiry 2008 which had at their disposition shallower groundwater resources and or less sandy soil 4 2 tr et land surface models and stand level measurements have revealed that terrestrial tr et values usually vary between 0 57 and 0 80 evaristo et al 2015 wei et al 2017 scots pine has been considered as a typical water saving tree species which has demonstrated a strong adaptation to soil drought during periods of high evaporative demands leo et al 2013 wieser et al 2014 for example in the belgian campine region characterized by a humid temperate climate a scots pine specimen with dbh 28 96 cm and stand density 359 trees ha was associated to a tr et value of 0 25 vincke and thiry 2008 whereas a 49 year old scots pine with dbh 25 cm and leaf area index lai 2 67 located in central siberia subjected to an annual precipitation of 431 mm was associated to a tr et value of 0 67 urban et al 2019 these data suggest that the tr et value of scots pine tends to be higher in areas characterized by a semi arid climate rather than by a humid one our seven year measurements revealed that the average tr et value of mongolian scots pine individuals in sandy soil subjected to a semi arid temperate climate and having dbh 17 2 cm and stand density 625 trees ha was 0 55 maximum 0 77 and minimum 0 38 apart from geographical and climatic factors the tr et values was mainly determined by the stands traits it was relatively low between 0 06 and 0 08 for young 20 year old and small dbh 10 6 cm and sparse mongolian scots pines stands density 104 trees ha song et al 2018 4 3 tr pr during the seven year period considered in this study the total transpiration of mongolian scots pine during the growing season varied between 138 4 and 275 1 mm the average ratio of total transpiration to total precipitation during the growing season tr pr was 0 42 0 12 the highest ratio 0 60 was registered during a typical moderately dry year 2014 while the smallest ratio 0 25 was noticed during a wet year 2016 the above values are obviously lower than the tr pr value obtained for a 49 year old scots pine in the russian boreal forest 0 67 urban et al 2019 but significantly higher than those obtained from a sparse wood grassland ecosystem with mongolian scots pine at a density of 104 trees ha near our study site 0 045 0 066 song et al 2018 overall these results indicate that the transpiration of mongolian scots pine plantations basically matches the amount of local precipitation during a two year drought period between 2014 and 2015 the tree transpiration diminished by 49 7 this reduction is considerably higher than that reported for 60 year old scots pine stands after the famous drought that occurred in europe during the summer of 2003 25 poyatos et al 2005 after the occurrence of the serious 2014 2015 drought in 2016 the year with the highest precipitation registered during the whole study period the tr increased by 56 then after another severely dry year and a normal year the tr increased by 94 in 2019 concerning the water use capacity of forests the process of restoration after long term droughts tends to be much slower than that of reduction during droughts martin gomez et al 2017 mcdowell et al 2008 the main reason for this likely is the death of a large number of fine roots and or the occurrence of defoliation rather than xylem embolism which would lead to a decrease in water absorption and assimilation irvine et al 1998 eilmann et al 2013 additionally severe drought events may induce long term physiological disorders which would lead to a prolonged recovery time for surviving individuals galiano et al 2011 the climax community of the semiarid sandy regions in the study area has been considered as a sparse wood grassland or meadow steppe the tr pr values in the actual forest stand with a density of 625 trees ha never exceeded 0 6 this tr pr value was lower than that calculated for nearby natural shrubs ecosystem dominated by caragana microphylla 0 66 yue et al 2008 suggesting that the transpiration use of the mongolian scots pine forest was not the main reason for the deterioration of soil moisture in the study area interestingly agricultural land and broadleaved forests together accounted for 60 of the total water consumption in this area while mongolian scots pine plantations accounted for 12 zheng et al 2012 based on this information it would be better to strengthen arbor tree dominated shelterbelts on sandy land rather than replace them nevertheless the management of pine forest ecosystems with low total tree population density and wide line spacing is a promising adaptive strategy for mitigating the adverse impacts of drought on forest growth bottero et al 2017 4 4 tr vpd vpd is the major variable deduced from the meteorological factors that determine tree transpiration in conifer forests the canopy conductance tends to be much smaller than the aerodynamic conductance hence a high degree of coupling is expected between conifer canopies and the atmosphere jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 transpiration clearly changes in response to vpd variations novick et al 2016 thereby tr vpd values reflect most of the information on canopy conductance that can calculated through penman monteith s equation including its modified or simplified form jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 köstner et al 1992 through the analysis of derived indexes e g the canopy conductance in scots pine it was found that scots pine usually has a strong ability to regulate water and stabilize water relations due to its isohydric behavior and water saving strategy poyatos et al 2008 leo et al 2013 in fact this tree species can effectively reduce canopy water loss according to changes in the environmental conditions and avoid permanent xylem embolism irvine et al 1998 poyatos et al 2005 urban et al 2019 a sensitive response of water use on vpd has also been reported for mongolian scots pine dang et al 2019a song et al 2020 in this study the threshold value of soil moisture rew that induced a sharply reduction of tr vpd at the monthly scale was found to be at 0 41 although this value is nearly equal to that previously reported for several ecosystems 0 4 bréda et al 1995 granier et al 1999 bernier et al 2002 poyatos et al 2005 based on the boundary analyses we considered it valid only under ideal soil texture conditions under sandy soil conditions it should actually be smaller the threshold point rew 0 35 derived from our field observations at the daily scale was slightly 0 31 dang et al 2019b interestingly the transpiration of scots pine stops has been reported to stop when rew 0 2 or 0 25 lagergren and lindroth 2002 vincke and thiry 2008 during the growing season we usually found rew 0 2 our data do not support the idea of a null sap flux based transpiration even during severely drought days when rew0 1 m was as low as 0 03 overall this indicates a strong adaptation of the investigated mongolian scots pine specimens to a low soil moisture habitat through for example stem water storage after a long lasting drought in the wettest year of our study period 2016 the tr vpd did not show a strong recovery but it did so two years later this fact agrees with the supposed limited recovery of pine species e g scots pine over short periods of time guada et al 2016 4 5 water budgets balance water consumption in the studied mongolian scots pine dominated ecosystem did not seem to rely on groundwater during the growing season the et deduced from the variation of soil moisture within the upper 2 m of soil profile generally did not exceeded the precipitation amount however it did so in 2017 a dry year when et p 1 this might be explained by a considerable soil water storage derived from abundant precipitation in 2016 and is consistent with a previous study in which the soil moisture necessary for et during non successional droughts was inferred to be provided by antecedent precipitation diao et al 2021 our study in which tr pr 0 6 and the average groundwater level 5 47 m supports the idea that mongolian scots pine plantations do not contribute much to water resource consumption or in particular to the decline of the groundwater level zheng et al 2012 in fact these plants tend to use soil water which does not contribute to groundwater recharge or streamflow evaristo et al 2015 the degradation of mongolian scots pine and poplar trees within the great green wall in northern china has been proven to be a consequence of climate change and anthropogenic induced declines in groundwater rather than their cause as long as kept a proper magnitude sun et al 2018 a fragile habitat rather than the simple water requirement of trees seems to have tightened the hydrological budget of the mongolian scots pine ecosystem besides keeping a proper tree density practical management measures for the decrease of under canopy et should aim at diversifying the forest structure and composition moreover a reduction of the water quotient dedicated to agriculture is recommended for mitigating the drought effects 5 conclusion the soil moisture conditions in a sandy land located in a semi arid area characterized by low soil water capacity great inter and intra annual variabilities in precipitation vertical soil moisture depletion patterns and a declining groundwater level over time provide a harsh habitat for trees the low water availability at the study site tightened the tree water relationships of mongolian scots pines that were planted to create a shelterbelt forest for wind breaking and sand fixing the transpiration of the mongolian scots pine specimens never exceeded 60 of the annual precipitation and never exceeded 77 of the evapotranspiration in the ecosystem these results refute the over consumption of local water resources by this tree species as long as there is a proper density of specimens the experimentally deduced relative extractable soil water threshold that triggered the reduction of transpiration capability was 0 41 at the daily timescale and 0 35 at the monthly timescale highlighting the strong drought resistance of mongolian scots pine overall our results underline how soil moisture conditions represent a cause rather than a consequence of the degradation of mongolian scots pine moreover they emphasize the importance of combatting climate change related impacts on water use by forest management during the prevalence of unfavorable

10102,the effect of regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies on fruit yield and quality at harvest and during cold storage at 5 c of wonderful pomegranates was studied three irrigation strategies were tested control strategy c using farm irrigation with 100 of crop evaporation etc and two rdi strategies where 25 of etc was applied during flowering and fruit set rdi 1 and during the final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 the rdi 1 approach reduced the pomegranate yield conversely the rdi 2 allowed a similar pomegranate yield to c treatment fruit morphological characteristics were not affected by rdi at harvest and during cold storage both rdi strategies resulted in fruits with higher aril percentages physicochemical parameters of fruits at harvest and during cold storage were not affected by irrigation strategies except the total soluble solids content that was higher in fruits from rdi 2 than in those from c and rdi 1 during storage a reduction of the fruit weight and size was observed particularly in the first 15 days of storage the total soluble solids content and titratable acidity decrease while ph increases with storage at harvest and during cold storage the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity evaluated by abts assay did not differ among irrigation treatments whereas using a frap assay fruits from rdi trended to have higher antioxidant activity than those from c treatment total phenolic content and abts values were lower at the final of storage time than on the first day present results showed that rdi strategies applied in a final phase of fruit growth and ripening could be a convenient irrigation strategy for commercial wonderful orchards in the south of portugal allowing improve the fruit quality with a water saving of 14 6 keywords punica granatum l wonderful regulated deficit irrigation fruit quality postharvest cold storage 1 introduction pomegranate punica granatum l is a fruit very appreciated by consumers due to its organoleptic characteristics and health properties the growing consumer interest for this fruit associated with high adaptation of the pomegranate tree to various edaphoclimatic conditions has promoted the expansion of this crop in many regions of the world commercial orchards of pomegranate trees have been growing in the mediterranean basin and its cultivation is now emerging in portugal particularly in new irrigation areas of alentejo south of portugal the irrigation perimeter of alqueva reaches 120 000 ha of irrigated area and another 50 000 ha are planned for the coming years edia 2019 the water availability had allowed the growth of traditional crops like olive and grapevine but also the implantation of new crops in this region such as almond or pomegranate in portugal the cultivated surface of pomegranate is still much lower than that of other countries of the mediterranean basin reaching 475 ha in 2018 60 of which are in the alentejo region ine 2019 pomegranate is considered as a drought tolerant crop holland et al 2009 however when is cultivated in arid and semiarid regions regular irrigation throughout the season is required to prevent the fruit physiopathies and optimize the growth yield and fruit quality galindo et al 2014b intrigliolo et al 2013 similar to other regions of the southern mediterranean alentejo is dominated by an arid and semi arid climate mainly characterized by hot dry summers rainy winters and wet spring and autumn galindo et al 2018 models predict that climate changes will be more pronounced in southern europe with an alarming increase of temperature and more frequent and severe drought periods in the mediterranean region christensen and christensen 2007 giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias and garrote 2015 the expected climate changes will have a negative impact on water availability for crops and irrigation in alentejo rocha et al 2020 a mediterranean region that already has limited water resources to cope the water scarcity it is urgent to adopt more efficient irrigation strategies to improve water saving without compromise the fruit yield and quality and also without put the feasibility of perennial crops at serious risk regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a water saving strategy that consists in the reduction of irrigation or non irrigation during the water stress tolerance phenological phases non critical periods while full irrigation is applied during the water stress sensitive phenological phases critical periods galindo et al 2018 martínez nicolás et al 2019 this deficit irrigation strategy has been successfully applied in pomegranate to save water without or with a slight impact on fruit yield volschenk 2020 moreover results also showed that when applied in specific phenological periods rdi can be a tool to control fruit ripening timing improve the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of fruit and the postharvest performance galindo et al 2014a 2017 laribi et al 2013 despite promising results on the application of rdi on pomegranate yield and quality are also variable probably due to different cultivars edaphoclimatic conditions or agronomic practices reinforcing the importance to the development of research for each pomegranate cultivar and under local condition volschenk 2020 in portugal there are still few studies on irrigation water management in pomegranate orchards using rdi strategies studies on the application of rdi in pomegranate have mainly focused on mollar de elche cultivar and in a minor extent on wonderful cultivar volschenk 2020 wonderful is one of the pomegranate cultivars that has been implemented in the south of portugal still the information about irrigation management of the wonderful orchard in this edaphoclimatic condition is limited the present experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different irrigation strategies in a wonderful orchard installed in baixo alentejo region south of portugal on fruit yield and physicochemical characteristics at harvest and during cold storage to test the hypothesis that the application rdi in this pomegranate cultivar in this region can improve the water saving without compromise the fruit yield and quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and irrigation treatments the field experiment was conducted in 2018 on a commercial pomegranate tree orchard cv wonderful located in beja southern of portugal the trial took place in an irrigated pomegranate orchard with 5 years old and a 5 5 m x 3 5 m compass about 516 trees ha 1 with natural cover crop

texture varies from sandy loam to sandy clay loam according to the usda soil texture triangle with low organic matter content 2 18 and ph close to neutral alentejo is a csa climate region according to the köppen geiger climate classification meteorological data were collected by an automatic weather station located in quinta da saúde beja portugal 37 99734º n 7 81038º w elevation 236 m about 8 km far from the experimental site precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax and reference crop evapotranspiration eto during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the irrigation started on 29 march lasted until november 2018 and it was conducted three times a week using a drip irrigation system formed by self compensating drippers 0 5 m apart from each other with a debit of 2 2 l h 1 the three irrigation strategies were the following control c farm irrigation where irrigation was scheduled to replace 100 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc rdi 1 regulated deficit irrigation 1 where trees were irrigated at 25 of etc from 29 june to 30 july matching with flowering to initial fruit growth and at 100 of etc in the remaining phases of the crop cycle rdi 2 regulated deficit irrigation 2 where trees were irrigated at 25 of etc from 10 august to 30 october harvest coinciding with the non linear phase of fruit growth to maturation and at 100 of etc in the remaining phases of the crop cycle both deficit irrigation strategies adopted were based on the farmer s irrigation control the water stress applied to fruit trees was based on the farmer s calculation of etc weekly quantified according to the fao methodology for controlling the water consumption of the crops the kc values used by the farmer are 0 63 0 69 0 70 0 68 and 0 53 in june july august september and october respectively water stress was applied by reducing the duration of the irrigation period since the water flow rates were constant in all trial the total amount of water applied in each irrigation treatment were 274 9 247 4 and 234 9 mm for c rdi 1 and rdi 2 respectively fig 2 the experimental design was randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment each experimental plot had twenty trees in four columns three central trees of each plot with similar in appearance ground shaded area height leaf area trunk cross sectional area etc were used for measurements and fruit harvest while the other seventeen trees served as border trees the agricultural management practices were identical in all irrigation treatments and concerning fertilization nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k were applied monthly from the beginning of the irrigation campaign until two weeks before harvest the total amounts of nutrients provided were 121 uf n ha 63 uf p ha and 197 uf k ha 2 2 marketable yield fruits collection and postharvest storage conditions pomegranate fruits above 85 mm of diameter at commercial maturity and without injures were harvested on 31 october to determine the marketable yield it was also quantified the number of cracked fruits in each irrigation strategy and the percentage of non marketable fruits of the total fruits which includes cracked fruit and fruit of low commercial value fruits bellow 85 mm of diameter some of these fruits and transported to the cebal laboratory a 10 min trip to evaluate the quality attributes five fruits per tree totalizing 15 fruits from each replicate and 45 per treatment were used for physicochemical analysis at harvest moreover 20 pomegranate fruits from each replicate 7 from 2 trees and 6 from 1 tree totalizing 60 fruits per treatment were used to evaluate the impact of irrigation strategy on fruit physicochemical attributes during cold storage these fruits were kept at 5 1 ºc and 80 83 rh during 15 30 45 and 64 days at each storage day 15 fruits per treatment were randomly selected for analysis 2 3 fruit physicochemical analysis all fruits were weighted mettler toledo pb1501 0 1 g accuracy

a mixed procedure of sas considering the irrigation treatment as the main effect for the effect of storage time on fruit quality a mixed procedure of sas was performed considering irrigation treatment it storage time st and interaction of irrigation treatment and storage time it st as main effects significant differences between means were determined by the differences of least squares means test at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 marketable yield and fruit physicochemical characteristics at harvest irrigation water restriction applied from flowering to initial fruit growth rdi 1 reduced 20 the marketable yield of pomegranate when compared to full irrigation p 0 016 30 3 vs 37 9 kg tree 1 in c and rdi 1 treatments respectively table 1 however the marketable yield of pomegranate did not differ between the farm irrigation c and application of water restriction during the period of non linear phase of fruit growth to maturation rdi 2 34 4 kg tree 1 the number of cracking fruits and proportion of non marketable fruit was higher in rdi 1 than in c treatment 37 vs 10 fruits tree 1 while in rdi 2 treatment these parameters did not differ from c and rdi 1 treatments the morphological characteristics of pomegranate fruits were not affected by irrigation treatments with average values of 376 5 g for fruit weight 92 5 mm for equatorial diameter ed 92 6 mm for fruit length fl and 1 00 for ed fl ratio table 1 flowering and fruit set period is considered as a non critical period for pomegranate period culture intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 and application of irrigation water restriction at 25 of etc during the period coinciding with flowering fruit set and early fruit growth has been appointed as the best rdi strategy for mollar de elche pomegranate trees without effect on fruit production intrigliolo et al 2013 moreover not effect on total and marketable yield was observed in wonderful and mollar de elche cultivars when irrigation was withheld during the flowering fruit set period martínez nicolás et al 2019 the lower pomegranate marketable yield observed in rdi 1 treatment resulted from the higher number of cracking fruits in this treatment than in other irrigation treatments table 1 while the total yield and number of fruits per tree were not affected results not shown which is in accordance with other reports intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 the ripening stage has been considered as a critical period for pomegranate production galindo et al 2017 however the impact of water deficit during pomegranate ripening on yield has been inconsistent galindo et al 2014a 2018 intrigliolo et al 2013 laribi et al 2013 irrigation water restriction during final phase of fruit growth and ripening to mollar de elche trees led to inconsistent results among three consecutive seasons with a negative impact on pomegranate yield and fruit weight only in one season intrigliolo et al 2013 laribi et al 2013 on the other hand galindo et al 2017 reported for the mollar de elche cultivar the reduction of the pomegranate marketable yield and fruit weight when longer withholding periods during ripening phase 15 25 and 36 days before harvest were applied while the irrigation restriction only at the late ripening stage 6 days before harvest did not affect the marketable fruit yield and size in the present work the application of water restriction at 25 of etc during non linear phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 to wonderful trees did not affect the fruit yield and morphological characteristics probably the water stress during ripening stage was not enough to induce adverse effects on pomegranate productivity galindo et al 2017 factors such as the environmental condition and the different sensibility to water stress of pomegranate cultivars adiba et al 2021 and during ripening stage galindo et al 2017 can contribute to inconsistency among results both irrigation water restriction treatments rdi 1 and rdi 2 increased the proportion of pomegranate arils compared to the c treatment p 0 023 46 9 vs 50 0 table 1 the improvement of aril proportion by applying deficit irrigation was also reported by other authors in mollar de elche pomegranates mellisho et al 2012 parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 pomegranate colour is one of the most important quality parameters for consumer choice being the redness associated with high nutritional value and healthy properties the colour parameters of pomegranate peel and arils were not affected by irrigation treatment table 2 martínez nicolás et al 2019 also did not found changes in peel colour of wonderful and mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation was withheld during the flowering and fruit set period on the other hand an increase of the redness and darkness of the fruit peel was verified in mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation water restriction was applied during ripening period galindo et al 2017 laribi et al 2013 mellisho et al 2012 in contrast with our results martínez nicolás et al 2019 reported the increase of the a values in arils from wonderful and mollar de elche cultivars subject to water restriction during the flowering and fruit set period application of koalin treatment to prevent pomegranate sunburn protect the fruit against sunlight exposure which can explain the absence of impact of irrigation water restriction on colour of pomegranate peel and arils observed in our work the ph 2 9 ta 2 0 citric acid tss ta ratio 8 33 and firmness 29 45 n of pomegranate arils were also not affected by irrigation treatment table 3 the tss content of arils was affected by irrigation treatment p 0 001 with higher values in arils from rdi 2 treatment 17 0 ºbrix than in arils from c and rdi 1 treatments 15 7 ºbrix such result agrees with other authors who reported higher aril tss content in mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation water restriction 25 and 33 of etc was applied during ripening period laribi et al 2013 mellisho et al 2012 in wonderful pomegranates an increase in sugar content was reported with water irrigation at 60 of etc during fruit growth and ripening cano lamadrid et al 2018 the increase of the tss content in arils could be a response to water stress induced by irrigation restriction during by ripening stage laribi et al 2013 the tpc and antioxidant activity determined by abts assay were not affected by irrigation treatments table 3 only there was a trend p 0 060 for the increase of the antioxidant activity determined by frap assay in rdi 1 and rdi 2 fruits comparatively to fruits from control treatment 490 4 and 560 7 mg fe 100 ml 1 juice in arils from the c and rdi treatments respectively table 3 according to our finds other authors also did not observe effect on arils tpc when irrigation water restriction was applied in different stages of phenological cycle galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 selahvarzi et al 2017 however the impact of deficit irrigation on arils tpc has been diverse with reports of tpc increase in pomegranate subject to water withheld from the beginning of the growing season until the end of fruit set stage selahvarzi et al 2017 or progressive reduction of tpc with an increase in the number of water withholding days before harvest galindo et al 2017 as it happens for tpc the antioxidant activity response to deficit irrigation has been inconsistent according to our results laribi et al 2013 did not found effect of three different rdi treatments two of them the same as those applied in the present study on the antioxidant activity of pomegranate arils at harvest selahvarzi et al 2017 also reported that deficit irrigation treatment did not affect arils antioxidant activity the water withholds during ripening period also did not affect the arils antioxidant activity galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 oxidative stress induced by water shortage has been associated with an increase in the biosynthesis of the phenolic compounds and an increase in the antioxidant activity in fruits and vegetables fortier et al 2010 mellisho et al 2012 oh et al 2009 toscano et al 2019 however in present work like in other studies the irrigation water restriction applied during flowering and fruit set rdi 1 and final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 did not lead to an increase in the synthesis of phenolic compounds or an increase in antioxidant activity the inconsistent effect of deficit irrigation on pomegranate bioactive compounds synthesis and antioxidant activity might be explained by several factors such as cultivar used edaphoclimatic conditions tree age harvest time and water restriction severity selahvarzi et al 2017 in the present work the water stress applied to pomegranate trees may not have been enough to promote the synthesis of phenolic compounds and increase the antioxidant activity in fruits 3 2 effect of storage time on quality of pomegranates produced under different irrigation strategies the physicochemical characteristics of pomegranate fruits changed over 64 days of cold storage while irrigation treatments did not affect the fruit attributes during conservation time tables 4 5 and 6 the most significant changes in the pomegranates morphological characteristics were recorded in the first 15 days of storage table 4 with reduction of 29 84 g in fruit weight p 0 021 loss of 7 9 5 22 mm in equatorial diameter p 0 001 loss of 6 5 and 14 76 mm in fruit length p 0 001 loss of 16 between days 15 and 64 days of storage the fruit weight equatorial diameter and fruit length remained constants the aril percentage increased 5 4 p 0 002 between days 0 and 64 of storage the peel porosity of the pomegranate fruit which allows the free water vapour movement from the peel makes this fruit highly prone to weight loss during postharvest handling and storage elyatem and kader 1984 the fruit weight changes during cold storage observed in the present study are accompanied by the increase of the aril proportion with consequent reduction of the peel proportion in the pomegranate fruit suggesting that the weight loss is mainly related to the water loss in the peel the fruit weight loss observed in the present study was small and similar to that found in molar de elche laribi et al 2013 or in bhagwa and ruby fawole and opara 2013 pomegranates cold stored 5 ºc during 8 weeks according to our results laribi et al 2013 also did not observe effect of equal irrigation water restriction and in the same phenological periods on the fruit weight loss along 8 weeks of storage colour changes in pomegranate peel and arils over cold storage are reported by several authors however such changes are not always consistent fawole and opara 2013 laribi et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 peña et al 2013 in the present work the colour changes in peel and arils during storage were independent of the irrigation treatment being only affected by storage time table 5 in peel the b and c values increased throughout storage time and l values were higher on the last day of storage than on previous days the a values increased in the first 15 days of storage but then return to initial values the h values tended to increase during conservation time particularly at the last day of storage p 0 060 regarding arils the a b and c values reduced until 30 days of storage remained unchanged until the last day of storage the h values showed changes over conservation time with a lower value at 30 days of storage than in other storage days the δe which allows assessing the overall variation of colour during storage remained fairly constant between 15 and 64 days of storage in peel and remained unchanged over cold storage in arils suggesting a minor colour change in the pomegranate peel and arils over storage time like what happened at harvest rdi 2 fruits presented a higher tss content p 0 019 14 36 brix when compared to other irrigation treatments 13 19 brix table 6 however the behavior of the tss content over the storage time was similar among treatments decreasing progressively throughout 45 days of storage from 16 38 brix at day 0 to 11 94 brix at day 45 p 0 001 and then remained unchanged until day 64 of storage the decrease of tss content in pomegranate fruit during storage is in agreement with other authors arendse et al 2015 fawole et al 2020 fawole and opara 2013 which could occur due to the degradation of sugars fawole and opara 2013 the ph and ta of pomegranate arils were not affected by irrigation treatments but changed throughout storage time p 0 001 the ph increased from 2 91 to 3 24 and ta decreased from 2 09 to 1 50 g 100 ml 1 between days 0 and 64 of storage table 6 the tss ta ratio showed changes with storage time but the values did not differ between the first and last day of storage table 6 the ph increases and ta reduction during storage are consistent once these two parameters are inversely proportional moreover the increase in ph throughout storage time can be related to the utilization of organic acids which is in accordance with the reduction of tss content with storage fawole et al 2020 the arils firmness remained unchanged during the first 15 days of storage reducing at day 30 of storage p 0 012 at days 45 and 64 of storage the firmness values were equal to found for days 0 and 30 reduction of the arils firmness could be due to loss in cell wall integrity of aril related to the senescence process that continues throughout storage time arendse et al 2015 fawole et al 2020 nanda et al 2001 the tpc was affected by the storage time p 0 001 increasing in the first 15 days of storage 156 4 174 1 mg gae 100 ml 1 juice at days 0 and 15 respectively and then decreasing for the lowest tpc at day 30 of storage 116 4 mg gae 100 ml 1 juice at days 45 and 64 of storage the tpc was equal to initial values the initial increase in tpc could be a result of phenolic compounds concentration which is consistent with weight loss during the first days of storage however the subsequent reduction in the arils tpc could be related to the degradation of phenolic compounds arendse et al 2014 fawole et al 2020 fawole and opara 2013 antioxidant activity determined by abts assay was not affected by irrigation treatment but varied with storage time showing lower values after 15 days of storage than in the first day of storage otherwise for antioxidant activity evaluated by frap assay there was a trend for interaction between irrigation treatment and storage time p 0 05 fig 3 despite poor consistent changes over storage time arils from each irrigation treatment showed equal frap values at days 0 and 64 of storage in both storage days the arils from the c treatment had lower frap values than those from rdi treatments between deficit irrigation treatments the rdi 2 fruits showed higher frap values than rdi 1 fruits the higher antioxidant activity determined by frap assay in arils from rdi treatments along storage is consistent with the trend for higher frap values in these fruits at harvest 4 conclusions present results showed that rdi strategies are a good water saving approach to use in wonderful pomegranate orchards of the mediterranean area in the present study application of the irrigation water restriction during flowering and fruit set period rdi 1 did not affect the physicochemical attributes of pomegranate fruits at harvest and during cold storage however the irrigation water restriction at the final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 besides 15 water savings allowed improvement in the arils tss content and antioxidant activity changes in the physicochemical characteristics of fruits during cold storage were independent of the irrigation strategies applied to pomegranate trees present results showed that the application of regulated deficit irrigation strategies in wonderful pomegranate orchards did not compromise the physicochemical characteristics of fruit or even allowed to improve the quality of the pomegranate regular application of these irrigation strategies is increasingly important to cope the expected

10102,the effect of regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies on fruit yield and quality at harvest and during cold storage at 5 c of wonderful pomegranates was studied three irrigation strategies were tested control strategy c using farm irrigation with 100 of crop evaporation etc and two rdi strategies where 25 of etc was applied during flowering and fruit set rdi 1 and during the final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 the rdi 1 approach reduced the pomegranate yield conversely the rdi 2 allowed a similar pomegranate yield to c treatment fruit morphological characteristics were not affected by rdi at harvest and during cold storage both rdi strategies resulted in fruits with higher aril percentages physicochemical parameters of fruits at harvest and during cold storage were not affected by irrigation strategies except the total soluble solids content that was higher in fruits from rdi 2 than in those from c and rdi 1 during storage a reduction of the fruit weight and size was observed particularly in the first 15 days of storage the total soluble solids content and titratable acidity decrease while ph increases with storage at harvest and during cold storage the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity evaluated by abts assay did not differ among irrigation treatments whereas using a frap assay fruits from rdi trended to have higher antioxidant activity than those from c treatment total phenolic content and abts values were lower at the final of storage time than on the first day present results showed that rdi strategies applied in a final phase of fruit growth and ripening could be a convenient irrigation strategy for commercial wonderful orchards in the south of portugal allowing improve the fruit quality with a water saving of 14 6 keywords punica granatum l wonderful regulated deficit irrigation fruit quality postharvest cold storage 1 introduction pomegranate punica granatum l is a fruit very appreciated by consumers due to its organoleptic characteristics and health properties the growing consumer interest for this fruit associated with high adaptation of the pomegranate tree to various edaphoclimatic conditions has promoted the expansion of this crop in many regions of the world commercial orchards of pomegranate trees have been growing in the mediterranean basin and its cultivation is now emerging in portugal particularly in new irrigation areas of alentejo south of portugal the irrigation perimeter of alqueva reaches 120 000 ha of irrigated area and another 50 000 ha are planned for the coming years edia 2019 the water availability had allowed the growth of traditional crops like olive and grapevine but also the implantation of new crops in this region such as almond or pomegranate in portugal the cultivated surface of pomegranate is still much lower than that of other countries of the mediterranean basin reaching 475 ha in 2018 60 of which are in the alentejo region ine 2019 pomegranate is considered as a drought tolerant crop holland et al 2009 however when is cultivated in arid and semiarid regions regular irrigation throughout the season is required to prevent the fruit physiopathies and optimize the growth yield and fruit quality galindo et al 2014b intrigliolo et al 2013 similar to other regions of the southern mediterranean alentejo is dominated by an arid and semi arid climate mainly characterized by hot dry summers rainy winters and wet spring and autumn galindo et al 2018 models predict that climate changes will be more pronounced in southern europe with an alarming increase of temperature and more frequent and severe drought periods in the mediterranean region christensen and christensen 2007 giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias and garrote 2015 the expected climate changes will have a negative impact on water availability for crops and irrigation in alentejo rocha et al 2020 a mediterranean region that already has limited water resources to cope the water scarcity it is urgent to adopt more efficient irrigation strategies to improve water saving without compromise the fruit yield and quality and also without put the feasibility of perennial crops at serious risk regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a water saving strategy that consists in the reduction of irrigation or non irrigation during the water stress tolerance phenological phases non critical periods while full irrigation is applied during the water stress sensitive phenological phases critical periods galindo et al 2018 martínez nicolás et al 2019 this deficit irrigation strategy has been successfully applied in pomegranate to save water without or with a slight impact on fruit yield volschenk 2020 moreover results also showed that when applied in specific phenological periods rdi can be a tool to control fruit ripening timing improve the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of fruit and the postharvest performance galindo et al 2014a 2017 laribi et al 2013 despite promising results on the application of rdi on pomegranate yield and quality are also variable probably due to different cultivars edaphoclimatic conditions or agronomic practices reinforcing the importance to the development of research for each pomegranate cultivar and under local condition volschenk 2020 in portugal there are still few studies on irrigation water management in pomegranate orchards using rdi strategies studies on the application of rdi in pomegranate have mainly focused on mollar de elche cultivar and in a minor extent on wonderful cultivar volschenk 2020 wonderful is one of the pomegranate cultivars that has been implemented in the south of portugal still the information about irrigation management of the wonderful orchard in this edaphoclimatic condition is limited the present experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different irrigation strategies in a wonderful orchard installed in baixo alentejo region south of portugal on fruit yield and physicochemical characteristics at harvest and during cold storage to test the hypothesis that the application rdi in this pomegranate cultivar in this region can improve the water saving without compromise the fruit yield and quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and irrigation treatments the field experiment was conducted in 2018 on a commercial pomegranate tree orchard cv wonderful located in beja southern of portugal the trial took place in an irrigated pomegranate orchard with 5 years old and a 5 5 m x 3 5 m compass about 516 trees ha 1 with natural cover crop between lines and conducted with a wire tutor system the experimental work was carried out on a plot of 3 ha where soil features were very much homogeneous and also representative of all orchards soil texture varies from sandy loam to sandy clay loam according to the usda soil texture triangle with low organic matter content 2 18 and ph close to neutral alentejo is a csa climate region according to the köppen geiger climate classification meteorological data were collected by an automatic weather station located in quinta da saúde beja portugal 37 99734º n 7 81038º w elevation 236 m about 8 km far from the experimental site precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax and reference crop evapotranspiration eto during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the irrigation started on 29 march lasted until november 2018 and it was conducted three times a week using a drip irrigation system formed by self compensating drippers 0 5 m apart from each other with a debit of 2 2 l h 1 the three irrigation strategies were the following control c farm irrigation where irrigation was scheduled to replace 100 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc rdi 1 regulated deficit irrigation 1 where trees were irrigated at 25 of etc from 29 june to 30 july matching with flowering to initial fruit growth and at 100 of etc in the remaining phases of the crop cycle rdi 2 regulated deficit irrigation 2 where trees were irrigated at 25 of etc from 10 august to 30 october harvest coinciding with the non linear phase of fruit growth to maturation and at 100 of etc in the remaining phases of the crop cycle both deficit irrigation strategies adopted were based on the farmer s irrigation control the water stress applied to fruit trees was based on the farmer s calculation of etc weekly quantified according to the fao methodology for controlling the water consumption of the crops the kc values used by the farmer are 0 63 0 69 0 70 0 68 and 0 53 in june july august september and october respectively water stress was applied by reducing the duration of the irrigation period since the water flow rates were constant in all trial the total amount of water applied in each irrigation treatment were 274 9 247 4 and 234 9 mm for c rdi 1 and rdi 2 respectively fig 2 the experimental design was randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment each experimental plot had twenty trees in four columns three central trees of each plot with similar in appearance ground shaded area height leaf area trunk cross sectional area etc were used for measurements and fruit harvest while the other seventeen trees served as border trees the agricultural management practices were identical in all irrigation treatments and concerning fertilization nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k were applied monthly from the beginning of the irrigation campaign until two weeks before harvest the total amounts of nutrients provided were 121 uf n ha 63 uf p ha and 197 uf k ha 2 2 marketable yield fruits collection and postharvest storage conditions pomegranate fruits above 85 mm of diameter at commercial maturity and without injures were harvested on 31 october to determine the marketable yield it was also quantified the number of cracked fruits in each irrigation strategy and the percentage of non marketable fruits of the total fruits which includes cracked fruit and fruit of low commercial value fruits bellow 85 mm of diameter some of these fruits and transported to the cebal laboratory a 10 min trip to evaluate the quality attributes five fruits per tree totalizing 15 fruits from each replicate and 45 per treatment were used for physicochemical analysis at harvest moreover 20 pomegranate fruits from each replicate 7 from 2 trees and 6 from 1 tree totalizing 60 fruits per treatment were used to evaluate the impact of irrigation strategy on fruit physicochemical attributes during cold storage these fruits were kept at 5 1 ºc and 80 83 rh during 15 30 45 and 64 days at each storage day 15 fruits per treatment were randomly selected for analysis 2 3 fruit physicochemical analysis all fruits were weighted mettler toledo pb1501 0 1 g accuracy measured the equatorial diameter ed mm and fruit length fl mm from calix to the base using a caliper with 170 mm 0 05 mm before peeling the external colour of the fruit was evaluated then fruits were peeled manually and the arils and peel were weighted for determination of the edible and non edible proportion of fruit part of the arils were used to perform colour and texture analysis while the other part was squeezed to obtain juice and kept at 80 ºc until further analysis 2 3 1 colour of pomegranate peel and arils to determine peel colour four measurements of equidistant points on equatorial region of each individual fruit were made using a konica minolta cr 400 colorimeter osaka japan the colour of arils were evaluated in different sub samples of arils from the same fruit with

a mixed procedure of sas considering the irrigation treatment as the main effect for the effect of storage time on fruit quality a mixed procedure of sas was performed considering irrigation treatment it storage time st and interaction of irrigation treatment and storage time it st as main effects significant differences between means were determined by the differences of least squares means test at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 marketable yield and fruit physicochemical characteristics at harvest irrigation water restriction applied from flowering to initial fruit growth rdi 1 reduced 20 the marketable yield of pomegranate when compared to full irrigation p 0 016 30 3 vs 37 9 kg tree 1 in c and rdi 1 treatments respectively table 1 however the marketable yield of pomegranate did not differ between the farm irrigation c and application of water restriction during the period of non linear phase of fruit growth to maturation rdi 2 34 4 kg tree 1 the number of cracking fruits and proportion of non marketable fruit was higher in rdi 1 than in c treatment 37 vs 10 fruits tree 1 while in rdi 2 treatment these parameters did not differ from c and rdi 1 treatments the morphological characteristics of pomegranate fruits were not affected by irrigation treatments with average values of 376 5 g for fruit weight 92 5 mm for equatorial diameter ed 92 6 mm for fruit length fl and 1 00 for ed fl ratio table 1 flowering and fruit set period is considered as a non critical period for pomegranate period culture intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 and application of irrigation water restriction at 25 of etc during the period coinciding with flowering fruit set and early fruit growth has been appointed as the best rdi strategy for mollar de elche pomegranate trees without effect on fruit production intrigliolo et al 2013 moreover not effect on total and marketable yield was observed in wonderful and mollar de elche cultivars when irrigation was withheld during the flowering fruit set period martínez nicolás et al 2019 the lower pomegranate marketable yield observed in rdi 1 treatment resulted from the higher number of cracking fruits in this treatment than in other irrigation treatments table 1 while the total yield and number of fruits per tree were not affected results not shown which is in accordance with other reports intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 the ripening stage has been considered as a critical period for pomegranate production galindo et al 2017 however the impact of water deficit during pomegranate ripening on yield has been inconsistent galindo et al 2014a 2018 intrigliolo et al 2013 laribi et al 2013 irrigation water restriction during final phase of fruit growth and ripening to mollar de elche trees led to inconsistent results among three consecutive seasons with a negative impact on pomegranate yield and fruit weight only in one season intrigliolo et al 2013 laribi et al 2013 on the other hand galindo et al 2017 reported for the mollar de elche cultivar the reduction of the pomegranate marketable yield and fruit weight when longer withholding periods during ripening phase 15 25 and 36 days before harvest were applied while the irrigation restriction only at the late ripening stage 6 days before harvest did not affect the marketable fruit yield and size in the present work the application of water restriction at 25 of etc during non linear phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 to wonderful trees did not affect the fruit yield and morphological characteristics probably the water stress during ripening stage was not enough to induce adverse effects on pomegranate productivity galindo et al 2017 factors such as the environmental condition and the different sensibility to water stress of pomegranate cultivars adiba et al 2021 and during ripening stage galindo et al 2017 can contribute to inconsistency among results both irrigation water restriction treatments rdi 1 and rdi 2 increased the proportion of pomegranate arils compared to the c treatment p 0 023 46 9 vs 50 0 table 1 the improvement of aril proportion by applying deficit irrigation was also reported by other authors in mollar de elche pomegranates mellisho et al 2012 parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 pomegranate colour is one of the most important quality parameters for consumer choice being the redness associated with high nutritional value and healthy properties the colour parameters of pomegranate peel and arils were not affected by irrigation treatment table 2 martínez nicolás et al 2019 also did not found changes in peel colour of wonderful and mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation was withheld during the flowering and fruit set period on the other hand an increase of the redness and darkness of the fruit peel was verified in mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation water restriction was applied during ripening period galindo et al 2017 laribi et al 2013 mellisho et al 2012 in contrast with our results martínez nicolás et al 2019 reported the increase of the a values in arils from wonderful and mollar de elche cultivars subject to water restriction during the flowering and fruit set period application of koalin treatment to prevent pomegranate sunburn protect the fruit against sunlight exposure which can explain the absence of impact of irrigation water restriction on colour of pomegranate peel and arils observed in our work the ph 2 9 ta 2 0 citric acid tss ta ratio 8 33 and firmness 29 45 n of pomegranate arils were also not affected by irrigation treatment table 3 the tss content of arils was affected by irrigation treatment p 0 001 with higher values in arils from rdi 2 treatment 17 0 ºbrix than in arils from c and rdi 1 treatments 15 7 ºbrix such result agrees with other authors who reported higher aril tss content in mollar de elche pomegranates when irrigation water restriction 25 and 33 of etc was applied during ripening period laribi et al 2013 mellisho et al 2012 in wonderful pomegranates an increase in sugar content was reported with water irrigation at 60 of etc during fruit growth and ripening cano lamadrid et al 2018 the increase of the tss content in arils could be a response to water stress induced by irrigation restriction during by ripening stage laribi et al 2013 the tpc and antioxidant activity determined by abts assay were not affected by irrigation treatments table 3 only there was a trend p 0 060 for the increase of the antioxidant activity determined by frap assay in rdi 1 and rdi 2 fruits comparatively to fruits from control treatment 490 4 and 560 7 mg fe 100 ml 1 juice in arils from the c and rdi treatments respectively table 3 according to our finds other authors also did not observe effect on arils tpc when irrigation water restriction was applied in different stages of phenological cycle galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 selahvarzi et al 2017 however the impact of deficit irrigation on arils tpc has been diverse with reports of tpc increase in pomegranate subject to water withheld from the beginning of the growing season until the end of fruit set stage selahvarzi et al 2017 or progressive reduction of tpc with an increase in the number of water withholding days before harvest galindo et al 2017 as it happens for tpc the antioxidant activity response to deficit irrigation has been inconsistent according to our results laribi et al 2013 did not found effect of three different rdi treatments two of them the same as those applied in the present study on the antioxidant activity of pomegranate arils at harvest selahvarzi et al 2017 also reported that deficit irrigation treatment did not affect arils antioxidant activity the water withholds during ripening period also did not affect the arils antioxidant activity galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 oxidative stress induced by water shortage has been associated with an increase in the biosynthesis of the phenolic compounds and an increase in the antioxidant activity in fruits and vegetables fortier et al 2010 mellisho et al 2012 oh et al 2009 toscano et al 2019 however in present work like in other studies the irrigation water restriction applied during flowering and fruit set rdi 1 and final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 did not lead to an increase in the synthesis of phenolic compounds or an increase in antioxidant activity the inconsistent effect of deficit irrigation on pomegranate bioactive compounds synthesis and antioxidant activity might be explained by several factors such as cultivar used edaphoclimatic conditions tree age harvest time and water restriction severity selahvarzi et al 2017 in the present work the water stress applied to pomegranate trees may not have been enough to promote the synthesis of phenolic compounds and increase the antioxidant activity in fruits 3 2 effect of storage time on quality of pomegranates produced under different irrigation strategies the physicochemical characteristics of pomegranate fruits changed over 64 days of cold storage while irrigation treatments did not affect the fruit attributes during conservation time tables 4 5 and 6 the most significant changes in the pomegranates morphological characteristics were recorded in the first 15 days of storage table 4 with reduction of 29 84 g in fruit weight p 0 021 loss of 7 9 5 22 mm in equatorial diameter p 0 001 loss of 6 5 and 14 76 mm in fruit length p 0 001 loss of 16 between days 15 and 64 days of storage the fruit weight equatorial diameter and fruit length remained constants the aril percentage increased 5 4 p 0 002 between days 0 and 64 of storage the peel porosity of the pomegranate fruit which allows the free water vapour movement from the peel makes this fruit highly prone to weight loss during postharvest handling and storage elyatem and kader 1984 the fruit weight changes during cold storage observed in the present study are accompanied by the increase of the aril proportion with consequent reduction of the peel proportion in the pomegranate fruit suggesting that the weight loss is mainly related to the water loss in the peel the fruit weight loss observed in the present study was small and similar to that found in molar de elche laribi et al 2013 or in bhagwa and ruby fawole and opara 2013 pomegranates cold stored 5 ºc during 8 weeks according to our results laribi et al 2013 also did not observe effect of equal irrigation water restriction and in the same phenological periods on the fruit weight loss along 8 weeks of storage colour changes in pomegranate peel and arils over cold storage are reported by several authors however such changes are not always consistent fawole and opara 2013 laribi et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 peña et al 2013 in the present work the colour changes in peel and arils during storage were independent of the irrigation treatment being only affected by storage time table 5 in peel the b and c values increased throughout storage time and l values were higher on the last day of storage than on previous days the a values increased in the first 15 days of storage but then return to initial values the h values tended to increase during conservation time particularly at the last day of storage p 0 060 regarding arils the a b and c values reduced until 30 days of storage remained unchanged until the last day of storage the h values showed changes over conservation time with a lower value at 30 days of storage than in other storage days the δe which allows assessing the overall variation of colour during storage remained fairly constant between 15 and 64 days of storage in peel and remained unchanged over cold storage in arils suggesting a minor colour change in the pomegranate peel and arils over storage time like what happened at harvest rdi 2 fruits presented a higher tss content p 0 019 14 36 brix when compared to other irrigation treatments 13 19 brix table 6 however the behavior of the tss content over the storage time was similar among treatments decreasing progressively throughout 45 days of storage from 16 38 brix at day 0 to 11 94 brix at day 45 p 0 001 and then remained unchanged until day 64 of storage the decrease of tss content in pomegranate fruit during storage is in agreement with other authors arendse et al 2015 fawole et al 2020 fawole and opara 2013 which could occur due to the degradation of sugars fawole and opara 2013 the ph and ta of pomegranate arils were not affected by irrigation treatments but changed throughout storage time p 0 001 the ph increased from 2 91 to 3 24 and ta decreased from 2 09 to 1 50 g 100 ml 1 between days 0 and 64 of storage table 6 the tss ta ratio showed changes with storage time but the values did not differ between the first and last day of storage table 6 the ph increases and ta reduction during storage are consistent once these two parameters are inversely proportional moreover the increase in ph throughout storage time can be related to the utilization of organic acids which is in accordance with the reduction of tss content with storage fawole et al 2020 the arils firmness remained unchanged during the first 15 days of storage reducing at day 30 of storage p 0 012 at days 45 and 64 of storage the firmness values were equal to found for days 0 and 30 reduction of the arils firmness could be due to loss in cell wall integrity of aril related to the senescence process that continues throughout storage time arendse et al 2015 fawole et al 2020 nanda et al 2001 the tpc was affected by the storage time p 0 001 increasing in the first 15 days of storage 156 4 174 1 mg gae 100 ml 1 juice at days 0 and 15 respectively and then decreasing for the lowest tpc at day 30 of storage 116 4 mg gae 100 ml 1 juice at days 45 and 64 of storage the tpc was equal to initial values the initial increase in tpc could be a result of phenolic compounds concentration which is consistent with weight loss during the first days of storage however the subsequent reduction in the arils tpc could be related to the degradation of phenolic compounds arendse et al 2014 fawole et al 2020 fawole and opara 2013 antioxidant activity determined by abts assay was not affected by irrigation treatment but varied with storage time showing lower values after 15 days of storage than in the first day of storage otherwise for antioxidant activity evaluated by frap assay there was a trend for interaction between irrigation treatment and storage time p 0 05 fig 3 despite poor consistent changes over storage time arils from each irrigation treatment showed equal frap values at days 0 and 64 of storage in both storage days the arils from the c treatment had lower frap values than those from rdi treatments between deficit irrigation treatments the rdi 2 fruits showed higher frap values than rdi 1 fruits the higher antioxidant activity determined by frap assay in arils from rdi treatments along storage is consistent with the trend for higher frap values in these fruits at harvest 4 conclusions present results showed that rdi strategies are a good water saving approach to use in wonderful pomegranate orchards of the mediterranean area in the present study application of the irrigation water restriction during flowering and fruit set period rdi 1 did not affect the physicochemical attributes of pomegranate fruits at harvest and during cold storage however the irrigation water restriction at the final phase of fruit growth and ripening rdi 2 besides 15 water savings allowed improvement in the arils tss content and antioxidant activity changes in the physicochemical characteristics of fruits during cold storage were independent of the irrigation strategies applied to pomegranate trees present results showed that the application of regulated deficit irrigation strategies in wonderful pomegranate orchards did not compromise the physicochemical characteristics of fruit or even allowed to improve the quality of the pomegranate regular application of these irrigation strategies is increasingly important to cope the expected climatic changes and contribute to mitigate the problems of water scarcity in this mediterranean region funding this work was supported by the project innoace 049 innoace 4 e funded by european fund

10103,nitrogen n application is important for agricultural practical management the study aimed to determine the impact of n application amount on maize growth water and n use efficiency and soil n residue under in season mulched drip fertigation m df in semi arid region with chilling damage the experiment was carried out in 2015 and 2016 in northeast china with six n application amounts including 0 140 190 240 290 and 340 kg ha 1 referred to n0 n140 n190 n240 n290 and n340 the n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 is widely applied in local high yield maize field results showed that appropriate application of n fertilizer under m df improved maize plant height stem diameter and leaf area index to respond positively to grain yield in season supply of n through m df increased the n accumulation na of plant during maize reproductive stages from tasseling to maturity which accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na for the whole growing season across the treatments the effect of n application amount on the na of plant was gradually more obvious after maize tasseling which was mainly reflected in the differences in na of ears the na of ears accounted for 75 3 77 7 of the total na of plant at maturity across the treatments the na and n recovery efficiency of plant grain yield and water use efficiency at maturity obviously increased when the n rate ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while it showed a negative effect when the n amount continue to increase the soil n residue rate in treatments of n290 and n340 were much higher than other treatments and obviously increased by 10 0 11 8 points the second year the study suggested a reasonable threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 of n applied through in season m df for maize with high yield and resources use efficiency but lower soil n residue rate which decreased by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 in local field the conclusions can provide scientific basis for maize production in northeast china and other regions with similar climate or productive conditions worldwide keywords maize water use efficiency n recovery efficiency soil n residue mulched drip fertigation n accumulation 1 introduction global crop demand is projected to double by 2050 due to an expected rapid increase in the global population tilman et al 2011 currently the application of mineral nitrogen n is a main pathway to increase crop yield and maintain the soil fertility hirel et al 2011 china has been the top consumer of n fertilizer in order to be able feed more than one fourth of the world s population on 8 of the global cropland fao 2011 heffer et al 2017 there is mounting evidence showing that the n fertilizer application in china has largely surpassed the crop demands and consequently triggered severe environmental problems zhang et al 2012 2016 sun et al 2018 therefore developing efficient fertigation techniques is needed in order to improve the water and fertilizer use efficiency which in turn will result in sustainable development of agriculture and improvement of farmland nitrogen is an essential constituent of protein nucleic acids chlorophyll and growth hormones in plants which directly affects the processes of assimilation and photosynthesis barker et al 1974 leghari et al 2016 nitrogen deficiency may result in stunted seedlings slow growth and grain wight reduction uhart and andrade 1995 an optimum amount of n fertilizer is beneficial to the synthesis of chlorophyll which hastens plant growth and the accumulation of biomass dordas and sioulas 2008 while excessive use of n fertilizer may lead to tip or leaf burn of seedlings styer 2009 excess vegetative growth thus increasing superfluous crop water evapotranspiration and energy consumption rudnicka et al 2017 wang et al 2019c and decrease in fruit quantity with low quality leghari et al 2016 therefore appropriate n input and efficient use of n in crop cultivation is critical for optimum crop productivity and the field nutrient management nitrogen fertilizer is converted into nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4 n structure which are the main forms of n absorbed by plants in soil king et al 1992 zhang et al 2016 currently only 30 50 of applied n fertilizer is taken up by crops tilman et al 2002 in the most intensive agricultural production systems more than half of the n used for crop fertilization is lost into the environment hirel et al 2011 lassaletta et al 2014 maresma et al 2019 excessive n application rates potentially have a negative impact on the environment and cannot be ignored it can increase greenhouse gas emissions and can also cause eutrophication resulting in a loss of diversity and degradation of soil and freshwater resources vitousek et al 1997 cassman 1999 tilman et al 2002 hirel et al 2011 therefore the scientific n fertilization management is crucial to coordinate the efficient use of resources and farmland environmental protection drip irrigation as one of the most efficient agricultural technique for water and fertilizer saving has been widely used in greenhouses orchards and field crops worldwide al said et al 2012 chukalla et al 2015 rashidi and keshavarzpour 2011 wu et al 2021 yang et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 the development of the best management practices bmps for n use under drip fertigation provides producers a way to

water and fertilizer li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 ning et al 2020 which has been developed more than 3 3 million hectare in northwest china where the evaporation is much greater than precipitation lin et al 2019 however due to the global climate change and the high latitude of the maize belt in northeast china in which maize yield accounts for 30 of the whole country ma et al 2008 the main problem for maize planting is that the accumulative temperature is insufficient and the water shortage seasonally is unfavorable to maize growth given the uneven precipitation in time and space in recent years m df was gradually used for maize cultivation in northeast china numerous studies have been carried out on the effect of film mulching irrigation regime of m df and mechanism of water saving with yield increase liu et al 2014 sui et al 2018 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 however these studies followed the traditional field management habits with relatively low fertigation frequency and planting density there are limited few studies on the quantitative analysis of the synergistic performance of maize growth and n recovery of plant soil system under different n application rates under m df in the northeast china based on the high yield agricultural practices of close planting and in season fertigation with m df technique for maize uzbek 2013 xu 2014 a number of treatments with smaller increments in n application rate are designed to determine the optimum n input understanding the ability of maize to use water and n resources efficiently is of crucial importance for decisions related to the best management practice of n through drip fertigation therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate maize growth and n uptake under different n application amounts and to identify the peak demand for n of maize and to develop a reasonable input threshold of n fertilizer for m df based on grain yield water and n use efficiency and n residue in

is widely applied in local high yield maize fields the treatments were replicated three times there were 18 subplots in total with a dimension of 40 m 6 m with 10 rows per plot the fertilizer effect in each treatment would continue because the same treatment was set in the same subplot in two years the experimental layout and treatment plot arrangement was shown in fig 1 2 2 agronomic practices the maize hybrid xianyu 335 was planted on may 3 in 2015 and may 2 in 2016 maize seeds were planted in alternate wide narrow 80 40 cm rows with a planting density of 83 330 plants ha 1 dripline with a wall thickness of 0 2 mm a drip flow of 1 38 l h 1 and a dripper space of 40 cm were placed in the middle of narrow row the agricultural plastic film was an ordinary white polyethylene mulching that was 80 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick a partial cover method of film mulching was used in which the narrow space between the dual planted rows was fully covered but the wider space between the dual rows was only partially covered all of the treatments used the same p2o5 and k2o at 135 kg ha 1 the fertilizer application percentages during maize growing season are shown in table 1 the starter fertilizer composed of urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 46 and potassium sulfate k2o 52 was broadcast by the seeder during the planting process the topdressing fertilizers which included urea monoammonium phosphate p2o5 61 n 12 and potassium chloride k2o 62 were applied through the m df systems the total precipitation from maize planting to harvest for 2015 was 217 mm and for 2016 was 259

same area it is reasonable to take 85 of the evapotranspiration of maize under surface irrigation as the irrigation quota of drip irrigation with high yield and water use efficiency all treatments were irrigated with 30 mm for pre emergence based on the researches of uzbek 2013 and xu 2014 under m df in the same experimental site the irrigation amount from seedling to maturity of maize for 2015 is 160 mm and for 2016 is 130 mm both years irrigated eight times other crop management practices were in accordance with those for a local high yielding farm maize was harvested on october 2 in 2015 and on september 28 in 2016 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis before planting soil samples from 0 to 60 cm were collected to test the soil basic nutrients including organic matter total n available phosphorus and potassium after final harvest soil samples of 0 180 cm were collected to analyze the no3 n and nh4 n residue distribution in soil profile the soil sample were collected in between two plants at a horizontal distance of 20 cm from the dripline the soil no3 n and nh4 n concentration were measured using an aa3 continuous flow analyzer bran luebbe germany the amounts of no3 n nh4 n and inorganic n residue in soil profile were calculated using eqs 2 4 the soil n relative residue rate soil nrr was calculated with eq 5 2 r no 3 n i 0 1 8 c no 3 n h i γ i 10 3

plants in each plot were selected at different growth stages including the sixth leaf v6 the twelfth leaf v12 tasseling vt filling r2 dough r4 and physiological maturity r6 stages these plants were removed from the soil except for the roots to measure the plant height stem diameter leaf area index lai and the n accumulation of plant the lai was calculated using eq 6 mckee 1964 6 lai d i 1 n 0 75 l i w i 10000 where d is the density of seedlings plants ha 1 l is the length of per leaf m w is the width per leaf m and n is the total number of leaves per plant plants were separated into leaves stems and ears then they were heat treated and crushed to test the concentration of n for different plant organs kjeldahl method the n recovery efficiency nre was calculated by eq 7 7 nre na n na n 0

water use efficiency maize seasonal evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the water balance as shown in eq 8 the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using eq 9 8 et c p i u r w d 9 wue yield et c where u is the seasonal capillary rise to the root zone in mm u was negligible since the groundwater table was 20 30 m below the soil surface r is the seasonal runoff in mm the field was flat without borders no r was observed in the field because the precipitation intensity was low w is the change in soil water storage mm d is the seasonal deep percolation in mm the soil moisture at the bottom of the main root zone didn t exceed the filed capacity thus the d was negligible since the small precipitation intensity and well designed irrigation scheduling qi et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2018 2 3 3 grain yield at maturity the four outermost rows were considered as border rows and were not taken into consideration grain yield measurements were made of all plants in a ten meter swath of the middle six rows in each plot 10 3 6 m2 grain moisture was measured with a grain moisture analyzer and then yield was corrected to 14 moisture 2 3 4 determination for n fertigation input threshold the reasonable threshold for n applied was determined based on the function equations describing the relationships of yield wue and nre with n application amount the three corresponding n application amounts which corresponded the optimal economic yield and the maximum wue and nre respectively were taken as the interval boundary of the n fertigation input threshold the optimal economic n amount was calculated according to the assumption that marginal income is equal to marginal cost using eq 10 10 dy dx x p y p where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 x is the n amount kg ha 1 x p is the n price 0 46 kg 1 y p is the grain price 0 28 kg 1 the prices of n and maize grain were determined according to local market chifeng china in the experimental years of 2015 and 2016 chifeng agriculture and animal husbandry bureau the n amount corresponding to maximum wue and nre was calculated according to the solution of extreme point of regression equation using eq 11 11 dy dx 0 where y is the wue or nre x is the n amount 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed using one way anova at a 0 05 significance level to identify differences among the treatments plotting was performed using microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 plant height stem diameter and lai the plant height stem diameter and lai throughout maize entire growing season among the treatments with different n application amount are shown in tables 2 4 there was a significant p 0 05 effect of n amount on the plant height throughout maize growing season except for the plant height at the seedling stage in 2015 the plant height after tasseling tended to be stable and increased with the increase in n amount applied the plant height of n140 and n190 treatments showed no significant difference from n0 treatment which were within 285 1 302 5 cm on average of two years while the plant height among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 was much higher 22 6 29 7 cm on average than n0 treatment the n amount had a significant effect on stem diameter throughout the growing season and the stem diameter increased with an increase in n amount at maturity stage the stem diameter of n140 and n190 treatments showed no significant difference while the stem diameter among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 significantly increased by 13 2 18 2 compared to n0 treatment the table 4 showed that the lai responded positively to the increase in n amount before maize filling r2 stage while the lai in treatment with high n input n340 decreased more obviously due to premature leaf senescence in late growth season compared to other treatments it can be seen that the lai 5 1 5 3 of n340 treatment during 64 69 days after emergence was the maximum among all of the treatments while the lai of n340 treatment during 114 118 days decreased to 3 14 3 24 which was even lower than that of n190 treatment the lai among n190 n240 and n290 treatments maintained high values throughout the growing seasons 3 2 plant n accumulation and n recovery efficiency the n accumulation na during maize growing season for all plant components and entire plant for the different treatments are shown in the fig 3 the results for both years showed the same variation tendency the total na of the plant increased throughout the growing season the na of leaves and stems increased first and then decreased with the development of maize growth and both of them reached the highest values around vt stage while the na of ears gradually increased starting at the beginning of reproductive growth period due to the transportation of n from leaves and stems there was no obvious difference in the na of plant at seedling stage during the v6 vt period the na of leaves and stems under the treatments with varying n application levels showed no significant difference but noticeably improved 38 8 78 6 and 32 8 66 9 compared with n0 treatment after maize tasseling the differences in the na of entire plant across the treatments were more obvious and were mainly reflected in the na of ears the na of ears accounted for 38 5 50 3 at vt r2 stage 57 8 69 5 at r2 r4 stage and 71 6 77 7 at r4 r6 stage of the total na of plants on average among the treatments the effect of n fertilizer amount on the na of ears reached significant level p 0 05 during maize reproductive period the na of ears improved significantly when the n amount ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while the na of ears showed no significant changes among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 the relationship of the na of entire plant with n fertilizer amount in the reproductive period showed the same variation tendency as that of the na of ears with n fertilizer amount take the r2 r4 stage as an example when the n amount was between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 each 50 kg ha 1 increase in n amount caused a 19 9 22 9 and 15 6 17 0 improvement in the na of ears and the entire plant respectively however the increasing ratio of na for ears and the entire plant dropped until negative growth appeared when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 on average over two years the n recovery efficiency nre of plant for the different growth stages and among the treatments is shown in fig 4 the nre gradually increased with the development of maize growth while the increasing ratio declined after maize tasseling take the n240 treatment as an example the nre from maize tasseling to filling increased 8 1 points while the nre from maize filling to maturity increased 1 6 points there was no significant difference in the nre among the treatments before maize tasseling whereas the difference in nre across treatments was gradually noticeable with the start of reproductive growth after maize tasseling the nre showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the increase of n amount from maize filling to maturity the values of nre reached the maximum in n240 treatment and decreased significantly when the n amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 it can be seen the n240 treatment improved 5 9 7 9 and 14 6 16 0 points in nre compared with n140 and n340 respectively during this period 3 3 the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n and the soil n residue in soil profile fig 5 shows the distributions of no3 n and nh4 n in 0 180 cm soil profile under different n application levels for two years at maturity the no3 n increased with the soil depth in a range of 0 40 cm and then decreased in deeper layers while the nh4 n was almost decreasing with the depth in 0 180 cm soil profile the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in soil profile showed an increasing tendency with the increase in n amount there was no obvious change of the inorganic n residue at different depths of soil when the n amount was less than 190 kg ha 1 while the inorganic n concentration increased noticeably after the n amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 the concentration of no3 n in soil was much higher than nh4 n in all treatments and the differences in the inorganic n among the treatments were more noticeable at a depth of 0 60 cm for example compared with n0 treatment the no3 n concentration at the depth of 0 60 cm in n140 n240 and n340 treatment increased 1 2 11 3 and 21 7 mg kg 1 respectively on average of two years there were different effects of n amount on the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in deeper soil layer 80 180 cm the results showed that the no3 n concentration at the depth of 80 180 cm increased obviously when the n amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 while the nh4 n concentration changed little in these soil layers for example the no3 n concentration in treatments of n240 n290 and n340 was 8 9 13 6 mg kg 1 while the nh4 n concentration in these treatments was 2 7 4 6 mg kg 1 in 2016 it can be concluded that increasing n amount promotes deep movement of no3 n in soil but has little effect on the migration of nh4 n at maturity the amounts of no3 n and nh4 n residue as well as the inorganic n in soil profile increased with the increase in n amount table 5 all three of these indexes significantly increased when the n application amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 the soil n residue decreased the second year when the n amount was within 0 190 kg ha 1 the soil n residue of n0 n140 and n190 treatments decreased 38 4 39 0 and 24 9 respectively the second year while the soil n residue in n240 treatment was almost the same between years by contrast the soil n residue increased obviously by year when the n amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 the soil n residue of n290 and n340 treatments increased 11 5 and 8 8 respectively the second year the soil n relative residue rate soil nrr between n290 and n340 treatments showed no significant difference but significantly increased 11 3 26 5 points compared with other treatments on average of two years while the n140 and n190 treatments have low soil nrr 8 7 and 13 3 respectively which may decrease the soil fertility by years 3 4 maize yield water use efficiency and n recovery the results in table 5 show that maize yield etc wue na and nre of plants at maturity stage for both years showed the same variation tendency of increasing initially and then decreasing with the increase in n rate maize yield in n240 treatment was the highest and showed no significant difference from the yield of n290 treatment but it was 7 2 53 8 higher than the yield of other treatments for two years on average the etc of treatments with n fertilizer application showed no significant difference but was 3 0 9 3 higher than the etc of n0 treatment for two years on average the etc of n290 treatment was the highest for two years the wue of treatments with n fertilizer application was 27 8 42 3 higher than that of n0 treatment the wue of n240 treatment was the highest amounting to 37 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average for two years the total na of plant at maturity for n240 n290 and n340 treatments showed no significant difference but it was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in n0 n140 and n190 treatments the n240 treatment obtained the highest nre amounting to 62 0 on average of two years the nre of plants for n190 and n290 treatments showed no significant difference from n240 treatment while there was a drop in the nre by 7 9 points for n140 treatment and 16 0 points for n340 treatment compared to n240 treatment for two years on average maize yield responded positively to the na of plant for both years each 50 kg ha 1 increase in n amount caused an average 16 7 improvement for na of plant and 9 1 for yield when the n amount was between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 while the increasing rate of yield and na for plant declined when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 the n240 treatment obtained the highest yield wue and nre which were 2 2 53 7 4 4 35 0 and 14 8 35 0 respectively higher than those in other treatments for two years on average the fig 6 showed that the function equations of maize yield wue and nre related to n amount showed quadratic parabola relationships which were in line with the theory of diminishing returns in agriculture while the soil nrr related to n amount showed a positive linear relationship all of the function equations fitted well through an f test p 0 01 according to the assumption that marginal income is equal to marginal cost the optimal economic n amount was 253 kg ha 1 with the target yield of 15545 kg ha 1 based on the method to solve the extreme point of regression equation the equation of wue vs n amount obtained the highest wue of 36 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 when the n amount was at 251 kg ha 1 while for the nre vs n amount equation the nre reached the maximum value of 62 4 when the n amount was 226 kg ha 1 in the field experiments the n input of 240 kg ha 1 which was within the range of 226 253 kg ha 1 obtained the highest yield wue and nre which presented high consistency with the fitted results of these function equations it can be concluded that the input threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 for n fertilizer can ensure high yield and resource use efficiency and the corresponding soil nrr were 20 4 24 2 which decreased by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 appropriate n application under m df improves maize growth and n accumulation water and nutrients in soil are fundamental to crop productivity sufficient water ensures nitrogenous fertilizer effect on crop wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 this study used the technique of mulched drip fertigation m df with an irrigation regime according to the demand of maize which provides a suitable soil moisture environment to the movement and mobilization of soil nutrition nitrogen plays a major role in the growth and development of plant and it affects almost all of the metabolic processes lea and miflin 2011 leghari et al 2016 plant height stem diameter and lai are important to assess plant growth given that they reflect the amount of light interception of the canopy which influences the extent of photosynthesis and final biomass yield elia and conversa 2012 the results of this study showed that the application of n fertilizer improved plant height stem diameter and lai compared to n0 treatment whereas the growth indexes above showed no significant differences among n240 n340 treatments excessive n application may lead to high activity of nitrate reductase excessive vigorous n metabolism and too much exhaustion of carbohydrate in ear leaf which resulted in the lack of enough carbohydrate in the lower leaf then the early senescence occurred he et al 1998 liu et al 2007 thus the lai plummeted due to premature leaf senescence in treatment with high n amount n340 during late growth period it can be concluded that n fertilizer promote maize growth but the promoting effect weakened after the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 maize grows through the physiological process of n accumulation na the n application amount had obvious effect on the na of varying plant components as well as the entire plant the na of each plant component improved significantly when the n amount increased between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 there was no significant increase in na of the entire plant when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 perhaps because the supra optimal n inputs far exceeded the demands for plant growth and no longer contributed to the processes of photosynthesis and assimilation li and ma 2018 and may cause damage for enzyme of the sort associated with crop growth including nitrate reductase glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase in leaves xu et al 2018 urease and catalase in soil zhang et al 2016 the differences in total na of plant across the treatments gradually increased after maize tasseling and the differences were mainly reflected in the na of ears a sufficient level of n was found in plant vegetative organs to serve as an n source to reproductive structures in general over the two years the na of plant during vt r6 period among the treatments with different n application levels accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na for the whole growing season and the na of ears accounted for 75 3 77 7 of the na for entire plant at maturity gao et al 2000 found that the ratio of the plant na before and after tasseling of spring maize with super high yield 15000 kg ha 1 was 72 28 under surface irrigation hou et al 2019 found that the plant na before and after maize tasseling stage was in the proportion of 60 40 using m df with super high yield in this study the ratio of the plant na during ve vt period to vt r6 period stands at 53 3 46 7 on average across the treatments under m df and the ratio in the optimal treatment n240 was 49 3 50 7 it can be concluded that the m df technique combined with appropriate n application improved the proportion of n translocation from plant vegetative organs to grain due to the n demand during late growth stages several studies also reported that in season fertigation benefits maize yield liu et al 2014 sui et al 2018 4 2 appropriate n application under m df decreases soil n residue the distribution of no3 n and nh4 n in soil profile at depths of 0 180 cm showed that the n residue in soil mainly distributed at depth of 0 60 cm in harvest season under m df because the fertilizer moves with water in soil the inorganic n mainly accumulated within the wetted volume of m df on the other hand the decomposed n was absorbed into the root layer of maize where there is plentiful humus zhang et al 2016 the residue amounts of both no3 n and nh4 n in soil increased with the increase in n amount and the no3 n concentration in soil was much higher than nh4 n the inorganic n content in soil indicates the soil fertility in this study the soil inorganic n amount after harvest was basically balanced for two years in n240 treatment while the soil n nutrient in treatments of n140 and n190 decreased by year implying that insufficient n application amount led to a decrease in soil fertility however excessive n fertilizer resulted in large amount of inorganic n residue the readings showed that the soil n relative residue rate at depth of 0 180 cm in n290 and n340 treatments increased 7 6 and 11 3 points respectively compared to n240 treatment over two years because of the high mobility of no3 n karandisha and šimůnek 2017 the masses of no3 n in soil at depth of 80 180 cm obviously increased under excessive n fertilizer conditions fig 5 it concluded that overuse of n input would promote the movement of no3 n toward deeper soil layers increasing additional risk of n leaching losses from the system especially during irrigation or rainfall events guo et al 2008 in addition excessive amounts of nutrients perhaps cause oxygen depletion in the soil and thus prevent the proper functioning of natural microorganisms which in turn affects soil fertility hirel et al 2011 4 3 appropriate n application under m df improves maize yield water and n use efficiency nitrogen availability can affect crop photosynthetic rate radiation interception and plant growth which in turn influence crop etc as reported by pandey et al 2000 and lenka et al 2009 greater n fertilizer input increased crop water use maize etc increased when the n application amount ranged from 0 to 290 kg ha 1 in this study the wue and nre were affected by crop yield etc and plant na the results showed that all of maize yield wue and nre increased first and then decreased with the increase in n amount and the peak values appeared in n240 treatments it can be concluded that maize growth and resource use efficiency responded positively to an increase in the amount of n application until the optimal level had been reached further increase in n amount was unlikely to be as effective at increasing yields and resource use efficiency fig 6 because of the theory of diminishing returns in agriculture tilman et al 2002 dai et al 2019 identifying the optimal n application amount based on the function equations such as yield vs n amount wue vs n amount and nre vs n amount is one of the most effective field test methods as it takes into account both yield and environmental benefits and has abroad application in agriculture zhu 2006 zhang et al 2018 if we take the three corresponding n application amounts which corresponded the optimal economic yield and the maximum wue and nre as the interval boundary the range of the function values of each equation in this interval maintained at high levels around the extreme points with less than 5 0 reduction therefore it s feasible to recommend this interval of 226 253 kg ha 1 as n input threshold under m df for maize which can ensure high benefits of maize production as well as lower soil n residue compared with the n fertilizer application threshold of 240 253 kg ha 1 which was put forward according to the relationship between yield benefit and n amount in previous research wang et al 2018 this study decreased the lower limit of the reasonable n input threshold which put more emphasis on the efficiency of resource utilization and environmental friendliness in recent years some other scholars have also carried out experiments on n fertigation management using m df for maize planting in northeast china lv 2012 and hou et al 2019 recommended the optimal n rate for maize with a planting density of 75000 80000 plants ha 1 under m df was 300 kg ha 1 the target yield was 15 532 15 739 kg ha 1 and the n partial factor was 51 8 52 5 kg 1 kg 1 maize yield 11 500 11 758 kg ha 1 and wue 24 8 25 2 kg 1 kg 1 of the optimal treatments conducted by c wang et al 2019 and qi et al 2019 were almost similar but the recommended n rate for maize with 61 400 65 400 plants ha 1 for planting density using m df were 292 and 240 kg ha 1 respectively the differences in the findings drawn by these scholars above probably attributed to the differences in the planting densities of maize and fertigation frequencies however it has been proved that in season n fertigation was better than that applied in two or three times and appropriate close planting was better than wide spacing planting for maize in this study maize was planted with a density of 83 330 plants ha 1 and the n fertilizer were applied in six times in maize different growth stages as a result the recommended n rate under m df was obviously decreased but the yield wue and n use efficiency were almost equal or improved compared to the conclusions drawn by the above mentioned researchers in the same region 5 conclusions identifying the optimal n application amount combined with the advanced water saving technique mulched drip fertigation m df is the key method to ensure high maize productivity and small buildup of n residue in soil profile appropriate n fertigation improved maize growth indexes including plant height stem diameter and lai which responded positively to grain yield the in season input of n fertilizer using m df increased plant na during maize reproductive growth periods from tasseling to maturity which accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na during the whole growing season across the treatments the effect of n application amount on plant na was more obvious after maize tasseling which was mainly reflected in the differences in na of ears the na and nre of plant grain yield and wue increased obviously when the n application amount ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while the increasing rate of the indexes mentioned above decreased until negative values appeared with further increase in n amount the n residue in soil profile especially in deeper layers below 80 cm noticeably increased when the n application amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 based on the function equations describing the relationships of yield wue and nre with n application amount the reasonable input threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 of n applied through in season m df was recommended for maize production would ensure high resources use efficiency but avoid large buildup of n residue in soil which decreased the soil n residue rate by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 in local field declaration of competing interest the authors

10103,nitrogen n application is important for agricultural practical management the study aimed to determine the impact of n application amount on maize growth water and n use efficiency and soil n residue under in season mulched drip fertigation m df in semi arid region with chilling damage the experiment was carried out in 2015 and 2016 in northeast china with six n application amounts including 0 140 190 240 290 and 340 kg ha 1 referred to n0 n140 n190 n240 n290 and n340 the n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 is widely applied in local high yield maize field results showed that appropriate application of n fertilizer under m df improved maize plant height stem diameter and leaf area index to respond positively to grain yield in season supply of n through m df increased the n accumulation na of plant during maize reproductive stages from tasseling to maturity which accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na for the whole growing season across the treatments the effect of n application amount on the na of plant was gradually more obvious after maize tasseling which was mainly reflected in the differences in na of ears the na of ears accounted for 75 3 77 7 of the total na of plant at maturity across the treatments the na and n recovery efficiency of plant grain yield and water use efficiency at maturity obviously increased when the n rate ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while it showed a negative effect when the n amount continue to increase the soil n residue rate in treatments of n290 and n340 were much higher than other treatments and obviously increased by 10 0 11 8 points the second year the study suggested a reasonable threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 of n applied through in season m df for maize with high yield and resources use efficiency but lower soil n residue rate which decreased by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 in local field the conclusions can provide scientific basis for maize production in northeast china and other regions with similar climate or productive conditions worldwide keywords maize water use efficiency n recovery efficiency soil n residue mulched drip fertigation n accumulation 1 introduction global crop demand is projected to double by 2050 due to an expected rapid increase in the global population tilman et al 2011 currently the application of mineral nitrogen n is a main pathway to increase crop yield and maintain the soil fertility hirel et al 2011 china has been the top consumer of n fertilizer in order to be able feed more than one fourth of the world s population on 8 of the global cropland fao 2011 heffer et al 2017 there is mounting evidence showing that the n fertilizer application in china has largely surpassed the crop demands and consequently triggered severe environmental problems zhang et al 2012 2016 sun et al 2018 therefore developing efficient fertigation techniques is needed in order to improve the water and fertilizer use efficiency which in turn will result in sustainable development of agriculture and improvement of farmland nitrogen is an essential constituent of protein nucleic acids chlorophyll and growth hormones in plants which directly affects the processes of assimilation and photosynthesis barker et al 1974 leghari et al 2016 nitrogen deficiency may result in stunted seedlings slow growth and grain wight reduction uhart and andrade 1995 an optimum amount of n fertilizer is beneficial to the synthesis of chlorophyll which hastens plant growth and the accumulation of biomass dordas and sioulas 2008 while excessive use of n fertilizer may lead to tip or leaf burn of seedlings styer 2009 excess vegetative growth thus increasing superfluous crop water evapotranspiration and energy consumption rudnicka et al 2017 wang et al 2019c and decrease in fruit quantity with low quality leghari et al 2016 therefore appropriate n input and efficient use of n in crop cultivation is critical for optimum crop productivity and the field nutrient management nitrogen fertilizer is converted into nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4 n structure which are the main forms of n absorbed by plants in soil king et al 1992 zhang et al 2016 currently only 30 50 of applied n fertilizer is taken up by crops tilman et al 2002 in the most intensive agricultural production systems more than half of the n used for crop fertilization is lost into the environment hirel et al 2011 lassaletta et al 2014 maresma et al 2019 excessive n application rates potentially have a negative impact on the environment and cannot be ignored it can increase greenhouse gas emissions and can also cause eutrophication resulting in a loss of diversity and degradation of soil and freshwater resources vitousek et al 1997 cassman 1999 tilman et al 2002 hirel et al 2011 therefore the scientific n fertilization management is crucial to coordinate the efficient use of resources and farmland environmental protection drip irrigation as one of the most efficient agricultural technique for water and fertilizer saving has been widely used in greenhouses orchards and field crops worldwide al said et al 2012 chukalla et al 2015 rashidi and keshavarzpour 2011 wu et al 2021 yang et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 the development of the best management practices bmps for n use under drip fertigation provides producers a way to remain operationally and economically viable lamb et al 2008 lamm and schlegel 2004 mpanga and idowu 2020 mulched drip fertigation m df combines advantages of film mulching and precision placement of water and fertilizer li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 ning et al 2020 which has been developed more than 3 3 million hectare in northwest china where the evaporation is much greater than precipitation lin et al 2019 however due to the global climate change and the high latitude of the maize belt in northeast china in which maize yield accounts for 30 of the whole country ma et al 2008 the main problem for maize planting is that the accumulative temperature is insufficient and the water shortage seasonally is unfavorable to maize growth given the uneven precipitation in time and space in recent years m df was gradually used for maize cultivation in northeast china numerous studies have been carried out on the effect of film mulching irrigation regime of m df and mechanism of water saving with yield increase liu et al 2014 sui et al 2018 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 however these studies followed the traditional field management habits with relatively low fertigation frequency and planting density there are limited few studies on the quantitative analysis of the synergistic performance of maize growth and n recovery of plant soil system under different n application rates under m df in the northeast china based on the high yield agricultural practices of close planting and in season fertigation with m df technique for maize uzbek 2013 xu 2014 a number of treatments with smaller increments in n application rate are designed to determine the optimum n input understanding the ability of maize to use water and n resources efficiently is of crucial importance for decisions related to the best management practice of n through drip fertigation therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate maize growth and n uptake under different n application amounts and to identify the peak demand for n of maize and to develop a reasonable input threshold of n fertilizer for m df based on grain yield water and n use efficiency and n residue in the soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 in chifeng in inner mongolia china 42 56 53 n 119 4 20 e the area has a semi arid and

is widely applied in local high yield maize fields the treatments were replicated three times there were 18 subplots in total with a dimension of 40 m 6 m with 10 rows per plot the fertilizer effect in each treatment would continue because the same treatment was set in the same subplot in two years the experimental layout and treatment plot arrangement was shown in fig 1 2 2 agronomic practices the maize hybrid xianyu 335 was planted on may 3 in 2015 and may 2 in 2016 maize seeds were planted in alternate wide narrow 80 40 cm rows with a planting density of 83 330 plants ha 1 dripline with a

was 80 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick a partial cover method of film mulching was used in which the narrow space between the dual planted rows was fully covered but the wider space between the dual rows was only partially covered all of the treatments used the same p2o5 and k2o at 135 kg ha 1 the fertilizer application percentages during maize growing season are shown in table 1 the starter fertilizer composed of urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 46 and potassium sulfate k2o 52 was broadcast by the seeder during the planting process the topdressing fertilizers which included urea monoammonium phosphate p2o5 61 n 12 and potassium chloride k2o 62 were applied through the m df systems the total precipitation from maize planting to harvest for 2015 was 217 mm and for 2016 was 259 mm all of the treatments were irrigated according to the average lower irrigation limit and crop water requirement the lower limit of irrigation at seedling and mature stages was 70 of field capacity while for the other growth stages it was 75 the daily et0 and precipitation during maize growing seasons in two years were shown in fig 2 the irrigation amount i was calculated based on eq 1 1 i 85 k

same area it is reasonable to take 85 of the evapotranspiration of maize under surface irrigation as the irrigation quota of drip irrigation with high yield and water use efficiency all treatments were irrigated with 30 mm for pre emergence based on the researches of uzbek 2013 and xu 2014 under m df in the same experimental site the irrigation amount from seedling to maturity of maize for 2015 is 160 mm and for 2016 is 130 mm both years irrigated eight times other crop management practices were in accordance with those for a local high yielding farm maize was harvested on october 2 in 2015 and on september 28 in 2016 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis before planting soil samples from 0 to 60 cm were collected to test the soil basic nutrients including organic matter total n available phosphorus and potassium after final harvest soil samples of 0 180 cm were collected to analyze the no3 n and nh4 n residue distribution in soil profile the soil sample were collected in between two plants at a horizontal distance of 20 cm from the dripline the soil no3 n and nh4 n concentration were measured using an aa3 continuous flow analyzer bran luebbe germany the amounts of no3 n nh4 n and inorganic n residue in soil profile were calculated using eqs 2 4 the soil n relative residue rate soil nrr was calculated with eq 5 2 r no 3 n i 0 1 8 c no 3 n h i γ i 10 3

plants in each plot were selected at different growth stages including the sixth leaf v6 the twelfth leaf v12 tasseling vt filling r2 dough r4 and physiological maturity r6 stages these plants were removed from the soil except for the roots to measure the plant height stem diameter leaf area index lai and the n accumulation of plant the lai was calculated using eq 6 mckee 1964 6 lai d i 1 n 0 75 l i w i 10000 where d is the density of seedlings plants ha 1 l is the length of per leaf m w is the width per leaf m and n is the total number of leaves per plant plants were separated into leaves stems and ears then they were heat treated and crushed to test the concentration of n for different plant organs kjeldahl method the n recovery efficiency nre was calculated by eq 7 7 nre na n na n 0

water use efficiency maize seasonal evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the water balance as shown in eq 8 the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using eq 9 8 et c p i u r w d 9 wue yield et c where u is the seasonal capillary rise to the root zone in mm u was negligible since the groundwater table was 20 30 m below the soil surface r is the seasonal runoff in mm the field was flat without borders no r was observed in the field because the precipitation intensity was low w is the change in soil water storage mm d is the seasonal deep percolation in mm the soil moisture at the bottom of the main root zone didn t exceed the filed capacity thus the d was negligible since the small precipitation intensity and well designed irrigation scheduling qi et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2018 2 3 3 grain yield at maturity the four outermost rows were considered as border rows and were not taken into consideration grain yield measurements were made of all plants in a ten meter swath of the middle six rows in each plot 10 3 6 m2 grain moisture was measured with a grain moisture analyzer and then yield was corrected to 14 moisture 2 3 4 determination for n fertigation input threshold the reasonable threshold for n applied was determined based on the function equations describing the relationships of yield wue and nre with n application amount the three corresponding n application amounts which corresponded the optimal economic yield and the maximum wue and nre respectively were taken as the interval boundary of the n fertigation input threshold the optimal economic n amount was calculated according to the assumption that marginal income is equal to marginal cost using eq 10 10 dy dx x p y p where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 x is the n amount kg ha 1 x p is the n price 0 46 kg 1 y p is the grain price 0 28 kg 1 the prices of n and maize grain were determined according to local market chifeng china in the experimental years of 2015 and 2016 chifeng agriculture and animal husbandry bureau the n amount corresponding to maximum wue and nre was calculated according to the solution of extreme point of regression equation using eq 11 11 dy dx 0 where y is the wue or nre x is the n amount 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed using one way anova at a 0 05 significance level to identify differences among the treatments plotting was performed using microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 plant height stem diameter and lai the plant height stem diameter and lai throughout maize entire growing season among the treatments with different n application amount are shown in tables 2 4 there was a significant p 0 05 effect of n amount on the plant height throughout maize growing season except for the plant height at the seedling stage in 2015 the plant height after tasseling tended to be stable and increased with the increase in n amount applied the plant height of n140 and n190 treatments showed no significant difference from n0 treatment which were within 285 1 302 5 cm on average of two years while the plant height among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 was much higher 22 6 29 7 cm on average than n0 treatment the n amount had a significant effect on stem diameter throughout the growing season and the stem diameter increased with an increase in n amount at maturity stage the stem diameter of n140 and n190 treatments showed no significant difference while the stem diameter among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 significantly increased by 13 2 18 2 compared to n0 treatment the table 4 showed that the lai responded positively to the increase in n amount before maize filling r2 stage while the lai in treatment with high n input n340 decreased more obviously due to premature leaf senescence in late growth season compared to other treatments it can be seen that the lai 5 1 5 3 of n340 treatment during 64 69 days after emergence was the maximum among all of the treatments while the lai of n340 treatment during 114 118 days decreased to 3 14 3 24 which was even lower than that of n190 treatment the lai among n190 n240 and n290 treatments maintained high values throughout the growing seasons 3 2 plant n accumulation and n recovery efficiency the n accumulation na during maize growing season for all plant components and entire plant for the different treatments are shown in the fig 3 the results for both years showed the same variation tendency the total na of the plant increased throughout the growing season the na of leaves and stems increased first and then decreased with the development of maize growth and both of them reached the highest values around vt stage while the na of ears gradually increased starting at the beginning of reproductive growth period due to the transportation of n from leaves and stems there was no obvious difference in the na of plant at seedling stage during the v6 vt period the na of leaves and stems under the treatments with varying n application levels showed no significant difference but noticeably improved 38 8 78 6 and 32 8 66 9 compared with n0 treatment after maize tasseling the differences in the na of entire plant across the treatments were more obvious and were mainly reflected in the na of ears the na of ears accounted for 38 5 50 3 at vt r2 stage 57 8 69 5 at r2 r4 stage and 71 6 77 7 at r4 r6 stage of the total na of plants on average among the treatments the effect of n fertilizer amount on the na of ears reached significant level p 0 05 during maize reproductive period the na of ears improved significantly when the n amount ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while the na of ears showed no significant changes among the treatments of n240 n290 and n340 the relationship of the na of entire plant with n fertilizer amount in the reproductive period showed the same variation tendency as that of the na of ears with n fertilizer amount take the r2 r4 stage as an example when the n amount was between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 each 50 kg ha 1 increase in n amount caused a 19 9 22 9 and 15 6 17 0 improvement in the na of ears and the entire plant respectively however the increasing ratio of na for ears and the entire plant dropped until negative growth appeared when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 on average over two years the n recovery efficiency nre of plant for the different growth stages and among the treatments is shown in fig 4 the nre gradually increased with the development of maize growth while the increasing ratio declined after maize tasseling take the n240 treatment as an example the nre from maize tasseling to filling increased 8 1 points while the nre from maize filling to maturity increased 1 6 points there was no significant difference in the nre among the treatments before maize tasseling whereas the difference in nre across treatments was gradually noticeable with the start of reproductive growth after maize tasseling the nre showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the increase of n amount from maize filling to maturity the values of nre reached the maximum in n240 treatment and decreased significantly when the n amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 it can be seen the n240 treatment improved 5 9 7 9 and 14 6 16 0 points in nre compared with n140 and n340 respectively during this period 3 3 the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n and the soil n residue in soil profile fig 5 shows the distributions of no3 n and nh4 n in 0 180 cm soil profile under different n application levels for two years at maturity the no3 n increased with the soil depth in a range of 0 40 cm and then decreased in deeper layers while the nh4 n was almost decreasing with the depth in 0 180 cm soil profile the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in soil profile showed an increasing tendency with the increase in n amount there was no obvious change of the inorganic n residue at different depths of soil when the n amount was less than 190 kg ha 1 while the inorganic n concentration increased noticeably after the n amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 the concentration of no3 n in soil was much higher than nh4 n in all treatments and the differences in the inorganic n among the treatments were more noticeable at a depth of 0 60 cm for example compared with n0 treatment the no3 n concentration at the depth of 0 60 cm in n140 n240 and n340 treatment increased 1 2 11 3 and 21 7 mg kg 1 respectively on average of two years there were different effects of n amount on the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in deeper soil layer 80 180 cm the results showed that the no3 n concentration at the depth of 80 180 cm increased obviously when the n amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 while the nh4 n concentration changed little in these soil layers for example the no3 n concentration in treatments of n240 n290 and n340 was 8 9 13 6 mg kg 1 while the nh4 n concentration in these treatments was 2 7 4 6 mg kg 1 in 2016 it can be concluded that increasing n amount promotes deep movement of no3 n in soil but has little effect on the migration of nh4 n at maturity the amounts of no3 n and nh4 n residue as well as the inorganic n in soil profile increased with the increase in n amount table 5 all three of these indexes significantly increased when the n application amount exceeded 190 kg ha 1 the soil n residue decreased the second year when the n amount was within 0 190 kg ha 1 the soil n residue of n0 n140 and n190 treatments decreased 38 4 39 0 and 24 9 respectively the second year while the soil n residue in n240 treatment was almost the same between years by contrast the soil n residue increased obviously by year when the n amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 the soil n residue of n290 and n340 treatments increased 11 5 and 8 8 respectively the second year the soil n relative residue rate soil nrr between n290 and n340 treatments showed no significant difference but significantly increased 11 3 26 5 points compared with other treatments on average of two years while the n140 and n190 treatments have low soil nrr 8 7 and 13 3 respectively which may decrease the soil fertility by years 3 4 maize yield water use efficiency and n recovery the results in table 5 show that maize yield etc wue na and nre of plants at maturity stage for both years showed the same variation tendency of increasing initially and then decreasing with the increase in n rate maize yield in n240 treatment was the highest and showed no significant difference from the yield of n290 treatment but it was 7 2 53 8 higher than the yield of other treatments for two years on average the etc of treatments with n fertilizer application showed no significant difference but was 3 0 9 3 higher than the etc of n0 treatment for two years on average the etc of n290 treatment was the highest for two years the wue of treatments with n fertilizer application was 27 8 42 3 higher than that of n0 treatment the wue of n240 treatment was the highest amounting to 37 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average for two years the total na of plant at maturity for n240 n290 and n340 treatments showed no significant difference but it was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in n0 n140 and n190 treatments the n240 treatment obtained the highest nre amounting to 62 0 on average of two years the nre of plants for n190 and n290 treatments showed no significant difference from n240 treatment while there was a drop in the nre by 7 9 points for n140 treatment and 16 0 points for n340 treatment compared to n240 treatment for two years on average maize yield responded positively to the na of plant for both years each 50 kg ha 1 increase in n amount caused an average 16 7 improvement for na of plant and 9 1 for yield when the n amount was between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 while the increasing rate of yield and na for plant declined when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 the n240 treatment obtained the highest yield wue and nre which were 2 2 53 7 4 4 35 0 and 14 8 35 0 respectively higher than those in other treatments for two years on average the fig 6 showed that the function equations of maize yield wue and nre related to n amount showed quadratic parabola relationships which were in line with the theory of diminishing returns in agriculture while the soil nrr related to n amount showed a positive linear relationship all of the function equations fitted well through an f test p 0 01 according to the assumption that marginal income is equal to marginal cost the optimal economic n amount was 253 kg ha 1 with the target yield of 15545 kg ha 1 based on the method to solve the extreme point of regression equation the equation of wue vs n amount obtained the highest wue of 36 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 when the n amount was at 251 kg ha 1 while for the nre vs n amount equation the nre reached the maximum value of 62 4 when the n amount was 226 kg ha 1 in the field experiments the n input of 240 kg ha 1 which was within the range of 226 253 kg ha 1 obtained the highest yield wue and nre which presented high consistency with the fitted results of these function equations it can be concluded that the input threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 for n fertilizer can ensure high yield and resource use efficiency and the corresponding soil nrr were 20 4 24 2 which decreased by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 appropriate n application under m df improves maize growth and n accumulation water and nutrients in soil are fundamental to crop productivity sufficient water ensures nitrogenous fertilizer effect on crop wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 this study used the technique of mulched drip fertigation m df with an irrigation regime according to the demand of maize which provides a suitable soil moisture environment to the movement and mobilization of soil nutrition nitrogen plays a major role in the growth and development of plant and it affects almost all of the metabolic processes lea and miflin 2011 leghari et al 2016 plant height stem diameter and lai are important to assess plant growth given that they reflect the amount of light interception of the canopy which influences the extent of photosynthesis and final biomass yield elia and conversa 2012 the results of this study showed that the application of n fertilizer improved plant height stem diameter and lai compared to n0 treatment whereas the growth indexes above showed no significant differences among n240 n340 treatments excessive n application may lead to high activity of nitrate reductase excessive vigorous n metabolism and too much exhaustion of carbohydrate in ear leaf which resulted in the lack of enough carbohydrate in the lower leaf then the early senescence occurred he et al 1998 liu et al 2007 thus the lai plummeted due to premature leaf senescence in treatment with high n amount n340 during late growth period it can be concluded that n fertilizer promote maize growth but the promoting effect weakened after the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 maize grows through the physiological process of n accumulation na the n application amount had obvious effect on the na of varying plant components as well as the entire plant the na of each plant component improved significantly when the n amount increased between 0 and 240 kg ha 1 there was no significant increase in na of the entire plant when the n amount exceeded 240 kg ha 1 perhaps because the supra optimal n inputs far exceeded the demands for plant growth and no longer contributed to the processes of photosynthesis and assimilation li and ma 2018 and may cause damage for enzyme of the sort associated with crop growth including nitrate reductase glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase in leaves xu et al 2018 urease and catalase in soil zhang et al 2016 the differences in total na of plant across the treatments gradually increased after maize tasseling and the differences were mainly reflected in the na of ears a sufficient level of n was found in plant vegetative organs to serve as an n source to reproductive structures in general over the two years the na of plant during vt r6 period among the treatments with different n application levels accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na for the whole growing season and the na of ears accounted for 75 3 77 7 of the na for entire plant at maturity gao et al 2000 found that the ratio of the plant na before and after tasseling of spring maize with super high yield 15000 kg ha 1 was 72 28 under surface irrigation hou et al 2019 found that the plant na before and after maize tasseling stage was in the proportion of 60 40 using m df with super high yield in this study the ratio of the plant na during ve vt period to vt r6 period stands at 53 3 46 7 on average across the treatments under m df and the ratio in the optimal treatment n240 was 49 3 50 7 it can be concluded that the m df technique combined with appropriate n application improved the proportion of n translocation from plant vegetative organs to grain due to the n demand during late growth stages several studies also reported that in season fertigation benefits maize yield liu et al 2014 sui et al 2018 4 2 appropriate n application under m df decreases soil n residue the distribution of no3 n and nh4 n in soil profile at depths of 0 180 cm showed that the n residue in soil mainly distributed at depth of 0 60 cm in harvest season under m df because the fertilizer moves with water in soil the inorganic n mainly accumulated within the wetted volume of m df on the other hand the decomposed n was absorbed into the root layer of maize where there is plentiful humus zhang et al 2016 the residue amounts of both no3 n and nh4 n in soil increased with the increase in n amount and the no3 n concentration in soil was much higher than nh4 n the inorganic n content in soil indicates the soil fertility in this study the soil inorganic n amount after harvest was basically balanced for two years in n240 treatment while the soil n nutrient in treatments of n140 and n190 decreased by year implying that insufficient n application amount led to a decrease in soil fertility however excessive n fertilizer resulted in large amount of inorganic n residue the readings showed that the soil n relative residue rate at depth of 0 180 cm in n290 and n340 treatments increased 7 6 and 11 3 points respectively compared to n240 treatment over two years because of the high mobility of no3 n karandisha and šimůnek 2017 the masses of no3 n in soil at depth of 80 180 cm obviously increased under excessive n fertilizer conditions fig 5 it concluded that overuse of n input would promote the movement of no3 n toward deeper soil layers increasing additional risk of n leaching losses from the system especially during irrigation or rainfall events guo et al 2008 in addition excessive amounts of nutrients perhaps cause oxygen depletion in the soil and thus prevent the proper functioning of natural microorganisms which in turn affects soil fertility hirel et al 2011 4 3 appropriate n application under m df improves maize yield water and n use efficiency nitrogen availability can affect crop photosynthetic rate radiation interception and plant growth which in turn influence crop etc as reported by pandey et al 2000 and lenka et al 2009 greater n fertilizer input increased crop water use maize etc increased when the n application amount ranged from 0 to 290 kg ha 1 in this study the wue and nre were affected by crop yield etc and plant na the results showed that all of maize yield wue and nre increased first and then decreased with the increase in n amount and the peak values appeared in n240 treatments it can be concluded that maize growth and resource use efficiency responded positively to an increase in the amount of n application until the optimal level had been reached further increase in n amount was unlikely to be as effective at increasing yields and resource use efficiency fig 6 because of the theory of diminishing returns in agriculture tilman et al 2002 dai et al 2019 identifying the optimal n application amount based on the function equations such as yield vs n amount wue vs n amount and nre vs n amount is one of the most effective field test methods as it takes into account both yield and environmental benefits and has abroad application in agriculture zhu 2006 zhang et al 2018 if we take the three corresponding n application amounts which corresponded the optimal economic yield and the maximum wue and nre as the interval boundary the range of the function values of each equation in this interval maintained at high levels around the extreme points with less than 5 0 reduction therefore it s feasible to recommend this interval of 226 253 kg ha 1 as n input threshold under m df for maize which can ensure high benefits of maize production as well as lower soil n residue compared with the n fertilizer application threshold of 240 253 kg ha 1 which was put forward according to the relationship between yield benefit and n amount in previous research wang et al 2018 this study decreased the lower limit of the reasonable n input threshold which put more emphasis on the efficiency of resource utilization and environmental friendliness in recent years some other scholars have also carried out experiments on n fertigation management using m df for maize planting in northeast china lv 2012 and hou et al 2019 recommended the optimal n rate for maize with a planting density of 75000 80000 plants ha 1 under m df was 300 kg ha 1 the target yield was 15 532 15 739 kg ha 1 and the n partial factor was 51 8 52 5 kg 1 kg 1 maize yield 11 500 11 758 kg ha 1 and wue 24 8 25 2 kg 1 kg 1 of the optimal treatments conducted by c wang et al 2019 and qi et al 2019 were almost similar but the recommended n rate for maize with 61 400 65 400 plants ha 1 for planting density using m df were 292 and 240 kg ha 1 respectively the differences in the findings drawn by these scholars above probably attributed to the differences in the planting densities of maize and fertigation frequencies however it has been proved that in season n fertigation was better than that applied in two or three times and appropriate close planting was better than wide spacing planting for maize in this study maize was planted with a density of 83 330 plants ha 1 and the n fertilizer were applied in six times in maize different growth stages as a result the recommended n rate under m df was obviously decreased but the yield wue and n use efficiency were almost equal or improved compared to the conclusions drawn by the above mentioned researchers in the same region 5 conclusions identifying the optimal n application amount combined with the advanced water saving technique mulched drip fertigation m df is the key method to ensure high maize productivity and small buildup of n residue in soil profile appropriate n fertigation improved maize growth indexes including plant height stem diameter and lai which responded positively to grain yield the in season input of n fertilizer using m df increased plant na during maize reproductive growth periods from tasseling to maturity which accounted for 42 7 50 7 of the total na during the whole growing season across the treatments the effect of n application amount on plant na was more obvious after maize tasseling which was mainly reflected in the differences in na of ears the na and nre of plant grain yield and wue increased obviously when the n application amount ranged from 0 to 240 kg ha 1 while the increasing rate of the indexes mentioned above decreased until negative values appeared with further increase in n amount the n residue in soil profile especially in deeper layers below 80 cm noticeably increased when the n application amount exceeded 290 kg ha 1 based on the function equations describing the relationships of yield wue and nre with n application amount the reasonable input threshold of 226 253 kg ha 1 of n applied through in season m df was recommended for maize production would ensure high resources use efficiency but avoid large buildup of n residue in soil which decreased the soil n residue rate by 12 2 16 0 points compared with that under conventional n application amount of 340 kg ha 1 in local field declaration of competing interest the authors

10104,the use of reclaimed or treated water from urban wastewater treatment plants for irrigation has been proposed as an alternative water source to address water scarcity issues in europe in this paper using agro economic modelling we analyse if treated water available for agriculture has the potential to reduce freshwater abstraction and consequently water stress implementing exogenous treated water quantities as an additional water supply at nuts 2 level in the capri model we found that treated water reuse is a possible alternative supply source to address water shortages with a very negligible effect on farmers income and food production in the eu however the actual water reuse and water stress reduction is very limited due to high costs even climate change effects on water availability and precipitation failed to induce higher use the one size fits all approach modelled via a flat rate water price only encourages the reuse of treated water in a limited number of eu member states thus in order to maximise the potential of reused water to address water scarcity different rates should be used so as to ensure higher treated water volumes at lower costs keywords treated water capri model climate change water scarcity water stress 1 introduction water scarcity is already a recurrent problem in some european countries eea 2018a leading to environmental and economic consequences which will be aggravated in the future due to climate change collins et al 2009 due to increased temperatures driven by climate change water availability will be impacted due to increased evapotranspiration and thus changes in precipitation and river flows such changes will also affect the capacity of different economic sectors to access water simultaneously water demand is expected to increase due to population growth that will trigger higher use across the sectors in particular it is expected that agricultural water use will be intensified to satisfy increased food demand european commission 2018a it is estimated that in the future more farmland area will have to be irrigated especially in southern europe putting additional pressure on the existing water stress in europe eea 2018b furthermore there will be an increase in demand by households tourism and industry leading to a more intense competition for water use to guarantee that the increased demand and reduced supply do not put at risk the competitiveness and the efficient functioning of the european internal market all sectors need to improve their water use efficiency to deliver its share of the joint effort sustainable irrigation water management is required to mitigate the water deficit in agriculture to promote sustainable water management the european commission ec urges farmers under the current common agricultural policy cap to meet specific agri environmental targets for water through the cross compliance mechanism european commission 2019a in addition cap rural development measures support investments for improving the state of irrigation infrastructures or irrigation techniques leading to efficiency gains and a reduction in water losses ibid however the efficiency of such measures may be limited berbel et al 2018 soto garcía et al 2013 despite these efforts the key challenges in terms of water scarcity remain and further actions are needed eea 2018a uneven implementation of water abstraction measures across europe were also identified as a gap in the implementation of the water framework directive wfd european commission 2019b therefore other policy measures that can reduce the net use of water in the agricultural sector have been put in place recently the european council adopted for a regulation which will facilitate the safe reuse of treated urban wastewater treated water for agricultural irrigation from urban wastewater treatment plants european council 2020a the regulation provides a harmonised approach regarding minimum requirements on reference pathogens and risk management when irrigating with reused water in the eu as a climate change adaption tool which will contribute to lowering water extraction from agriculture together with irrigation modernisation plans that can be included in the cap beyond 2020 it should be noted that water reuse as an alternative supply option to address eu water scarcity was already acknowledged in the 2012 commission communications ʻa blueprint to safeguard europe s water resourcesʼ com 2012 673 and ʻclosing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economyʼ com 2015 614 bixio et al 2006 found that in europe there has been an increase in treated water use for irrigation especially in southern europe alcon et al 2012 lazarova et al 2001 reviewed the role of treated water and its contribution to integrated water management it was concluded that treated water is a reliable alternative resource which prevents the degradation of the environment barbagallo et al 2012 have also found that treated water is a potential alternative irrigation source and has a fundamental opportunity to reduce freshwater use and improve the environment as well as the agricultural sector pedrero et al 2010 have similar findings however in their studies an economic assessment is lacking and is also limited to specific case studies italy spain greece france in an economic evaluation by vergine et al 2017 it was found that treated water reduces the stress on conventional resources especially during the drier seasons furthermore alcon et al 2012 show that the implementation of treated water in the context of the wfd produces significant environmental benefits that are greater than the investment and operational costs of the treatment plants nevertheless despite the economic assessment the findings are limited to italy and south eastern spain pistocchi et al 2017 found that farmers attractiveness of using treated water for irrigation vary depending on the infrastructure costs and the distance from the treatment plant to the irrigated land therefore there is still a knowledge gap concerning how additional availability from reused water at a given cost will be adopted by the agricultural sector at eu level and how these costs impact agricultural and food production and prices of agricultural commodities in the eu this is particularly relevant if the full price recovery principle of the wfd is implemented it is also unclear how freshwater abstraction will change and if water stress will be reduced at eu level thus the aim of this paper is to provide insights into whether water reuse is a viable alternative to reduce the risk of water shortages for irrigation in the eu and how it can contribute to mitigating water scarcity across the eu in the context of adapting to climate change if this is the case then it would also contribute to the reduction in freshwater abstraction leading to a reduction in water stress to answer these questions we use the common agricultural policy regional impact analysis capri model with its updated water module blanco et al 2018 the capri water module was developed with the purpose of making simulations of the potential impact of water availability on agricultural production in the eu blanco et al 2015 it integrates detailed water considerations of capri including crop specific irrigation water use and livestock water use as a specific input in production at nomenclature of territorial units for statistics nuts 2 level thus being able to capture such food water linkages makes the capri water modelling framework suitable for this purpose the study contributes to the existing literature on the reuse of treated water in agriculture in two main ways first it considers the potential impact on production using novel estimates of the availability of treated water at nuts2 level second it evaluates the role of treated water considering the reduction on water availability due to climate change the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the modelling approach followed by the scenario definition in section 3 section 4 covers the simulation results and in the final section 5 we discuss the results of this study and highlight the main conclusions 2 methodology to achieve the aim of this research we use the agro economic capri model with its water module capri is a partial equilibrium large scale economic global multi commodity agricultural sector model britz and witzke 2014 the effects of agricultural environmental and trade policies on agricultural production farm prices and income trade as well as environmental indicators are analysed in a comparative static framework where the simulated results are compared to a baseline scenario that is calibrated to the 2017 agricultural outlook published by the ec european commission 2017 which considers the continuation of the cap 2014 up to 2030 capri consists of a supply module for the eu at regional member state ms and aggregated eu level that interacts with a global market module where bilateral trade and prices for agricultural commodities are computed the supply module covers more than 50 inputs and outputs which are produced or used in more than 50 crop and livestock activities in about 280 nuts 2 regions within the eu the production of 47 primary and processed agricultural products from the supply module is covered by 77 countries in 40 trade blocks in the market model and the two modules interact until equilibrium is reached britz and witzke 2014 the main simulated results provided by capri are related to crop areas and yields production prices income the water module in capri is implemented in the supply part of capri i e for the eu western balkans and turkey for the analysis we use the recently updated capri water module blanco et al 2018 water is included as a production factor in both crop and livestock production in addition areas are split into irrigated and rain fed considering water use irrigation efficiency and differentiated crop yields of irrigated and rain fed activities it should be noted that some activities in capri are aggregates and the technical coefficients are not purely crop specific instead for these crop aggregates the input output coefficients for the rain fed irrigated variants are defined to match the average activity coefficients of that aggregate blanco et al 2015 irrigated areas are based on the 2010 survey on agricultural production methods sapm and the 2000 2013 eurostat farm structure survey fss data crop specific and regional irrigation requirements were obtained from the cropwat 1 1 www fao org land water databases and software cropwat en model and the potential and water limited yields at nuts 2 level were derived from biophysical simulations using the world food studies wofost model 2 2 www wur nl en research results research institutes environmental research facilities products software and models wofost htm the data from cropwat covers a set of 12 crops soft wheat maize paddy rice sunflower olives potatoes sugar beet tomatoes apples citrus fruits table grapes and wine production for the capri crops not directly matched to cropwat crop simulations assumptions were used by assuming that the non modelled crop has the same value as a ʻsimilarʼ crop see appendix a a similar approach was also applied to the 10 crop set from wofost wheat barley rye maize field beans sugar beet rapeseed potato sunflower and rice the updated module uses data on water use from the distributed water balance and flood simulation model lisflood it is based on the 2006 simulations since it is the most complete consistent quality and comparable water data set available at the time of the recent update of the water module used for this paper as mentioned the updated water module includes water as a production factor in rain fed agriculture in the previous version water food linkages were limited to irrigated agriculture only thus besides linking treated water to irrigated water availability we are now able to also link impacts of treated water reuse to those originating from changes in precipitation due to climate change farmers are flexible and able to switch production between irrigated and rain fed alternatives depending on the climate change shock as well as the available treated water hence we are able to provide a better understanding of the treated water reuse potential with respect to climate change it should be noted that capri does not currently explicitly model deficit irrigation but it is indirectly captured through the yield ratio between potential and water limited yields derived from the wofost model blanco et al 2015 this ratio also equals the rain fed to irrigated yield ratio which allows the differentiation of rain fed and irrigated yields and substitution between the crop variants therefore if there are changes in effective rainfall and its distribution over the crop growing season the water limited yield is lower than the potential yield under irrigated conditions i e the irrigated crop variant gains more weight if there is no water availability stress and there will be a substitution between the rain fed and irrigated crop variant the opposite also applies if there are irrigation water shortages data on the potential supply of reused water at different cost levels in eu at nuts 2 level were taken from pistocchi et al 2017 as exogenous additional water availability in the model fig 1 we focus on treated water availability at 0 5 m3 total costs these costs include the treatment cost 0 08 m3 and additional charges such as pumping transportation storage and charges for potential expansion and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure ibid since these costs cannot be separated in the capri water module we assume that the total cost equates to the water price for extra m3 of treated water full cost recovery we assume full cost recovery because water supply benefits alone cannot cover the treatment costs raso 2013 the additional cost was modelled to account for simulating water price scenarios blanco et al 2015 where the total cost related to the consumed water quantities are introduced in the objective function according to pistocchi et al 2017 the available treated water quantities at 0 5 m3 treatment costs provide the highest benefits in terms of nutrient load and water stress mitigation below the 0 5 m3 cost limited reused water quantities can be provided and above this threshold the net benefits in terms of cost are significantly lower to comply with the assumptions in the study by pistocchi et al 2017 we consider only quantities that can actually reach the irrigation demand within a 10 km distance from the urban wastewater treatment plants this means that in some regions the available quantities were higher than the irrigation demand that can actually be reached in those few cases regions in belgium germany italy the netherlands and portugal we considered the irrigation demand rather than the availability from the treatment plants it should be noted that the additional treated water quantities are available for the entire nuts 2 regions since it is the smallest spatial unit in capri and cannot apply the 10 km distance criterion the simulation year is 2030 given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic and agricultural projections over longer periods we also assume that there will be no change in terms of the distribution of wastewater treatment plants in order to capture changes in irrigation requirements due to climate change we applied changes in irrigated area according to fao 2017 projections however to make sure that we fully capture the treated water reuse potential not limiting the expansion in an irrigated area we increased the potentially irrigated 3 3 potentially irrigated area compared to actual is the maximum area which could be irrigated using the equipment and the available water quantity the total irrigable area may differ from the actual since the equipment may be mobile and therefore utilisable on several fields depending on the available water quantities area by 30 3 simulated scenarios to capture the potential of treated water reuse we consider three scenarios and three baselines the scenarios are needed as the current configuration of the water module in capri does not allow for separating water as an input or the input cost by water source nor separating the crop activities by irrigation water source as it has been done between irrigated and rain fed crop activities to solve this modelling limitation water reuse scenarios where only the additional quantities of treated water were added as a shock are compared to different baselines with and without climate change impacts on freshwater and rain availability only in this way we can separate the effects of additional treated water supply from those due to climate change the main characteristics of the scenarios and baselines are described below and summarised in table 1 1 baseline base business as usual scenario calibrated to mid term projections for agricultural markets based on the 2017 agricultural outlook for 2030 european commission 2017 and considering the cap 2014 2020 gocht et al 2017 irrigation costs are included together with the other cost groups and cannot be explicitly distinguished from them since eu wide statistics are lacking in terms of irrigation costs since the freshwater price in the baseline is not explicitly observed we have to price it at 0 5 m3 i e equal to the total cost of treated water when running the baseline as well as the other baseline scenarios if we shock the system as it works when we introduce the treated water quantities with a specific price we are not just pricing treated water but also freshwater because as explained above in the current water module there is no possibility of separating the irrigation water supply by source or prices thus there is inconsistency between the baseline and alternative scenario with the assumption of pricing freshwater already in the baseline we are able to compare and analyse water reuse effects on water stress reduction and agricultural production note that some current ms already use treated water for irrigation and these quantities are not captured in the baseline scenario 1 a treated water reuse reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of base and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a total cost of 0 5 m3 see appendix b priced at full cost recovery this scenario allows us to examine if water reuse is a cost effective measure that could reduce freshwater use and thus water stress a conventional measure of water stress is the withdrawal to availability ratio however in this case the difference in water use between the baseline and the scenario can be seen as a change in the water stress as freshwater in the baseline is priced at the same level as the treated water cost any additional quantity used when the treated water is allocated should be seen as a shift from fresh to treated water use and a reduction in the water stress 2 less freshwater availability for irrigation wava this scenario considers the same settings as base i e the cap 2014 2020 as well as a price of 0 5 m3 for the freshwater to be able to do a meaningful analysis but additionally considers a reduction in water availability for irrigation as a consequence of climate change we focus on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 that corresponds to a high greenhouse gas emissions pathway with very little mitigation riahi et al 2011 thus having a negative effect on the water resources fischer et al 2007 under these settings we would like to investigate whether the full potential of treated water can really reduce the risk of water shortages region specific data on water availability for irrigation reductions per nuts 2 region was obtained from bisselink et al 2018 2 a less water availability for irrigation and treated water reuse wava reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of wava and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a cost of 0 5 m3 to be able to analyse the effect of water reuse independent of the climate change impacts via reduced freshwater availability the comparisons are made with respect to the wava scenario this comparison implies that the additional water quantity used can be seen as a shift between water sources and a reduction in the water stress 3 less rain rain this scenario again builds on the assumptions under the base scenario but compared to the base scenario changes in effective rainfall are added to the simulation year attributed to climate change this will only affect rain fed agriculture but not irrigated agriculture however with less rain the available demand for irrigation is expected to increase with an associated increased water use similar to scenario 2 we focus on rcp8 5 and implemented changes in effective rainfall obtained from bisselink et al 2018 3 a less rain and treated water reuse rain reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of rain and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a cost of 0 5 m3 to be able to analyse the effect of water reuse independent of the climate change impacts via reduced rainfall the comparisons are made with respect to the rain scenario this comparison implies that the additional water quantity used can be seen as a shift between water sources and a reduction in the water stress 4 results we discuss the impacts of making treated water available for irrigation focusing on two main aspects firstly from an environmental point of view we see whether treated water reuse is effective in reducing water stress and secondly we see how agricultural markets are affected this analysis is performed for the three comparisons mentioned above 4 1 effect on water stress as argued in the introduction the treated water reuse potential in terms of reducing freshwater net use in the agricultural sector and consequently reducing regional water stress is noteworthy recall that due to the impossibility of separating water sources the water stress indicator is calculated as the difference between the base and alternative scenario given that the price for water is equal in both scenarios rather than the conventional method of withdrawal to availability ratio fig 2 shows that water stress can be reduced by around 14 on average in the eu ranging between 35 in belgium and 1 in slovenia the czech republic bulgaria and romania fig 2 however the actual situation is far from the identified potential figs 2 and 3 in the scenario reuse on average in the eu in 2030 the water stress reduction is only 1 compared to the potential 14 4 4 appendices b and c provide the actual numbers for both potential and actual water stress very few regions hungary bulgaria romania and slovenia actually use treated water and reduce freshwater use up to the identified potential column 3 in appendix c nevertheless the potential or availability of treated water in these regions is very small compared to the total water resources column 2 in appendix c on the other hand austria displays a high actual reduction in water stress mainly driven by area changes in sugar beet production due to higher average irrigated yields compared to rain fed yields there is a switch from a rain fed to an irrigated area with climate change the water stress potential is declining because of projected increasing annual water availability and precipitation in central and northern european countries bisselink et al 2018 spain should not be neglected despite the identified low potential to reduce water stress it can be noticed from the table in column 1 of appendix b that spain uses the largest quantities of treated water driven by an increase in olives for oil which is around ¾ of the total treated water use in europe and it is doubling given the projected decline in water availability and precipitation due to climate change from fig 3a c it is visible that at nuts 2 level this is mainly occurring in the regions of andalusia and murcia where there is a greater reduction in water stress compared to the national average in fig 2 the same can be noticed for some regions in france and germany however in most of the mediterranean regions with a few exceptions in spain and italy the actual water stress reduction is still marginal nevertheless these regions rely considerably on irrigation and have great potential to reduce the water stress from agricultural production by using treated water as long as there is no other incentive such as a reduction in freshwater availability or changes in effective rainfall farms rarely use treated water as an alternative supply but this is again limited to some regions in the southern part of europe where climate change is expected to have negative effects on water availability and precipitation the actual water stress reduction in central and northern europe is declining with climate change fig 3b and c compared to 3a due to the positive effect on water resources still rendering the actual water stress reduction far from the identified potential 4 2 effect on agriculture as expected with more available water farmers are switching from rain fed to irrigated crop activities leading to an increase in production columns 4 and 5 in table 2 display the effect at eu level under the reuse scenario it may be noticed that despite the switch in crop mix overall production increases only marginally resulting in a small decline in producer prices for the most common produced crops the crop mix change is the result of a small decline in soft wheat and grain maize production rain fed crop variant and an increase in durum wheat sugar beet and olives for oil production irrigated crop variant due to the high shares of rain fed areas the decline in cereals is greater than the increase in irrigated area in addition economic returns to these crops are relatively low therefore cannot afford to pay the price of treated water on the contrary irrigated production from rapeseed sugar beet and olives for oil is increasing since they are less water intensive or value added crops nevertheless due to the increase in irrigated agricultural production there will be an increase in production at aggregate level due to higher yields pushing down the prices however as a result of irrigated production there is a noticeable increase in water use costs which together with negative producer prices offset the higher production from the irrigated crop variant resulting in insignificant income changes the reduction in the relative profitability of irrigated crops compared to rain fed crops also explains why there is a small production increase as previously argued despite the large available water quantities production effect is limited due to the input cost for water the positive production changes as well as income are mainly driven by the higher average yields from irrigated crop variants tables 3 and 4 show that the results are similar under wava reuse and rain reuse scenarios to the reuse scenarios the magnitude of the impact on production and water use differs and is slightly higher given the decline in freshwater availability for irrigation or decline in effective rainfall due to climate change as previously noted treated water becomes a slightly more important alternative source of irrigation for some regions fig 3b and c when there is an induced change in freshwater availability water scarcity or rainfall due to climate change the increase in irrigated crop supply the income and thus production effect are in general limited again to similar regions as well as crops as before due to high water costs it seems that demand elasticities in the model lead to a failure in the translation of higher crop production water costs into higher producer prices to stimulate production looking into country level data some nuance can be introduced to the statement that costs are an impediment to address water scarcity with water reuse as an alternative source fig 4 when the impact of climate change leads to a reduction in freshwater availability treated water does become a mitigation option but only limited to spain andalusia and murcia regions more specifically recall that for the northern and central european countries the projected climate change effects on water availability and precipitation were beneficial as a result countries such as belgium germany and france use less treated water for irrigation fig 4b or do not even irrigate at all like in the example of belgium and austria in the rain reuse scenario fig 4c in the case of spain the increase in irrigated area supply is mainly due to the use of this alternative water source for growing olives for oil however the increase in associated water costs is even higher thus irrespective of the small increase in production compared to the baseline the increase in water cost combined with the decline in producer prices due to higher supply results in very small income changes these results display an important message namely that under a less available water for irrigation or rain scenario treated water is an alternative supply option which without impacting farmers income can reduce the water stress from agricultural production however the potential of the treated water is not fully exploited if the costs of treated water are lower those farmers are paying for freshwater or if farmers obtain financial support in the form of subsidies to cover the treatment transport storage and investment costs 5 discussion in this paper using agro economic modelling we are able to assess the potential of treated water to reduce freshwater abstraction and thus water stress and address water scarcity induced by climate change using the capri model and data on treated water quantities at nuts 2 level we showed that treated water is a possible alternative supply source to address water shortages with very negligible effects on farmers income and food production in the eu food production will change marginally and be slightly more dependent on irrigated agriculture our findings that treated water can contribute to water stress reduction in spain germany and france corroborate with those from lazarova et al 2001 barbagallo et al 2012 pedrero et al 2010 but not with vergine et al 2017 in the case of italy in addition the estimated potential is also in line with that identified by sanz and gawlik 2014 with few exceptions such as belgium the netherlands and italy pistocchi et al 2017 calculated an average reduction of around 11 per year in the eu however the actual water reuse and water stress reduction is far from the identified potential 14 of total available water and is only limited 1 of total available water or 7 of total available treated water to several regions across the eu spain austria france germany this is in line with previous studies european commission 2018a where it is identified that the current uptake of treated water 1 7 billion m3 falls far below its full potential 6 6 billion m3 without any eu legal framework imposed in our study the high price 0 5 m3 equal to the total treatment cost full cost recovery is the reason for such a low implementation 5 5 while it could be argued that following the polluter pays principle treatment costs could be covered by the polluter industrial or residential users the lion s share 42 euro cents of the total cost comes from making water accessible from the waste treatment plant to the field climate change effects on water availability and precipitation even failed to induce higher use across the eu see fig 2 and appendix c under these scenarios the reduction in the pressure on the water resources increases marginally compared to the reuse alternative scenario and is still far from the identified potential the inclusion of relevant externalities may have a strong impact on the economic feasibility of using treated water garcia and pargament 2015 thus unless farmers consider the environmental benefits of treated water in their decision making they will always find surface water more profitable than treated water alcon et al 2013 to test the potential impact of water costs being borne by other agents we conduct a sensitivity analysis considering different cost recovery scenarios 50 20 and 15 of the access cost however we obtained similar results with a reduction in water stress of around 1 when treated water was priced at 0 5 m3 this is not surprising given that farmers in the eu pay a small share of the total irrigation cost with average prices sometimes well below the treatment cost ranging between 0 005 m3 in germany to 0 12 m3 in italy berbel et al 2019 the main reason that could explain why our findings for italy differ from those of vergine et al 2017 spanish farmers pay more 0 12 m3 and 0 24 m3 on average over the last 10 years and are willing to pay more than double to ensure water supply alcon et al 2014 this is in line with our findings where we noticed the highest amount of treated water use given the cost of 0 5 m3 it should be noted that the simulation results are subject to some limitations and qualifications as previously pointed out in our modelling exercise we are not able to separate treated water from freshwater in the capri model however even if we were able to model properly as alcon et al 2013 argue farmers will always give priority to freshwater or groundwater without considering any non market benefits in their decision making this is not the case in capri in addition deficit irrigation is not explicitly modelled however even if considered as an adaptive strategy in dry regions our results will not change much this is mainly because firstly capri does not consider crop growth stages and secondly the water saving from deficit irrigation will actually mean less freshwater or treated irrigated water requirements hence the consumed treated water quantities may be considered as the maximum quantities that can be consumed furthermore the capri water database being from 2006 should not be seen as an impediment as pointed earlier the main driver for the simulation results is the high water price imposed in both the baseline and the alternative scenarios updating it to more recent data from lisflood is desirable but this will not make any difference in the current exercise given the inability to separate treated water the imposed high water price or not capturing non market benefits during the optimisation last our modelling approach considers water availability at nuts2 level this approach fails to fully capture the fact that water uses costs and availability as water networks are much more local however the capri model is designed to represent whole regions instead single farms or fields hence there is a distribution of cost functions in the regions that are embedded in a single function and a regional water price of 0 5 m3 should be interpreted as an average price despite the costs are not uniform in reality therefore even though an increase in irrigated area of 1 ha at an average price of 0 5 m3 looks unrealistic the predicted area also cover the part of the distribution where farmers irrigate at much lower costs the assumptions on the positive mathematical programming pmp terms of the quadratic cost function to allow smooth substitution between rain fed and irrigated crop variants also drives to some extent the model response meaning it implies that when simulating high water prices the model may show small irrigated areas in regions where irrigation is not expected at all therefore our results may partly overestimate the potential in spite of the small use of reused water even when the cost estimates from pistocchi et al 2017 take into account the deployed of the water from the waste treatment plant to the field including all costs of infrastructure treatment and pumping 6 conclusion in this paper we use an agro economic model to see the uptake of the theoretical availability of treated water for irrigation our results show that considering the cost associated with making available treated water to farmers the use of this water source is limited despite the caveats discussed above as well as the non conventional way of calculating the water stress we believe that our results are realistic in this first attempt to model treated water in an agricultural economic model the results help policy makers and stakeholders to obtain a better understanding of the role water reuse may have as a future adaptation measure for water scarcity and climate change together with the recently adopted regulation on minimum quality requirements and the risk management of using treated water feasible policy measures can be proposed that can complement the environmental objectives of the cap nevertheless in order to promote the sustainable management of water resources and the full potential of treated water is to be exploited financial support is required in the form of subsidies to cover the treated water price that reflects the treatment transport storage and investment cost according to the european council 2020b p 7 ʻfinancial incentives for practicing water reuse in agriculture have been identified as being among the reasons for the low uptake of water reuse in the unionʼ however the one size fits all approach via a flat rate water price is not desirable from our results it becomes apparent that a flat rate of 0 5 m3 can only lead to a full absorption of the supplied treated water resource by farmers in a limited number of member states thus a preferable option for agricultural irrigation would be a ʻfit for purposeʼ approach i e an approach that will maximise the potential of reused water to address water scarcity and able to provide a higher volume of treated wastewater at lower cost the impact assessment analysis by the european commission 2018b also concluded that this is a preferred option this ʻfit for purposeʼ approach is very relevant in the long term despite the positive climate change effects on water resources in central and northern europe drought events are present and may become more persistent in time thus water reuse will become more important however when these become recurrent and affect the availability of freshwater stored in reservoirs the farming sector will possibly be even more dependent on alternative water resources our results also inform and support the need for consistency between the two existing water policies the water framework directive and the urban waste water treatment directive these policies identify and encourage the reuse of treated water but specific conditions are not present european commission 2018a ensuring coherent conditions within the existing eu legislative frameworks on water will ensure the applicable levels of environmental protection and food security are maintained however these conditions should also be in line with the ʻfit for purposeʼ approach however given the transboundary issue of the river basin aspect in the wfd proposing different rates in different ms should also be carefully defined and chosen finally the results may also be relevant and linked in the future to other technological alternatives such as a ʻseawater greenhouseʼ based on thermally evaporating seawater or water from desalination based on photovoltaic energy and reverse osmosis separating freshwater and alternative irrigation water sources to see how the alternatives displace or do not displace the current water available for irrigation or allow the expansion of irrigation to previously rain fed areas is something that we would like work on and investigate in the future funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

10104,the use of reclaimed or treated water from urban wastewater treatment plants for irrigation has been proposed as an alternative water source to address water scarcity issues in europe in this paper using agro economic modelling we analyse if treated water available for agriculture has the potential to reduce freshwater abstraction and consequently water stress implementing exogenous treated water quantities as an additional water supply at nuts 2 level in the capri model we found that treated water reuse is a possible alternative supply source to address water shortages with a very negligible effect on farmers income and food production in the eu however the actual water reuse and water stress reduction is very limited due to high costs even climate change effects on water availability and precipitation failed to induce higher use the one size fits all approach modelled via a flat rate water price only encourages the reuse of treated water in a limited number of eu member states thus in order to maximise the potential of reused water to address water scarcity different rates should be used so as to ensure higher treated water volumes at lower costs keywords treated water capri model climate change water scarcity water stress 1 introduction water scarcity is already a recurrent problem in some european countries eea 2018a leading to environmental and economic consequences which will be aggravated in the future due to climate change collins et al 2009 due to increased temperatures driven by climate change water availability will be impacted due to increased evapotranspiration and thus changes in precipitation and river flows such changes will also affect the capacity of different economic sectors to access water simultaneously water demand is expected to increase due to population growth that will trigger higher use across the sectors in particular it is expected that agricultural water use will be intensified to satisfy increased food demand european commission 2018a it is estimated that in the future more farmland area will have to be irrigated especially in southern europe putting additional pressure on the existing water stress in europe eea 2018b furthermore there will be an increase in demand by households tourism and industry leading to a more intense competition for water use to guarantee that the increased demand and reduced supply do not put at risk the competitiveness and the efficient functioning of the european internal market all sectors need to improve their water use efficiency to deliver its share of the joint effort sustainable irrigation water management is required to mitigate the water deficit in agriculture to promote sustainable water management the european commission ec urges farmers under the current common agricultural policy cap to meet specific agri environmental targets for water through the cross compliance mechanism european commission 2019a in addition cap rural development measures support investments for improving the state of irrigation infrastructures or irrigation techniques leading to efficiency gains and a reduction in water losses ibid however the efficiency of such measures may be limited berbel et al 2018 soto garcía et al 2013 despite these efforts the key challenges in terms of water scarcity remain and further actions are needed eea 2018a uneven implementation of water abstraction measures across europe were also identified as a gap in the implementation of the water framework directive wfd european commission 2019b therefore other policy measures that can reduce the net use of water in the agricultural sector have been put in place recently the european council adopted for a regulation which will facilitate the safe reuse of treated urban wastewater treated water for agricultural irrigation from urban wastewater treatment plants european council 2020a the regulation provides a harmonised approach regarding minimum requirements on reference pathogens and risk management when irrigating with reused water in the eu as a climate change adaption tool which will contribute to lowering water extraction from agriculture together with irrigation modernisation plans that can be included in the cap beyond 2020 it should be noted that water reuse as an alternative supply option to address eu water scarcity was already acknowledged in the 2012 commission communications ʻa blueprint to safeguard europe s water resourcesʼ com 2012 673 and ʻclosing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economyʼ com 2015 614 bixio et al 2006 found that in europe there has been an increase in treated water use for irrigation especially in southern europe alcon et al 2012 lazarova et al 2001 reviewed the role of treated water and its contribution to integrated water management it was concluded that treated water is a reliable alternative resource which prevents the degradation of the environment barbagallo et al 2012 have also found that treated water is a potential alternative irrigation source and has a fundamental opportunity to reduce freshwater use and improve the environment as well as the agricultural sector pedrero et al 2010 have similar findings however in their studies an economic assessment is lacking and is also limited to specific case studies italy spain greece france in an economic evaluation by vergine et al 2017 it was found that treated water reduces the stress on conventional resources especially during the drier seasons furthermore alcon et al 2012 show that the implementation of treated water in the context of the wfd produces significant environmental benefits that are greater than the investment and operational costs of the treatment plants nevertheless despite the economic assessment the findings are limited to italy and south eastern spain pistocchi et al 2017 found that farmers attractiveness of using treated water for irrigation vary depending on the infrastructure costs and the distance from the treatment plant to the irrigated land therefore there is still a knowledge gap concerning how additional availability from reused water at a given cost will be adopted by the agricultural sector at eu level and how these costs impact agricultural and food production and prices of agricultural commodities in the eu this is particularly relevant if the full price recovery principle of the wfd is implemented it is also unclear how freshwater abstraction will change and if water stress will be reduced at eu level thus the aim of this paper is to provide insights into whether water reuse is a viable alternative to reduce the risk of water shortages for irrigation in the eu and how it can contribute to mitigating water scarcity across the eu in the context of adapting to climate change if this is the case then it would also contribute to the reduction in freshwater abstraction leading to a reduction in water stress to answer these questions we use the common agricultural policy regional impact analysis capri model with its updated water module blanco et al 2018 the capri water module was developed with the purpose of making simulations of the potential impact of water availability on agricultural production in the eu blanco et al 2015 it integrates detailed water considerations of capri including crop specific irrigation water use and livestock water use as a specific input in production at nomenclature of territorial units for statistics nuts 2 level thus being able to capture such food water linkages makes the capri water modelling framework suitable for this purpose the study contributes to the existing literature on the reuse of treated water in agriculture in two main ways first it considers the potential impact on production using novel estimates of the availability of treated water at nuts2 level second it evaluates the role of treated water considering the reduction on water availability due to climate change the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the modelling approach followed by the scenario definition in section 3 section 4 covers the simulation results and in the final section 5 we discuss the results of this study and highlight the main conclusions 2 methodology to achieve the aim of this research we use the agro economic capri model with its water module capri is a partial equilibrium large scale economic global multi commodity agricultural sector model britz and witzke 2014 the effects of agricultural environmental and trade policies on agricultural production farm prices and income trade as well as environmental indicators are analysed in a comparative static framework where the simulated results are compared to a baseline scenario that is calibrated to the 2017 agricultural outlook published by the ec european commission 2017 which considers the continuation of the cap 2014 up to 2030 capri consists of a supply module for the eu at regional member state ms and aggregated eu level that interacts with a global market module where bilateral trade and prices for agricultural commodities are computed the supply module covers more than 50 inputs and outputs which are produced or used in more than 50 crop and livestock activities in about 280 nuts 2 regions within the eu the production of 47 primary and processed agricultural products from the supply module is covered by 77 countries in 40 trade blocks in the market model and the two modules interact until equilibrium is reached britz and witzke 2014 the main simulated results provided by capri are related to crop areas and yields production prices income the water module in capri is implemented in the supply part of capri i e for the eu western balkans and turkey for the analysis we use the recently updated capri water module blanco et al 2018 water is included as a production factor in both crop and livestock production in addition areas are split into irrigated and rain fed considering water use irrigation efficiency and differentiated crop yields of irrigated and rain fed activities it should be noted that some activities in capri are aggregates and the technical coefficients are not purely crop specific instead for these crop aggregates the input output coefficients for the rain fed irrigated variants are defined to match the average activity coefficients of that aggregate blanco et al 2015 irrigated areas are based on the 2010 survey on agricultural production methods sapm and the 2000 2013 eurostat farm structure survey fss data crop specific and regional irrigation requirements were obtained from the cropwat 1 1 www fao org land water databases and software cropwat en model and the potential and water limited yields at nuts 2 level were derived from biophysical simulations using the world food studies wofost model 2 2 www wur nl en research results research institutes environmental research facilities products software and models wofost htm the data from cropwat covers a set of 12 crops soft wheat maize paddy rice sunflower olives potatoes sugar beet tomatoes apples citrus fruits table grapes and wine production for the capri crops not directly matched to cropwat crop simulations assumptions were used by assuming that the non modelled crop has the same value as a ʻsimilarʼ crop see appendix a a similar approach was also applied to the 10 crop set from wofost wheat barley rye maize field beans sugar beet rapeseed potato sunflower and rice the updated module uses data on water use from the distributed water balance and flood simulation model lisflood it is based on the 2006 simulations since it is the most complete consistent quality and comparable water data set available at the time of the recent update of the water module used for this paper as mentioned the updated water module includes water as a production factor in rain fed agriculture in the previous version water food linkages were limited to irrigated agriculture only thus besides linking treated water to irrigated water availability we are now able to also link impacts of treated water reuse to those originating from changes in precipitation due to climate change farmers are flexible and able to switch production between irrigated and rain fed alternatives depending on the climate change shock as well as the available treated water hence we are able to provide a better understanding of the treated water reuse potential with respect to climate change it should be noted that capri does not currently explicitly model deficit irrigation but it is indirectly captured through the yield ratio between potential and water limited yields derived from the wofost model blanco et al 2015 this ratio also equals the rain fed to irrigated yield ratio which allows the differentiation of rain fed and irrigated yields and substitution between the crop variants therefore if there are changes in effective rainfall and its distribution over the crop growing season the water limited yield is lower than the potential yield under irrigated conditions i e the irrigated crop variant gains more weight if there is no water availability stress and there will be a substitution between the rain fed and irrigated crop variant the opposite also applies if there are irrigation water shortages data on the potential supply of reused water at different cost levels in eu at nuts 2 level were taken from pistocchi et al 2017 as exogenous additional water availability in the model fig 1 we focus on treated water availability at 0 5 m3 total costs these costs include the treatment cost 0 08 m3 and additional charges such as pumping transportation storage and charges for potential expansion and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure ibid since these costs cannot be separated in the capri water module we assume that the total cost equates to the water price for extra m3 of treated water full cost recovery we assume full cost recovery because water supply benefits alone cannot cover the treatment costs raso 2013 the additional cost was modelled to account for simulating water price scenarios blanco et al 2015 where the total cost related to the consumed water quantities are introduced in the objective function according to pistocchi et al 2017 the available treated water quantities at 0 5 m3 treatment costs provide the highest benefits in terms of nutrient load and water stress mitigation below the 0 5 m3 cost limited reused water quantities can be provided and above this threshold the net benefits in terms of cost are significantly lower to comply with the assumptions in the study by pistocchi et al 2017 we consider only quantities that can actually reach the irrigation demand within a 10 km distance from the urban wastewater treatment plants this means that in some regions the available quantities were higher than the irrigation demand that can actually be reached in those few cases regions in belgium germany italy the netherlands and portugal we considered the irrigation demand rather than the availability from the treatment plants it should be noted that the additional treated water quantities are available for the entire nuts 2 regions since it is the smallest spatial unit in capri and cannot apply the 10 km distance criterion the simulation year is 2030 given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic and agricultural projections over longer periods we also assume that there will be no change in terms of the distribution of wastewater treatment plants in order to capture changes in irrigation requirements due to climate change we applied changes in irrigated area according to fao 2017 projections however to make sure that we fully capture the treated water reuse potential not limiting the expansion in an irrigated area we increased the potentially irrigated 3 3 potentially irrigated area compared to actual is the maximum area which could be irrigated using the equipment and the available water quantity the total irrigable area may differ from the actual since the equipment may be mobile and therefore utilisable on several fields depending on the available water quantities area by 30 3 simulated scenarios to capture the potential of treated water reuse we consider three scenarios and three baselines the scenarios are needed as the current configuration of the water module in capri does not allow for separating water as an input or the input cost by water source nor separating the crop activities by irrigation water source as it has been done between irrigated and rain fed crop activities to solve this modelling limitation water reuse scenarios where only the additional quantities of treated water were added as a shock are compared to different baselines with and without climate change impacts on freshwater and rain availability only in this way we can separate the effects of additional treated water supply from those due to climate change the main characteristics of the scenarios and baselines are described below and summarised in table 1 1 baseline base business as usual scenario calibrated to mid term projections for agricultural markets based on the 2017 agricultural outlook for 2030 european commission 2017 and considering the cap 2014 2020 gocht et al 2017 irrigation costs are included together with the other cost groups and cannot be explicitly distinguished from them since eu wide statistics are lacking in terms of irrigation costs since the freshwater price in the baseline is not explicitly observed we have to price it at 0 5 m3 i e equal to the total cost of treated water when running the baseline as well as the other baseline scenarios if we shock the system as it works when we introduce the treated water quantities with a specific price we are not just pricing treated water but also freshwater because as explained above in the current water module there is no possibility of separating the irrigation water supply by source or prices thus there is inconsistency between the baseline and alternative scenario with the assumption of pricing freshwater already in the baseline we are able to compare and analyse water reuse effects on water stress reduction and agricultural production note that some current ms already use treated water for irrigation and these quantities are not captured in the baseline scenario 1 a treated water reuse reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of base and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a total cost of 0 5 m3 see appendix b priced at full cost recovery this scenario allows us to examine if water reuse is a cost effective measure that could reduce freshwater use and thus water stress a conventional measure of water stress is the withdrawal to availability ratio however in this case the difference in water use between the baseline and the scenario can be seen as a change in the water stress as freshwater in the baseline is priced at the same level as the treated water cost any additional quantity used when the treated water is allocated should be seen as a shift from fresh to treated water use and a reduction in the water stress 2 less freshwater availability for irrigation wava this scenario considers the same settings as base i e the cap 2014 2020 as well as a price of 0 5 m3 for the freshwater to be able to do a meaningful analysis but additionally considers a reduction in water availability for irrigation as a consequence of climate change we focus on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 that corresponds to a high greenhouse gas emissions pathway with very little mitigation riahi et al 2011 thus having a negative effect on the water resources fischer et al 2007 under these settings we would like to investigate whether the full potential of treated water can really reduce the risk of water shortages region specific data on water availability for irrigation reductions per nuts 2 region was obtained from bisselink et al 2018 2 a less water availability for irrigation and treated water reuse wava reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of wava and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a cost of 0 5 m3 to be able to analyse the effect of water reuse independent of the climate change impacts via reduced freshwater availability the comparisons are made with respect to the wava scenario this comparison implies that the additional water quantity used can be seen as a shift between water sources and a reduction in the water stress 3 less rain rain this scenario again builds on the assumptions under the base scenario but compared to the base scenario changes in effective rainfall are added to the simulation year attributed to climate change this will only affect rain fed agriculture but not irrigated agriculture however with less rain the available demand for irrigation is expected to increase with an associated increased water use similar to scenario 2 we focus on rcp8 5 and implemented changes in effective rainfall obtained from bisselink et al 2018 3 a less rain and treated water reuse rain reuse this scenario takes the assumptions of rain and adds additional water availability equal to the treated water quantities for reuse which can be made available at a cost of 0 5 m3 to be able to analyse the effect of water reuse independent of the climate change impacts via reduced rainfall the comparisons are made with respect to the rain scenario this comparison implies that the additional water quantity used can be seen as a shift between water sources and a reduction in the water stress 4 results we discuss the impacts of making treated water available for irrigation focusing on two main aspects firstly from an environmental point of view we see whether treated water reuse is effective in reducing water stress and secondly we see how agricultural markets are affected this analysis is performed for the three comparisons mentioned above 4 1 effect on water stress as argued in the introduction the treated water reuse potential in terms of reducing freshwater net use in the agricultural sector and consequently reducing regional water stress is noteworthy recall that due to the impossibility of separating water sources the water stress indicator is calculated as the difference between the base and alternative scenario given that the price for water is equal in both scenarios rather than the conventional method of withdrawal to availability ratio fig 2 shows that water stress can be reduced by around 14 on average in the eu ranging between 35 in belgium and 1 in slovenia the czech republic bulgaria and romania fig 2 however the actual situation is far from the identified potential figs 2 and 3 in the scenario reuse on average in the eu in 2030 the water stress reduction is only 1 compared to the potential 14 4 4 appendices b and c provide the actual numbers for both potential and actual water stress very few regions hungary bulgaria romania and slovenia actually use treated water and reduce freshwater use up to the identified potential column 3 in appendix c nevertheless the potential or availability of treated water in these regions is very small compared to the total water resources column 2 in appendix c on the other hand austria displays a high actual reduction in water stress mainly driven by area changes in sugar beet production due to higher average irrigated yields compared to rain fed yields there is a switch from a rain fed to an irrigated area with climate change the water stress potential is declining because of projected increasing annual water availability and precipitation in central and northern european countries bisselink et al 2018 spain should not be neglected despite the identified low potential to reduce water stress it can be noticed from the table in column 1 of appendix b that spain uses the largest quantities of treated water driven by an increase in olives for oil which is around ¾ of the total treated water use in europe and it is doubling given the projected decline in water availability and precipitation due to climate change from fig 3a c it is visible that at nuts 2 level this is mainly occurring in the regions of andalusia and murcia where there is a greater reduction in water stress compared to the national average in fig 2 the same can be noticed for some regions in france and germany however in most of the mediterranean regions with a few exceptions in spain and italy the actual water stress reduction is still marginal nevertheless these regions rely considerably on irrigation and have great potential to reduce the water stress from agricultural production by using treated water as long as there is no other incentive such as a reduction in freshwater availability or changes in effective rainfall farms rarely use treated water as an alternative supply but this is again limited to some regions in the southern part of europe where climate change is expected to have negative effects on water availability and precipitation the actual water stress reduction in central and northern europe is declining with climate change fig 3b and c compared to 3a due to the positive effect on water resources still rendering the actual water stress reduction far from the identified potential 4 2 effect on agriculture as expected with more available water farmers are switching from rain fed to irrigated crop activities leading to an increase in production columns 4 and 5 in table 2 display the effect at eu level under the reuse scenario it may be noticed that despite the switch in crop mix overall production increases only marginally resulting in a small decline in producer prices for the most common produced crops the crop mix change is the result of a small decline in soft wheat and grain maize production rain fed crop variant and an increase in durum wheat sugar beet and olives for oil production irrigated crop variant due to the high shares of rain fed areas the decline in cereals is greater than the increase in irrigated area in addition economic returns to these crops are relatively low therefore cannot afford to pay the price of treated water on the contrary irrigated production from rapeseed sugar beet and olives for oil is increasing since they are less water intensive or value added crops nevertheless due to the increase in irrigated agricultural production there will be an increase in production at aggregate level due to higher yields pushing down the prices however as a result of irrigated production there is a noticeable increase in water use costs which together with negative producer prices offset the higher production from the irrigated crop variant resulting in insignificant income changes the reduction in the relative profitability of irrigated crops compared to rain fed crops also explains why there is a small production increase as previously argued despite the large available water quantities production effect is limited due to the input cost for water the positive production changes as well as income are mainly driven by the higher average yields from irrigated crop variants tables 3 and 4 show that the results are similar under wava reuse and rain reuse scenarios to the reuse scenarios the magnitude of the impact on production and water use differs and is slightly higher given the decline in freshwater availability for irrigation or decline in effective rainfall due to climate change as previously noted treated water becomes a slightly more important alternative source of irrigation for some regions fig 3b and c when there is an induced change in freshwater availability water scarcity or rainfall due to climate change the increase in irrigated crop supply the income and thus production effect are in general limited again to similar regions as well as crops as before due to high water costs it seems that demand elasticities in the model lead to a failure in the translation of higher crop production water costs into higher producer prices to stimulate production looking into country level data some nuance can be introduced to the statement that costs are an impediment to address water scarcity with water reuse as an alternative source fig 4 when the impact of climate change leads to a reduction in freshwater availability treated water does become a mitigation option but only limited to spain andalusia and murcia regions more specifically recall that for the northern and central european countries the projected climate change effects on water availability and precipitation were beneficial as a result countries such as belgium germany and france use less treated water for irrigation fig 4b or do not even irrigate at all like in the example of belgium and austria in the rain reuse scenario fig 4c in the case of spain the increase in irrigated area supply is mainly due to the use of this alternative water source for growing olives for oil however the increase in associated water costs is even higher thus irrespective of the small increase in production compared to the baseline the increase in water cost combined with the decline in producer prices due to higher supply results in very small income changes these results display an important message namely that under a less available water for irrigation or rain scenario treated water is an alternative supply option which without impacting farmers income can reduce the water stress from agricultural production however the potential of the treated water is not fully exploited if the costs of treated water are lower those farmers are paying for freshwater or if farmers obtain financial support in the form of subsidies to cover the treatment transport storage and investment costs 5 discussion in this paper using agro economic modelling we are able to assess the potential of treated water to reduce freshwater abstraction and thus water stress and address water scarcity induced by climate change using the capri model and data on treated water quantities at nuts 2 level we showed that treated water is a possible alternative supply source to address water shortages with very negligible effects on farmers income and food production in the eu food production will change marginally and be slightly more dependent on irrigated agriculture our findings that treated water can contribute to water stress reduction in spain germany and france corroborate with those from lazarova et al 2001 barbagallo et al 2012 pedrero et al 2010 but not with vergine et al 2017 in the case of italy in addition the estimated potential is also in line with that identified by sanz and gawlik 2014 with few exceptions such as belgium the netherlands and italy pistocchi et al 2017 calculated an average reduction of around 11 per year in the eu however the actual water reuse and water stress reduction is far from the identified potential 14 of total available water and is only limited 1 of total available water or 7 of total available treated water to several regions across the eu spain austria france germany this is in line with previous studies european commission 2018a where it is identified that the current uptake of treated water 1 7 billion m3 falls far below its full potential 6 6 billion m3 without any eu legal framework imposed in our study the high price 0 5 m3 equal to the total treatment cost full cost recovery is the reason for such a low implementation 5 5 while it could be argued that following the polluter pays principle treatment costs could be covered by the polluter industrial or residential users the lion s share 42 euro cents of the total cost comes from making water accessible from the waste treatment plant to the field climate change effects on water availability and precipitation even failed to induce higher use across the eu see fig 2 and appendix c under these scenarios the reduction in the pressure on the water resources increases marginally compared to the reuse alternative scenario and is still far from the identified potential the inclusion of relevant externalities may have a strong impact on the economic feasibility of using treated water garcia and pargament 2015 thus unless farmers consider the environmental benefits of treated water in their decision making they will always find surface water more profitable than treated water alcon et al 2013 to test the potential impact of water costs being borne by other agents we conduct a sensitivity analysis considering different cost recovery scenarios 50 20 and 15 of the access cost however we obtained similar results with a reduction in water stress of around 1 when treated water was priced at 0 5 m3 this is not surprising given that farmers in the eu pay a small share of the total irrigation cost with average prices sometimes well below the treatment cost ranging between 0 005 m3 in germany to 0 12 m3 in italy berbel et al 2019 the main reason that could explain why our findings for italy differ from those of vergine et al 2017 spanish farmers pay more 0 12 m3 and 0 24 m3 on average over the last 10 years and are willing to pay more than double to ensure water supply alcon et al 2014 this is in line with our findings where we noticed the highest amount of treated water use given the cost of 0 5 m3 it should be noted that the simulation results are subject to some limitations and qualifications as previously pointed out in our modelling exercise we are not able to separate treated water from freshwater in the capri model however even if we were able to model properly as alcon et al 2013 argue farmers will always give priority to freshwater or groundwater without considering any non market benefits in their decision making this is not the case in capri in addition deficit irrigation is not explicitly modelled however even if considered as an adaptive strategy in dry regions our results will not change much this is mainly because firstly capri does not consider crop growth stages and secondly the water saving from deficit irrigation will actually mean less freshwater or treated irrigated water requirements hence the consumed treated water quantities may be considered as the maximum quantities that can be consumed furthermore the capri water database being from 2006 should not be seen as an impediment as pointed earlier the main driver for the simulation results is the high water price imposed in both the baseline and the alternative scenarios updating it to more recent data from lisflood is desirable but this will not make any difference in the current exercise given the inability to separate treated water the imposed high water price or not capturing non market benefits during the optimisation last our modelling approach considers water availability at nuts2 level this approach fails to fully capture the fact that water uses costs and availability as water networks are much more local however the capri model is designed to represent whole regions instead single farms or fields hence there is a distribution of cost functions in the regions that are embedded in a single function and a regional water price of 0 5 m3 should be interpreted as an average price despite the costs are not uniform in reality therefore even though an increase in irrigated area of 1 ha at an average price of 0 5 m3 looks unrealistic the predicted area also cover the part of the distribution where farmers irrigate at much lower costs the assumptions on the positive mathematical programming pmp terms of the quadratic cost function to allow smooth substitution between rain fed and irrigated crop variants also drives to some extent the model response meaning it implies that when simulating high water prices the model may show small irrigated areas in regions where irrigation is not expected at all therefore our results may partly overestimate the potential in spite of the small use of reused water even when the cost estimates from pistocchi et al 2017 take into account the deployed of the water from the waste treatment plant to the field including all costs of infrastructure treatment and pumping 6 conclusion in this paper we use an agro economic model to see the uptake of the theoretical availability of treated water for irrigation our results show that considering the cost associated with making available treated water to farmers the use of this water source is limited despite the caveats discussed above as well as the non conventional way of calculating the water stress we believe that our results are realistic in this first attempt to model treated water in an agricultural economic model the results help policy makers and stakeholders to obtain a better understanding of the role water reuse may have as a future adaptation measure for water scarcity and climate change together with the recently adopted regulation on minimum quality requirements and the risk management of using treated water feasible policy measures can be proposed that can complement the environmental objectives of the cap nevertheless in order to promote the sustainable management of water resources and the full potential of treated water is to be exploited financial support is required in the form of subsidies to cover the treated water price that reflects the treatment transport storage and investment cost according to the european council 2020b p 7 ʻfinancial incentives for practicing water reuse in agriculture have been identified as being among the reasons for the low uptake of water reuse in the unionʼ however the one size fits all approach via a flat rate water price is not desirable from our results it becomes apparent that a flat rate of 0 5 m3 can only lead to a full absorption of the supplied treated water resource by farmers in a limited number of member states thus a preferable option for agricultural irrigation would be a ʻfit for purposeʼ approach i e an approach that will maximise the potential of reused water to address water scarcity and able to provide a higher volume of treated wastewater at lower cost the impact assessment analysis by the european commission 2018b also concluded that this is a preferred option this ʻfit for purposeʼ approach is very relevant in the long term despite the positive climate change effects on water resources in central and northern europe drought events are present and may become more persistent in time thus water reuse will become more important however when these become recurrent and affect the availability of freshwater stored in reservoirs the farming sector will possibly be even more dependent on alternative water resources our results also inform and support the need for consistency between the two existing water policies the water framework directive and the urban waste water treatment directive these policies identify and encourage the reuse of treated water but specific conditions are not present european commission 2018a ensuring coherent conditions within the existing eu legislative frameworks on water will ensure the applicable levels of environmental protection and food security are maintained however these conditions should also be in line with the ʻfit for purposeʼ approach however given the transboundary issue of the river basin aspect in the wfd proposing different rates in different ms should also be carefully defined and chosen finally the results may also be relevant and linked in the future to other technological alternatives such as a ʻseawater greenhouseʼ based on thermally evaporating seawater or water from desalination based on photovoltaic energy and reverse osmosis separating freshwater and alternative irrigation water sources to see how the alternatives displace or do not displace the current water available for irrigation or allow the expansion of irrigation to previously rain fed areas is something that we would like work on and investigate in the future funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the
